1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,880
Three,
two,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,980
one,
yes.

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:07,230
Dan Carlin.
Where ally,

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,660
what's up buddy?
I kick you again.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,160
Always a pleasure.
Bye.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,880
Ooh,
all the time.

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,910
You to me are like this guy that's 
working on this never ending project 

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,740
that occasionally you release these 
chunks of these never ending projects,

9
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,070
but I look at your podcast has this 
great work,

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
this long.
Never ending like dramatic 

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,530
interpretation of history.
That's so exciting and interesting.

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,580
But when you were talking before the 
podcast about podcasting,

13
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,300
but I don't think of what you do as 
anything remotely like what I do.

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,880
Like he was like,
you do so many podcasts in my cabinet.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,520
There's nothing to it.
You start it,

16
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:49,521
you start talking and that's it.
You have like preparation and research 

17
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:55,131
and you know when you're doing hardcore 
history that's like a great work.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,140
Like you're doing like this thing that's
evergreen,

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,141
that's going to be passed down forever 
and bit torrent did the fuck out of 

20
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:03,170
Danieli.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,070
Bolelli had a great line to me cause you
know,

22
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:08,190
he does a history podcast now too and he
started off by doing just a,

23
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,440
a talk.
One of my common sense kind of his,

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,750
and he said the difference with the 
history one is you actually have to,

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,720
it has to make,
it has to make sense when you're done.

26
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,120
I mean the banks,
so that's a huge.

27
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,270
I mean I sit there like forever and I 
ended up in my,

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,310
my wife's never heard it by the way I,
my kids don't understand why anybody 

29
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,850
would want to hear me talk and you know,
so,

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
so,
but when I come out of the studio and 

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,280
you know,
like sweat pouring off me and I'm trying

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,040
to,
and then we'll look at it and it doesn't

33
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,140
mean you're listening,
you'll hear a mistake and you'll have to

34
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,470
repair the mistake and you know,
when you're just doing a,

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,770
when I'm talking on the political 
podcast and we make a mistake,

36
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,040
I'll say afterwards on twitter,
all I got that wrong on the history one,

37
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:49,041
like you said,
it's forever and so you really have to 

38
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,500
dot your i's and cross your t's and all 
that kind of stuff.

39
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,110
It makes it a lot harder.
Yeah.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,150
When you do in common sense,
you're essentially just sort of ranting 

41
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,520
about your thoughts on what's going on 
and that's a pretty good description.

42
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

43
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,470
When you do those and you release them 
and you find out you made an error,

44
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,150
that is a fucking pain in the ass,
right?

45
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,270
I,
I,

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,190
I,
I,

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,210
I recently blamed one on concussions or 
brain damage or something like that.

48
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,040
So yeah,
in reference to Hillary Clinton.

49
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,590
No,
I know.

50
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,160
I said,
uh,

51
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,490
I was talking about that stuff they 
throw out of airplanes to jam radars and

52
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,330
I called it flash and of course it's 
chaff and all of course 10,000

53
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,290
military people go,
you know,

54
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:22,980
it's chaffed.
And I go,

55
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,600
of course I know the chaff.
I wouldn't have brought it up.

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,660
It's brain damage.
Don't make fun of people who are 

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,660
injured,
you know.

58
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,660
So,
but on the history show,

59
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,180
you have to go,
okay,

60
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,950
I gotta go recut that.
Refixed it.

61
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,320
I do a lot more editing than I used to.
Yeah.

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,220
That's,
um,

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,510
yeah,
it's,

64
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,260
you're,
you're,

65
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:41,610
like I said like you have a podcast,
but then you also have this thing,

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,770
the heart cast are killing me by the 
way.

67
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,670
I'm going to at some point I'm going to 
have to just do like one podcast a year,

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,600
you know,
I just,

69
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,650
I am the slowest podcaster in the world.
I have one claim to fame number one in 

70
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,890
time it takes to get a new show out.
It's not the same.

71
00:02:55,891 --> 00:03:00,891
See,
that's the problem with calling your 

72
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:00,891
thing a podcast.
It's an audio show.

73
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,920
It is at this point.
It evolved into that unintentionally.

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,940
But you have a podcast too.
I do getting longer,

75
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,470
longer between Joseph.
Well,

76
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,320
it's got to be like when I listened to 
some of your podcasts,

77
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,440
like the one on Martin Luther and what 
was the name of that one?

78
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,450
The prophets had to do them.
Yeah,

79
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,380
that one you're like,
I learned about lutherism from you.

80
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,060
Like I didn't,
I didn't know the history.

81
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:22,780
Right Joe?
Let's.

82
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
But I think that's happening with a lot 
of people that are like learning about 

83
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,740
certain aspects of,
of history from,

84
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,180
from you and from,
from your stuff.

85
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,181
So a lot of responsibility if billy.
So it makes sense that you're spending 

86
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:38,230
as much time on them is what I think 
what happens is.

87
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,231
I think originally if you recall that 
the shows if you go listen to the old 

88
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:47,101
shows,
they don't sound like the newer ones is 

89
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,291
because I thought I was just going to 
talk about funky stuff in history and 

90
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,110
then people wrote and go,
I don't really know the story.

91
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:55,111
Can you tell more of the story?
And so you inadvertently start telling 

92
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:55,111
the story and then you go,
wait,

93
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm not qualified to tell the story.

94
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,670
And so it just.
Yeah,

95
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,340
it's,
it's,

96
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,670
it's an interesting.
It's an interesting.

97
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,830
The way it's evolved and it's also 
interesting.

98
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,060
I was,
you know,

99
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,010
I warn people when they go and buy the 
old shows,

100
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:06,340
I said,
you know,

101
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,880
the old shows aren't going to sound 
quite the same because they were good by

102
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,150
2007 podcasting standards.
But the standards of what we all do are 

103
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,890
so much higher than when we started 
doing them.

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,540
You know,
if you grade this on a curve,

105
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,720
go to itunes and look at the stuff 
that's up there with you and compare it 

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
to the stuff that was up there 10 years 
ago.

107
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,450
I was competing with kids in dorm rooms 
10 years ago.

108
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,080
Now we're competing with NPR and I mean 
all the pro outfits.

109
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,020
Yeah,
it is the sound quality for sure.

110
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,140
But also like podcast,
you get better at doing it,

111
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,490
you know,
you get better at the flow of the 

112
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:43,490
conversation.

113
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,770
You get better at like being in tune 
with the person that you're talking to 

114
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,161
or at least attempting to like that.
That's something for people that are 

115
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:54,451
listening.
When you try to consider like how a 

116
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,611
podcast is made,
one of the things that we're doing is 

117
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,431
we're trying to express ourselves,
but we're also trying to monitor 

118
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:02,461
ourselves at the same time.
Make sure you're not too overbearing or 

119
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:06,481
you're not talking too much.
Or sometimes you have a point and you 

120
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:06,481
just,
Oh my God,

121
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:06,481
I gotTa make this point.
But the other person's talking,

122
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:11,461
you don't know when to jump in,
but you also have to listen to the 

123
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:11,461
person who's talking.
So then you forget your point and you're

124
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:11,890
like,
fuck,

125
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,440
you know,
it's,

126
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:15,580
it's a weird juggling act because we're 
both doing it.

127
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,520
Sort of free balling.
We're both ad libbing,

128
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,300
doing it live.

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,370
You know what's happening to me now.
I'm ashamed to say it,

130
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,950
but I was starting to get that,
that thing.

131
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,410
I'm 59,
I turned and I'm starting to get that.

132
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,120
You forget the name or you forget,
you know,

133
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,150
I compare it to a computer.
I have more stuff in my computer,

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,310
but the computer is slower than it used 
to be.

135
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,520
And so I'll have this point where I'll 
be talking and everything will be going 

136
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,010
good and then all of a sudden there'll 
be this really long pause.

137
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,810
What I can't think of what,
that's where we have to just,

138
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,880
you know,
if there is a bed and he has to cut out 

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,290
and just eat a sandwich.
The two pieces together.

140
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:52,291
While I tried to remember the name of 
the person I wanted to say or so I'm 

141
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,981
getting to the point now where I'm not 
sure I could go live anymore without 

142
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,801
these really long pauses where I forget 
what I was going to say or I forget the 

143
00:05:58,801 --> 00:05:59,660
point I was making or the tangent I was 
on,

144
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:04,661
so 10 years from now,
this is going to be very interesting 

145
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:04,661
podcast.

146
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:05,720
It's also deals with the amount of hard 
drive space you have.

147
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,750
I think if you told her remembering 
things like there's things that I used 

148
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,991
to know so well just 10,
15 years ago that I just have pushed 

149
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,340
aside because I haven't brought it up in
a long time.

150
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,300
I haven't gone into that folder in my 
mind in the tabs now.

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Yeah,
and if I went to try to pull it out now 

152
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480
it's like,
no,

153
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480
no,
no,

154
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,940
we're,
we're our space on the warehouse floor 

155
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,310
is filled bro.
There's no room for that.

156
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,860
And the bus isn't what it used to be 
asked.

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,880
The Bas speed is not what it used to be,
but I try to crank that up with this 

158
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,150
stuff.
I'm so much healthier than I am.

159
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,040
Well,
this is coffee.

160
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,850
This is not how.
I mean it's kind of healthy,

161
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,920
but it's really just speed.

162
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,760
Where I come from.
Coffee is health food.

163
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,680
What?
Oregon?

164
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,090
Oregon healthiest.
Fuck.

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Yeah.
Well there's a couple of people that 

166
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,250
aren't so healthy in Oregon just in that
I'm leading the charge.

167
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,400
Do you like living up there in the 
Pacific northwest?

168
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,920
You know,
I'm from here and,

169
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:01,921
and,
and coming back home is weird because I 

170
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,851
told my,
my wife recently see my kids are 

171
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:03,890
Oregonians and I haven't gotten used to 
that fact.

172
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
It just seems weird to me and I told her
I still feel like this Angeleno up in 

173
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,740
Oregon,
but I've been there 20 years.

174
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,060
I don't know.
When you start feeling,

175
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,670
I mean you're from the east coast to 
research.

176
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Do you feel like you're an Angeleno or 
do you still think of yourself as a 

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,011
transplant?
I've been here for 22 years as long as 

178
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:21,350
I've been in Oregon,
so I've been here forever.

179
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,590
So you feel like this is home.
I've lived here more than I've lived 

180
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:26,860
anywhere in my life.
When you go home with home,

181
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,560
when you go back to where you were from,
does it feel like coming home or does it

182
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,360
feel foreign?
It feels weird.

183
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm used to make me insecure,
like I used to go a look where my high 

184
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,581
school was and I would.
It would bring back the feelings of 

185
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:42,650
being in high school again.
When I was.

186
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,680
When I graduated from high school,
I would have nightmares that I didn't 

187
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,340
graduate and I'd have to go back.
That's pretty classic.

188
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,890
The algebra class I forgot that you 
didn't drop or whatever.

189
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,430
Yeah.
And yeah,

190
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,470
I felt like I had to go back like,
oh no,

191
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,650
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna fucking have to drop out or 

192
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,440
I'm going to have to go back to school 
at the dread of the.

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,810
And it wasn't like the school was so 
horrible.

194
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,050
It was really like the uncertainty of 
the future and life and the insecurity 

195
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,420
and the,
just the,

196
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,620
the angst that teen angst of,
you know,

197
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
slowly realizing that we're not even 
slowly realizing but becoming an adult 

198
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,730
and knowing that it's just a few years 
away that I'm going to be completely 

199
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,970
responsible for myself,
but I'm completely lost,

200
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,240
you know,
so there's is unbelievable pressure that

201
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,960
comes with going from being a teenager 
to a time.

202
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,260
It's really mean to say unbelievable is 
nothing to compare to be like growing up

203
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,880
a kid in Laos,
you know,

204
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,970
or you're living in fucking Somalia in 
the middle of,

205
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,040
you know,
all sorts of different crisis that are 

206
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,461
going on.
So it's really like the most privileged 

207
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:45,461
angst possible.
Home.

208
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,720
Reasonably the same when you go back to 
the sea,

209
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,060
because I come back here,
I told my mom I was reading this.

210
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:54,020
I'm reading this book written by a,
if you remember,

211
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:54,490
uh,
uh,

212
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,190
William Buckley,
the famous,

213
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,660
you know,
talk,

214
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,950
talk to his son,
wrote a book about,

215
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,560
you know,
his dad getting old and getting ready to

216
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:06,561
pass away and whatever.
And at one point his dad who was in 

217
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:06,561
Florida said he wanted to go home to 
die,

218
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:11,481
which I guess was Connecticut and he 
said dying in Florida was like contrary 

219
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,660
to nature.
So we wanted to go home where everything

220
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:13,950
was the same.
And I thought to myself,

221
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,280
if I went home to die home is anything 
like home was I drive to the places I'm 

222
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,190
from and it doesn't even know it doesn't
ring a bell anymore.

223
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,020
The place,
if I wanted to go home to die,

224
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,900
I'd have to have a time machine,
you know,

225
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,100
because everything is so different to if
every fifth,

226
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,040
for those who don't know Los Angeles,
like every 15 years,

227
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,220
bulldozes itself and rebuilds itself.
And so I'm like three generations of La 

228
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,020
bulldozing from where my time was.

229
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,780
And so I go up and down these streets.
It looks like a foreign city to me.

230
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:47,781
Now also,
the mass exodus of people is never 

231
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:47,781
subsided.
A lot of them are in Oregon now.

232
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:52,280
Just so you don't mean we've got better 
restaurants in better theater and 

233
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,280
everything because of all the 
California's that go.

234
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,330
Yeah.
But when I first moved up there,

235
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,930
if you had a California license plate 
that was like an invitation to have your

236
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,750
car get keyed.
Yeah.

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Oh,
the California's were not popular in 

238
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Colorado either.
When I went to school there,

239
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:04,760
California Californians were not 
popular.

240
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,980
Now I think probably x Californians are 
like the majority.

241
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,120
Yeah.
That's the case with boulder.

242
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:15,121
I remember when I was living in Boulder,
they said that a lot of people moved up 

243
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:15,121
right after the earthquake.
I lived in boulder to four years.

244
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:15,850
Yeah.
I went to school there.

245
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:18,970
People will like check please soon as 
the ground starts shaking boulder,

246
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,790
um,
seven years ago,

247
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,820
seven years ago.
So there before the podcast for the 

248
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:26,820
podcast started.
Did you like it?

249
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,410
I was only there for a few months.
I was there for four months.

250
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,900
We planned on living there for a year 
then maybe permanently.

251
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,130
But along the way my wife got pregnant 
and we were at 8,500

252
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:38,060
feet above sea level.
That's right.

253
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,910
Yeah.
And it was just brutal.

254
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,390
They say that Colorado in general,
like around the Denver area has a very 

255
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,441
high rate of premature births.
And low birth weight because of the lack

256
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,520
of oxygen I would never have thought.

257
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,550
I would've thought you'd have your kid 
born with like superhuman lungs be like 

258
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,461
one of those Sherpas in Tibet.
Well I think if you live there and you 

259
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,360
grow up there,
probably like if you live there and grow

260
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:06,361
up there.
Like I was talking to an endurance 

261
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,461
runner that lives there and he said it 
takes three years for the body to 

262
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,700
completely acclimate where you get all 
the benefits of training up there.

263
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,510
But I have all the Olympic guys.
You do the bicycling and everything up 

264
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:15,510
there too,
just because of the altitude.

265
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:15,510
Well,
yeah,

266
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,341
that's a big thing with any sort of 
athletic competition training that 

267
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,420
involves endurance training at altitude.
It makes a big difference,

268
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,310
but I think if you lived there your 
whole life,

269
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,770
your body's accustomed to it,
you're adapted to it.

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,200
It's probably fine for your kids because
obviously a lot of people who have kids 

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,311
in Colorado,
but I think that if you were from sea 

272
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,400
level like here and then you go there,
it's quite a shock to your system.

273
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,380
Like you tried to go up a flight of 
stairs and you're like,

274
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,360
Whoa,
I'm Kinda remind you.

275
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,940
Doesn't mean for sure if you were at 80 
something.

276
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,440
I mean that's,
that's tired and boulder.

277
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,450
You must've been out in the mountains.
Yeah,

278
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:47,460
we're in the mountains.
It,

279
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,700
yeah,
85,

280
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,200
8,500
feet above sea level.

281
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,480
It's a.
But when you work out there,

282
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,640
man,
it's,

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,090
it's,
it's crazy.

284
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,020
The,
the,

285
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,230
the impact.
Like if you're just standing around 

286
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,230
talking,
it seems normal.

287
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,580
Like if you and I were having this 
conversation up there,

288
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:06,581
it wouldn't be any different,
but if you had to walk up a flight of 

289
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:06,581
stairs or climb a ladder or something 
like that,

290
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:06,990
all of a sudden you're like,
Jesus Christ.

291
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,890
I age 30 fucking years in 10 minutes.
But anyway,

292
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,980
going back to my high school,
when I go to my neighborhood where I 

293
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,281
grew up in,
it looks pretty much the same so it 

294
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:20,470
hasn't really blown up.

295
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,510
But I grew up in Newton,
upper falls,

296
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,430
Massachusetts,
which is a small,

297
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,020
like a suburb of Boston.
So it's a small place.

298
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,180
It's always been small lets you go back 
there.

299
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:36,181
It's kind of similar.
Like I went back to the house where I 

300
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,510
grew up like about a year and a half ago
and it's pretty much the same.

301
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,630
Wow.
I'm jealous because I go to these 

302
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,191
websites that say you know,
the San Fernando Valley in the 19 

303
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,940
seventies and look at pictures and it's 
nothing like it looks now you have to go

304
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,860
to Jerry's Deli and look at those old 
pictures.

305
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,970
They have to.
I have books actually had.

306
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:51,130
And this is funny,
as I get older,

307
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,170
I'd ever cared about La history when I 
lived here,

308
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,060
but now that I'm getting nostalgic and 
stuff,

309
00:12:55,061 --> 00:13:00,061
I buy all these old books with pictures 
of Magic Mountain when I was a kid in 

310
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,400
Disneyland when I was a kid.

311
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,400
And all those kinds of things.
What's fascinating because this area 

312
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,400
used to be ranches.
Oh yeah.

313
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,150
Oh.
And horse country and having.

314
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Absolutely.
Well I took my wife back to my high 

315
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,220
school recently and you know,
my high school's turned into like,

316
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,910
you know the Beverly Hills high school 
is when it's like.

317
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:13,840
And so she looks at me,
she goes,

318
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,100
oh,
I see how you were raised,

319
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,790
honey.
No,

320
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,920
it's melt like manure.
It was all dirt roads.

321
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,750
It was really.
It wasn't like that for me.

322
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:22,150
So she doesn't believe me.
Yeah.

323
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,030
The pictures at Jerry's Deli on Ventura 
up here,

324
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,210
they have these pictures from the early 
19 hundreds of these big giant high 

325
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,070
resolution photos and it's like wow,
fields and stuff.

326
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,230
Rolling Hills.
You could look at an a timelapse just 

327
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,230
watch it all,
watch it all build.

328
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,650
You'd be like,
Whoa,

329
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,660
what the.
My Mom's got this view of the entire 

330
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,661
valley and you look at it and it's full 
and you see those pictures from Jerry's 

331
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:47,200
Deli and it's empty and it basically,
whatever it is,

332
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,670
70 years or something.

333
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,320
It's full.
Yeah.

334
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,430
Well,
the whole country,

335
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,860
if you really stop and think about,
I've been talking to people about that a

336
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,150
lot lately because we've been sort of 
discussing how bizarre this,

337
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:03,151
uh,
election has been and how recent this 

338
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,631
country has existed.
How recent is recently this country was 

339
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:06,631
established.
I mean,

340
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:11,431
when you think about 17,
76 and you think about the rest of the 

341
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:12,880
world,
like this is an insanely new country.

342
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,780
Oh,
in the west.

343
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,640
My,
my wife's grandfather died recently.

344
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:21,641
He was 94 and I said,
do you realize that two of your 

345
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,931
grandfather's lifespans and there is no 
non natives here on the west coast.

346
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,800
That's too long.
Lifetime.

347
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,750
Yeah.
It's bizarre.

348
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,870
It's really interesting when you think 
about it that way.

349
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,110
How quick this gigantic thing it took 
over the world.

350
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:38,800
Essentially.
I should correct the.

351
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:39,370
See,
I already heard it.

352
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:44,371
Hardcore history error in that comment I
should say in the Pacific northwest 

353
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:44,371
because they'll say,
oh no,

354
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:44,800
Dan,
they were Spanish missions.

355
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,560
And see that's how you get in trouble.
Okay.

356
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,280
We go three generations.
Three generations now.

357
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,980
The Spanish were here a long time ago,

358
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,660
but,
but up in the Pacific northwest,

359
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,680
he wasn't like that.
There were,

360
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,850
you know,
because it's funny,

361
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,851
you can tell where the tide of,
of Spanish conquest sort of broke 

362
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:01,200
because you,
you,

363
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,220
you stop getting those Hispanic names 
for all the communities and all of a 

364
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,890
sudden you're like,
what happened to Lahabra?

365
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:11,891
What happened to all those wonderful 
Spanish names and you're no longer in 

366
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:15,011
that.
Now you're in Russia actually owned a 

367
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:15,011
little bit of that territory once upon a
time,

368
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:17,600
but now you're,
everything's a native American name or,

369
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,810
or some name from some really early 
settler or pioneer or something like 

370
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,201
that.
We were talking about how recently 

371
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,201
slavery existed in this country.
Oh my God,

372
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,450
yes.
18,

373
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,550
65.
And you think about 18,

374
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:32,540
65 to 2016 is nothing.
Well,

375
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,080
and then let's remember that.
You know,

376
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:39,081
you still had the Jim crow laws and 
segregation up until you and I were 

377
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:39,081
kids.

378
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:43,180
My mom did a film in Florida in 1972 and
I'm not talking about the apologies to 

379
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,700
floridians out there,
but the civilized part of Florida,

380
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,120
we were in the swamp.
It was a place called Weeki wachee if 

381
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,720
you've ever been there.
The big draw is they have a live mermaid

382
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,650
show that they try to get you to slow 
down for enough to eat at the local cafe

383
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,080
or whatever.
And so we're in Weeki wachee Florida.

384
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:05,081
We took a picture when we left and the 
whole hotel staff was out there and it 

385
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:08,000
looks like something out of a time more 
because you realize you're like three or

386
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,360
five years of segregation has been gone 
that long.

387
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:16,361
I mean that's how recent this is.
Although I realized the more I talk to 

388
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:19,511
young people,
even being 50 sounds like a long time 

389
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:19,511
ago,
but when you and I were kids,

390
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,580
that was the tail end of the time when 
if you were a black person in certain 

391
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,850
states in this country,
you couldn't stay in a bunch of hotels.

392
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,840
I mean,
that's,

393
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,150
that's,
that's really recent.

394
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,440
Yeah,
that's really recent.

395
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,470
Um,
I had this cop on my from Baltimore,

396
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,770
Michael Wood,
and he was telling me about the laws 

397
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,860
that they had in Baltimore,
that they had a systematic,

398
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,220
they really had racism that was so a 
part of the city that you couldn't sell 

399
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:52,271
houses in certain areas to Bach people.
Frank Robinson tells a story about being

400
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,390
with the Baltimore Orioles and he says 
he got traded from the Cincinnati reds,

401
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,440
the Baltimore Orioles,
and his wife was able to find a house 

402
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,671
really quickly until they realized it 
wasn't Brooks Robinson's wife who's a 

403
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,060
white guy.
It was Frank Robinson's wife.

404
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,950
And then all of a sudden the house 
disappeared right off,

405
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,300
you know,
two seconds later.

406
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:10,300
So,
but that's almost a,

407
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,340
you know,
you don't know what to say about that 

408
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,340
because there's two kinds of racism.
There's the kind where the government is

409
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,560
involved in the states involved,
like you said,

410
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,480
system institutionalized.

411
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,840
And then there's,
I'm a white home buyer whose neighbors,

412
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:25,841
you know,
I remember there was an all in the 

413
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:27,621
family episode where Archie bunker or 
one of the neighbors was going to sell 

414
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:30,560
to a black family.
And all the other white neighbors 

415
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,861
freaked out.
So I mean that's not really like 

416
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,751
government racism.
That's like good old fashioned one to 

417
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:34,751
one racism,
you know?

418
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:38,290
Well they used to do this thing called 
blockbusting and it happened with my 

419
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,540
grandfather.
My grandfather lived in Newark,

420
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,920
New Jersey.
And these realtors would go door to door

421
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,921
and literally tell the homeowners,
black people are moving into the 

422
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,071
neighborhood.
You have to sell your home and the 

423
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:51,071
property values are going crash.
People

424
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:51,780
just.
They just started selling like crazy.

425
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:54,150
My grandfather stayed.
My grandfather was like,

426
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,890
I like black people,
get the fuck off my lawn.

427
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,720
He was one of those guys.
So they,

428
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,020
they left in the neighborhood changed.
First it became black,

429
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,260
then it became Puerto Rican.
And then before my grandfather died it 

430
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,100
had been like a weird mixture of 
ethnicities,

431
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:13,890
Dominicans and different people from 
different environments.

432
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:18,120
But it was a really fascinating place to
live because there was extreme,

433
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,200
there was poverty and then there was a 
lot of crime and stuff.

434
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,700
Like the next door neighbor when my 
grandfather lived there is a kid who was

435
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,970
selling crack and they battering rammed 
his front door.

436
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,670
He had it all reinforced everything.
Had An audi in the driveway,

437
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,760
like the whole deal.
He was just selling drugs and they,

438
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,040
you know,
broke down as doorway and arrested.

439
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,690
I've never thought it was a pretty 
dramatic moment,

440
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:43,680
but the rest of it was like when you 
look at like a bad neighborhood,

441
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,500
it's not like you go down the street and
it's like a war zone.

442
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,620
Guns are going off and people getting 
stabbed for the most part.

443
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,770
It's pretty friendly and lively.
It's just when you're dealing with poor 

444
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,610
people in a crime ridden neighborhood,
you know,

445
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,640
it's just gonna happen more often than 
it's going to happen in a place that's 

446
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:01,980
really nice.
But most of the time when you go outside

447
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,180
it would be people playing music and 
there was kids playing in the street and

448
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,920
it was people hanging out in their 
steps.

449
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,890
It was really interesting to watch like 
his,

450
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,940
you know,
from the time I was a little kid 

451
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:15,940
remembering his name,
you know,

452
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,271
his neighborhood to what it was before 
he died and it had just kept shifting 

453
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:21,660
over and over again.
We're new,

454
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,870
new,
sort of a lower income,

455
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,960
disenfranchised groups would move into 
the area.

456
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,600
And you know,
this I'm sure already,

457
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:34,601
but for the listeners state,
there's a whole theory on how if you 

458
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:34,850
look at boxing,
you can see,

459
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,280
you know,
who the wave of immigrants most recent 

460
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,330
was because boxing became a way for 
people to get out of the ghetto.

461
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,920
And so if you look at,
say,

462
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,490
early 19 hundreds up into the middle,
19 twenties and thirties,

463
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:51,491
there were a lot of Jewish boxers 
because their parents had come over on 

464
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,720
the boat and they were first generation 
Italian boxers during the same period.

465
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,220
Irish boxers.
Uh,

466
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,290
and then you move to areas where,
I mean poor African Americans have 

467
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:00,620
always been in boxing for.
Because for the same reason,

468
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,030
Hispanic boxers,
I mean,

469
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I saw a whole article once on America's 
immigration story as told through 

470
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:12,431
boxing.
And they would suggest that by the time 

471
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:15,370
the next generation came along,
most of the time the parents had done 

472
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:15,370
well enough so that,
you know,

473
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,280
the kids didn't have to go into boxing,
but.

474
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,260
But it was an interesting story that,
you know,

475
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,450
I think it was,
I think the article was entitled 

476
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,451
something like,
why don't you see any great Jewish 

477
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,191
boxers anymore?
And it went down the whole list and I 

478
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:27,191
didn't know there were Jewish boxers 
when I first.

479
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:27,800
Oh,
Benny Leonard.

480
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,440
There a lot of Jewish maxie Rosenbloom.
A lot of them.

481
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,180
Yeah.
There was a,

482
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,950
there was a ton of them,
the early days.

483
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:37,951
But it's always that.
It's always the immigrants first 

484
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:37,951
generation people,
right?

485
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,370
Yeah.
Well we've seen a lot now is Russians.

486
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,890
Same.
Same system though,

487
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,460
right?
You have,

488
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,490
you have newcomers who are trying to 
make their way into the system and 

489
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:46,490
boxing is the best thing they bring to 
the table.

490
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah.
It's also that you,

491
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,400
growing

492
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,400
up in these really hard environments 
were fisticuffs are much more common and

493
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
people seek to train themselves to learn
how to fight because they're dealing 

494
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,830
with conflict all the time.
Absolutely right.

495
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:01,720
Whereas a lot of the kids in class,
you see,

496
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,380
you know,
America,

497
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,490
no bullying,
you know,

498
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:08,491
hey,
diversity and these kids are growing up 

499
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:08,491
and they,
you know,

500
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:11,490
they just no desire for the average 
middle class white kid to go into 

501
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,450
boxing.
It's just no desire.

502
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Those of us who've tried it,
I tried it once just for the fun of it 

503
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,420
and that was enough to kick me out of 
the.

504
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:24,421
I didn't,
didn't look so fun anymore after I came 

505
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:24,421
home with a black eye and I thought 
that's just one day at practice.

506
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:29,160
You know,
these people who do it for a living 

507
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,160
that's everyday,
but you only try.

508
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,160
You try it for one day.

509
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Oh,
well,

510
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,020
you know,
I was like,

511
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,340
this is crazy to say now.
I've always been a huge fan of boxing 

512
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,831
because I grew up in an era where it was
one of the great errors in boxing 

513
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,160
history and so you know,
you think long enough that you want to,

514
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,680
you want to see what it's like,
and I had a buddy that I worked with,

515
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,040
he was the one who showed up with the 
black guy after the weekend was over and

516
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,780
he said,
I'll take him,

517
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,790
we'll fool around.
The first thing I learned that I didn't 

518
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,370
know is how much some of these guys just
love it because you think who would like

519
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:56,371
getting hit?
And I met one of these guys and he was 

520
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:56,371
like,
you don't understand the sport,

521
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:56,920
you just don't understand it,
but season he's put some gloves on.

522
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:57,700
We'll go in there.

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Well that's when you learn,
you know,

524
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,330
especially I have a soft face.
That's,

525
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,630
that guy's an asshole.
That's not how you're supposed to teach 

526
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,031
somebody about boxing.
You're not supposed to even think about 

527
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:09,031
sparring for a long time.
Paul,

528
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,670
I think he was going to show me a lesson
and these gonna Cheat on you.

529
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,490
That's right.
Yeah.

530
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,990
I had a buddy of mine do the same thing,
assholes.

531
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,450
They know how to quite already and they 
put gloves on.

532
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,760
You beat the shit out of you.
He was waiting with one punch,

533
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:23,761
Joe,
let's not make it more one that I 

534
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:23,761
learned my lesson pretty fast.
I'm a smart guy.

535
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,830
Joe took one punch and you're like,
okay,

536
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,150
got through my defense with the first 
one and that was it.

537
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,980
Well,
you need to learn stuff.

538
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,040
This is like boxing the way.
It really should be taught to someone.

539
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,040
If you really want someone to learn,
you should teach them the proper 

540
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,621
fundamentals on how to move their body 
and then you slowly teach them how to 

541
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:44,761
slowly hit things.
How about protective head gear for the 

542
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:44,761
new guy?
What about that?

543
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,050
That protective headgear does less than 
you think.

544
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,870
I know I've read that actually there 
also,

545
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,620
they're also removing it from Olympic 
competition.

546
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,880
Now you ever see that?
You know,

547
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I had mentioned to my wife,
didn't they used to have boxing in the 

548
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Olympics?
Do they even just show it anymore?

549
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,010
Did they show it because I didn't see 
it?

550
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,390
You don't see it as much.
I was so big when I was a kid.

551
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,510
I wonder what they decide to put on and 
how they decide.

552
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,100
It's got to be based on ratings.
Right?

553
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,130
Because like archery,
you see archery for like 30 seconds.

554
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,720
Look,
the Arrow flew through the air next.

555
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,000
You know,
and then gymnastics is always a big one.

556
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:18,001
People have watched people flip.
I told my wife there was this 

557
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:18,600
competition called a biathlon will you 
ski and shoot?

558
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:19,960
And she said,
you're making that up.

559
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,650
I said,
no,

560
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,770
it's really an Olympic sport.
It is a weird sport.

561
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:28,771
Right.
What a strange combination with those 

562
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:28,771
scandinavians just kick everybody's rear
end.

563
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,010
Yeah,
because they're all out there skiing and

564
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,570
shooting.
Exactly right.

565
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,760
It's rude.
It's a lot of moose in that area.

566
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,150
That's a strange.
The Olympics are strange in what is a 

567
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,901
metal and what is not like.
Ballroom dancing is an Olympic 

568
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,680
synchronized swimming.
That's an Olympics.

569
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,710
I'm not denigrating anybody.
If you're a professional synchronized 

570
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:49,710
swimmer,
I am.

571
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:49,710
I'll take the blame.
That's.

572
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,700
Please do a lot like curling.
Ever seen that one?

573
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,250
Yeah.
That's another one.

574
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,410
I always thought that was what they did 
on like cruises for old people,

575
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,240
but apparently it's a little bit 
shuffleboard.

576
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,610
It's very close.
There's no brooms involved in.

577
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:05,480
Shuffled.
Does no brooms and know what's curling.

578
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,460
You're trying to drink the other guy out
of the way.

579
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,600
Right.
Trying to knock your.

580
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,120
It's very complicated.
I never quite mastered the.

581
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,690
I was in Newfoundland.
I know how to say it now because people 

582
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:16,690
got mad at me because I said,
oh,

583
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,200
we're calling new found blend that gets 
its newfoundland.

584
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,550
They're probably correct.
Correct me again.

585
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,410
I'm probably fucking it up again.
I'm not even going to try,

586
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,530
but I was making fun of curling and they
went crazy.

587
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,730
They were so upset at me.
I was like,

588
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:30,731
come on folks.
Those are not people to get get mad at 

589
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:30,731
you either.
They're hardy.

590
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,590
Say it's very cold.
Yeah.

591
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,700
Different kinds of different kind of 
life,

592
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,080
but what I don't know what.
What do they do to decide like what goes

593
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:39,490
on the air?

594
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,900
It must just be based on popularity.
Right?

595
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,430
The Olympics.
I got to tell you,

596
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:48,431
if I'm the.
If I'm the network executive deciding 

597
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:48,431
what goes on the air,
that's what I'm going to base it on.

598
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:52,510
Did you see all those videos of people 
getting robbed that were just walking 

599
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:52,510
down the street and Rio?
Rio?

600
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,770
No,
but I go to a website sometimes when I'm

601
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:57,260
bored and have nothing better to do that
is just,

602
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,120
you know,
stuff that people upload,

603
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,520
you know,
just to blow your mind and say wow,

604
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,250
that and half of them are from Brazil 
for some reason,

605
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,110
you know,
and they're always terrible.

606
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:07,850
You just go.
I know it's giving me a,

607
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:12,851
um,
an unusually wrong version of what 

608
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:12,851
Brazil is light,
but when they said the Olympics,

609
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:13,130
we're going to be there.
I said,

610
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:15,380
do you know half the videos on this site
or from Rio?

611
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,760
So.
Well,

612
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,100
it's,
it does have a history of violence,

613
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:24,101
that's for sure.
It's a strange place and that's kind of 

614
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,321
the reverse of la in that La you,
you essentially have the expensive homes

615
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:31,160
in the hills and then the people that 
have the less expensive homes are on the

616
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:33,350
bottom.
But in Rio it's the opposite.

617
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,170
The people on the bottom,
like near the ocean,

618
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,520
it's the really expensive homes and up 
in the hills with this amazing views are

619
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:42,890
all the favelas.
So it's all these houses that don't have

620
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,891
any windows.
Some of them have dirt floors and 

621
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:51,160
there's like extreme extreme poverty.
I know some of these communities they 

622
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,641
can't eat.
The police can't even go into right 

623
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:54,641
somehow.
Really hardcore.

624
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:55,820
Very.
Did you ever see city of God the movie?

625
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,740
No,
but I saw the preview.

626
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:59,150
Does that count?
Does not count,

627
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,580
but it's,
it makes Boyz in the hood look like Mary

628
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:05,960
poppins and it's based on life in the 
favela is like really,

629
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,060
really based on it.

630
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Like these kinds of actual scenarios 
actually do take place where young kids 

631
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,620
with guns form gangs and you know,
you're,

632
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:17,000
you're looking at like 10 year old kids.
Doesn't.

633
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:22,001
That almost seemed to be like a law of 
nature though because you do see it 

634
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:25,211
everywhere in these.
When you go to the poor countries or 

635
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:25,211
poor parts of the US,
like you said,

636
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:29,591
uh,
you were talking about how the poor 

637
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:31,241
communities are,
are pretty much like the nicer 

638
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:31,910
communities in some ways.
I used to have to go down to compton all

639
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:36,200
the time when I worked in news down here
and Compton in the daytime.

640
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,560
It looks just fine.
People are trying to keep their lawns 

641
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,781
mowed.
They're out there working on their 

642
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:43,781
homes.
I mean everything.

643
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:46,030
It's when darkness falls that things can
get a little weird on certain street 

644
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,470
corners and,
and whatnot.

645
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,940
But you know,
I remember going down,

646
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,560
they just think,
boy,

647
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,790
everybody here is really trying,
you know,

648
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,030
I mean,
they're really keeping up their homes 

649
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,030
and trying to make everything nice.

650
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,040
And,
and at nighttime they're just victims.

651
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,150
A lot of the time,
you know,

652
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:02,151
they shut their doors and close their 
windows and try to stay out of what's 

653
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:02,910
going on outside.
It is weird that it's night,

654
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,180
like there's something happens to people
when there's not as much people that 

655
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,930
sleep all day.
I used to be one of those people once 

656
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,590
upon a time,
but compton,

657
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,230
like if you looked at a good 
neighborhood,

658
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,750
like how many people are getting by and 
how many people are fucking it up,

659
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,490
you know,
in a great neighborhood.

660
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,730
Maybe it's like 100 people are getting 
by and one guy's fucking it up.

661
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,800
You like one issue out of 100.
But in compton it might be three and 

662
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,771
that's enough.
That's enough to give the whole 

663
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:33,771
neighborhood a black guy.
You're right.

664
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:34,230
It doesn't take very many.
That's right.

665
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Yeah.
A friend of mine has a gym in Compton 

666
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,320
and I was telling we were headed there 
and I was like,

667
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,990
yeah,
it's in Compton.

668
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,510
My,
the guy I was going with like,

669
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
Jesus,
we're going to compton.

670
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,490
I was like,
it's a fucking wrong.

671
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,820
It's just a city.
It's just go there.

672
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,210
What does this compton cowboys.
I just googled compton in his story.

673
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,211
Just came up from yesterday.
What's the fuck is this the guys that 

674
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,930
ride horses through Compton?
I guess it's even legal.

675
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:59,620
I didn't know you could do that in la 
because,

676
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:04,621
uh,
like in New York they have to have a 

677
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:04,621
device that hooks up to the horse so it 
doesn't,

678
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:05,550
you know,
have manure on the streets.

679
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:10,551
How did they get around that?
There is lyrice cowboys roping and 

680
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:13,611
riding right in the heart of Compton 
have found their hobby contains some of 

681
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:16,560
the most dangerous neighborhoods.
I have a regular nine to five job,

682
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,700
but I'm a cowboy.
Hossley said good for him.

683
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm in favor of that.

684
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,250
But you're not a cowboy.
Keep the horse.

685
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,590
First of all,
there's no cows.

686
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,360
You're a horse boy.
What do you.

687
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,730
You're in a horses.
Is that a backyard horse?

688
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:30,890
I mean,
we beat that.

689
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,130
It must be.
Well,

690
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:37,131
there's some.
I mean I know that like I've seen them 

691
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:37,131
in Burbank,
Burbank.

692
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:40,290
There's sections of a,
which is where NBC is.

693
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,980
Jay Leno tonight show the sections of 
that that are at question.

694
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:49,010
So you're allowed to have a stable in 
your yard and people will just ride 

695
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,740
horses down the street.
You see it all the time.

696
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,130
They used to have a place called 
pickwick stables right outside of 

697
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,130
Burbank that was like that.
Yeah.

698
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,060
They used to have the equestrian center 
down there when I was a kid 50 years ago

699
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,290
or whenever it was.
Yeah.

700
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,350
Horse Horse riding makes you a cowboy.
You'd not accounting less cows are 

701
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,350
involved.

702
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,970
Is that the Rogan standard on that?
Just think that's a fact.

703
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,550
I just think that's the fact that your 
horsepower,

704
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,520
will you call them cowboys?
Because they would chase cow.

705
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,070
They would herd them,
you know.

706
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,870
Okay,
I'll go with you.

707
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,360
I just don't have the expertise to 
compete on that subject.

708
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,610
They have the competition policy.
What does is they have an actual ranch 

709
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:23,650
called richland farms.
I was just looking at it up,

710
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,250
try to find out like more pictures or 
what it really looks like,

711
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,840
you know,
I'll tell you.

712
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,980
Educated.
I was.

713
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,710
I didn't know they had enough open 
property out there to look at that.

714
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,760
Yeah.
Wow.

715
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,880
So they have chickens and shit.
I'm impressed and these guys are doing 

716
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,710
little things with their horses where 
they're running them through routine for

717
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:42,130
them.
Interesting.

718
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,960
Very interesting.
Yeah.

719
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:44,980
Well,
you know what man,

720
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,160
when people find open spaces and spaces 
that are vacant and they start 

721
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,331
reclaiming them and occasionally good 
things come out of that and you know 

722
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:57,511
what,
there's a lot of cities in the United 

723
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:58,410
States and in Europe and stuff that that
had built giant open spaces,

724
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,420
you know,
whether it's a central park in New York 

725
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,420
or anything like that.

726
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,270
It changes the whole feel of these urban
centers don't have to have big open 

727
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,830
pieces of territory in the midst of the 
urban sprawl.

728
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,300
I mean,
if that's what they'd done,

729
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:12,370
got more power to them.
La needs more of that.

730
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,350
I think you're right.
And it keeps it from growing.

731
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:16,900
Like one of the really smart things that
Boulder's Don's,

732
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,980
they buy up all the open space when lots
are available all around boulder.

733
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:25,981
They just buy it up,
the city buys it up and they just 

734
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:26,650
prevent people from building on it.
That's why it costs like $9,000

735
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,720
a month to have an apartment in boulder.
Yeah,

736
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,870
it's super expensive,
but you know,

737
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,070
I mean ultimately it's probably a good 
idea,

738
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,700
right?
Oh yeah.

739
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,030
Well,
from it from your own living purposes.

740
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,050
Absolutely.
So I mean that's what I want.

741
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:40,240
I look in Oregon.
I can park anywhere.

742
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,030
I tell Angelenos that near that.
Really the only people,

743
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,380
New Yorkers and Angelenos understand 
when you say I can park anywhere dude.

744
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,280
And they just go,
Oh really?

745
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah.
My Buddy Steve moved from New York.

746
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,920
He was living in Brooklyn and he moved 
to Seattle and he was like,

747
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,030
I should have been here a long time ago.
Oh totally.

748
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,870
He's like fucking traffics.
Nothing.

749
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,050
He's like,
people are complaining but they don't 

750
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,440
know like it takes 10 minutes more to 
get where you're going.

751
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,070
That's it right now.
And you know,

752
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:11,071
nowadays,
I mean in the old days if you and I 

753
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:11,071
wanted to work,
you had to live where the work was now.

754
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:13,210
I mean even the actors don't live here 
much anymore,

755
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:13,980
you know?
Yeah.

756
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Well Open space I think is a really 
smart thing because people left their 

757
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,680
own devices will really fuck up 
anything.

758
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,160
They'll just build on top of shit and 
stack things up and stuff.

759
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,810
People in there.
And next thing you know,

760
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,170
the views gone.
Everything's gone,

761
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,830
chicken ranch next to your house.
It's one of the things that this country

762
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,350
has.
It's really interesting is public land,

763
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,500
these gigantic national parks like 
yellowstone,

764
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,210
all these different places that you can 
go to.

765
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,840
Mostly in the West though,
you know,

766
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,350
that was a win,
that sage brush rebellion type thing 

767
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,350
happened up in Oregon.
You know what?

768
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,980
The one area where they're still having 
trials about and everything that the 

769
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,250
were they see 20 years ago I would have 
remembered their names right off the 

770
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,951
bat,
but there's a wilderness thing up in 

771
00:31:58,951 --> 00:31:58,951
Oregon.
We had that whole thing.

772
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,750
Well,
their complaint was that the federal 

773
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,621
government doesn't have big tracks of 
land in the eastern part of the country 

774
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,831
where things started.
They reverted that land back to the 

775
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:10,591
public,
but they had these huge swaths of land 

776
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:12,781
in the West because it was kind of a 
different government by the time they 

777
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:12,781
were out here in the west.

778
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,820
I truthfully,
I'm kinda thankful they do because if 

779
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:17,820
they didn't,
it wouldn't be here anymore.

780
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,751
I mean,
that's the way I look at it and just be 

781
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:21,751
gone.
Yeah.

782
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:23,560
Most likely that that whole land thing 
was really confusing for people.

783
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:26,580
They were trying to figure out what the 
hell is going on because if you.

784
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,650
Unless you really dive into the story 
and try to find out who's angry at who 

785
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,731
and why is the government moving in on 
these people and what's what's 

786
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:36,670
happening.
Because there was a few of these sort of

787
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,530
rancher type disputes with the 
government.

788
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,340
Remember there was one in Nevada as 
well.

789
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,320
I actually can speak to this a little 
bit because what I was a talk radio host

790
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:49,321
up there.
Those people were actually a large part 

791
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:52,081
of any talk radio show audience and they
were a little different back in the day 

792
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,040
of say the Clinton administration in the
mid 19 nineties,

793
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,020
but.
But the modern movement kind of grew out

794
00:32:56,021 --> 00:33:01,021
of that and if you understand the 
position of those people in those small 

795
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,411
towns,
those people essentially made a living 

796
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:07,951
in resource extraction so they didn't 
have the big factories that they had 

797
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:11,371
back east and Detroit and everything.
They logged or they mind or they did 

798
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:13,300
those kinds of things and so when the 
government will decide,

799
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,060
for example,
we have a problem with the spotted owl,

800
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,950
so we're going to cut back on the 
logging.

801
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,430
The people in places like Portland where
everybody's got a software job or 

802
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,430
something,
they they're like,

803
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,530
absolutely,
that's a wonderful thing,

804
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,430
but those devastated some of those 
communities and you know,

805
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:32,431
it's everything from the schools in 
those areas not getting a lot of tax 

806
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:33,130
dollars anymore or the problem they have
an Oregon.

807
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,450
There's a lot of those small 
communities.

808
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,240
All the young people are gone because 
there's no jobs.

809
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,230
So the old people who have homes stay,
there's no jobs because everybody was in

810
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:46,231
logging and they get very resentful.
So when they wanted the public land 

811
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:50,371
turned over to private people because 
they were hoping the private people 

812
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:50,740
would start off the meals again and 
people could work.

813
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,070
So in that sense,
I felt like the media really didn't 

814
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,800
really didn't look at that side of the 
story,

815
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,780
which is.
I'm not saying these people are right or

816
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:03,781
wrong,
but understand that this wasn't a 

817
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:03,781
question of the government's got to get 
off of our net.

818
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:06,700
It was jobs and I think we can all 
understand jobs.

819
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,470
Well,
what was going on in Oregon was cattle,

820
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:12,320
ranchers and public land and they 
decrease.

821
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,510
Hey,
today's.

822
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,080
Yeah.
They didn't want to pay for public land.

823
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:20,410
Now,
before I had ever ventured into public 

824
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,501
land,
I didn't understand the whole cattle 

825
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,871
grazing thing,
but when I was in the first time I was 

826
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:25,871
in Montana,
we went,

827
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,760
uh,
we took a float down the Missouri River.

828
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,120
We went down to where the Missouri 
Breaks and Montana's beautiful.

829
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,200
Oh man,
it's amazing.

830
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,840
But one of the things I was like,
there's these cows everywhere.

831
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,410
Like,
is it,

832
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:37,610
this is public land,
right?

833
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:43,060
And um,
my friend Steve had a sort of explained 

834
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,491
to me how they kind of leased the land.
They let cows graze this land and they 

835
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,040
do it at this riddick.

836
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,890
Yes.
They made a lot of these laws in the 

837
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:53,890
late 18 hundreds of safety with the 
mining ones in the claims to that.

838
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,800
So they have updated a lot of those 
things,

839
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,450
um,

840
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,280
but then Nevada guys,
or excuse me,

841
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,060
the Oregon guys,
they didn't want to pay.

842
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,300
That was part of what was going on.
They didn't want to pay their bill to 

843
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,510
least as far as experience

844
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,980
and there's different parties involved.
So you had these ranchers,

845
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:13,981
he didn't want to do that and then you 
have a bunch of people in the community 

846
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:14,560
who were sympathetic,
not so much to that part,

847
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,920
but the fact that the ranchers were mad 
at the same people that they were mad 

848
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:19,920
at.
So,

849
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,030
so,
so that's why you hear a lot of people 

850
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,030
speak in these things saying I'm not 
really,

851
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,370
you know,
on their side,

852
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,580
but we all generally have sympathy to 
the idea that we would like the federal 

853
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,931
government to stop telling us how many 
logs we can cut or those kinds of 

854
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:34,180
things.
And that's a traditional American thing.

855
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:36,350
Get the government off my back and 
whatever

856
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,840
it is.
And there's points on both sides though,

857
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,520
unfortunately.
Oh absolutely.

858
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:46,521
Because when you look at,
like when you look at some that's been 

859
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,800
clear cut and you see like how much it's
devastating.

860
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:54,801
It's devastating when you see a giant 
swath of land that used to be filled 

861
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:57,450
with old growth trees and they replanted
with a single mono crop instead and use,

862
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,190
you know,
they always call it like they want you 

863
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,190
to think it's like growing tomatoes,
you know,

864
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,360
they always say this is a renewable crop
and yes and no.

865
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,050
And,
and like you said,

866
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:09,510
the clear cuts are awful because you do 
think to yourself,

867
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,720
couldn't you take like every fifth tree 
or a lot of times private land owners 

868
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,040
will do a better job of it.
Not always.

869
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,020
Sometimes they'll just think my kid 
needs to go to college.

870
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:20,910
It's time to just level everything on 
this hill.

871
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,460
Sometimes though they're attitude is 
okay,

872
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,740
this is my view.
I mean I look out,

873
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:30,741
I don't want to see a clear cut as well.
I'll take every third or fourth tree 

874
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:30,741
and,
and it becomes like a,

875
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,100
an extra bank account for some of them.
So.

876
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,370
Well,
it's if your whole business is the 

877
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,951
logging business,
I can imagine like we were up in the 

878
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:40,800
redwood forest recently and as we were 
driving up there,

879
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:45,801
you pass these lumber yards.
There was this one lumber yard where 

880
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,540
it's just massive logs and massive 
amounts.

881
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,550
They're just stacked up and you're 
looking at like in terms of the number 

882
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,991
of years of growth you're looking at 
when you're looking at this huge lumber 

883
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,400
yard filled with trees,
like how many years of growth is that?

884
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,650
How do you sustain it?
Right?

885
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,550
I mean if this is how much you need 
today,

886
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,920
how do you make sure you have that much,
15,

887
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,340
20 years?

888
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,790
You know,
what they're doing right now is,

889
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:11,100
is the Canadians are logging a lot and 
in Russia,

890
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,470
in the places like below the,
the,

891
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,930
the,
they have a forest line in Siberia and 

892
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,261
they're logging a lot there too.
I mean it's Kinda like gold that grows 

893
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:25,101
for those people.
And so in one sense you find it hard to 

894
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:25,101
tell them not to because I'm doing just 
fine,

895
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,210
but you can't log and make money.
And the other hand,

896
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,610
you know,
we all do kind of share this and so it's

897
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:34,611
hard to figure out how to manage things 
she does for the greater good as they 

898
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:37,911
say.
That's the good point is that it's 

899
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:37,911
really,
I mean,

900
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:39,150
it's no ones you could call it property,
but what it is,

901
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:44,151
is like we're all sharing the resources 
of the earth and what's going on in the 

902
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:44,580
Amazon right now.

903
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:49,790
And uh,
what happens when people move in and 

904
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,761
farm for cattle is one of the best 
arguments against factory farming and 

905
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:57,420
against supporting the meat industry 
pollutes rivers and all that devastating

906
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:59,970
deforestation to at a ridiculously high 
rate.

907
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:04,020
That's a big part of what's going,
what's fueling the deforestation is they

908
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:09,021
chopped down all these trees so that 
they can make gland for these cattle to 

909
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,020
graze on.
And you can see by the way,

910
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,470
how much money is involved because some 
of the,

911
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,950
in some of those countries,
the people that campaign,

912
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,450
a lot of times they're indigenous 
people,

913
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,470
it gets violent and people die.
And you know what I mean?

914
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,980
That's how much money we're talking 
about.

915
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,640
Yeah,
they killed.

916
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:25,641
They were killed some nun that was 
protesting against the logging she got 

917
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:27,450
murdered recently.
It's not that uncommon.

918
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:27,890
And,
and,

919
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,240
and you know,
everybody kind of knows this is,

920
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:30,960
you know,
you're taking.

921
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,990
I mean,
it's pretty brave when you think about 

922
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,581
what those people do because they get 
the threatening letters long before 

923
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:37,581
happens to them

924
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,300
and then to keep doing it.
I admire people like that and whether or

925
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:40,930
not I agree with a specific cause.
Yeah.

926
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,700
I mean who knows if they're even getting
letters,

927
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,990
you know,
they just might get bullets.

928
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,670
You know what I mean?
If you start making a massive,

929
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,690
making a lot of noise and making it 
problematic for the people that are 

930
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:51,820
earning a shitload of money,
chopping those trees down,

931
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,120
things can get real ugly.
They get real nasty.

932
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,720
I was in Mount Rainier and that was the 
first time I ever saw like real clear 

933
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,310
cut areas and that's an interesting 
place because it rains so much,

934
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,680
you would think like it's a real fertile
environment,

935
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:10,681
like whatever trees that they do have.
But when I was talking to one of the 

936
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,380
guys was up there,
one of the cops that was um,

937
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,130
uh,
you know,

938
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:13,930
it was a forest ranger type character.

939
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,020
Uh,
he was saying that they do it,

940
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,800
but it takes like 20 years for these 
things become trees again.

941
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Well,
and they use different growth trees for 

942
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,220
different things.
So you can grow the quick,

943
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,961
you know,
I always hear from the guys who want to 

944
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:30,961
grow hemp and say,
well,

945
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:30,961
if they would just grow hemp,
it would make it.

946
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,280
But it would make up for some uses.
The old growth trees,

947
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:34,390
they'll like,
if you go into some of these,

948
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:35,980
there are some Oregon hotels for 
example,

949
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:40,981
they're all built with old growth and 
you go in there and you see what old 

950
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:41,170
growth can do and you say,
okay,

951
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,780
there are no other logs that you could 
do this with.

952
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,880
You know,
it's just a,

953
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,460
it's a,
you see the band saws that they use to 

954
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:50,460
cut that stuff.
It's,

955
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,070
it's a whole different level of tree.

956
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,940
But the replacement time periods,
like a hundred and 50 years or something

957
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,230
for those kinds of things.
Yeah,

958
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,240
it's kind of fucking crazy.
We didn't really think about it.

959
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,250
It's totally unsustainable,
but you're right,

960
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:03,760
it looks nothing like it.
There's a company called urban hardwoods

961
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,970
and they're in Seattle.
I've heard of them and they make like 

962
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,580
tables and desks and stuff out of the 
most incredible looking.

963
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:16,591
Would they take like real wood,
like a real giant tree and they'll turn 

964
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:19,150
that giant tree.
They'll cut chunks out of it and turn it

965
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,970
into a table,
but it's got like the outside edge.

966
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:26,971
It's like the natural edge of the tree.
I used to know a guy who was a big 

967
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:26,971
investor.
He's dead now,

968
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:31,891
but he would find investments to go to 
go by and he went and somehow he was so 

969
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,931
proud of this.
He'd got himself a piece of a Koa Wood 

970
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:41,041
forest in Hawaii and he showed me the 
deed and the deed from the guy he bought

971
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:45,130
it from had been signed by light King 
Kamehameha or something.

972
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,280
So he was bragging to me for years about
this and then found out later Hawaii 

973
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,370
wouldn't let him cut any of it.
So He.

974
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,460
He bought it all on the premise that I 
had this valuable would and but for 

975
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,250
environmental and heritage reasons why 
you wouldn't let him,

976
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,680
he was totally screwed.
Wow.

977
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,150
Well,
at least you got a cool forest,

978
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,780
a gorgeous heart and valuable and rare.
Yeah.

979
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:07,200
I don't think many like guitars out of 
the.

980
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,910
I know they make pool cues.
They used to make ships out of it.

981
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,130
You know,
like those old wooden ships.

982
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,630
Beautiful.
Yeah.

983
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:18,160
The different densities of trees and the
different grains and patterns.

984
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:20,350
And when you look at actual like 
hardwood,

985
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,530
it's such a fascinating and Admin,
not invention,

986
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,900
but creation of nature like these,
the,

987
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,780
the variety of the grain and the way 
they look.

988
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,410
It's really like a work of art and it's,
it's strange how it affects us visually.

989
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,970
Like if you look at a piece of redwood 
that's been polished and sanded and cut,

990
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,950
it's like you see the grain in.
It's like,

991
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,390
wow,
that is so pretty.

992
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,130
You know,
it's,

993
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:46,250
it's interesting how that affects us.
I'm wondering who's winning the pool for

994
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:48,650
what they thought we would talk about 
today.

995
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,640
How many people had hardwoods?
Nobody there,

996
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,050
right about hemp though.
As far as the construction material,

997
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,440
they make that stuff called hempcrete.
Have you ever seen that?

998
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,780
It's like no product that they make with
hemp.

999
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,550
It's incredibly.
Has incredible installation values.

1000
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:09,551
It's really difficult to light on fire.
It's going to be used a lot up until 

1001
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:14,081
about the thirties and forties.
It was a pretty big crop for a lot of 

1002
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,901
industrial use is everybody.
Everybody who looks into it for five 

1003
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:16,901
minutes knows that.
Yeah.

1004
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,740
Well that's one of those things were 
stoners love to sit down and talk to you

1005
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:19,070
about it.

1006
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,700
You know man Henry Ford made the first.
George Washington.

1007
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:25,460
Yeah.
Do George Washington grew pot bro?

1008
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,040
Ben Franklin smoked pot.
Yeah.

1009
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,110
Yeah,
they probably did good stuff.

1010
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,230
Hard to prove.
Yeah.

1011
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,830
Well they definitely liked him.
You know,

1012
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:38,831
there definitely were into hemp and they
were definitely into using it as a 

1013
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:38,831
commodity and a textile,
you know,

1014
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,340
and you can go back and forth about 
that.

1015
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,210
Like the pay,
the dress like that.

1016
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,390
The first tech waste and one of the 
first drafts of the declaration of 

1017
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,351
independence was written on hemp and 
parachutes sales sales with a lot of 

1018
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,540
stuff we used in both world wars for 
equipment in fabric,

1019
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,410
a lot of stuff like that.
Even the term canvas comes from the word

1020
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,310
cannabis because that's what it was.
Made a member that actually.

1021
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1022
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,680
It's interesting how it's becoming 
illegal,

1023
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,680
but that's another thing that's really 
fascinating about this time.

1024
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,620
It's like slowly in your state,
Washington state,

1025
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:14,621
Colorado,
you're studying to see so much money 

1026
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:15,830
coming in from it being legal that it's 
going to trickle down into other states.

1027
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:17,570
It's almost kind of a great experiment,
isn't it?

1028
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,350
And I've.
I've said before and I,

1029
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:22,130
I might've even said on this show,
the very first time we got together,

1030
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:23,990
I think we may have talked about,
you know,

1031
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:25,560
what's going to happen,
we,

1032
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,670
because we have this divergence between 
the states and the federal government 

1033
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,690
and as you probably know,
only a couple of weeks ago the federal 

1034
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,331
government decided to leave marijuana 
classified as a schedule one drug for 

1035
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:40,601
the same reason they always did.
Which is they say that the research 

1036
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:41,450
doesn't show anything and then you find 
out what they're not really permitted do

1037
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:43,490
the research.
So it's this catch 22.

1038
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,850
So at some point either the feds are 
going to have to move toward the states 

1039
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,450
or somebody going to get into power that
says,

1040
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:52,700
enough of this dichotomy,
we're going to crack down.

1041
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,680
I have no idea what that would look 
like.

1042
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,600
It would look ugly.
You can't crack down.

1043
00:43:56,601 --> 00:44:00,050
Now the amount of money that Colorado is
making is changed.

1044
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,220
The,
the quality of life for so many people 

1045
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,220
there,
their real estate values have gone up.

1046
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,370
The drunk driving accidents have gone 
way down,

1047
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:08,780
drunk driving arrest,
way down,

1048
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,250
violent crime,
way down.

1049
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:15,460
I mean,
it's really fascinating what's happened 

1050
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,261
to Colorado.
Look at what the feds have already done 

1051
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:17,261
in,
in,

1052
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:17,261
in roundabout ways.
For example,

1053
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:21,731
one of the things that they've said and 
some of these places is if you have a 

1054
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:24,461
medical marijuana card,
you can't get pain medication prescribed

1055
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,230
to you.
If you have a medical marijuana card,

1056
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,610
a judge just upheld,
didn't they?

1057
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:30,530
That you.
That you can be denied a gun.

1058
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,030
Yeah,
they don't deny people guns for drinking

1059
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,470
the pills.
Yeah,

1060
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,520
so the only reason that that works is 
because you have a disagreement between 

1061
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,770
state and federal law and they're siding
with the higher law,

1062
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:42,840
which is the way the law is supposed to 
work,

1063
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:48,290
but at what point,
at what point do we have such a of a 

1064
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,401
division between the reality on the 
ground in these states and what federal 

1065
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,150
law says that the rubber's gonna meet 
the road somewhere.

1066
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:59,150
I don't know who wins,
but there's going to be a moment where 

1067
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,060
you have a rubber meets the road moment.
Yeah,

1068
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,960
and it's an interesting case with the 
National Rifle Association too,

1069
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,230
because the NRA,
which is always a course pro gun and 

1070
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,931
really trying to stop any laws that 
infringe upon the rights of people to 

1071
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:14,700
uphold the second amendment,
but when you get to this pot thing,

1072
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:16,110
they don't want to fuck with the pot 
thing.

1073
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,390
I think they did.
I may be wrong about this,

1074
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:23,391
but I do believe that they did come out 
and say that you shouldn't be denying 

1075
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:24,600
people's rights the better.
I think that.

1076
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,480
Well,
there's a lot.

1077
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,450
It's in their interest,
it's in their interest to.

1078
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,770
There's a lot of closet pot smokers out 
there because it's obviously the 

1079
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,970
stereotype is always been that it makes 
you lazy and it makes you dumb and sort 

1080
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,930
of gives you brain damage and you forget
things that's been shown time and time 

1081
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:41,930
again to not be true.

1082
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,050
I mean when you are high as fuck,
you do forget things like when you're in

1083
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:51,051
the throws of like that.
I remember reading a study once where 

1084
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:54,141
they were studying population in Jamaica
where a lot of these people who were 75 

1085
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:58,320
years old had been doing it their whole 
lives and they didn't show any.

1086
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,770
Anything that would make you your eyes 
bulge out,

1087
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:05,640
your hair stand up and made nothing 
seemed that out of the ordinary in terms

1088
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,740
of whether you're talking about cancer 
rates,

1089
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,500
are any of these other things.
If there were something like that,

1090
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,910
God,
it would be beaten into our head.

1091
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:16,911
Right,
and that's all the contents of 

1092
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:18,530
pharmaceutical drugs and all the people 
that are making money off of marijuana 

1093
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,310
remaining in this schedule.
One category which are pretty 

1094
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,771
significant.
There's a lot of people that make money 

1095
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:24,771
off of it.
The category is ridiculous.

1096
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:25,500
I mean,
that's just crazy.

1097
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,440
Do you see what's going on in Arizona?
I tweeted about it.

1098
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,560
I think yesterday,
these people who were protesting against

1099
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,900
marijuana being legalized in Arizona,
that people are spending the most money.

1100
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,650
We're talking hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to try to keep marijuana illegal

1101
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:46,770
and Arizona are directly tied to 
pharmaceutical drugs.

1102
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,870
That's directly tied to pain pills,
specifically the stuff that killed 

1103
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,130
prince.
What's that stuff called?

1104
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:53,930
Fentanyl?
Fentanyl.

1105
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,140
Fentanyl.
Well,

1106
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:58,260
Arizona was a weird state of the two.
They have some very conservative people.

1107
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:01,350
This is the alcohol industry.
Before that there was one.

1108
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,530
So that's the alcohol industry.
And then there's also the,

1109
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,350
um,
the fentanyl industry.

1110
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,110
It might be a little bit earlier to see 
if you scroll down a little bit further,

1111
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:13,470
see if you find it.
But it's just bizarre that we allow that

1112
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:18,240
stuff and it's so transparent today as 
opposed to this stuff all went on behind

1113
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:23,241
the scenes 100 years ago,
which of course is why marijuana got 

1114
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:27,050
made illegal area.
Fentanyl maker donates big to campaign 

1115
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:27,660
opposing pot legalization.
That's fast.

1116
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:28,140
Yeah.
There you go.

1117
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:30,100
A $500,000
towards

1118
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
defeating a ballot initiative that would
make recreational use of marijuana 

1119
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,440
illegal under Arizona law.
You're just criminals here.

1120
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:41,441
A bunch of crooks.
The fact that you guys would spend that 

1121
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,270
much money to stop a drug that has 
nothing to do with what you do,

1122
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,300
but I'll make the case,
and this is pretty much what my 

1123
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300
political show has been about since the 
very beginning,

1124
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,640
is that that's a fact of factor of the 
corruption in our system.

1125
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,810
Um,
when,

1126
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,230
when it's a pay to play system.
Well,

1127
00:47:56,231 --> 00:48:01,231
I mean that's how this happens.
If you're going to impact somebody 

1128
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:02,590
else's business by legalizing something 
else than the way you fight,

1129
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,780
that is you go out there and you donate 
to the,

1130
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,710
to the cause.
I mean,

1131
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,950
in other words,
instead of the people getting what they 

1132
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,950
want,
it's,

1133
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,950
it's,
it's whomever donates the most.

1134
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,541
And I remember Justice Scalia before he 
died was part of a ruling where he 

1135
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:15,541
basically said,
that's not a,

1136
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:16,420
a,
a bug.

1137
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,420
It's a feature.
This is the way the system is supposed 

1138
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,420
to work,
you know,

1139
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,230
money is,
is supposed to represent the views of 

1140
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,680
people and if it's poor people,
they can bundle it all together and then

1141
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,760
if,
if there's no money,

1142
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:30,580
obviously there's not a lot of people 
who care and that was the theory,

1143
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,910
but what it's really done is,
is mean if you don't have money flowing 

1144
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:36,010
into Washington,
you don't count.

1145
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,960
You're not at the table.
Right?

1146
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:42,961
So there's whole sectors of the American
society that are essentially 

1147
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,920
unrepresented because there's no money 
coming from them.

1148
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,650
That's the real problem.
And wasn't this sort of structure,

1149
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,680
the government structure that sort of 
enforces that or,

1150
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:55,681
or relies upon that.
It was kind of established before 

1151
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,771
corporations were and definitely 
established before corporations were 

1152
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:02,761
allowed to act as an individual and 
donate insane amounts of money to 

1153
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:03,280
campaigns the problem.

1154
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:08,550
And you look at it and you just.
You can see how it happened because you 

1155
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,590
could see that that the people that gave
a little money back in the days when you

1156
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:13,750
could only give this much money,
had a little influence.

1157
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:18,751
So what do you want to do?
You want to influence them to let you 

1158
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:19,610
give a little bit more and slowly but 
surely you evolve into a system.

1159
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:22,390
I mean that was talking to my wife about
this the other day where we were talking

1160
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:27,391
about how it was never a good system,
but it was a fairer system back when I 

1161
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:31,741
was a kid in the 19 seventies because 
some of the money came from entities 

1162
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,120
that represented people who were blue 
collar people.

1163
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,390
So for example,
when unions were big a private employee 

1164
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:39,390
unions,
not the public employee unions.

1165
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,311
They're so popular now.
So if you were a pipe fitter or a 

1166
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:46,270
plumber or those people that had the 
electricians had pretty powerful unions,

1167
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,660
those people would bundle money and 
those unions would give money to 

1168
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,301
candidates that sort of compensated for 
the fact that you had corporate money or

1169
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,540
whatever and other directions.

1170
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,430
In the 19 eighties when the Democrats 
started getting waxed regularly and were

1171
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,430
due to Reagan changing tax policies and 
whatever else,

1172
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:08,431
we started to get some really wealthy 
people and the union started getting 

1173
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:08,680
less powerful.
All of a sudden,

1174
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:10,090
you know,
Willie Sutton,

1175
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,790
the bank robber was famously asked,
you know,

1176
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,000
why do you rob banks?
And he says,

1177
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,590
that's where the money is.
Well,

1178
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,230
in the eighties,
you know,

1179
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,300
after 84,
especially after Mondale got waxed by 

1180
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Reagan,
they,

1181
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,140
that's when superdelegates started to.
They went and they looked and they said,

1182
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:24,370
okay,
what do we need to compete?

1183
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,470
Because if you look at the longterm 
trends,

1184
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,490
the people that Republicans tend to get 
money from,

1185
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,670
they're just getting more money.
The people that we tend to get money 

1186
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:33,670
from or getting weaker,
and that's when,

1187
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:38,170
that's the role Bill Clinton played in 
the Democratic Leadership Council where 

1188
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,830
they basically said we can go and get 
money from those same sources.

1189
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,210
So they did.
Okay,

1190
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:46,211
so fast forward to now everybody's taken
money from those same sources and the 

1191
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,610
people that are lower and middle class 
have no way to break into that game.

1192
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,890
Right?
So if you know Lawrence Lessig,

1193
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:54,800
the Harvard law professor did a great 
book called Republic last,

1194
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:59,801
where he pointed out how he went and 
interviewed politicians who didn't even 

1195
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:04,301
realize there was another side.
Sometimes to the issue they were voting 

1196
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:04,640
on because they hadn't heard from any 
money.

1197
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,290
Right,
so you almost.

1198
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:11,350
You almost felt like a lot of these 
people were almost blameless because in 

1199
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:11,350
their minds,
well,

1200
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,920
nobody cares about this or I would've 
had some money coming in for that.

1201
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:18,310
It's strange how the systems evolve,
but the one thing you can say for sure 

1202
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,550
is you're not getting money from people 
who don't have money,

1203
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:25,060
and so eventually we get to this 
dichotomy where there's a lot of people 

1204
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,391
in this country right now.
What's that old line about taxation 

1205
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:30,461
without representation.
A lot of people in this country not 

1206
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:30,461
represented a 100 percent.

1207
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:35,130
Also,
you have to think about how many people 

1208
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,670
feel disenfranchised by the system and 
it doesn't seem like it's gonna be fixed

1209
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:41,671
anytime soon because the amount of 
people that are contributing to these 

1210
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:42,340
campaigns,
when you look at the percentage of human

1211
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:47,341
beings on this landmass is very small 
and so the amount of people that have 

1212
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:51,811
influence,
it's a very small amount of people that 

1213
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:54,280
are affecting the lives of a vast 
majority of people and it becomes a very

1214
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:59,281
weird sort of a scenario when we 
continue with the same representative 

1215
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:04,170
government structure that we had back 
when it was impossible to communicate 

1216
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,170
with people and the other side of the 
country.

1217
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Like you had a Senate,
you know Morse code or a guy on a horse 

1218
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,180
with a letter.
It was hard,

1219
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,771
so this is why they decided to have 
representative government in the first 

1220
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:13,771
place.

1221
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:14,470
You couldn't communicate with people.
Now that you can.

1222
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,700
It's like we,
we,

1223
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,530
we really ultimately have to decide.
I think one day it is one person,

1224
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,070
one vote,
like do we all as a mass has 300 million

1225
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:29,071
people get to decide.
Like if a hundred 90 million people 

1226
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:29,770
think one thing and the rest,
think another thing.

1227
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,540
How does this all work out?
Like how do,

1228
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,330
how do we decide?
Because right now we have delicates,

1229
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,940
we have representatives,
we have senators,

1230
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:41,941
we have all these different people that 
sort of a buffer us from the actual 

1231
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:43,960
decisions that are being made and I 
think as we,

1232
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:50,010
as it becomes easier and easier to 
communicate and express your opinions 

1233
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:53,210
and give your thoughts on things,
the option of voting online and the 

1234
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,661
option of voting directly for issues 
without representation seems more and 

1235
00:52:57,661 --> 00:52:58,600
more enticing to people.

1236
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah.
But you'd have to change the 

1237
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:03,920
constitution and,
and you know,

1238
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,500
that'd be a good idea.
So old as fuck.

1239
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,710
I hate to.
It depends on.

1240
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:10,790
I'm reading a book right now that talks 
about our government actually operating 

1241
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,240
sort of between the lines of the,
of the constitution.

1242
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:17,241
So there's room to maneuver and over 
time for understandable reasons like 

1243
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:21,831
security and other things.
I mean the fact that nuclear bombs were 

1244
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,501
invented,
changed everything that within those 

1245
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,080
lines there's room to sort of expand 
what you can do,

1246
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,440
but you do that generation after 
generation and then you look around and 

1247
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,231
go,
how did we get from where we were in 

1248
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:35,691
1942 where we are now?
It's almost inexplicably and and 

1249
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:39,710
sometimes when I talk about reform,
you try to figure out how you can dial 

1250
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,041
things back,
but we've come so far beyond any point 

1251
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,270
you could dial it back to.
It becomes really hard to imagine.

1252
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,660
It's like you have an old mainframe 
computer that you've patched and patched

1253
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:53,661
and patched,
and the only way now to make any real 

1254
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:55,110
reform is to throw the computer out and 
buy a new Mac and start from scratch and

1255
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,400
nobody can do that.
I mean,

1256
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:57,930
you can't even figure out how to get 
that done.

1257
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:03,290
Yeah.
It's almost like we need an asteroid to 

1258
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,541
take out the grid,
just come down and boom and wreck the 

1259
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:10,011
whole.
Just a big earthquake or a title wave 

1260
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:10,380
have to be a big thing.
A big,

1261
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,020
big thing that unfortunately kills a lot
of people.

1262
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,610
Then the government will step in and 
say,

1263
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:14,940
well,
you know,

1264
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,830
we have to take care of all of you down 
and your security martial law.

1265
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,330
People on the street corner was a 
government's dead or the hits them.

1266
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,120
How symbol,
symbol amatic.

1267
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,300
It would be symbolic.
It would be rather simple maddox and 

1268
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,620
ignored with how amazing it would be.
Like if that's the only place where an 

1269
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:37,701
asteroid hit,
if it hit the Pentagon and the White 

1270
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:37,701
House,
if like this is too broken up.

1271
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:41,100
Chunks of space.
Rock one slams into the Pentagon.

1272
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,450
Kills everyone.
Hey Blaine.

1273
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,350
Yeah,
the god of terror.

1274
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,650
The God of terror.
Yeah,

1275
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,160
I mean that is.
That's really almost the only way.

1276
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Something has to be catastrophic in 
order for them to try to reset and 

1277
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,160
rebuild a completely new system and then
people would have to agree.

1278
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,040
You.
They'd have to get to together and go,

1279
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:04,041
okay,
are we going to go back to that thing 

1280
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,931
that was written on him by people that 
wrote with feathers or are we going to 

1281
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:09,560
Redo this?
We're gonna figure this out from a 

1282
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,811
modern perspective,
knowing what we know now about our 

1283
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:14,661
ability to communicate and knowing what 
we know now about all the things that 

1284
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:18,741
are the founding fathers of this country
did an amazing job of trying to protect 

1285
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:19,380
from corruption,
you know,

1286
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,710
trying to make sure that their,
their vision of what America could be,

1287
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,860
that this experiment in self government 
and they put all these safeguards in 

1288
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,821
play,
but there's no way they could have ever 

1289
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,041
predicted how far technology would have 
taken us in the 200 plus years since 

1290
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,330
they did that.
There's just no way they,

1291
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:38,590
they,
they,

1292
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,380
they,
they couldn't have any idea.

1293
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,500
So now that we know where we are now and
we can sort of extrapolate where it's 

1294
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:50,340
going to be in the next 50 a hundred 
years and maybe plan for the future,

1295
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:52,170
the digital future that we're dealing 
with now.

1296
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,260
And then we thought it was the case.
We would have put in some,

1297
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:00,890
some things that people would agree with
in regards to like what the NSA got 

1298
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,390
caught with,
you know,

1299
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,070
with the mass surveillance of the.

1300
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,300
Let's talk about that for because I was 
just going to go there.

1301
00:56:05,301 --> 00:56:07,520
You know,
I was thinking not that long ago,

1302
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:09,190
if you could,
if they force you,

1303
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,750
because we all understand that that 
history is an evolution,

1304
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:16,751
so,
so all of this is the result of decades 

1305
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:19,401
and decades and generations of 
generations of building stuff on top of 

1306
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:20,870
other things,
but if you had to pick the time that was

1307
00:56:20,871 --> 00:56:24,040
most transformative for all those you 
were talking about,

1308
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,110
you have to go back to the United States
between 1947 and 1948.

1309
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:34,530
That's when Harry Truman and the 
government passed these rules that made 

1310
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,600
everything we talk about today,
the NSA,

1311
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,720
the CIA,
all those things are developments from 

1312
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,140
like national security.
I mean NSC.

1313
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:49,141
60 eight is one of those big ones.
A bunch of these rules that created the 

1314
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:51,820
modern United States,
we'll call it the secret government that

1315
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:53,020
we know about today.

1316
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,450
And you know,
if you go back in time,

1317
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:58,570
you can certainly understand what they 
were thinking.

1318
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:03,571
I mean,
you have to remember how crazy it was 

1319
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:06,001
after the second world war and this 
feeling that the Soviet Union was this 

1320
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:09,091
threat to the whole world and now you 
have nuclear weapons and can you really 

1321
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:10,510
declare war if there's nuclear weapons.
That could be,

1322
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,660
you know,
there's a whole bunch of things where 

1323
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:15,660
you go here,
kind of get what was going on,

1324
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,730
but it didn't take Harry Truman Long,
you know,

1325
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,870
after he left office to say I made a few
mistakes including things like the CIA 

1326
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,200
and whatnot.
But once you start those programs,

1327
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:28,710
there's an autopilot that that happens 
and they develop a momentum of their 

1328
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,190
own.
So if you said today,

1329
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,370
because I would make this case,
if you wanted to look at this the way my

1330
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,650
stepfather,
when he was a total profit and loss guy,

1331
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,570
and you would look at something like the
CIA,

1332
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,490
you would say the CIA is a terrible 
failure.

1333
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:44,700
They miss all the big things.
Whether it's the fall of the Soviet 

1334
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Union,
you name it,

1335
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,241
right?
The CIA has got major failures and then 

1336
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:48,241
you said,
you know,

1337
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:48,460
all the things that they've done that 
were nefarious that they shouldn't have.

1338
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:51,160
So if this were a private business,
you'd turn around and go,

1339
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:51,610
well,
listen,

1340
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,560
that's a last thing right there.
You know,

1341
00:57:53,561 --> 00:57:58,561
let's take that division scrap it 
startled you can't do that in a 

1342
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:02,641
government for some reason.
It's almost impossible to decide this 

1343
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:06,301
whole area has been a failure.
So let's start over and that's the 

1344
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:07,060
problem because I'm not sure you can 
reform things that are,

1345
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,060
that are flawed at the seeds.
Do you know what I mean?

1346
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,340
Um,
and,

1347
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,750
and the CIA is a perfect example,
but even the NSA,

1348
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,790
I mean,
did you see that this week they're,

1349
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:20,791
once again trying to slip a bill and 
that would allow the government without 

1350
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:20,791
a warrant to track,
you know,

1351
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,300
every website you go to an all these 
things,

1352
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,420
how does this stuff get that far?

1353
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,420
They're going,
they're going to attach it to a totally 

1354
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:30,420
unrelated bill so that you don't know 
about it.

1355
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,090
Again,
how do they get away with this?

1356
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,720
Most likely it's just justifying 
something they're already doing well and

1357
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,840
they're legitimately afraid.
There's stuff to be afraid of,

1358
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:39,610
so I don't always,
you know,

1359
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:45,030
you have to cut them a little slack,
but there's no waiting at all about the 

1360
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,580
downside.
I mean,

1361
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:50,581
it's almost like the only thing we pay 
attention to is the terror side of the 

1362
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:50,581
ledger.
Not the fact that,

1363
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:54,660
do you John Mccain or Lindsey Graham,
do you really want the government 

1364
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:54,910
knowing every webs,
especially Lindsey Graham.

1365
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,300
There's got to be some websites there 
that he really would not like the 

1366
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,300
government to know about.
Come on.

1367
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,000
At least think about yourself.
You know,

1368
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,150
so I don't know how you stop this 
dynamic.

1369
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:07,540
We're such a fearful people that that's 
what's going to kill us.

1370
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,920
Well,
we know what we've done.

1371
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:12,040
Other people we know.
Payback is probably likely.

1372
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:13,990
That's.
And you know what's.

1373
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:19,350
What's really sad is I've always had 
this rose colored view of us and I 

1374
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,190
acknowledged that it's a myth,
but always look at the myth

1375
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,210
of America as I call it,
the 19 fifties high school textbook view

1376
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,220
of American.
That to me is what I want to move 

1377
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,471
towards.
So when they talk about creating a more 

1378
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,770
perfect union,
that to me is the goal and anything that

1379
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,650
conflicts with that self image to me is 
the problem.

1380
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,430
So when you see sometimes how we really 
operate anything Dick Cheney does,

1381
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,200
um,
and I don't use the word evil,

1382
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:46,370
so I'll use the word nefarious Dick 
Cheney is to me when you say what do you

1383
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:47,900
want to avoid in this country?
I want to avoid.

1384
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:52,280
We're Dick Cheney wants us to go because
nothing conflicts with my 19 fifties,

1385
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,050
mythological American textbook idea than
what Cheney wants us to be.

1386
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,940
And when you look at some of the things 
we've done,

1387
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:00,920
some of the things based on that 19,
47,

1388
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:02,330
19,
48 America,

1389
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,230
which we thought,
okay,

1390
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,210
we have to do everything to stop global 
communism.

1391
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:10,210
They're gonna take over the country.
Once you look at some of the things we 

1392
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:10,880
did and you realize some of what we're 
dealing with today is blowback.

1393
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,340
You don't know how to undo that.
I mean,

1394
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,900
you almost think it's like permanent 
damage.

1395
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:16,610
Look at the way some in the Middle East.
See us.

1396
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,630
I mean,
uh,

1397
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,660
I'll,
I'll talk to people like I remember 

1398
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,251
talking to Sam Harris about this and he 
was talking about what you have to see 

1399
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:27,521
things a certain way and I said yes,
but that's not going to help you solve 

1400
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,921
the problem.
How do you solve the problem if we've 

1401
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:32,471
already,
if we've already soiled our bed so much 

1402
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:32,780
that you don't know how to fix that.
You don't have to go and say,

1403
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:33,680
listen,
we're sorry about this.

1404
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:36,410
Can we start from scratch?
You can't do that in foreign affairs.

1405
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:38,420
Just like you can't do it with the 
mainframe computer.

1406
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,620
That is the government,
you know,

1407
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:44,770
I can't figure out how to,
how to reverse course to a point where 

1408
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:44,930
we can once again fix stuff,
right?

1409
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:46,370
It's,
it's too damaged.

1410
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,430
I think it just has to dry out slowly 
but surely look all the wounds of the 

1411
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,800
past to heal up and dry out and it just 
takes time.

1412
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,370
How do you do it when they're still 
after?

1413
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:58,430
You mean we've already made enough 
people mad at us so that thereafter us.

1414
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,250
Well now we have to go protect ourselves
by going and getting them,

1415
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:06,251
so we perpetuate the cycle.
Like I can't figure out how to jump off 

1416
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:06,251
the merry go round.
You know what I mean?

1417
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:11,170
I don't think it moves that way.
I think we're trying to make a 

1418
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,580
battleship move like a race car and I 
just think it takes a long time to shift

1419
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:18,581
course and when we're looking at these 
people that are in the Middle East that 

1420
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:21,440
are opposing the US right now and angry 
and want to attack the US right now,

1421
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,750
you're most likely never going to get to
them.

1422
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:28,250
You might get to their grandchildren and
I think that might be the only way.

1423
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:33,310
Things slowly but surely settled down 
and that's the argument for the NSA and 

1424
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,841
the CIA to continue to monitor things 
that are really kind of ridiculous and 

1425
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:41,261
invasive level because there's so many 
people out there that hate us or hate 

1426
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:45,910
the government.
I hate the military and hate what's 

1427
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:45,910
happened to them and so many martyrs are
created.

1428
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,120
Every time a drone strike was going to 
go.

1429
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:48,050
How do you.
How do you,

1430
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:53,140
how do you get that next generation to 
not hate us when we're busy killing 

1431
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,240
their parents because their parents want
to kill us.

1432
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,480
I mean,
that's the cycle and I can't figure out 

1433
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,641
how to break the cycle.
How do you protect ourselves from their 

1434
01:02:00,641 --> 01:02:02,240
anti American parents in a way that 
doesn't turn them against us to.

1435
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:03,140
Does that make sense?

1436
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,270
It's a real.
It definitely makes sense in the.

1437
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:10,420
It's hard.
No one has a real logical answer to 

1438
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:11,180
that.
I mean,

1439
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:16,390
he talked to the Ron Paul supporters and
they think we should just separate and 

1440
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,460
don't police the world and take care of 
our own and just stay there and still 

1441
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:21,600
people will want to kill us.
Yeah,

1442
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,200
yeah,
yeah.

1443
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:27,201
And then you talk to the people that are
on the Dick Cheney camp that like you're

1444
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:32,421
out of your mind.
You're living in a dream movie world in 

1445
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:35,430
the real world is dirty and nasty and we
need all these people.

1446
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:40,431
We need all these operatives.
We need people constantly monitoring 

1447
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:40,710
these hotspots all around the world 
because like,

1448
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,890
look what's going on in North Korea.
They're fucking testing nuclear bombs 

1449
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:46,830
now and you know,
what are we doing?

1450
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,410
We're flying by.
We're.

1451
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:53,160
We're making these threatening gestures.
We were flying fighter jets around North

1452
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:53,160
Korea.

1453
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,100
It's,
it's,

1454
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:58,560
it's really spooky.
It's spooky because something can happen

1455
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:01,860
and we don't have anybody over there,
you know,

1456
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,150
at least as far as I know.
I mean,

1457
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:04,680
I don't know.
Maybe we have some deep,

1458
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:09,681
deep,
deep undercover CIA people working as 

1459
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:10,050
North Korean soldiers.
But I'll tell you what upsets me though,

1460
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:12,810
because what we were just talking about,
getting off the merry go round.

1461
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,940
It means kind of not perpetuating the 
same mistakes we've made before.

1462
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:23,150
But what drives me crazy about our 
system is that the people who make 

1463
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,150
mistakes,
and I've always said,

1464
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,820
you know,
you've forgiven people,

1465
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,350
make mistakes.
You're gonna make a mistake,

1466
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,510
right?
You shouldn't be allowed to make another

1467
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:28,410
one though,
right?

1468
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:33,540
At the highest levels of government when
you send people to war and we shouldn't 

1469
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:33,900
have gone to war.
I'll cut you some slack,

1470
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,350
but I don't want you then going on cnn 
and being the expert who tells us how to

1471
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:38,490
handle the next crisis,
right?

1472
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:43,490
Because your track record sucks.
Dick Cheney's got a terrible track 

1473
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:43,530
record.
We still listen to him.

1474
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:48,531
He still gets to be a person who,
who moves the public debate and there's 

1475
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:49,860
a lot of people like that.
You look at the John Bolton's.

1476
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:54,861
There's a heck of a lot of these guys 
who are consistently and regularly 

1477
01:03:54,861 --> 01:03:56,290
wrong,
but we put them out there as though,

1478
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:01,291
oh,
this is somebody you should listen to 

1479
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:01,291
now.
And the show.

1480
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:01,291
He's going to analyze how we should 
handle North Korea.

1481
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:05,630
Yeah,
but he was wrong as heck about Iraq and 

1482
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,791
all these other things,
so we're going to listen to him on that 

1483
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,981
next subject.
We don't make people who are wrong in 

1484
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:09,981
this country pay the price,
which means you know,

1485
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:14,920
if you're in a private,
if you're a doctor and you screw up a 

1486
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:14,920
few surgeries and people who should not 
die,

1487
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,000
die.

1488
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,980
You're done.
You'll be out of business.

1489
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:19,230
They will take your license.
You won't get to kill anymore.

1490
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:24,231
People in government.
You can continue to make these errors 

1491
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:24,450
and you,
you'll be promoted.

1492
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,210
You'll be in a position to make more.
Yeah,

1493
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,710
that'll kill you.
Over the long haul,

1494
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,250
do you wonder like what,
what motivation is Dick Cheney have?

1495
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,570
I mean,
he doesn't even have a heart.

1496
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,770
They took his heart out.
They stuck some cadaver heart in their 

1497
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,100
worldview,
but it's not a 19 fifties us high school

1498
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:42,510
textbook worldview.
Right?

1499
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:43,980
But I mean,
why is he doing it?

1500
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:49,010
Like what is his motivation for 
continuing to keep Pistons on who you 

1501
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,010
ask?
Sometimes it's money.

1502
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:53,841
Sometimes it's powerful friends.
I've talked to these people and they'll 

1503
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:53,841
give you the old.
You don't know how the world works.

1504
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:54,100
Speech.
Right?

1505
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,400
And,
and at that point you have to say to 

1506
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,400
yourself,
okay,

1507
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,941
listen,
I know the constitution is just a piece 

1508
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:03,300
of paper,
but at some point there's a rubber meets

1509
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:04,810
the road.
That's going to be my word for today's.

1510
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,620
Joe Rogan showed me my fly in the 
ointment for today's Joe Rogan show.

1511
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,860
But there's got to be a point where 
somebody has to sit down and say,

1512
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:12,720
look,
we have a constitution that does this.

1513
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,130
Here's the way the world really works.
Now either we're going to go back to one

1514
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,130
or we're going to discard

1515
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:23,130
one and completely embrace the other.
At this point we embrace the hypocrisy 

1516
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:25,060
that we still live like this,
but the world's a difficult,

1517
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:26,710
tough place,
so we're acting like that.

1518
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,960
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

1519
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:28,870
No,
no,

1520
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,110
it does.
It definitely makes sense.

1521
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,800
And that dichotomy is what makes so many
Americans angry.

1522
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1523
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,260
Well,
it's,

1524
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:40,590
it's amazing that we've limited the 
amount of attacks on American soil to 

1525
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,450
nine slash 11 and Pearl Harbor.
Well,

1526
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:47,570
you had the Orlando attack.
It depends on what you classify the 

1527
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:48,010
town.
Lando attack was a crazy fuck that lived

1528
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,680
in America.
I mean that was a gun wolf stuff.

1529
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,060
What's that guy proven to be gay or is 
that like what that is?

1530
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,290
I'm sure he's okay.
How about that?

1531
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:56,560
But,
but,

1532
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,560
but that's a perfect example though,
of,

1533
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,540
of why this is so tough to defend 
yourself against.

1534
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,430
Because.
And this is the same thing by the way,

1535
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:08,320
the country has been worried about 
American radicals for decades.

1536
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,320
I mean,
you go look at how we treated the 19 

1537
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,661
sixties leftist radicals that were 
putting bombs in the Pentagon and stuff 

1538
01:06:15,661 --> 01:06:15,661
like that.
I mean,

1539
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,930
it always blows my mind to realize that 
if those guys were doing that today,

1540
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:23,140
we might waterboard them at Guantanamo,
you know?

1541
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:26,350
Um,
so I think the domestic radical idea has

1542
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:31,351
been something the government's been 
worried about since the first red scare 

1543
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:33,040
in the 19,
19 era and the anarchists and that whole

1544
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,210
era.
Yeah.

1545
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:36,220
And I think whenever you have a 
government,

1546
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:37,820
whenever you have people that are in 
charge,

1547
01:06:37,821 --> 01:06:40,870
there's going to be people that oppose 
those people and they're going to try to

1548
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,060
go through some people that are opposing
them.

1549
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:46,540
We're going to go through legal channels
and they're going to protest legally and

1550
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:51,130
they're going to organize and give 
speeches and other people are gonna say,

1551
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:52,060
look,
that doesn't work.

1552
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,430
We're going to do this guerrilla style.
We're going to do this.

1553
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,990
So now we come to the hacks,
right?

1554
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,400
That's where we're at.
See,

1555
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:02,401
I argued in the last common sense 
program that that the hacks are kind of 

1556
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:06,241
a chickens coming home to roost thing 
that when we deputize our 

1557
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:07,570
representatives to keep some secrets 
from us,

1558
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:10,240
because we all understand that there's 
going to be some of those,

1559
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,800
but if you did that in a private 
business,

1560
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:13,760
Joe,
if you work for a boss,

1561
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,780
you're your.
You're delivering pizzas at the Pizza 

1562
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:18,780
Company and the boss says,
do you listen to?

1563
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,170
Sometimes I have to have a little 
plausible deniability,

1564
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:22,330
so if you have to stamp something top 
secret on your,

1565
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:27,331
on your order form,
I won't look at it and we'll all be 

1566
01:07:27,331 --> 01:07:27,331
cool.
Okay,

1567
01:07:27,331 --> 01:07:30,931
so one day you're out with prostitutes 
and drinking beer and you don't deliver 

1568
01:07:30,931 --> 01:07:32,140
your pizza and you think if I put top 
secret on this,

1569
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,940
the boss won't see it will be great.

1570
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:39,150
I mean,
it's human nature that after a you're 

1571
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:39,150
going to start to classify stuff that 
really shouldn't be secret,

1572
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:43,951
right?
I W I t and I said this in the last 

1573
01:07:43,951 --> 01:07:46,681
show,
I talked to an intelligence operative 

1574
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:48,361
once.
It wouldn't tell me anything except I 

1575
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:50,020
asked him a question once about if you 
had to guess what percentage of stuff is

1576
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:52,690
the stuff that Americans would agree 
should be kept secret.

1577
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,730
He said about 10 percent.
I said,

1578
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:55,630
what's the rest?
He said,

1579
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,700
everything you can think of.
He said,

1580
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:02,701
cover your own rear end corporate deal 
that a senator doesn't want his 

1581
01:08:02,701 --> 01:08:04,480
constituents to know about for 40 years 
because he'll get voted,

1582
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,680
you know,
all the and it's.

1583
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:11,220
It becomes a point where when you're 
keeping that much stuff from the 

1584
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,220
American people that they have a right 
to know.

1585
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:16,350
It seems to be inevitable that there 
will be literally leaks like you're 

1586
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:16,350
trying to cover too much.

1587
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:16,350
Damn.
With,

1588
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,890
with two little concrete.
It's natural.

1589
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:23,891
I think in some of these guys like 
William beneath the one that everybody 

1590
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:23,891
knows.
He said,

1591
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:28,631
I went through every channel I was 
supposed to go to and I ended up with 

1592
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:32,710
officers pointing federal agents,
pointing machine guns at me as I came 

1593
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:36,521
out of the shower.
So when when the system breaks down to 

1594
01:08:36,521 --> 01:08:39,641
the point where the whistleblowers go 
through the proper channels and they 

1595
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:42,641
become the ones who get into trouble 
than you're asking for leaks and it's 

1596
01:08:42,641 --> 01:08:46,001
hard to say,
I feel sorry for you that they leaked 

1597
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:46,590
that vital information,
but if you haven't been keeping nonvital

1598
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:49,400
information from us for so long that 
might not have happened.

1599
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:54,550
And then you do get release of stuff 
that none of us thinks should be 

1600
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,550
released.
That's the terrible problem.

1601
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:58,790
It doesn't seem like leaks are not just 
inevitable now,

1602
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:03,260
but it's baked into the pie that baked 
into it.

1603
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,440
It seems like there's almost no way to 
keep stuff secret now operative at the 

1604
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:13,901
Democratic and Republican parties.
How much would you want to bake it into 

1605
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:16,841
the cake that you try to see that 
there'll be a leak against your 

1606
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:19,361
opponents before the next election?
How much does that now become a part of 

1607
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:19,610
your strategize?
Yeah,

1608
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,350
yeah,
for sure.

1609
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,650
I'll put out a little stuff that I 
hacked on the DNC kind of attitude,

1610
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:25,310
you know,
or whatever.

1611
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:27,800
I mean listen,
and if and if the Russians are,

1612
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:29,420
you know,
Vladimir Putin said that,

1613
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,040
what's the problem?
Shouldn't we just look,

1614
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,480
the American people should know this 
stuff.

1615
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:35,540
So we released this information or 
somebody releases this information,

1616
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:38,420
but if they only release information on 
one side,

1617
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,940
have they influenced the election?
Right.

1618
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,160
So you have to be careful how that works
too.

1619
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:46,430
They have the ability to sort of set the
tone of the discussion.

1620
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:51,870
Yeah.
I wonder what if they checked the 

1621
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:52,580
Republicans,
if they checked like what kinds of crazy

1622
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:55,290
shit was said when they realize that 
Donald Trump was running away with it,

1623
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:57,560
heard something that there'd been a hack
and I,

1624
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:59,450
and it was like new news,
so I'm not up to speed,

1625
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:04,451
but that there had been at the RNC to.
Did you see everybody's freaking out now

1626
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:07,340
over the fact.
And again we have to make the disclaimer

1627
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:12,390
that the Russian hackers or whomever I 
had this Russian hackers would get mad 

1628
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,910
at me when I say that.
Whomever it was that did this,

1629
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:19,260
that they've been known to alter stuff.
So you have to take it all with a grain 

1630
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:19,260
of salt,
but,

1631
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,240
but what came out,
I guess was a list,

1632
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,120
and this is from the Democratic Party's 
main list of donors,

1633
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:25,250
right?
Their internal documents which shows the

1634
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:30,251
top donors how much they gave,
and then what was given in return,

1635
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,460
Basadur ships,
director of homeland security,

1636
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,690
all that kind of stuff.

1637
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,880
Now here's the funky part that says old 
almost as the republic.

1638
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:44,510
It was called the spoil system in the 
early 18 hundreds,

1639
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:45,500
right?
I win election.

1640
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:47,150
So all my buddies get jobs,
right?

1641
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:50,060
Everybody who supported me.
So there've been asked though,

1642
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:55,061
ever since then,
the hatch act was one where they tried 

1643
01:10:55,061 --> 01:10:57,440
to limit that and both parties act like 
they don't do it anymore.

1644
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:01,490
So when it comes out that they still do,
people freak out.

1645
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,980
But here's the truth.
If the Democrats do it,

1646
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:09,250
I'm sure the Republicans do it too.
I'd love to see a list from the last 

1647
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:09,790
Republican administration who their top 
donors were.

1648
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:15,580
All you have to do is look at who the 
ambassadors were and especially the 

1649
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:15,580
ambassadors to good places,
right?

1650
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,540
Who is the ambassador to Bermuda who was
the ambassador to London?

1651
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:25,220
The UK one is always a coveted position.
How much did that guy give and because 

1652
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:28,860
it's always been the way it is.
There's a part of me that goes,

1653
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:29,730
Eh,
what are you going to do?

1654
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:34,731
But the other part of me goes,
that's the corruption you wish more 

1655
01:11:34,731 --> 01:11:35,610
Americans knew was built into the 
system.

1656
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:41,030
Right?
If you found out that the guy who's in 

1657
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,940
charge of making sure this country safe 
and the Homeland Security Department got

1658
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:44,310
the job because he gave money to get the
job,

1659
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,540
how much less safer we than if you gave 
it to the most qualified candidate.

1660
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,700
That's a very important point.
And how many people are doing it for 

1661
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,410
vanity positions just so they can say 
they are that ambassador.

1662
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:54,460
Yeah.

1663
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,210
London.
I just saw a way to reform joe,

1664
01:11:57,211 --> 01:12:02,211
so all we have to do is get some really 
rich marijuana grower to give them 

1665
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:04,530
enough money so that he becomes the 
Department of Homeland Security Director

1666
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,260
and you could get that corruption thing 
working in your favor.

1667
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,300
That's actually possible with the amount
of money that I'm making in Colorado.

1668
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,050
You never know.

1669
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,480
You would never direct your homeland 
security made all of his money growing 

1670
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,550
weed and it comes full circle.
How much have you

1671
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:23,590
paid attention to?
All the controversy about the Clinton 

1672
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:23,590
Foundation.

1673
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,170
I have a special relationship with the 
Clintons.

1674
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:32,171
You know,
I was in talk radio during that whole 

1675
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:34,130
administration and there they're 
relatively unique people as a couple and

1676
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:37,820
they're very hard to describe and I 
always try to be fair.

1677
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:38,070
You know,
I'm,

1678
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,150
I'm very into fair and seeing context,
but let's be honest.

1679
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:43,380
These are two people that,
you know,

1680
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:48,430
here's the way I look at it.
If you're Hillary Clinton and they have 

1681
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,670
been after you since before your husband
was president,

1682
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:50,570
you know,
in Arkansas,

1683
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:51,590
they were after them,
right?

1684
01:12:51,591 --> 01:12:54,950
So you know how on you they're going to 
be.

1685
01:12:55,370 --> 01:13:00,370
Wouldn't you stay so far away from any 
lines that nobody could ever come close 

1686
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:02,090
to saying you were?
But they don't.

1687
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,290
They both walk and straddle and that,
you know,

1688
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:08,630
if you talked to people in Arkansas,
they just say that's the Clintons.

1689
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:13,631
They,
they walk the straddle the line and a 

1690
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:13,631
lot of times they go in too much of one.

1691
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:17,930
And why would you do that?
We talked about this with Anthony 

1692
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:17,930
Wiener,
you and I a long time ago.

1693
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:22,870
If you know that stuff's out there,
why would you go and run for office 

1694
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,450
again?
It's the same thing with Clinton.

1695
01:13:23,451 --> 01:13:26,000
If you know you're the most watched man 
in the world,

1696
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:31,210
why on earth would you have an affair 
with a teenage intern who you know will 

1697
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:31,590
not stay quiet about it?
It,

1698
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,810
it,
it boggles the mind.

1699
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:36,830
So if you're Hillary Clinton and you've 
got everyone trying to come up with dirt

1700
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:41,831
on you,
why would you do anything that was even 

1701
01:13:41,831 --> 01:13:42,860
suspicious and yet they still walk that 
line.

1702
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,090
I don't get it.
Well,

1703
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:44,700
don't you think?
I think

1704
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,700
that first of all,
their patterns and their behavior and 

1705
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,131
their attitudes towards things were 
established in the 19 eighties when the 

1706
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:55,251
world was a much simpler place.
And you can get away with what happened 

1707
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:56,220
in Mena,
Arkansas with all that craziness,

1708
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:56,960
with,
you know,

1709
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,710
the dropping drugs out of airplanes.
And uh,

1710
01:14:01,711 --> 01:14:02,640
when,
when you know,

1711
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,880
which is all part of that narco series,
narco series,

1712
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,250
I mean,
somebody was in on it.

1713
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:12,580
I mean that guy who got shot and killed,
who is about to testify

1714
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,800
for George Bush?
What the fuck was his name?

1715
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,770
I'm convinced.
No,

1716
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:18,880
no,
no,

1717
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:19,320
no.
The,

1718
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,640
the pilot.
That was the drug pilot.

1719
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,260
I remember the story of.
Dammit.

1720
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:25,150
I can't remember the story though.
Yeah.

1721
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:30,180
So client assessment I into this,
obviously some people knew about this.

1722
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:36,061
Obviously the CIA was involved.
This guy was involved with some cowboys 

1723
01:14:36,061 --> 01:14:40,081
and the CIA.
They were bringing drugs in from what 

1724
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:40,081
they were doing that during the Iran 
contra thing in the 80.

1725
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:41,500
So it's not old news.
Yeah,

1726
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:46,530
no,
it's so somehow or another that was 

1727
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,420
standard operational procedure at least 
on some level,

1728
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:54,570
whether it's rogue,
rogue agents and the CIA or rogue people

1729
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:57,520
in the government or whoever was 
profiting on it.

1730
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,050
And that was also of course,
what was,

1731
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:04,530
what was going on in south central Los 
Angeles during the contrast in the 

1732
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,801
center versus the Sandinista.
There was a relationship that they were 

1733
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,641
making money by selling drugs in the 
ghetto and they were taking that money 

1734
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:15,511
and it was directly affecting global 
politics in a country that cared about 

1735
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:15,550
reform.

1736
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:20,910
How many of those things have to happen 
before somebody would turn around and 

1737
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:20,910
say,
okay,

1738
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:23,350
we have a big problem and we have to 
weed that problem,

1739
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:26,260
so out of the CIA or whichever agency 
you want to,

1740
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,240
you want a name so that it doesn't 
happen again.

1741
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:33,241
When that doesn't happen,
know I remember I'm looking into police 

1742
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:34,690
departments that had problems and in La 
when I was growing up,

1743
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,150
you knew which ones to avoid.
For example,

1744
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:39,340
there was one in Signal Hill and we all 
knew you don't.

1745
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:44,341
You don't want to get pulled over there.
So eventually they had to disband the 

1746
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:46,540
whole police department and start from 
scratch because every time they tried to

1747
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:51,541
reform it,
there was a culture in that little 

1748
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,030
police department that absorbed new 
members and the people that wouldn't 

1749
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:56,200
become part of the culture ended up 
transferring out or whatever.

1750
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,120
And the people that worked with the 
culture state.

1751
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,170
That's a microcosm of how all these 
giant agencies work where,

1752
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,190
how do you change the culture of 
something when you would have to get rid

1753
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:11,191
of the people who are there now who all 
bought in or they wouldn't still be 

1754
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:11,360
there.
You know,

1755
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:12,610
you were saying about the mainframe 
computer.

1756
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:14,800
If you wanted to start the CIA over 
today,

1757
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,590
would you use any of the people that are
in it now?

1758
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,690
It's hard to know because I think if you
didn't,

1759
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,940
you'd end up with an agency that 
thought,

1760
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:26,941
listen,
we're keeping America safe and if we 

1761
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:28,750
have to dose people with Lsd as happened
in the late fifties,

1762
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:32,560
early 19 sixties as a way to make sure 
that our people aren't dosed with Lsd,

1763
01:16:32,561 --> 01:16:35,470
we're going to do it.
You know the pilot was barry seal's.

1764
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:36,240
I was trying to remember it.

1765
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,290
So you're having the same problem by 
him.

1766
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,410
A little bit too many goddamn people.
Too much stuff in our brain.

1767
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:44,020
Too much data.
But the.

1768
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,080
So the Clintons in the 19 eighties,
they pretty much were able to get away 

1769
01:16:49,841 --> 01:16:52,450
with pretty much whatever they wanted.
I mean,

1770
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:54,990
they had so much immense power,
right.

1771
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,160
She's Arkansas,
governor of Arkansas.

1772
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,930
Yeah,
but he was a frequent freaks,

1773
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:03,931
right.
It was just whipping his dick out all 

1774
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:05,461
over the place.
But what's funny is not exactly a 

1775
01:17:05,461 --> 01:17:07,190
pipeline to the White House either.
So in that sense it was.

1776
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:09,190
It was a little like getting somebody 
from,

1777
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,970
you know,
Mississippi as your president.

1778
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:12,470
It's just a little different.
Well,

1779
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,340
yeah.
No,

1780
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,780
no doubt,
no doubt whatsoever,

1781
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:18,890
but this time when all this stuff was 
going on,

1782
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:24,340
established their behavior patterns 
maybe and then will mean Arkansas of 

1783
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:28,050
course is where the CIA was dropped or 
someone in the CIA,

1784
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:29,120
some rogue agent.

1785
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:34,240
I don't think it was like a systemic 
thing inside the CIA where the top of 

1786
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,841
the CIA was aware of it and condoned it 
and sanctioned in with someone was 

1787
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:38,960
bringing in drugs and they bring it in 
drugs to Arkansas.

1788
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:44,350
I don't think it's a coincidence that 
the fucking governor of Arkansas gets 

1789
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:48,671
fast track to becoming the president.
It's probably in some way related in 

1790
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,690
some some fiber,
whether it's.

1791
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:54,800
I don't think it's the most important 
aspect of his governorship,

1792
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,830
but there's some connection there.
It has to be.

1793
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:02,860
I'll tell you what though,
if you go look at Bill Clinton in the 

1794
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,261
primaries when he was basically chosen 
to be the Democratic candidate to run 

1795
01:18:05,261 --> 01:18:09,671
against the elder George Bush,
and you look at those stiffs he was up 

1796
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:10,700
against.
Yeah.

1797
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,080
It's how it always is.
I mean,

1798
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:12,980
when you look and you go,
okay,

1799
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:18,250
there's a bunch of people who I could 
never vote for 2 million years and 

1800
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:18,250
there's one person who's got some 
charisma.

1801
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,630
Right?
I don't know how it happens that way.

1802
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,980
I mean,
if somebody wanted to say,

1803
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:23,420
well,
that's the part that's rigged.

1804
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,960
Listen to the two parties who are 
private entities that can do whatever 

1805
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:28,960
they want.
Someone said to me the other day,

1806
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,380
what happens if Hillary Clinton drops 
out for health reasons?

1807
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,980
You know who,
who naturally does the job devolve to,

1808
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:37,990
and I said,
whoever the Democratic National 

1809
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:37,990
Committee wants it too,
which is really fascinating.

1810
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:42,221
When I was a registered Democrat,
they make themselves out to be like a 

1811
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:43,030
constitutional,
a pillar of ours.

1812
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:48,070
They're not.
They're a private entity that can do 

1813
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,021
what they want and they will do whatever
they want if they have to have that 

1814
01:18:50,021 --> 01:18:53,381
comes down to it.
So all the people that voted in the 

1815
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:53,900
primaries for hilary or Bernie or it 
doesn't mean anything anymore.

1816
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:57,080
So now who are you being represented by 
the king.

1817
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,310
Just choose someone.
I mean,

1818
01:18:58,311 --> 01:19:00,530
this is what you're down to.
You're down to like a monarchy.

1819
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:03,530
Well you said the funding,
you've talked about the founding fathers

1820
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,780
earlier and I'm always blown away that 
Madison,

1821
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:09,710
who's the guy who's most responsible for
writing the constitution was like 23.

1822
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,500
I was the most irresponsible,
you know,

1823
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:17,530
goof off in the world I think at 23.
So you look at those guys and you 

1824
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:21,401
realize how much they had a problem with
what they called factions there version 

1825
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:22,580
of factions is what we would call 
parties today.

1826
01:19:22,581 --> 01:19:26,000
And they thought it was poisonous and 
yet it was like a generation later.

1827
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,190
And what did they have cropping up 
factions.

1828
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,250
So it's,
it would be a really difficult thing.

1829
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:36,251
It must be an evolutionary natural thing
to normally develop in a society like 

1830
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:40,991
ours,
but if you decided that that was the 

1831
01:19:40,991 --> 01:19:43,721
poison pill,
what could you write into the founding 

1832
01:19:43,721 --> 01:19:44,150
documents that prevented that?

1833
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,500
I don't know,
but,

1834
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:50,501
but to me that's the root of so much of 
our evil in this country is we have two 

1835
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,600
parties that control a corrupt system 
and in order to fix the corrupt system,

1836
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,870
the two parties would have to be on 
board to do it.

1837
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,070
Well,
okay.

1838
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:03,071
That's,
that's actually asking what if we said 

1839
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,071
the Fox to redesign the chicken coop?
It's the Fox is interest.

1840
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,520
Well,
it's also what we were talking about,

1841
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:08,640
whether it's the CIA or the NSA,
if you're them to redesign this thing,

1842
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:10,510
you're asking relinquished some pants.
Right.

1843
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,930
And to redesign it away where they can't
get back into it.

1844
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,920
Even if they had to do it to save us.
I mean that's when it gets really wiggy.

1845
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,100
If you say,
I don't want you spying on us anymore 

1846
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,201
and the next nine slash 11 attack,
we have happened because they couldn't 

1847
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:24,201
spot on us.

1848
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:24,270
You better believe they'll point that 
out.

1849
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,670
Yeah,
and also if you had to redesign it,

1850
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:31,671
you would have to eliminate some jobs.
I mean there's no way this thing is 

1851
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:33,360
operating at 100 percent efficiency.
So if somebody really audited it,

1852
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,940
whether it's the CIA or the FBI or the 
NSA,

1853
01:20:36,941 --> 01:20:39,510
I mean do 100 percent sure they're doing
their best,

1854
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:41,490
but there's no way it's done really 
well.

1855
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:46,730
It's just the government,
the government fucks up almost 

1856
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:46,730
everything because most people don't 
want to work for the government.

1857
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,050
So who do you get?
You got a bunch of people that,

1858
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:49,590
well,
okay,

1859
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:50,880
I'll do that job.
It's like,

1860
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:56,060
is anybody clamoring to be the guy at 
the NSA that gets to read Dan Carlin's 

1861
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:56,850
email?
I think I,

1862
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,860
I think what it is,
I'm in a better way to put it as it's 

1863
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,741
the systems decline.
I mean it just deteriorates over time 

1864
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:03,741
and it's,
it's.

1865
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:06,690
Every system is remarkably hard to go 
back and fix and the government,

1866
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:09,150
especially as you know,
we've got 240 years of,

1867
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:14,210
of deadwood and you don't often go in 
there and have a spring cleaning 

1868
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:14,210
session.
You know,

1869
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,950
and I think the founding fathers were 
people who were aware,

1870
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:21,951
they used to talk about lifespans of 
countries and so you know that computer 

1871
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:26,151
analogy we use as a pretty good one.
This is an old computer that we've 

1872
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:27,450
patched many,
many times and also tasked to do many,

1873
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:31,380
many more things in the constitution 
ever envisioned because you have a great

1874
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:36,381
depression or you have a second world 
war or you have nuclear weapons appear 

1875
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:40,461
on the scene,
so all of a sudden we have a flexible 

1876
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:40,650
constitution to deal with unforseeables 
as you pointed out.

1877
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,720
Okay.
But how flexible is it?

1878
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,810
I mean at what point have you stretched 
it so far that it's become a fig leaf?

1879
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,510
I try to remind people.
We did a whole series on the decline and

1880
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:53,511
fall of the Roman republic and what a 
lot of people don't know is that when 

1881
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:55,320
the Roman Empire first appeared in for a
long time afterwards,

1882
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,980
they kept all the forms.
Senators were still elected.

1883
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,320
I mean,
you have an all powerful emperor,

1884
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:06,530
but they still went through the process 
of electing senators as though nothing 

1885
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:06,990
had changed.
They still held elections,

1886
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,230
they still had people giving money to 
senators to give them favors,

1887
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:13,860
but we had a system in Rome as if I was 
there,

1888
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:18,120
but at that point it was a total 
dictatorship,

1889
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,460
but we elected senators anyway because 
the forms had a long and noble tradition

1890
01:22:23,461 --> 01:22:26,400
that was tied to the way Roman saw 
themselves the same way.

1891
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,390
We're tied to that 19 fifties high 
school textbook of who we are.

1892
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,570
If we had a dictator someday,
they would never be able to get rid of 

1893
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:36,360
senators and because the forms are very 
important.

1894
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:41,630
Well,
that's one of the biggest fears about 

1895
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:41,630
the Patriot Act.
The Patriot Act two as well,

1896
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,160
is that if something did happen in 
martial law was declared,

1897
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:49,161
would we really have the same system 
that we think we have when we have that 

1898
01:22:49,161 --> 01:22:53,991
19 fifties textbook version of,
or would we really have a military 

1899
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:57,000
dictatorship that's disguised?
I just read a book,

1900
01:22:57,001 --> 01:23:00,300
I think it was called American coup.
You know back 20 years ago,

1901
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:03,120
people who wrote those books were 
conspiracy people who had no real.

1902
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:06,040
Now the people writing those books are 
all insiders and they have

1903
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,770
generals writing blurbs on the back and 
this guy,

1904
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,280
it's kind of a boring book because he 
talks so much about fema and Katrina and

1905
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:17,281
all these things,
but sometimes when you're diagramming 

1906
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,450
how these things happen,
it's not spy thriller type stuff.

1907
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,410
It's really sometimes run of the mill.
We had this problem.

1908
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:26,140
We had.
His point is that we've been living in a

1909
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:31,141
society that's operating between the 
lines in the constitution for 50 years 

1910
01:23:31,141 --> 01:23:36,121
now and that the government is 
absolutely petrified about all the 

1911
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:39,790
threats out there to us and in order to 
protect us.

1912
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:45,060
Things like little writings on hemp 
paper from 240 years ago are not going 

1913
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:49,441
to stand in the way of us protecting us 
from another nine slash 11 or a nuclear 

1914
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,110
bomb going off in a harbor or something 
like that.

1915
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,300
When of course,
the argument to that is like,

1916
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:54,250
of course you're going to say you're 
protecting us.

1917
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:57,730
Of course that's sometimes you are.
Sometimes you're not,

1918
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:00,970
but how convenient is that?
You are also controlling

1919
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:06,030
vast amounts of wealth,
controlling so much of the ability of 

1920
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:10,360
the United States citizens to to do 
their jobs,

1921
01:24:10,361 --> 01:24:12,130
to get through life,
to,

1922
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,340
to do anything they want to do without 
being infringed on by this group of 

1923
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:22,390
people that sort of got elected,
got elected in some sort of a weird,

1924
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:27,391
strange way in an antiquated system that
doesn't really make any sense anymore 

1925
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,290
and there's only really held accountable
up to a certain extent.

1926
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:34,650
That's one of the weirder aspects about 
real government corruption because the 

1927
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:38,140
real corruption as the legal shit like 
you're talking about the ledger,

1928
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:43,141
showing what people did,
what and what they received for those 

1929
01:24:43,141 --> 01:24:47,191
donations and how much they gave and how
much they got out of it and how they 

1930
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:50,371
became like that is how is that legal in
insider trading is illegal.

1931
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,320
How is that legal?
And Martha Quinn goes to jail,

1932
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,000
not Martha Quinn.

1933
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,830
She went,
yeah,

1934
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,770
the MTC zero j from MTV.
Martha Stewart rather goes to jail for a

1935
01:25:02,771 --> 01:25:04,720
stock trade.
You know,

1936
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:09,750
where she was not honest about the 
information that she knew about 

1937
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,090
profiting off of stocks rate.
It's,

1938
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:13,000
it's insane,
like the disparity.

1939
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,240
It's insane how much,
how much weird corruption is just 

1940
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,740
entangled into the system that the only 
way to get rid of what would have to be 

1941
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:26,350
you would have to stop all those jobs 
that are,

1942
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:31,650
that evolve around all that money coming
in and you're dealing with untold 

1943
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:35,881
millions of dollars and that it's being 
siphoned from the system by all these 

1944
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:40,351
people,
the lobbyists and all the special 

1945
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:42,961
interest groups that constantly work in 
the Washington hive to extract those 

1946
01:25:42,961 --> 01:25:43,960
people.
At this point,

1947
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,670
it's almost impossible without a total 
reset of the system.

1948
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,510
Well,
I look at how.

1949
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,450
Look at how things changed.
So for example,

1950
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:53,700
when the founding fathers set up war 
powers,

1951
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:55,680
which they understood to be the most 
important thing,

1952
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:01,340
they separated the part where we decide 
to go to war from the power of fighting 

1953
01:26:01,711 --> 01:26:03,800
the war,
and they gave the power to fight the war

1954
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:05,630
to the president.
He's the commander in chief,

1955
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:09,230
but they did not give him the power to 
decide to go to war.

1956
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,030
Right?
That's too much power for one guy.

1957
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,840
They gave that to Congress.
So Congress has the power to declare war

1958
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,080
once they do.
The president has really extreme 

1959
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,811
emergency authority to fight the war.
When Harry Truman took us into Korea in 

1960
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:27,431
1950,
he called it a police action and he 

1961
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:31,481
called it a police action because you 
don't need to declare a war to have a 

1962
01:26:31,481 --> 01:26:32,230
police action,
but he sent the united.

1963
01:26:32,231 --> 01:26:34,940
I mean we lost 50,000
guys or something in Korea.

1964
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,240
Um,
and you know,

1965
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,790
a lot more Koreans.
Um,

1966
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,040
once you do that,
we've never declared war again.

1967
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:43,070
As a matter of fact,
no president even throws that out there,

1968
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:46,280
that they would love to have a support,
a declaration of support by Congress.

1969
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,580
But once you do that,
you,

1970
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:53,650
you break an important wall,
the wall that says that the president 

1971
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:56,561
has basically unlimited powers and more 
time and now he has the right to decide 

1972
01:26:56,561 --> 01:27:00,761
when war time is okay.
That's a firewall that had been built 

1973
01:27:00,761 --> 01:27:03,230
into the system that once it's broken,
you can never repair that.

1974
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:08,231
You can never go back.
Congress has no way to repair that 

1975
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:08,480
firewall.
So now somebody said to me,

1976
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:13,481
if donald trump's elected president,
can he use a nuclear bomb against a 

1977
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:17,561
country or could he decide I'm going to 
scare the heck out of North Korea and 

1978
01:27:17,561 --> 01:27:18,140
I'm going to know drop a bomb off their 
coast?

1979
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,650
Yes,
and he can do it without asking anybody 

1980
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:24,290
and the only people that might tell him 
no.

1981
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,200
Are the military and the military starts
telling the president,

1982
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:32,201
no,
that's almost as scary as a president 

1983
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:32,201
that can drop a nuclear bomb whenever he
wants to.

1984
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:36,880
So that's in the.
In the founder's construction of the 

1985
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,580
country.
In in their mind,

1986
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:40,010
you would have had to have gone to 
Congress and say,

1987
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:42,080
can we drop a nuclear bomb on North 
Korea?

1988
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:47,081
And then Congress would have voted 
decided and then the president would 

1989
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:47,270
have been empowered to take whatever 
measures are necessary.

1990
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,520
Right?
We've that firewall is gone.

1991
01:27:49,521 --> 01:27:52,730
The president has extreme emergency 
authority in foreign policy.

1992
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,980
Now he didn't have to ask Congress for 
anything.

1993
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,400
There's only one thing congress can do.
They have the power of the purse so they

1994
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:03,401
can cut off the funds,
but can you imagine our troops say in 

1995
01:28:03,401 --> 01:28:05,600
Iraq or Afghanistan and the congress 
doesn't want them there anymore,

1996
01:28:05,601 --> 01:28:10,601
so the choice they have is to stop 
sending a meals and replacement bullets 

1997
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:11,600
and it's not going to happen.

1998
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:16,040
So those are the ways that the 
constitution gets destroyed.

1999
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:17,750
And Truman,
I mean,

2000
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,550
you look at what we mentioned earlier,
the CIA,

2001
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:24,551
the NSA,
that power truman did more damage to 

2002
01:28:24,551 --> 01:28:27,881
this country and in,
in one presidency than anyone I can 

2003
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:27,881
think of.
And,

2004
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:31,930
and,
and yet I cut him some slack because he 

2005
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:32,020
did.
The world had never existed.

2006
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:37,150
It existed in his heart.
He had a whole new challenges to deal 

2007
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:40,541
with.
It's like when Obama came into office 

2008
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,020
and promised to undo the extremes of the
previous administration,

2009
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,600
had he done that,
we could have said,

2010
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:45,740
okay,
nine slash 11 happened.

2011
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:47,750
We freaked out.
And then we fixed it,

2012
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:48,090
right?
We,

2013
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:51,140
we got our balance back.
By not doing that,

2014
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:53,930
he caught a fight it.
Now that's the rule,

2015
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:55,790
right?
When both parties agree on something,

2016
01:28:55,791 --> 01:29:00,791
it becomes the way we do things now.
So if Truman had left office and 

2017
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,130
Eisenhower had come in as a member of 
the other party and

2018
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,000
said,
Whoa,

2019
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:05,370
the CIA thing is more like an American 
Gestapo,

2020
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:06,870
we're going to get rid of it.
Boom.

2021
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,500
Truman is a blip.
But when he decides to embrace the CIA,

2022
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,240
now that's the way we do business.
So if the two parties don't sort of look

2023
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:16,440
out for each other and say,
listen,

2024
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:18,870
nine slash 11 is a one off,
strange experience,

2025
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:24,110
okay,
we understand how somebody could 

2026
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:24,180
overreact and freak out.
We'll fix it and instead say,

2027
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,920
no,
we'll keep things the way they are.

2028
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,630
Then you take it another step down.
Another firewall has been broken in.

2029
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,280
The constitution has been stretched 
again,

2030
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,520
to the point where there were big holes 
and now is there a fourth amendment 

2031
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,461
anymore really mean there's amendments 
of the constitution and people will say 

2032
01:29:40,461 --> 01:29:40,461
to me all the time,
Dan,

2033
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:45,950
you say our freedoms going away.
Tell me when we repealed in amendment 

2034
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:45,950
doesn't work that way.

2035
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:46,410
Rome didn't do that,
right?

2036
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:48,990
They kept the senators,
the forms stay,

2037
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:53,160
but the reality can be changed mightily.
Right?

2038
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:57,330
Yeah,
and it seems like once it's changed,

2039
01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:02,570
you know,
what is that old saying about a power 

2040
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:02,570
loss never recovered.
It's exactly where,

2041
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:03,960
and let's understand something,
let's,

2042
01:30:03,961 --> 01:30:06,330
let's not take the American people off 
the blame list.

2043
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,720
If another nine slash 11 happens,
they're going to go and call for the 

2044
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,480
heads of the people that voted against 
spying on,

2045
01:30:12,481 --> 01:30:14,070
you know,
I mean that's how we are.

2046
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:19,071
We're such a panicky people that were 
not willing to suck up a lot of 

2047
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:19,740
casualties if,
if that's what's required to defend some

2048
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:24,741
of this stuff.
If you're going to say you can't spy on 

2049
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:24,741
Americans,
just understand some nasty Americans are

2050
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:29,391
going to get fertilizer bombs and blow 
up stuff sometimes because they slipped 

2051
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:31,320
through that protection for you and me 
and everyone else.

2052
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,150
Yeah.
I wonder if over time,

2053
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:35,130
like going back to that battleship 
analogy,

2054
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:40,131
like that's going to be the only thing 
that clears this up is that the people 

2055
01:30:40,131 --> 01:30:43,071
that started getting elected into office
deal with the new level of transparency 

2056
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:46,230
and the people that are growing up now 
who will eventually become politicians.

2057
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:51,470
They grow up in a different world and so
their view of what's possible and not 

2058
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:55,440
possible is very different than like we 
were talking about the Clintons who kind

2059
01:30:55,450 --> 01:31:00,450
of had an open pass to kind of do a lot 
of shit that they wanted to do back in 

2060
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:06,201
the 19 eighties and the nineties and 
they're still kind of operating like 

2061
01:31:06,201 --> 01:31:10,041
when you're talking about Hillary 
Clinton and the Clintons just kind of 

2062
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,370
doing their thing and it's like if you 
look at the difference between here's.

2063
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:16,820
This is not a conspiracy theory.
If you look at the difference between 

2064
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,850
what Hillary Clinton says,
the FBI found out about her emails 

2065
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:25,490
versus what the FBI says about what they
found out about Hillary Clinton's 

2066
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:26,130
emails.

2067
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:30,120
Someone's lying and I don't think it's 
the FBI.

2068
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,450
Someone's lying.
Like her version of it is a lie.

2069
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,600
It's just not real.
Like what she's saying is not what 

2070
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,951
they're saying.
What's the assumption built into that 

2071
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:45,471
though?
The assumption is that I know that 

2072
01:31:45,471 --> 01:31:48,321
that's not the real spin that the FBI 
director put on it and the five percent 

2073
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:50,880
of Americans who read newspapers know 
that that's not the spin,

2074
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:56,270
but the majority of people that I'm 
trying to reach will simply hear what I 

2075
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,110
say and if they want to know.
And here's the thing.

2076
01:31:58,111 --> 01:31:59,830
I mean this is like a.
We all have.

2077
01:31:59,831 --> 01:31:59,980
If

2078
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,870
you want to support that candidate 
anyway,

2079
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:07,020
you're inclined to believe what they say
and disinclined to believe what the 

2080
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,501
other guy says.
This is part of the problem about the 

2081
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:12,661
binary,
lesser of two evils thing we get into 

2082
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:13,390
because Hillary Clinton is one of the 
most unpopular candidates.

2083
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,260
I mean,
I always tell,

2084
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,570
you know,
I have two daughters and they constantly

2085
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:21,571
asked me these really uncomfortable 
questions about why don't we have women 

2086
01:32:21,571 --> 01:32:21,970
presidents and all this kind of stuff.
So I'm all in favor of that.

2087
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:23,420
And I have a lot of women who say,
you know,

2088
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,270
Hillary Clinton's,
uh,

2089
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:29,430
uh,
the most qualified candidate we've ever 

2090
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:29,430
had for high offices is all just sexism.
And what I try to tell them is,

2091
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:32,770
is this really the person you want to be
the poster child though,

2092
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,590
as the first woman president?
Because I'll tell you what,

2093
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:39,280
if current trends continue,
I don't imagine Republicans are going to

2094
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:40,750
lay up on her at all,
right?

2095
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:45,750
The whole,
the entire Clinton administration was 

2096
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,750
the Republicans trying to get them for 
something.

2097
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:49,290
So imagine she gets elected.
Imagine that they continue to hound her 

2098
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:51,160
the way they do and remembering that 
they tend to walk that line,

2099
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:52,120
right?
Being the Clintons,

2100
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,840
there's going to be 90 percent of 
nothing in their travel gates at Rose 

2101
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,320
Hill law firms,
but there's going to be something they 

2102
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:01,320
find eventually they will impeach her 
for that.

2103
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,910
And if she's the first woman president 
to be impeached,

2104
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,590
how does that help you as the,
you know,

2105
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,740
if the first African American president 
had been impeached,

2106
01:33:08,741 --> 01:33:10,120
that wouldn't look very good.
Right?

2107
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,310
And I got to say President Obama,
you know,

2108
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:15,260
I don't like a lot of stuff he's done,
but from a scandal standpoint,

2109
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,560
he'd been pretty good.
You know,

2110
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,520
by if you grade these people on the 
curve,

2111
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,980
his scandal record's been pretty good.

2112
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:23,740
If you don't count accidental deaths and
drones,

2113
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,130
that's not a scandal.
That standard operating procedure.

2114
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:28,310
That is,
that's how we do.

2115
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,860
That's foreign policy baby.
That's,

2116
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,930
that's not a a bug,
that's a feature.

2117
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,960
But it seems like a scandal when people 
find out the numbers of innocent people 

2118
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,220
killed by drones and how many have.
And also the,

2119
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:42,880
the real issues with him saying that he 
was gonna support whistleblowers.

2120
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:47,910
Oh yeah.
And what they've actually done with and 

2121
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:47,910
blowers and how hard they've been on the
freedom of the press has been a very,

2122
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:53,020
very confusing time for a lot of people 
that were Obama supporters eight years 

2123
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:53,530
ago.
And thought like,

2124
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:55,300
I did that.
This was the answer.

2125
01:33:55,301 --> 01:34:00,301
Like finally we have the super 
articulate young guy who has a view of 

2126
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,100
the world that's similar to us.
You know,

2127
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,950
he said all the right things when he ran
for office.

2128
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,070
And but,
but again,

2129
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:11,071
what he had said was,
we're going to go and overturn the 

2130
01:34:11,071 --> 01:34:11,740
mistakes of the previous administration.
Had he done that,

2131
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,130
he would have reestablished a few 
firewalls that we ripped apart.

2132
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,480
It's always interesting to try to 
theorize why that didn't happen.

2133
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:21,340
People love to tell you those stories.
Oh,

2134
01:34:21,341 --> 01:34:23,890
they took him in the back room and they 
showed him the Kennedy assassination.

2135
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:26,220
Said any questions?
That's a Bill Hicks bit,

2136
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,440
but you don't know.
Part of you can say,

2137
01:34:29,441 --> 01:34:31,000
listen,
they took him in the back room and said,

2138
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:32,700
here are the threats.
We stopped last month.

2139
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:34,840
Do you really want to do what you say?
You know you don't,

2140
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:37,090
but you would love the president to at 
least say,

2141
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,360
okay,
I'm going to hold a televised press 

2142
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,431
conference now and I'm going to say,
here is what I said when I ran for 

2143
01:34:44,431 --> 01:34:45,970
president.
Here's why I can't do it right when they

2144
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,980
don't though.
Yeah,

2145
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,850
but what was going to say when they 
don't do that,

2146
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:51,340
you open up the door to what the hell's 
going on.

2147
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:56,820
He gave you this small promise and that 
small promise and maybe a healthcare 

2148
01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:00,240
reform,
but he said he was going to essentially 

2149
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,240
repair

2150
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,040
the constitution and he didn't.
So what's the story?

2151
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,570
Why?
Yeah,

2152
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:03,980
it's,
it's,

2153
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:07,560
it's just so hard to guess and he's not 
going to tell you.

2154
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,900
So it's one of those things that we're 
just gonna all have to debate about to 

2155
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:12,900
the end of time and then go home.
Angry.

2156
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,090
Well,
as everyone says,

2157
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:19,091
the what happens when you get the truly,
truly without limits candidate into 

2158
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:21,880
office without those firewalls.
Yeah.

2159
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,230
I mean it's,
it's one thing to say,

2160
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:29,240
listen to the president can drop a 
nuclear bomb on anybody wants to 

2161
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,721
legally.
It's another thing to have a president 

2162
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:31,721
who says,
you know,

2163
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:31,721
I can drop a nuclear bomb.
I'll just,

2164
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:32,450
you know,
we'll do that.

2165
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:36,170
It's also hard to understand like when 
you've seen a guy like trump,

2166
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,570
I don't want to get back to the Clinton 
Foundation before I forget,

2167
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:43,840
but while were you seeing a guy like 
trump and you listened to the people 

2168
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,981
that have actually interviewed him or 
talked to him and have conversations 

2169
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:47,981
with him?

2170
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:48,680
Like one of them was,
I forget what,

2171
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:51,530
head of military that he was discussing 
this with what he was talking about,

2172
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:53,550
the nuclear option.
You can't,

2173
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,610
we just use nuclear weapons.
That line.

2174
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:56,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2175
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,110
Do you,
you heard about that,

2176
01:35:57,111 --> 01:36:00,440
right?
And you wonder like what was the tone of

2177
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:01,580
that discussion?
You know,

2178
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,730
like,
like we're just being curious versus.

2179
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,300
Yeah,
well,

2180
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,670
or was he being silly?
You know what I mean?

2181
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:09,290
Maybe look,
he's Donald Trump,

2182
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:10,340
right?
He's a charmer.

2183
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,970
So he's this public figure.
He meets people,

2184
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:15,950
he talks to them.
He puts on this persona.

2185
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:20,951
Obviously a lot of this stuff he says in
a lot of ways he's like a comedian 

2186
01:36:20,951 --> 01:36:25,550
because he's saying so many things for 
effect and whether or not he believes it

2187
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:30,551
or not is not the point.
The point is they're going to get a big 

2188
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:30,551
impact.
He's going to kill,

2189
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:30,551
you know,
like.

2190
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:33,830
So I told the president of Mexico,
the wall just got 10 foot higher.

2191
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:36,560
He's doing stuff like that.
He's doing lines.

2192
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:37,570
Those are punchlines,
right?

2193
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:42,820
It might not be that funny,
but it's got it's a punch and he's 

2194
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:45,890
saying those in weird places,
like he's saying like it's,

2195
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:50,950
it's part of what makes him interesting 
is that he's like this weird entertainer

2196
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:53,660
that's hijack the system.
And I say interesting.

2197
01:36:53,661 --> 01:36:55,460
It's like a very generous use of the 
word.

2198
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:56,690
Um,
it's,

2199
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:01,790
it's scary.
But what interests be though we should 

2200
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:01,790
get these.
It's funny because,

2201
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:01,970
you know,
on twitter,

2202
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:07,270
some of the trump supporters,
and I don't ever want a broad brush 

2203
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:09,701
because I know a lot of people that are 
going to vote for trump that are old 

2204
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:09,701
people that are,
find people that are,

2205
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:10,110
you know,
but there's certainly a,

2206
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:15,230
an,
an edge on some of those people that 

2207
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:15,230
support them,
that,

2208
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:15,230
that,
that has certain racism,

2209
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:15,470
all kinds of things.

2210
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,360
We see them on twitter.
And so,

2211
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,620
you know,
when,

2212
01:37:18,621 --> 01:37:20,590
when one of them was talking about,
um,

2213
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,700
you know,
how Donald Trump is this,

2214
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,800
you know,
they conservative is one of the words 

2215
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:27,800
they like to use.
Now you know,

2216
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,270
all those kinds of this.
But,

2217
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:33,290
but to me,
no American who understands the United 

2218
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,630
States well would want to vote for some 
strong man.

2219
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,400
That whole attitude of wanting some 
strong man figure is unamerican is I can

2220
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:41,810
think of.
And if you go study your,

2221
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:46,940
your Roman republic history,
it was the strong men riding in on a 

2222
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,800
white horse that really signaled the 
beginning of the end.

2223
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,820
You know,
don't,

2224
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:53,280
don't anyone who wants too much power 
and promises to use it to.

2225
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,980
That's somebody to be afraid of in my 
book

2226
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,610
anyway.
No,

2227
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,000
it's definitely not a measured person.
I do not want some strong man.

2228
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,770
Well this is things that he says that 
you know,

2229
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:04,140
that he's just trying to get a reaction.
Like what,

2230
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:09,160
what did he say about Mccain as that he,
he likes people that didn't get caught.

2231
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:12,550
I know like,
what the fuck are you saying?

2232
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,830
When he was basically a guy who get five
deferments or whatever it had that's a,

2233
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,750
you know,
he'll say,

2234
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:22,800
well what else does that?
But it's also what he does.

2235
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:25,410
He says those outrageous things.
He hits those punches.

2236
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:30,411
Will someone's raping him,
you know he's got like these punchlines 

2237
01:38:30,411 --> 01:38:34,070
was up against on the primary stage with
a bunch of stiff robotic people 

2238
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:37,821
repeating talking points.
It was a little like Clinton wasn't his 

2239
01:38:37,821 --> 01:38:37,821
primary is in,
in,

2240
01:38:37,821 --> 01:38:42,100
in,
in the early nineties when when it's a 

2241
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,181
bunch of deadbeats,
stiff cardboard cutout pretend figures 

2242
01:38:44,181 --> 01:38:48,020
and one person that you don't know what 
they're going to say next and that 

2243
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,020
becomes interesting.

2244
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:51,620
But what's interesting is the 
charismatic type people that we are so 

2245
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,970
attracted to really are not what you 
want as a leader.

2246
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:59,450
You don't want that person that needs so
much attention that they polish their 

2247
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:02,841
persona to a point where they're 
incredibly influential because a lot of 

2248
01:39:02,841 --> 01:39:04,350
that persona,
a lot of that when you're seeing is it's

2249
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,870
like they're entertainers.
I mean that's what it is.

2250
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:11,871
When you're a really charismatic person,
you've figured out a way to speak in a 

2251
01:39:11,871 --> 01:39:14,490
way that people like you more and then 
you've.

2252
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:18,270
You've exercised that to the point where
it's a well honed muscle with incredible

2253
01:39:18,271 --> 01:39:21,420
endurance and you have a great 
sensitivity to how people are perceiving

2254
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:26,421
you so you know how to come across as 
noble and patriotic and brilliant and 

2255
01:39:26,421 --> 01:39:27,990
you know,
we all know that some of the things that

2256
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:30,510
people say like standard things that 
people say,

2257
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:35,511
there's some of them that you really 
shouldn't even be able to say anymore 

2258
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:38,510
because it doesn't mean anything and 
shouldn't be allowed to just hijack 

2259
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,660
those words and just use it to gain 
merit.

2260
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,660
Like God bless our troops.
I don't know what the fuck do you mean?

2261
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:45,360
What do you mean by the national anthem?
When people freak out over that,

2262
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:46,020
I always say,
listen,

2263
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:49,260
I'd be nice if we freaked out a little 
bit about what these songs and flags and

2264
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:54,261
symbols represent instead of freaking 
out over the symbol and ignoring the 

2265
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:54,261
stuff.
Exactly.

2266
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:55,590
Well,
I'll tell you when we're talking about a

2267
01:39:55,591 --> 01:40:00,591
person who's an incredible position of 
influence and they're saying these 

2268
01:40:00,591 --> 01:40:02,400
things that are kind of not like a real 
sentence.

2269
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:07,460
It's not really what you thought.
You just knew that other people have 

2270
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,130
said that it's something you say,
so you're saying it,

2271
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:10,080
but you're saying it about a very 
important thing.

2272
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:12,540
You're saying about the young people,
the children,

2273
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:17,541
of all the people that are here,
the 18 year old kids that are sent over 

2274
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:20,460
there to shoot people they've never met 
and you're saying,

2275
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:22,080
God bless those people.

2276
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:23,610
Who is.
What is God?

2277
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:26,340
Are you saying the invisible man in the 
sky with the harp?

2278
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:31,610
Is that who you're.
So you're saying God bless our kids to 

2279
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:33,600
go kill other people's kids?
Are you sure that that's how you want to

2280
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:38,601
say that?
Like you just wanted to have this open 

2281
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:41,361
statement,
God bless our troops to do I want our 

2282
01:40:41,361 --> 01:40:44,031
troops to be safe?
Of course do what do I wish that we 

2283
01:40:44,031 --> 01:40:44,031
didn't have to use them?
We didn't have to have.

2284
01:40:44,031 --> 01:40:44,960
Absolutely.
It's not a.

2285
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:48,660
not a negative in any way,
shape or form towards the military,

2286
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:51,930
but it's these expressions that leaders 
are just.

2287
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,340
They are freely to plug into.

2288
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:57,730
It's like a happy birthday to you or 
like a weird like youtube.

2289
01:40:57,790 --> 01:41:01,210
You're dealing with massive issues that 
are super,

2290
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:06,420
like not just charged,
but the consequences of being wrong or 

2291
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,460
right,
or being unsuccessful or massive to just

2292
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:11,280
gigantic.
You mentioned something I,

2293
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:13,120
I've always found very interesting,
which is,

2294
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:16,500
which is the charisma of the individual.
I had a,

2295
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,820
uh,
a poly sci professor back in college who

2296
01:41:18,821 --> 01:41:23,821
happened to be a German guy,
so he was sort of viewing our system 

2297
01:41:23,821 --> 01:41:24,120
from outside our system.
And he said,

2298
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:29,130
you know,
this is how I used to take such a 

2299
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,300
problem with you Americans,
is you have a president that combines 

2300
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,290
two jobs.
If you were a European country,

2301
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:35,590
that would be two jobs.
One is the bean counter guy,

2302
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:37,360
the one you were mentioning how you want
to be president,

2303
01:41:37,361 --> 01:41:42,361
the one that you know,
he's maybe not so great at the big 

2304
01:41:42,361 --> 01:41:44,731
speeches and you don't want that guy 
going to the funerals and representing 

2305
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:44,731
America.

2306
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:45,310
And he goes.
And then we have in Europe,

2307
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,720
chancellors or presidents that these 
people physically represent the soul.

2308
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:51,310
They go to the funerals.
So he said,

2309
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:56,400
you want John Wayne to be that guy and 
then you want some bean counter to be 

2310
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,990
the other guy,
but in your country you require both of 

2311
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:00,990
those things in the same person.
He says,

2312
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:03,670
do you know how often you get John Wayne
who is also a bean counter?

2313
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,140
He goes,
that's your problem.

2314
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:10,141
He goes,
you end up usually electing the John 

2315
01:42:10,141 --> 01:42:10,570
Wayne and wishing you had a bean 
counter.

2316
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,920
So I mean in Europe.
He said,

2317
01:42:11,921 --> 01:42:14,200
those are two separate jobs.
It's a good point.

2318
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:17,080
It's a good point.
What I was getting at by the expressions

2319
01:42:17,081 --> 01:42:22,081
is like saying things like,
God bless the troops or God bless 

2320
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:23,410
America.
Is that just the whole way of talking as

2321
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:28,411
a politician is so it's so false and so 
accepted that we know that they're going

2322
01:42:29,491 --> 01:42:34,491
to stand in front of all these people 
with this preplanned out speech that is 

2323
01:42:34,491 --> 01:42:38,731
like this weird rally,
this weird artificial strip club,

2324
01:42:39,191 --> 01:42:40,750
Dj voice that they put on.

2325
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:41,780
You know what I mean?
It's like,

2326
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,800
but this is why trump was so even to me 
attractive early on because he exposed 

2327
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,510
what happened to Rubio was a perfect 
example.

2328
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:51,790
If you remember the primary debates with
trump and rubio,

2329
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:57,420
rubio kept repeating the talking points,
so then Christy among other people said,

2330
01:42:57,521 --> 01:43:02,521
that's a talking point and you keep 
saying it and then he said it again two 

2331
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:03,490
more times.
Almost proving that this is all scripted

2332
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,010
to the fun part of Donald Trump.
Earlier on.

2333
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:08,980
Was he exposed all of that is you 
sometimes get the feeling that he didn't

2334
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:10,780
prep it all right.
I mean there was.

2335
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,190
You didn't know what he was going to 
say.

2336
01:43:12,191 --> 01:43:16,870
I loved trying to imagine the dilemma.
You know before these debates,

2337
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:19,750
they always have someone stand in for 
the other candidate.

2338
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:24,900
Who Do you get to stand in for trump if 
you're like when Hillary Clinton 

2339
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:28,081
practicing her debates who sits there 
and because I mean because you don't 

2340
01:43:28,081 --> 01:43:28,930
know median or something,
but the point is is that,

2341
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:31,110
is that that was the fun.

2342
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,800
He exposed kind of the,
the,

2343
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:36,160
the artificial Kabuki theater sort of 
way.

2344
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:41,161
This has developed and I liked that 
because I think it's good when more 

2345
01:43:41,161 --> 01:43:42,160
Americans see what it really is,
right?

2346
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,020
In other words,
most of the time you're right.

2347
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:49,050
They either get fooled by that or 
they've heard it so many times they 

2348
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:49,240
don't even pay attention.
Trump helped expose that.

2349
01:43:49,241 --> 01:43:51,260
So in that sense,
that was good for the system.

2350
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,560
Of course,
now we've gone quite a bit farther down 

2351
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,961
that road and uh,
and I don't think it is so good for the 

2352
01:43:58,961 --> 01:44:01,631
system anymore.
I do think anybody who would beat 

2353
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:01,631
Hillary Clinton almost.
I mean,

2354
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:01,631
I think,
you know,

2355
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:03,980
Democrats keeps saying to me,
if you don't vote for Hillary Clinton,

2356
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:06,500
you're going to put trump in office and 
that'll be your fault.

2357
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:11,650
And I keep saying it's not my fault.
You put Hillary Clinton up as your 

2358
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:11,650
candidate.

2359
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:11,650
I mean,
in 2008,

2360
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:15,020
we saw how unpopular she was.
She shouldn't have lost a Barack Obama.

2361
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:20,021
She was going to be correlated.
Then you realize if she hadn't had a 70 

2362
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:21,740
something year old democratic socialists
who,

2363
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:26,741
let's be honest,
does not have a ton of charisma and a 

2364
01:44:26,741 --> 01:44:26,741
guy.
Nobody's ever heard from her.

2365
01:44:26,741 --> 01:44:28,550
Only two primary challengers up on that 
stage.

2366
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:32,870
She wouldn't be here if Joe Biden and 
it's the first time I can think of that.

2367
01:44:32,871 --> 01:44:35,360
A vice president hasn't tried to run 
him.

2368
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:40,600
If Joe Biden had run,
he would be up against trump now and I 

2369
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:40,600
don't think trump would stand a chance 
to be honest,

2370
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,371
and I don't like Joe Biden,
but I just think he's a zero and right 

2371
01:44:45,371 --> 01:44:47,690
now trump is a negative running against 
Hillary who's a negative zero kicks.

2372
01:44:47,691 --> 01:44:48,420
Both their rear end.

2373
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:54,020
Yeah,
and he's also a zero who's had no 

2374
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:54,450
negative consequences of eight years in 
office,

2375
01:44:54,451 --> 01:44:59,451
really?
Which is amazing because he's known for 

2376
01:44:59,451 --> 01:44:59,451
gaffes.
Yeah,

2377
01:44:59,451 --> 01:44:59,451
he's a goofy dude.
Well,

2378
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:01,650
we used to have this thing in Boston and
stitches comedy club.

2379
01:45:01,651 --> 01:45:04,560
We'd call it Joe Biden tonight.
This was 1988 malarkey.

2380
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,170
He's an Irish guy.
Would steal other people's material.

2381
01:45:07,171 --> 01:45:09,590
That's what you would do like I feel.
Yeah,

2382
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,600
because people don't know,
but biden plagiarize Kennedy's speeches 

2383
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,100
when he was running for president and 
was a big deal.

2384
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:18,090
I recall everybody's Kinda forgot about 
that,

2385
01:45:18,091 --> 01:45:23,091
but he lived,
literally just stole giant passages out 

2386
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:23,091
of.
That's something we look back on now and

2387
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:23,360
go,
ah,

2388
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:26,310
the good old days when that was the only
thing we could slam somebody for.

2389
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:31,370
Well,
they're still doing it like didn't 

2390
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:31,370
Mellinia or how did he say?
Or she stole a.

2391
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,670
She claimed she didn't,
but it's a remarkable coincidence.

2392
01:45:32,671 --> 01:45:34,560
Well,
it's Michelle Obama's exact words,

2393
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:36,060
isn't it?
So what are the odds?

2394
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:41,360
She didn't write that shit anyway.
Somebody I wouldn't be surprised and 

2395
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:41,790
someone brought this up and it wasn't 
me,

2396
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:46,820
but someone suggested it and I think 
they're probably right that trump did it

2397
01:45:46,861 --> 01:45:51,861
on purpose and plagiarized Michelle 
Obama speech so that people would talk 

2398
01:45:51,861 --> 01:45:53,700
about it so it would give even more 
attention to his campaign.

2399
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:54,710
I love that.

2400
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Trump questions like Michael Moore of 
all people came out with a piece about 

2401
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,141
three weeks ago and he started the piece
off by saying something to the effect 

2402
01:46:04,141 --> 01:46:04,870
of,
you don't have to believe what I'm about

2403
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:09,871
to tell you,
but I will tell you that I have spoken 

2404
01:46:09,871 --> 01:46:12,781
to people who are in the know who tell 
me that trump doesn't even want this 

2405
01:46:12,781 --> 01:46:17,041
gate,
that this is something that has gotten 

2406
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:17,041
out of control,
that this was more of a,

2407
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:20,800
I'll get a TV series afterwards and then
he didn't expect you to do this,

2408
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:22,120
and I thought to myself,
okay,

2409
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:24,250
I don't know that I believe that,
but if that's true,

2410
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:26,890
this is the most unusual,
funky,

2411
01:46:26,891 --> 01:46:30,070
weird American political history story 
I've ever heard.

2412
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,210
I think it's the last gasps of a dying 
empire.

2413
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:36,510
I just don't think you can continue the 
way they've been doing it.

2414
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:41,160
I think this is showing us that there 
are no good representatives.

2415
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:42,990
There's,
there's no good candidates.

2416
01:46:42,991 --> 01:46:45,420
There's no way.
We didn't know about them.

2417
01:46:45,421 --> 01:46:47,760
If they were there,
they would know about them.

2418
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:49,080
I mean,
maybe there's some young

2419
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:53,940
that are coming up and there's some 
young congress people that are coming up

2420
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:58,970
maybe.
Well this was in Lawrence lessig spoke 

2421
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:58,970
book,
a republic loss,

2422
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:58,970
which by the way,
if anyone wants to go check out,

2423
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:01,530
he put it on the Internet for free now 
so you can read it.

2424
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:05,440
And one was the Harvard maybe.
Um,

2425
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:06,260
so,
so,

2426
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:09,450
but one of the things he said in that it
was so interesting because he showed how

2427
01:47:09,451 --> 01:47:11,580
people who are getting started,
you know,

2428
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:12,890
running for mayor,
you know,

2429
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,900
the low level things,
how the parties begin the weeding out 

2430
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,561
process.
And the first thing that they want to 

2431
01:47:21,561 --> 01:47:21,561
know is how good are you at raising 
money?

2432
01:47:21,561 --> 01:47:23,040
And this determines whether or not the 
party,

2433
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:28,041
let's this mayoral candidate put the Rod
after their name or that may oral 

2434
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:28,620
cancer.
So in other words,

2435
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:33,680
from the very beginning,
one of the main qualifications is how 

2436
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:33,680
good are you at raising money?

2437
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,790
Okay?
So fast forward to when that guy or 

2438
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:37,790
woman is up on the stage running for 
president.

2439
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:40,200
And then they have four other elected 
positions leading up to that.

2440
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:44,610
All of which require you to be a better 
fundraiser when that's one of the number

2441
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:48,150
one qualifications required for the 
parties to let you progress.

2442
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,730
Then what do you end up with at the end 
of the line?

2443
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,310
Mean what are the carrots and sticks 
that they're looking for?

2444
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:56,010
A little bit different than maybe what 
you and I as voters are looking for.

2445
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,930
That's why trump is such a weird one,
right?

2446
01:47:57,931 --> 01:48:00,120
Because he's a guy who has so much 
money.

2447
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:03,300
He funded allegedly,
allegedly.

2448
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:06,840
People like that.
He obviously has money credit.

2449
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:09,690
He got really good credit.
I mean he gets sell some of his shit and

2450
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:11,400
he would have money.
He owned some of that stuff.

2451
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:16,500
It seems like it does have a lot of 
stuff and maybe as money is wrapped up 

2452
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:16,500
in a lot of that stuff.

2453
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,190
I guess.
I don't know.

2454
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:22,260
I'd like to stop voting for 70 year old 
people and it's not an age is kind of 

2455
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,910
thing,
but as a person who just mentioned to 

2456
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:25,910
you that at 50 I'm starting to forget 
things.

2457
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:27,360
I can only imagine what I'll be like in 
20 years.

2458
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:32,390
Well,
I said that about Hillary Clinton and 

2459
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:32,390
people call me sexist.
They were like that sex.

2460
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:32,790
I'm like,
she's an old lady.

2461
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,150
Trump is.
He's an old man.

2462
01:48:36,151 --> 01:48:41,151
That's right.
If you could watch those TV shows from 

2463
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:44,751
like the 19 fifties and you see their 
portrayal of a 70 year old sitting on 

2464
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:47,260
the porch falling asleep and widdling.
That's what this is.

2465
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:50,250
Seventy may be the new 60,
but 68 grade either.

2466
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:55,520
Well,
it's definitely not the prime of your 

2467
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:55,520
cognitive abilities.
It's not the primary.

2468
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,290
This level may be good,
but your bas speed is terrible.

2469
01:48:58,410 --> 01:48:59,070
Yeah.
There you go.

2470
01:48:59,071 --> 01:49:01,170
Again,
with the bus that trump trump,

2471
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,780
I mean doesn't even have experience,
so it's even more bizarre.

2472
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:08,810
So it's not like you're dealing with 
this elderly statesman that has so much 

2473
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:12,081
knowledge and so much so much invested 
in our system of government and really 

2474
01:49:12,081 --> 01:49:14,340
believes in it so much that he wants to 
lead this country and make America great

2475
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:19,341
again.
Now you've got a super rich guy who's 

2476
01:49:19,341 --> 01:49:19,341
famous for going,
you're fired.

2477
01:49:19,341 --> 01:49:19,710
And when trump supporters say,
well,

2478
01:49:19,711 --> 01:49:22,110
he'll pick the best people.
I always want to point out,

2479
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:27,111
you know,
he's already shown some of the people 

2480
01:49:27,111 --> 01:49:28,140
that he likes and there's the same old 
group of people you had before,

2481
01:49:28,141 --> 01:49:33,141
but he's not going and picking other 
business people who've now he goes and 

2482
01:49:33,141 --> 01:49:33,540
finds this and you're going,
okay,

2483
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:38,010
it's the same group,
so I get Donald Trump presiding over the

2484
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:41,370
same old group of people who've been 
wrong about everything so far.

2485
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:46,370
I mean that's the problem is that how do
you get away from the people who are 

2486
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:49,731
consistently wrong in a merit system?
The people that should be promoted are 

2487
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:52,240
the ones who are right.
More often.

2488
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:56,610
We don't get that.
We have the same faces forever for A.

2489
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:58,600
I mean the same guys who are,
who are on,

2490
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:03,660
I always say on if CNN is going to put 
to just name one these experts to tell 

2491
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:04,580
us what this latest North Korean nuclear
missile thing,

2492
01:50:04,581 --> 01:50:09,581
these would you please put up their 
track record the way you would put up 

2493
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:11,140
the wins and loss record of a manager in
baseball.

2494
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:16,230
Do you want that manager who's who's 
four and 72 explaining to you the world 

2495
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:16,900
series strategy,
or are you going to say,

2496
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:19,840
this guy doesn't know Jack,
because if they put the records of these

2497
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:22,450
people they have on the programs,
you'd look at it and go,

2498
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,010
I'm not listening to this guy.

2499
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:26,170
He's consistently wrong.
Yeah,

2500
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,980
but once someone becomes someone that 
people recognize in that regard,

2501
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:34,510
you're an expert.
You're in the Rolodex a quote.

2502
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:35,770
That's right.
It's just.

2503
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:41,550
It's a weird time.
I think it is the weirdest time ever in 

2504
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:41,550
politics.
I don't think there's ever been anything

2505
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:42,040
weirder than this.
Well,

2506
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:47,041
let me show you what.
What bothers in independent like yours 

2507
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:49,261
truly.
If you look at the demographics of the 

2508
01:50:49,261 --> 01:50:51,900
United States,
the independence or actually the last 

2509
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,950
poll I saw were a slight majority now,
so divide the pie into three Democrats,

2510
01:50:53,951 --> 01:50:58,951
Republicans and everybody else,
which is what the independents are 

2511
01:50:58,951 --> 01:50:58,951
winning.
We're not a party.

2512
01:50:58,951 --> 01:50:59,890
We don't have a candidate we could agree
upon,

2513
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:02,560
but we're everyone else where the king 
makers in this election,

2514
01:51:02,561 --> 01:51:05,560
right?
Then you watch a TV and watch CNN or Fox

2515
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:08,770
and they have 10,000
analysts talking about politics on there

2516
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:13,860
on election night and everything else 
and half of them are democratic 

2517
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,101
operators,
operatives and half a Republican 

2518
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:17,101
operatives.

2519
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:20,580
Where the heck is anybody who could 
speak for that giant slice of the pot 

2520
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:25,260
and you would think that that common 
sense would dictate you would grab some 

2521
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:25,260
people,
right?

2522
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:30,241
What our independence thinking.
Instead they asked Democrats and 

2523
01:51:30,241 --> 01:51:30,241
Republicans and independents are 
thinking,

2524
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:32,200
and I'm not saying that because I have a
point.

2525
01:51:32,201 --> 01:51:34,940
I'm saying that because it confounds me,
get.

2526
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:40,070
It seems pretty straightforward.
It seems like if CNN or any of these 

2527
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:43,531
news networks decided to help support 
this independent idea and bring in 

2528
01:51:43,531 --> 01:51:47,170
independence and and show that that 
independence or the vast majority of the

2529
01:51:47,171 --> 01:51:52,171
voters are,
or the majority of the slight majority 

2530
01:51:52,171 --> 01:51:54,281
of majority of the voters in America.
If they showed that and promoted that 

2531
01:51:54,281 --> 01:51:54,760
idea and people that people would go,
wow,

2532
01:51:54,761 --> 01:51:58,920
I didn't know that.
Not that kind of reporting in on it like

2533
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:03,930
that.
And I think they're complicit because 

2534
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:05,890
they have relationships with the people 
that they know that where's the money,

2535
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:08,350
the money is interviewing and getting on
camera.

2536
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:11,350
The people that are the most popular 
right now and most likely to win.

2537
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:16,620
That's why one of the most amazing 
things that trump did was all that shit 

2538
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:20,641
dog.
And he did talk about Mexicans being 

2539
01:52:20,641 --> 01:52:20,641
rapists and all this nuts about the wall
and all the.

2540
01:52:20,641 --> 01:52:23,350
All the different crazy things that he 
said when he did that,

2541
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:26,290
the news was forced to cover him.
They were forced to.

2542
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:29,290
They liked it as long as we were still 
in the primary stage.

2543
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:34,320
Yeah.
They thought there's no way this guy's 

2544
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,971
gonna win.
Everybody said that there's no way this 

2545
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:35,971
guy's gonna win.
Right?

2546
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:35,971
I said that.
Yeah.

2547
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:35,971
One of the people that said,
well,

2548
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:38,710
he's now neck and neck with Hillary and 
the national polls.

2549
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:40,300
I will say this.
And,

2550
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:40,780
and,
and,

2551
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:45,900
and didn't I just say you shouldn't 
listen to people who have a bad track 

2552
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:45,900
record.
So I was wrong about that.

2553
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,010
So bear that

2554
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,550
in mind.
Oh,

2555
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,680
and one on my trump analysis on how far 
he'll go.

2556
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:50,260
So just be fair.
Um,

2557
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:55,330
but you know,
when you look at the American electoral 

2558
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:55,330
system,
like a,

2559
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:57,380
an analyst does,
they notice important states.

2560
01:52:57,381 --> 01:52:58,580
You have to win,
right?

2561
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,030
This state has to,
you know,

2562
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:03,320
as Ohio goes or as Florida,
there's certain places,

2563
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,240
and then there are other places that are
gimmes.

2564
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:08,390
This state will always go blue.
This state will always go red.

2565
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:13,630
So the battle ground are the,
are the states that are the toss ups in 

2566
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:15,620
a bunch of those states.
Hillary Clinton is leading.

2567
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:20,890
And so the attitude that the sharpies at
least have is that it doesn't matter 

2568
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:25,121
what the polls look like,
it matters how Ohio goes and it matters 

2569
01:53:25,121 --> 01:53:25,420
how Florida,
you know.

2570
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:29,180
So in other words,
those are the choke points that the real

2571
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:30,980
sharpies work from for you.

2572
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:35,980
I mean,
when Hillary Clinton decides four years 

2573
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:35,980
ago,
I'm going to run for president,

2574
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:35,980
okay,
get into Ohio now.

2575
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:40,180
Start working those places now.
And so when people talk about trump not 

2576
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:44,180
having a robust establishment or 
organization on the ground,

2577
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:49,570
this is where he's going to get killed.
They'll kill him in those states and 

2578
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:50,140
then he may,
when you know,

2579
01:53:50,141 --> 01:53:55,141
you could conceivably come up with an 
election where trump gets more actual 

2580
01:53:55,141 --> 01:53:58,391
votes,
but Clinton wins the electoral college 

2581
01:53:58,391 --> 01:54:01,421
and winds the key states and that's how 
the sharpies who do this for a living 

2582
01:54:01,421 --> 01:54:06,220
as,
as consultants and as campaign 

2583
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:06,220
strategist,
that's how they,

2584
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:09,671
when they find those places,
I think when you see her fainting at 

2585
01:54:09,671 --> 01:54:13,421
that nine slash 11 thing,
when they're trying to walk her to the 

2586
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:13,421
car and she starts bad timing on that,
huh?

2587
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:16,430
All of a sudden drudge looks like a 
nostradamus in that,

2588
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:16,790
doesn't it?

2589
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:17,660
Yeah.
Well it's,

2590
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:22,900
it's terrible to see.
It's terrible to see that she's in such 

2591
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,310
poor health that she starts just falling
down.

2592
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,250
I got to tell you though mean you know 
you,

2593
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:27,860
you could do it because you're in good 
shape.

2594
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:32,861
If I had tried to do what either one of 
those two people had done in terms of 

2595
01:54:32,861 --> 01:54:35,780
what their schedule has been like,
I would die 100 percent height and major

2596
01:54:35,781 --> 01:54:37,820
drinking problem.
I'd be drinking too much caffeine.

2597
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:39,350
I've been drinking too much alcohol.
I'd be.

2598
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,210
I'd take up smoking.
I don't know what I do,

2599
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:46,211
but I mean what we require those people 
to do with this permanent campaign that 

2600
01:54:46,211 --> 01:54:49,280
goes on forever and these are 70 year 
old people.

2601
01:54:49,281 --> 01:54:51,770
As we said.
I'm amazed they both haven't broken down

2602
01:54:51,771 --> 01:54:53,840
and if I'm trump I would look at this 
and go,

2603
01:54:53,841 --> 01:54:54,860
do I really want this?

2604
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:58,460
If this is how hard the job will be,
I could be in Hawaii.

2605
01:54:58,461 --> 01:54:59,660
I could be.
I could be.

2606
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:01,710
They do.
They all go gray.

2607
01:55:01,711 --> 01:55:03,500
What's going to happen?
Know trump is great,

2608
01:55:03,501 --> 01:55:04,120
let's be honest.
Right,

2609
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:09,280
but how much is a 70 year old guy going 
to age when he looks at how old the 

2610
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,120
presidents getting those jobs?
I think trump's going to sleep in.

2611
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,160
He's going to hire people to do all the 
dirty work.

2612
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:15,380
He was just going to just get on the 
Internet and go,

2613
01:55:15,381 --> 01:55:19,340
you're fired.
You have a youtube channel who knows,

2614
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:22,100
you know,
that is a part of you that would love to

2615
01:55:22,101 --> 01:55:24,110
just have a view of what it,
you know,

2616
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:27,050
like a Gilligan's island episode where 
you have a dream sequence.

2617
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,860
The coconut hits you on the head and you
imagine what I would,

2618
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,310
you know,
I don't want to live through it,

2619
01:55:31,311 --> 01:55:33,530
but I'd love to see it for a minute to 
see what it would look at.

2620
01:55:33,531 --> 01:55:35,180
Hillary Clinton will just be more of the
same.

2621
01:55:35,181 --> 01:55:40,181
That's the.
We're heading towards an iceberg here 

2622
01:55:40,181 --> 01:55:40,181
and she's one of the people that set the
course.

2623
01:55:40,181 --> 01:55:41,690
So that's my problem with her.
She's,

2624
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,740
she's doubling down on what always had.

2625
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,410
Whereas trump is,
is the wild card.

2626
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:48,000
I mean you just don't know.
Well,

2627
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:49,860
like you said,
there's a lot of intelligent people that

2628
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:51,330
support trump,
but man,

2629
01:55:51,331 --> 01:55:52,950
there's a lot of assholes that support 
trump.

2630
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,430
Lady that got punched in the face at a 
trump rally.

2631
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:01,460
Can you explain to me,
and I've talked about this in a couple 

2632
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:04,130
of shows.
Another thing that I'm having a bad 

2633
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:04,130
track record myself,
maybe you shouldn't listen to me at all,

2634
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:04,530
but,
but on the racism thing,

2635
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:09,740
which I don't,
I don't ever want to put a number on 

2636
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:12,231
what percentage of the trump supporters 
fall into that category that we see 

2637
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:13,370
twitter people trolling us on,
but,

2638
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:16,380
but I thought that was going the way of 
the Dodo.

2639
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:21,440
I am more surprised by that than 
anything else that the rise in overt 

2640
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,590
and,
and I don't even want to say racism,

2641
01:56:22,591 --> 01:56:24,730
but just people who look at the world 
with that,

2642
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,880
that viewpoint,
that Lens.

2643
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,720
I thought we were,
you know,

2644
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:33,830
not evolving but,
but like I thought those people were 

2645
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,830
dying out.
I thought they were like,

2646
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:36,980
right.
She bunkers and they were just going to 

2647
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:38,811
be.
And to see that recur is the biggest 

2648
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:40,560
surprise I've had in my adult lifetime.
I think when analyzing politics.

2649
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:42,360
Well,
they absolutely still exist.

2650
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:44,880
The question is have they diminished in 
numbers?

2651
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:49,970
I think they have,
but if you're just dealing with social 

2652
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:49,970
media,
there's so many voices.

2653
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:51,450
So many people have a voice.
If you're dealing.

2654
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:56,480
This is one of the ways that I've always
tried to describe how many retarded 

2655
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:00,111
people that are on the country,
and I don't mean people with down 

2656
01:57:00,111 --> 01:57:00,111
syndrome.
I'm not.

2657
01:57:00,111 --> 01:57:00,750
I'm not going to not stop using that 
word.

2658
01:57:00,751 --> 01:57:05,751
It's not a medical term.
It's doesn't mean people with the 

2659
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:05,751
disease.
It's almost fucking moron.

2660
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:06,330
Okay,
okay.

2661
01:57:06,331 --> 01:57:09,540
If there's 300 million people in this 
country,

2662
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:13,470
one out of 100 is going to be a fucking 
idiot.

2663
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,600
At least 100.
Really,

2664
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:17,970
really,
really nice.

2665
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Really Nice.
That's 3 million fucking idiots just in 

2666
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,170
this country that is a fucking gigantic.
Minneapolis size city,

2667
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:28,740
twitter,
morons,

2668
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:34,070
and tweet a lot and they could just be 
racist and sexist or just trying to get 

2669
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:36,960
a rise out of us or only have a 10 year 
old kids.

2670
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:37,830
I mean,
that's the other thing.

2671
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:39,400
Some of these are kids who think,
okay,

2672
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:42,120
that most shocking thing I can say is 
some racist term.

2673
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:47,121
I'm not supposed to say.
Of course there's all the above because 

2674
01:57:47,121 --> 01:57:48,510
young kids like I would have done when I
was 17,

2675
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:52,680
if you gave me a computer when I was 17,
but I knew I could tweet to Al Gore.

2676
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:55,890
I'd probably make the meanest fucking 
tweet.

2677
01:57:55,891 --> 01:57:57,250
I would try to be funny.
Yeah.

2678
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,860
You know,
I just think there's,

2679
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:04,130
there's so many voices out there that 
when you see racism attached to the 

2680
01:58:04,130 --> 01:58:07,881
Donald Trump campaign and you know,
like you can't really say what 

2681
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:12,351
percentage of Donald Trump supporters or
is it more of a problem in the trump 

2682
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:12,360
campaign and the hillary campaign?

2683
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:13,440
Yes.
Does the,

2684
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:16,620
he does the fact that he won't take it 
head on,

2685
01:58:16,621 --> 01:58:17,080
you know,
when they,

2686
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:22,750
I was gonna say you can see the 
reporters try to sort of frame the 

2687
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:24,300
questions so that he has to either go 
left or go right on this,

2688
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:24,930
you know,
uh,

2689
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:25,590
would you,
uh,

2690
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,230
would you denounce the KKK and David 
Duke support?

2691
01:58:28,231 --> 01:58:33,231
What did he say?
I don't know what the KKK is or 

2692
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:33,231
something like that,
but he came up with some answer that.

2693
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,770
Can you look that up?
Because I don't know.

2694
01:58:34,771 --> 01:58:35,660
I don't want to,
I don't know.

2695
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:36,810
I'm going to get 10,000
angry.

2696
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:39,300
He should go with the really easy stuff 
like slavery.

2697
01:58:39,301 --> 01:58:40,410
Good or bad,
Donald,

2698
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,340
it's

2699
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,680
just real easy stuff.
Just give me your position on that.

2700
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:46,450
Okay.
Let's work from their civil war.

2701
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,250
Good idea.
Bad idea.

2702
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:49,450
You know what?

2703
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:56,060
Oh God.
I just had this moment outside of my 

2704
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:56,740
body where I thought we're really 
talking about this stuff and you know,

2705
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:59,310
that there is,
and you know,

2706
01:58:59,311 --> 01:59:01,920
you had brought this up earlier and I 
wanted to point out we had talked about,

2707
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:03,450
uh,
people growing up,

2708
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:07,650
young people today and whether or not 
they're going to go back,

2709
01:59:07,651 --> 01:59:08,610
in other words say,
oh,

2710
01:59:08,611 --> 01:59:10,980
this is all so far beyond where we 
should go back.

2711
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:13,650
Or if they're going,
this is the new normal to them.

2712
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:17,160
To them,
they don't even remember when Dan Carlin

2713
01:59:17,161 --> 01:59:18,570
talks about the laws of the fourth 
amendment,

2714
01:59:18,571 --> 01:59:19,340
they're going,
what?

2715
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,920
You know,
I don't even remember what you were 

2716
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:24,920
saying.
You know,

2717
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:24,920
God,
that'd be crazy to let people do that or

2718
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:24,920
whatever.
I mean,

2719
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:29,691
you wonder if,
if once you haven't had a freedom for a 

2720
01:59:29,691 --> 01:59:30,680
while,
does it seem radical to go back to that?

2721
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:35,690
There was a great quote,
I use it all the time by a historian a 

2722
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:37,941
longtime ago named Charles Austin beard,
and he said to be considered a dangerous

2723
01:59:38,491 --> 01:59:41,790
radical today,
all you have to do is go around spouting

2724
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:46,791
the phrases of the founding fathers 
that'll get you on the NSA watchlist 

2725
01:59:46,791 --> 01:59:47,760
today.
What does it mean?

2726
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:48,900
You know,
if you,

2727
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,520
if you,
if you,

2728
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:52,200
if you take that out,
so smacking the mic.

2729
01:59:52,201 --> 01:59:54,180
But if you take that out and you try to 
analyze that,

2730
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:56,340
what does that say about how far we've 
come,

2731
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:01,640
you know,
revolutionaries create your country and 

2732
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:04,401
then we very quickly lose that 
revolutionary ardor and we become much 

2733
02:00:04,401 --> 02:00:05,160
more conservative,
which is natural I think.

2734
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:10,660
But you know,
we'd talked about life cycles of 

2735
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:10,660
countries.
Are we over the hill?

2736
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:15,380
I mean,
could you make a case that the United 

2737
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:15,380
States concept,
which is really a utopian one,

2738
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:15,810
this,
we can all be free.

2739
02:00:15,811 --> 02:00:20,811
We can all run the cut.
Is that something that is past its 

2740
02:00:20,811 --> 02:00:20,811
prime?
It's sell by date.

2741
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:25,930
Well I think the the corrupt amongst us 
have tried to whittle away at it like 

2742
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:30,491
you're talking about the fourth 
amendment or the second amendment or 

2743
02:00:30,491 --> 02:00:33,851
even the first amendment.
Any the amendments were you look at the 

2744
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:37,610
freedoms that people were really worried
about losing and when something like the

2745
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:42,610
Patriot Act or the Patriot Act gets 
passed and you realize that they can 

2746
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:46,241
just sorta detain you and they don't 
have to charge you with anything and 

2747
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:48,020
they can detain you indefinitely if they
just decide.

2748
02:00:48,021 --> 02:00:49,610
They don't have to present you with any 
evidence.

2749
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:54,730
They don't have to give you a trial.
They don't have to give you a court 

2750
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:54,730
date.
Like,

2751
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:54,730
well,
okay,

2752
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:57,040
well what are we operating under?
Then if you have,

2753
02:00:57,290 --> 02:01:02,290
if you can make an act like that and 
that sort of dissolves the constitution 

2754
02:01:02,841 --> 02:01:07,010
and the bill of rights for people who 
you decide are the bad guys.

2755
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:12,020
If you can just do that,
then we don't really have the protection

2756
02:01:12,021 --> 02:01:13,120
of the constitution and the bill

2757
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:19,480
were talking about earlier the 
corruption where you'd mentioned the 

2758
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:22,061
second amendment.
Why isn't the second amendment is in as 

2759
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:22,130
much trouble as the fourth,
for example,

2760
02:01:22,131 --> 02:01:23,930
an IRA?
Because there's money,

2761
02:01:23,931 --> 02:01:25,370
right?
There's some money on one.

2762
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,560
There's an industry.
That's right.

2763
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,790
That's right.
And so and listen,

2764
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:31,410
I'm okay with that.
I mean if you're gonna,

2765
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:36,430
if you're going to to to create a group 
and get a lot of money to defend an 

2766
02:01:36,711 --> 02:01:41,711
amendment to the constitution.
Even if Americans argue what the second 

2767
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:45,071
amendment means,
but I love the idea of money coming to 

2768
02:01:45,071 --> 02:01:47,300
legislators because that's what they pay
attention to to protect those rights.

2769
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:52,750
My problem is that the amendments that 
are getting shafted are the ones that 

2770
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:53,900
don't have a lot of money and often have
a lot of money on the other side.

2771
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:58,990
Yeah.
Well it's just bizarre that you could 

2772
02:01:58,990 --> 02:02:01,601
get so much done with money and that 
this is our system of government and 

2773
02:02:01,601 --> 02:02:05,141
it's slowly but surely crept its way 
into the root system of it and just 

2774
02:02:05,141 --> 02:02:07,220
entangled it and choked it down and 
natural though.

2775
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:07,670
I mean,
I think.

2776
02:02:07,671 --> 02:02:12,671
I think that that basically this is the 
way it always is and we would have had 

2777
02:02:12,671 --> 02:02:16,751
to have held it back with all of our 
force to keep it from doing it because 

2778
02:02:16,751 --> 02:02:17,550
money has a way,
doesn't it?

2779
02:02:17,551 --> 02:02:21,050
I mean we all,
we all are vulnerable.

2780
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:23,540
Once you have enough money so that you 
don't have to be vulnerable.

2781
02:02:23,541 --> 02:02:28,541
It's different,
but I mean if you are just a person 

2782
02:02:28,541 --> 02:02:28,730
struggling to get by and somebody who 
offer somebody offers you a lot of money

2783
02:02:28,731 --> 02:02:31,640
to do something,
it is a heck of a challenge to have,

2784
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,800
okay,
here are my philosophical beliefs.

2785
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:39,220
Here's food for my children or whatever.
That becomes very difficult and with 

2786
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:43,390
these legislators,
the PD is that they all want to be 

2787
02:02:43,390 --> 02:02:43,970
reelected so much that they can let the 
money sway them.

2788
02:02:43,971 --> 02:02:45,950
Though if they didn't care that much 
about the jobs,

2789
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,510
the money might not mean that much.

2790
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:49,790
That once you get elected,
if you said this is all I want,

2791
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:52,470
then you don't care what the money says.
You only care what the money.

2792
02:02:52,471 --> 02:02:57,471
He says if you want to get reelected,
which argues for term limits and all 

2793
02:02:57,471 --> 02:02:57,471
that stuff maybe.
Yeah,

2794
02:02:57,471 --> 02:02:57,800
no,
you're right.

2795
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,210
You're right.
It's just,

2796
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:04,750
boy,
it is daunting when you sit down and 

2797
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:09,371
talk about it like this.
I know I always come in here and bring 

2798
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:09,371
you down.
I'm sorry.

2799
02:03:09,371 --> 02:03:12,540
I do whatever you want to have a guest 
after me to cleanse your palate is what 

2800
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:15,291
he said about David Duke.
David Duke is a bad person who had 

2801
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:15,800
disavowed numerous occasions over the 
years.

2802
02:03:15,801 --> 02:03:17,870
Trumps had an MSL.
This is not the first time though.

2803
02:03:17,871 --> 02:03:21,590
This is after he got slammed for not 
doing enough to disavow.

2804
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,090
So in other words,
this is like the,

2805
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:24,740
the follow up question in the fall.

2806
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:26,600
So the first time he said something 
like,

2807
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:29,420
I don't want to miss quarter,
but I recall him saying something like,

2808
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:31,640
I don't know anything about the KKK or 
something like that.

2809
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:33,740
And everybody lost their minds.
But if you,

2810
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:35,360
if you said to yourself,
okay,

2811
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,600
five percent of my support is from 
people who would like a guy like David 

2812
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,870
Duke.
I'm not going to cut out five percent of

2813
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:42,710
my support.
I don't know.

2814
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:45,650
The whole thing is surreal to me a 
little bit.

2815
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:46,430
Once again,
you know,

2816
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:48,080
if I've been caught off guard by 
anything,

2817
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:52,460
I've been caught off guard by this and I
can't process it yet.

2818
02:03:52,461 --> 02:03:56,040
I don't know how to.
I don't know how to fit Donald Trump and

2819
02:03:56,090 --> 02:04:00,410
that one segment of his supporters into 
my worldview because I thought they were

2820
02:04:00,411 --> 02:04:05,411
a dying breed.
I didn't think that could be 

2821
02:04:05,411 --> 02:04:07,510
resurrected.
I talked to a guy when I was a reporter 

2822
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:11,110
during the Bosnian war and he was a 
Croat and he tried to make the case to 

2823
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,670
me and he very well might have been 
right that a lot of those people in that

2824
02:04:13,671 --> 02:04:16,970
area where they have historic problems 
with each other and always have.

2825
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:22,240
We're getting along just fine.
While economic things were okay when he 

2826
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:24,130
said we were intermarrying,
you know,

2827
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:25,970
serves could fall in love with Croats.
It was,

2828
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:27,800
it was going okay,
but he goes,

2829
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:32,480
once everything hit the fan and times 
became tough and the economics came into

2830
02:04:32,481 --> 02:04:37,481
play.
All those old feelings came back and I 

2831
02:04:37,481 --> 02:04:38,670
thought to myself,
is that something that is applicable

2832
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,670
on this racism thing?
I don't.

2833
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:45,840
I don't know,
but one could make a case that we 

2834
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,890
haven't been this unsettled in a very 
long time in this country.

2835
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:49,460
Are we seeing A.
I dunno.

2836
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:54,500
It's hard to factor how much that plays 
a role versus how much the Internet and 

2837
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:57,891
the ability for these people to speak 
out when before they would have had to 

2838
02:04:57,891 --> 02:04:58,560
be xeroxing things and leaving them on 
your car.

2839
02:04:58,561 --> 02:05:00,510
You know when you come out of the 
grocery store,

2840
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,730
did you ever get one of those things 
come into the grocery store?

2841
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:05,250
He has some racist track on your car 
window or something.

2842
02:05:05,251 --> 02:05:07,590
You never got to raise this one,
but I've got ones for carwashes.

2843
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:10,250
What about the tony allow you ever get 
the one that Tony Alamo ones.

2844
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:11,780
He was famous.
He Tonio Lama.

2845
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
He ran his own religious thing.
Here is something that you used to have 

2846
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:17,000
people twice a week.

2847
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,750
I'd have that on my car,
but in the old days that's how somebody 

2848
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:22,170
had to do it.
Now they have a broad class platform.

2849
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:27,180
Are we just hearing from these people 
more because they can speak to more 

2850
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:27,570
people while they also can find 
likeminded group.

2851
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:32,571
That's true.
I mean you couldn't find that many 

2852
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:35,211
likeminded groups.
If you lived in a neighborhood full of 

2853
02:05:35,211 --> 02:05:35,550
progressive people and you were like a 
really conservative person,

2854
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:37,200
it'd be really kind of difficult for you
to.

2855
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:42,230
True.
You'd have to seek these people out and 

2856
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:42,690
now it's with a couple clicks of the 
mouse and all of a sudden,

2857
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:47,691
boom,
you're on some website or a bunch of 

2858
02:05:47,691 --> 02:05:47,691
people who agree with you and wind each 
other up.

2859
02:05:47,691 --> 02:05:48,720
Everybody winds up,
by the way,

2860
02:05:48,721 --> 02:05:50,860
let's not pick sides.
That happens on all sides.

2861
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:52,990
Get to go to the daily coast and places 
like this.

2862
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,950
Hey,
wind people up and they also.

2863
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:59,540
They're apologists and they're not 
honest about the faults of their.

2864
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,880
Like there was this thing about Hillary,
about,

2865
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:07,910
like I said,
it was people were talking about how 

2866
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:09,090
it's sexist that people are commenting 
on her health and that if it was a,

2867
02:06:09,091 --> 02:06:14,091
a man that was running for president who
got week during nine slash 11 during,

2868
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:19,250
you know,
after some sort of a service for the 

2869
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:19,250
fallen troops that that would be totally
acceptable.

2870
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:24,231
Like that's not true.
No history shows it because people 

2871
02:06:24,231 --> 02:06:24,231
forget that they,
uh,

2872
02:06:24,231 --> 02:06:28,940
George mcgovern had to drop his vice 
presidential candidate because the guy 

2873
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:33,240
who had been released that he had 
visited a psychiatrist for some shock 

2874
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:33,450
shock therapy.
That's right.

2875
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:38,930
Yeah.
He had on more than one occasion had 

2876
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:38,930
electroshock therapy,
right?

2877
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,200
Because he was a fucking loon and he's 
not.

2878
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:42,000
Well,
maybe he wasn't Joe Rogan.

2879
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,770
Maybe you're just playing into the 
propaganda,

2880
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:49,130
get shocked to fix your brain.
And then a couple of years later 

2881
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:53,340
running,
there's only one way to find out that's 

2882
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:53,340
true.
I mean,

2883
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:53,980
maybe getting shocked is awesome.
You know what?

2884
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:57,390
Maybe the shark color was in the,
in the hands of voters,

2885
02:06:57,391 --> 02:06:58,890
we can get something done in this 
country.

2886
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:01,590
One more time.
The president makes a wrong move.

2887
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:03,480
Dick Cheney,
I'd love to have a shock button.

2888
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:06,230
There's a couple of people.
John Bolton,

2889
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,820
I'd love a shock,
but I think a lot of the people that are

2890
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:13,821
really excited about hillary becoming 
president are excited because it would 

2891
02:07:13,821 --> 02:07:14,400
be a first,
first time a woman.

2892
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,440
I would like that aspect of it myself.
Yeah,

2893
02:07:16,441 --> 02:07:19,440
and it would make a.
is make us feel like we're progressing,

2894
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:23,820
that we can find the best candidate in 
that regardless of sex.

2895
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:26,880
The real question isn't that the real 
question is,

2896
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:28,770
is that the best we can do?

2897
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:31,140
Because if that's the best woman we've 
got,

2898
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:33,600
that's crazy.
That doesn't make any sense.

2899
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:38,990
She's the most qualified.
She's also under to criminal 

2900
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:41,770
investigation simultaneously.
She's also like,

2901
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:44,380
I'm not a conspiracy theorist for the 
most part,

2902
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:47,410
but how many people have died that have 
crossed them?

2903
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,270
I don't go there.
Have you ever seen it?

2904
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:50,680
Yeah.
What's the number?

2905
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,870
I don't know,
but I'll tell you.

2906
02:07:51,871 --> 02:07:53,380
I'll tell you this.
Here's where I go.

2907
02:07:53,381 --> 02:07:58,381
I go to a much more concrete place,
which is look at who she's speaking to 

2908
02:07:58,381 --> 02:07:59,830
and look at who she's raising money from
and look at what they released,

2909
02:07:59,831 --> 02:08:01,690
the transcripts and those banks.
Oh,

2910
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:03,640
see.
And to me that she shouldn't have,

2911
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:05,190
she shouldn't have a choice in that.
Right?

2912
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:06,520
How is it possible?
She does,

2913
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:09,190
but because she keeps it a secret,
what does that encourage?

2914
02:08:09,191 --> 02:08:11,980
Joe Rogan leaks,
right hand hackings.

2915
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:16,000
And so if you didn't keep that a secret,
you could legitimately say,

2916
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:17,440
listen,
there are certain things that the public

2917
02:08:17,441 --> 02:08:20,500
should know when you keep things from 
the public that they should know.

2918
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,040
A lot of the public goes,
well,

2919
02:08:22,041 --> 02:08:23,480
the heck with that.
That ought to be elite.

2920
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:26,530
You know,
it's almost like the trying to hold back

2921
02:08:26,531 --> 02:08:30,310
as many leaks as possible before 
November just until it's too late.

2922
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:33,340
Exactly.
We've got to hold it back once she's in.

2923
02:08:33,341 --> 02:08:36,490
She's in.
But there's so many leaks now.

2924
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:39,100
It's just,
it's getting so strange.

2925
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:44,130
When I quoted in the last program I did,
I think it was a Dana milbank column.

2926
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:49,190
Um,
he had talked about one of the recent 

2927
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:49,190
links that say,
okay,

2928
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:51,370
don't get hassled by Russian hackers all
the time,

2929
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,620
or people that are mad that I could talk
about Russian hackers or what,

2930
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,120
sorry dudes,
I know so,

2931
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:55,550
so,
but,

2932
02:08:55,551 --> 02:09:00,551
but,
but milbank had said that these people 

2933
02:09:00,551 --> 02:09:02,230
had had hacked the records and then 
release them,

2934
02:09:02,231 --> 02:09:07,231
but they also had altered something and 
then released that version two and so 

2935
02:09:07,231 --> 02:09:11,581
they trip themselves up so that you 
could compare these are the documents 

2936
02:09:11,581 --> 02:09:11,581
they hacked.

2937
02:09:11,581 --> 02:09:15,480
Then these are the ones that they 
released to the public and they had 

2938
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:15,480
altered something.
And I said,

2939
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:16,630
everyone,
when they found that story out,

2940
02:09:16,631 --> 02:09:20,170
breathe a sigh of relief because now you
have an out and you see it already.

2941
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:21,770
The DNC is going well,
listen,

2942
02:09:21,771 --> 02:09:23,560
Russian hackers are known to alter this 
stuff.

2943
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:28,710
So the minute that came out,
it was the greatest boon to all the 

2944
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:31,681
politicians in the world because they 
can say whatever that says is probably 

2945
02:09:31,681 --> 02:09:31,750
altered.
You know,

2946
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:32,430
so it,
it's,

2947
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:35,010
it's the wonderful get out of jail free 
card on the.

2948
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,380
Well that is true,
but it's legitimate to.

2949
02:09:38,381 --> 02:09:41,260
Because if they really did that well,
that is a get out of jail free card.

2950
02:09:41,261 --> 02:09:43,660
So now the hacking is just muddied the 
waters even more.

2951
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:46,510
It certainly has.
I mean I would actually probably support

2952
02:09:46,511 --> 02:09:49,600
a hack if I was running for president in
that in that sense,

2953
02:09:49,601 --> 02:09:51,130
because you could say,
look,

2954
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:56,160
you're not going to trust evidence that 
came from someone who got it through 

2955
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,040
illegal means and they are doing it.

2956
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:02,640
Why would we trust that the hackers 
would be the only ones who wouldn't 

2957
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:03,970
distort the emails?
What do you got here?

2958
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:07,300
Column.
Did you confirms leaked emails?

2959
02:10:07,301 --> 02:10:12,301
Are you see what he said in his emails?
Oh my Quinton's out Dick and girls.

2960
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:16,750
He also talked about Hillary Clinton and
Hubris and all those kinds of things,

2961
02:10:16,751 --> 02:10:17,440
which,
you know,

2962
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:20,170
I mean I think.
I think that's the impression she gives.

2963
02:10:20,171 --> 02:10:23,110
So it's interesting to hear that people 
who know and liker feel a little of that

2964
02:10:23,111 --> 02:10:26,110
too is also very suspicious.
But she has already said,

2965
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:30,610
we have this phrase,
I would rather not have to vote for her.

2966
02:10:30,611 --> 02:10:34,250
Although she is a friend.
I respect a seven year old person with a

2967
02:10:34,251 --> 02:10:37,190
long track record,
unbridled ambition,

2968
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:38,690
greedy,
non,

2969
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:42,800
not transformational with a husband 
still dicking Bimbos at home.

2970
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,610
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

2971
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:49,100
First of all,
how dare he use the term Bimbos?

2972
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:52,700
I am triggered.
You're not supposed to use that term.

2973
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:55,200
That's a derogatory term towards.
Never come out though.

2974
02:10:55,201 --> 02:10:57,710
So he's coming for a guys had retard 40 
minutes ago.

2975
02:10:57,770 --> 02:11:00,020
Oh boy.
But that's what I'm saying.

2976
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,240
I'm going to get some blowback from this
Joe Rogan.

2977
02:11:02,241 --> 02:11:03,340
You know that for real?
Yeah.

2978
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,930
Stop hanging out with.
I know it's probably bad for you.

2979
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:07,730
I know it is bad for me.
Nah.

2980
02:11:09,230 --> 02:11:14,230
How can a guy like Colin Powell or even 
Hillary Clinton have all of this stuff 

2981
02:11:14,230 --> 02:11:18,371
written in emails?
Like are they that out of touch that 

2982
02:11:18,371 --> 02:11:19,640
this stuff is being tracked or like they
should know that it's being tracked.

2983
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:24,790
I think they felt like they could get 
away with a lot more than they can get 

2984
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:27,551
away with and I think again,
we're talking about people who grew up 

2985
02:11:27,551 --> 02:11:30,461
and started behaving a certain way way 
before there was this level of 

2986
02:11:30,461 --> 02:11:30,470
transparency.

2987
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:31,880
You're thinking they should behave 
differently.

2988
02:11:31,881 --> 02:11:36,881
That's not how these people are.
They're thinking now how can I not use 

2989
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:39,761
that email problem again?
They change you behavior change the 

2990
02:11:39,761 --> 02:11:40,010
behavior they want to change is using 
email.

2991
02:11:40,011 --> 02:11:45,011
That's the behavior.
They're just thinking that they sort of 

2992
02:11:45,011 --> 02:11:47,381
adapted to the times.
That was the political landscape back 

2993
02:11:47,381 --> 02:11:48,020
then.
I think the political landscape today is

2994
02:11:48,021 --> 02:11:53,021
just way different.
You have to literally literally thank 

2995
02:11:53,021 --> 02:11:53,430
everybody is watching everything you 
say.

2996
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:57,110
We talked about Clinton and and and,
and women Kennedy.

2997
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:59,630
The press knew that Kennedy was doing 
all that stuff,

2998
02:11:59,631 --> 02:12:04,631
but there was an unwritten gentleman's 
agreement that you didn't talk about 

2999
02:12:04,631 --> 02:12:04,631
that kind of stuff.
Nevermind.

3000
02:12:04,631 --> 02:12:06,540
That he might've been having sex with,
with Sam Giancana,

3001
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,960
his girlfriend,
judith exner at the same time,

3002
02:12:08,961 --> 02:12:12,590
and that there might be some problems 
with that nowadays.

3003
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:13,730
I mean,
that's why to me,

3004
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:18,900
you know,
people say Bill Clinton was just 

3005
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,440
impeached over sex in my mind,
anybody who's either dumb enough or 

3006
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,490
whatever name you want to put in there 
that he thinks he can get away with,

3007
02:12:22,491 --> 02:12:24,680
that is somebody I don't want with the 
hand on the nuclear button.

3008
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:25,250
I mean,
come on.

3009
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:27,290
Anybody with half a brain knows.
I mean,

3010
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:32,291
Joe,
if you wanted to get away with 

3011
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:32,291
something,
which you pull that one,

3012
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:32,291
I mean,
come on.

3013
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:34,730
There's no way he was 100 percent going 
to get caught and did it anyway.

3014
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:36,770
That's not good judgment.
Well,

3015
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:40,520
that kind of guy who becomes president 
is usually a deck.

3016
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:45,521
Sullinger no domestic George.
I don't think the elder George Bush 

3017
02:12:45,521 --> 02:12:46,650
falls into that category and maybe he 
not prudent.

3018
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:48,740
Maybe.
Maybe he didn't explain,

3019
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:51,110
but maybe he did.
Maybe that explained his wife.

3020
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,060
Like she's just hanging out and he was 
like,

3021
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,100
Hey,
I'm going to go dixon.

3022
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:59,110
He was a fighter pilot.
I never knew a fighter pilot who wasn't 

3023
02:12:59,110 --> 02:12:59,110
a little bit,
you know,

3024
02:12:59,110 --> 02:12:59,110
get around.
Yeah,

3025
02:12:59,110 --> 02:13:00,020
they're savages.
Savage.

3026
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:02,690
You want them that way,
but living on the edge,

3027
02:13:02,691 --> 02:13:05,150
but those are going to get all the 
fighter pilots right in me.

3028
02:13:05,151 --> 02:13:10,151
See,
I mean this is a terrible show for good 

3029
02:13:10,151 --> 02:13:10,151
men.
Those fighter pilots,

3030
02:13:10,151 --> 02:13:12,740
they're great men.
There was a high incidence of swinger 

3031
02:13:12,740 --> 02:13:12,800
behavior.
Was that,

3032
02:13:12,830 --> 02:13:16,520
was that the fifties and sixties or was 
that the fighter pilot who was a um,

3033
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:18,200
there was a study done.
No,

3034
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:23,440
it was a conversation between this guy 
and a fighter pilots about the high 

3035
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,430
incidences of swingers and one of the 
things that I think they were saying,

3036
02:13:25,431 --> 02:13:30,431
I forget where I read this,
but there were saying that what was 

3037
02:13:30,431 --> 02:13:31,980
going on was that these guys were in 
such

3038
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
an intense job where there's a high 
likelihood of them dying and one of the 

3039
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:41,661
ways to ensure that their loved one 
would be looked after is if someone 

3040
02:13:41,661 --> 02:13:46,101
loved them as much as they loved them.
So they would literally be in these 

3041
02:13:46,101 --> 02:13:48,930
fighter runs with these planes flying 
into hostile territory.

3042
02:13:48,931 --> 02:13:52,050
Getting shot at thinking any day could 
be my last day.

3043
02:13:52,051 --> 02:13:56,820
So this desperation of like you're 
leaving behind a wife and a family.

3044
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,540
And they one way they alleviated that 
this was the,

3045
02:14:00,620 --> 02:14:05,070
the idea was that they would wife swap 
and that it happened naturally.

3046
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:06,900
You know who it was.
I think it was Chris Ryan.

3047
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,220
I think it was Chris Ryan there was 
explaining this light.

3048
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:10,260
Chris Ryan.
Yeah.

3049
02:14:10,810 --> 02:14:12,810
I'm pretty sure it was him.
I'm now.

3050
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:14,820
I'm now.
I'm like reasonably sure.

3051
02:14:15,150 --> 02:14:20,150
But that kind of makes sense because 
when you're someone who's every day 

3052
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:25,890
world is life and death on a level that 
a fighter pilot is.

3053
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:30,890
I mean that is that.
See the risk taker thing where you said 

3054
02:14:30,890 --> 02:14:32,300
these are people who live on the edge 
because that's there when you.

3055
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:34,380
You fly those planes,
you're a risk taker.

3056
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:35,950
If you wanted to say,
okay,

3057
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:38,340
a person who is willing to do risky 
behavior here.

3058
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:40,310
I'm not thinking of the wife swapping as
much as,

3059
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:42,900
as having a lot of girlfriends that 
aren't even a wife,

3060
02:14:42,901 --> 02:14:44,190
but,
but at the same time,

3061
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:45,570
listen,
like you said,

3062
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:49,110
some of those personality traits are 
probably what you want in those guys.

3063
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:49,710
Yeah.
Well,

3064
02:14:49,711 --> 02:14:53,400
I think with the way Chris was 
explaining it to was that their bond and

3065
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:58,400
their comradery between each other was 
so powerful that it's sort of a,

3066
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:02,250
it's sort of the clips,
jealousy in a way,

3067
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:07,560
you know,
because they counted on each other so 

3068
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:09,060
much and they were brothers in war and 
literally life or death struggle.

3069
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:14,180
So there a bond and a comradery that 
sort of superseded everything and that 

3070
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:19,640
the idea of like they could swap wives 
and they just love each other more.

3071
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:25,610
It's kind of crazy.
So I go with the outcomes rather that 

3072
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:25,610
they're more like pro athletes and 
they're just,

3073
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:27,720
they're just wall or,
or just there.

3074
02:15:27,721 --> 02:15:29,970
There's this swagger you'd mentioned.
The swagger,

3075
02:15:29,971 --> 02:15:31,110
right?
It's all part of the,

3076
02:15:31,111 --> 02:15:36,111
of what kind of keeps them.
The kind of guys that can be fighter 

3077
02:15:36,111 --> 02:15:36,111
pilots,
you know,

3078
02:15:36,111 --> 02:15:38,930
maybe it'll come with the territory.
Maybe it's a bunch of those things too,

3079
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:40,940
you know,
let's be honest,

3080
02:15:40,941 --> 02:15:42,560
there were fighter pilots who never did 
anything like that.

3081
02:15:42,561 --> 02:15:45,090
Absolutely.
Given the get out of jail free pass,

3082
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:48,600
that's my Dan Carlin get in the car 
listening to his podcast.

3083
02:15:48,601 --> 02:15:51,540
He's guys are assholes,
assholes.

3084
02:15:51,541 --> 02:15:55,750
Why do you listen?
Fighter pilots are swingers youth pizza.

3085
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:56,970
You know,
what just happened?

3086
02:15:56,971 --> 02:15:59,730
A bunch of wives turned to their x 
fighter pilot husbands and says,

3087
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:00,930
honey,
that didn't involve you.

3088
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:05,931
Did it wife swap in a new reality show,
wife swap and fighter wife swap and 

3089
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,880
fighter pilots,
you know,

3090
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:11,880
for those who have not seen all of the 
appearances I've had on this.

3091
02:16:11,890 --> 02:16:13,200
Joe started off,
you know,

3092
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,290
breaking me into being on the Joe Rogan 
podcast with some,

3093
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:16,820
some,
uh,

3094
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:21,910
some comments initially.
So now I just flow with it and it's 

3095
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:23,080
gonna get me killed eventually,
but it's not gonna do anything mad.

3096
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:25,620
It's a conversation with this.
This is just like,

3097
02:16:25,621 --> 02:16:28,320
if you and I went out to dinner in 
between bites of food,

3098
02:16:28,321 --> 02:16:30,500
we would have probably the same 
conversations about stuff.

3099
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:31,870
Funny.
What,

3100
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:37,110
what do you like when you see what the 
reports are about the Clinton 

3101
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:41,281
Foundation?
I don't totally understand what's legal 

3102
02:16:41,281 --> 02:16:44,791
and what's not legal,
but I don't think I've seen anyone said 

3103
02:16:44,791 --> 02:16:46,240
that anything they've done is illegal.
Right?

3104
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:50,890
It skirts.
Yeah.

3105
02:16:50,930 --> 02:16:53,750
It falls into that category.
The same category that,

3106
02:16:54,110 --> 02:16:59,110
um,
maybe the giving of ambassadorships to 

3107
02:16:59,110 --> 02:16:59,570
people who give money fall into the,
for example,

3108
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:04,810
the clinic.
There's no question that the Clinton 

3109
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:04,810
Foundation goes and does good work.
There's no question,

3110
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:08,030
but how much does the fact that they do 
good work and that your name is attached

3111
02:17:08,031 --> 02:17:13,031
to it ended up being something that 
helps you for less charitable reasons,

3112
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:13,940
right?
In other words,

3113
02:17:13,941 --> 02:17:18,941
it makes you look good as a candidate to
be somebody that you know,

3114
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:22,130
helps vaccine people against polio.
Right?

3115
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:25,340
So all of that right there has a 
subsidiary effect that you could,

3116
02:17:25,341 --> 02:17:26,690
if you wanted to say,
oh,

3117
02:17:26,691 --> 02:17:28,940
you're,
you're benefiting from this will now add

3118
02:17:29,270 --> 02:17:33,230
the fact that you know,
people can give money to the foundation.

3119
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:36,680
Then the foundation can pay Bill Clinton
to run the mean.

3120
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:41,770
It becomes.
And then if you gave money to the 

3121
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:43,811
foundation,
does that mean you get special 

3122
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:43,811
treatment?

3123
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:43,811
I can hear the Hillary Clinton 
supporters saying,

3124
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:43,811
well,
that didn't happen,

3125
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:48,040
but it's the reason that people put 
stuff in a blind trust when they become 

3126
02:17:48,111 --> 02:17:51,440
president so that you don't even know 
what your money's doing.

3127
02:17:51,441 --> 02:17:55,320
So that you can't possibly be favoritism
toward one and,

3128
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:58,790
and the Clintons have basically made it 
sound like they're not going to do that.

3129
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,250
And once again,
as I said to you earlier,

3130
02:18:01,251 --> 02:18:04,250
if you know they're after you,
like thereafter the Clintons,

3131
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:09,400
wouldn't,
you just get leave as much room between 

3132
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,400
you and any potential width of scandal 
as you could,

3133
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:13,490
but they don't.
I don't know why they don't,

3134
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:16,670
but they don't Ken,
that maybe they can't

3135
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:18,740
at this point,
you know,

3136
02:18:19,370 --> 02:18:23,180
how could they,
they probably are so and all those other

3137
02:18:23,181 --> 02:18:26,570
people that have been a part of all that
stuff for so long.

3138
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:27,500
Well,
and you know,

3139
02:18:27,501 --> 02:18:32,501
you've done this and I've done this,
we both been around some of these high 

3140
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:34,961
rollers before where you realize how 
much they pick up the phone and talk to 

3141
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:35,870
other high rollers and how 
interconnected network is.

3142
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:38,420
And there's nothing wrong with that 
intrinsically,

3143
02:18:38,421 --> 02:18:43,421
but you could easily see that that 
networking can be used for nefarious 

3144
02:18:43,731 --> 02:18:45,560
purposes,
good purposes or no purposes,

3145
02:18:45,561 --> 02:18:47,780
but they all have each other on speed 
dial.

3146
02:18:47,810 --> 02:18:49,490
Right?
That's natural.

3147
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:50,760
Yeah.
It does seem natural.

3148
02:18:50,761 --> 02:18:52,240
I mean,
podcasts of have,

3149
02:18:52,410 --> 02:18:57,410
we do have that is a little known fact 
is you and I to podcasters who learned 

3150
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:03,500
about each other,
the moonlight on you sometimes just 

3151
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:03,500
moonlight on you as well,
sir.

3152
02:19:05,430 --> 02:19:10,430
Yeah,
I mean people in the same business talk 

3153
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:10,430
to each other and become tight and it 
affect like,

3154
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:11,430
you know,
it affects,

3155
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:13,500
it affects the way they do business for 
sure.

3156
02:19:13,501 --> 02:19:18,501
And it doesn't even necessarily have to 
be like some that really carefully 

3157
02:19:18,541 --> 02:19:22,770
scripted agreement is almost like a 
known thing.

3158
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:27,860
Exactly right.
I think and you know what and and in 

3159
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:27,860
the,
in the era of hacks and all that,

3160
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,160
isn't that the

3161
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:30,280
smarter way to comport yourself,
right.

3162
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,920
Nixon,
because he was a taper,

3163
02:19:32,930 --> 02:19:35,510
knew when he had to have an important 
discussion with somebody.

3164
02:19:35,511 --> 02:19:38,420
He wanted to make sure it was safe.
They went for a walk,

3165
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:43,780
right?
And they went for a walk past the White 

3166
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,090
House.
They got in the weeds out there and then

3167
02:19:44,091 --> 02:19:46,890
they had the discussion and then they 
use the n word or whatever,

3168
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,550
whatever it might be,
but the point clear.

3169
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:54,560
That's right,
but think about this in 10 years,

3170
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:59,740
in 10 years,
how is this email hack scandal have 

3171
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:01,760
going to change a protocol on how all 
these people do things?

3172
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:06,780
Because it is,
you watch Colin Powell and everybody 

3173
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:09,911
watching what's unfolding right now are 
determining that there are going to be 

3174
02:20:09,911 --> 02:20:10,580
new ways we communicate and it's not 
going to be like that.

3175
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,020
Well,
there's two different hacks,

3176
02:20:12,021 --> 02:20:17,021
right?
There's the DNC hack and then there's a 

3177
02:20:17,021 --> 02:20:17,021
hillary server hack,
right?

3178
02:20:17,021 --> 02:20:18,350
Aren't they different hacks?
Because the DNC,

3179
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:19,550
ar,
and then there'll be.

3180
02:20:19,551 --> 02:20:20,690
And from what I heard,
I told you,

3181
02:20:20,691 --> 02:20:23,210
I heard there was a republican national 
committee hack too.

3182
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:26,240
I love the fact that they fired that 
woman.

3183
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:27,140
Oh,
did you found something?

3184
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:29,420
It's not sure.
I'm the guy that said it,

3185
02:20:29,421 --> 02:20:31,160
said he misspoke.
Oh,

3186
02:20:31,330 --> 02:20:36,330
that came out later.
Mr Scott makes me more suspicious than 

3187
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:36,330
anything.
God Damn.

3188
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:39,050
Ms Dot Booker's.
I just think it's hilarious that,

3189
02:20:39,051 --> 02:20:43,670
uh,
the woman who got outed in the DNC hacks

3190
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:48,880
as being this woman who is conspiring to
like put down Bernie and help Hillary,

3191
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,910
like that woman,
she had a step down.

3192
02:20:52,911 --> 02:20:54,890
It was immediately hired by the Clinton 
campaign.

3193
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:57,260
I mean,
there's zero transparency.

3194
02:20:57,261 --> 02:20:58,760
I mean,
it's so obvious.

3195
02:20:58,761 --> 02:21:00,150
Corruption,
let's call it what it.

3196
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:05,290
And the corruption is both parties and 
we have no options besides the bulk 

3197
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:05,570
part.
So this is where,

3198
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:10,680
you know,
like we said on the common sense tool 

3199
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:10,680
for 11 years now,
this is your focal point of the problem.

3200
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,160
We have a corruption problem.
Both parties benefit from it.

3201
02:21:13,161 --> 02:21:15,230
They have no real interest in addressing
it.

3202
02:21:15,231 --> 02:21:20,231
The only time they're interested in 
fighting corruption is that they can 

3203
02:21:20,231 --> 02:21:22,931
manage to fight the kind of corruption 
that helps the other side without 

3204
02:21:22,931 --> 02:21:26,000
impacting the ones that help them.
So the Republicans always say that about

3205
02:21:26,001 --> 02:21:31,001
democratic campaign finance reform,
that it goes after Republican funders 

3206
02:21:31,001 --> 02:21:31,700
but not democratic ones.
In other words,

3207
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:33,320
they're not,
they're not holier than thou,

3208
02:21:33,321 --> 02:21:36,380
they're just trying to figure out 
another way to game the system,

3209
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:39,630
utilizing reform as the tool.
I mean,

3210
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:44,700
they have to do in some way.
They're all complicit in similar sorts 

3211
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:44,700
of situations,
but the,

3212
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:48,320
the thing that was so weird,
I think I said not transparent,

3213
02:21:48,321 --> 02:21:53,321
all I met completely transparent.
The thing that was weird about how 

3214
02:21:53,321 --> 02:21:55,280
transparent it was is that there wasn't 
even a gap in time of this woman getting

3215
02:21:55,281 --> 02:21:57,650
fired and then getting an appearance 
purposes.

3216
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:59,540
Right.
It was like instantaneous.

3217
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:00,980
It's like we don't care.
We're just going to do it.

3218
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,470
I,
yeah,

3219
02:22:01,471 --> 02:22:02,960
she helped me out.
She hooked me up.

3220
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:08,020
She's my girl that,
that's just like what you said about 

3221
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:08,020
Hillary Clinton.
Uh,

3222
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:12,320
um,
and the fact that she had said that the 

3223
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:14,801
FBI director said this about her when he
had just said something kind of 

3224
02:22:14,801 --> 02:22:17,591
complete,
but she knew that the five percent of 

3225
02:22:17,591 --> 02:22:17,591
people that would realize that didn't 
count.

3226
02:22:17,591 --> 02:22:19,760
Same thing.
The five percent of people who realize,

3227
02:22:19,761 --> 02:22:21,610
wait a minute,
you just hired that cast.

3228
02:22:22,130 --> 02:22:27,130
She's not after those pieces.
There's another day and more news 

3229
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:27,130
stories and a plane goes down in 
Singapore or something,

3230
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:32,121
and then there's another news story and 
some fucking nuclear tests in North 

3231
02:22:32,121 --> 02:22:32,121
Korea and everybody's gone.
It's gone.

3232
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:37,160
Three weeks later it's gone.
There's just so much going on that you 

3233
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:39,000
can't really maintain any story like 
that in the news.

3234
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,280
That's why the Glenn Greenwald,
Edward Snowden,

3235
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:44,520
the way that they approach that was 
structured the way it was to come out in

3236
02:22:44,521 --> 02:22:47,910
chunks because they had said if you 
release it all at once,

3237
02:22:47,911 --> 02:22:49,830
it'd be this huge story,
but then it's done.

3238
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:55,160
If you.
If you understand how the news cycle 

3239
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,051
works the way you just mentioned,
you want to release a nice chunk and 

3240
02:22:57,051 --> 02:23:00,321
then wait until the headlines die down 
again and we start moving and then 

3241
02:23:00,321 --> 02:23:01,080
release another chunk and that's the way
these wiki leaks is doing that right now

3242
02:23:01,081 --> 02:23:06,081
with these hacks they have.
They're releasing it in chunks because 

3243
02:23:06,081 --> 02:23:09,291
as soon as the news cycle dies down,
they want to take advantage of the next 

3244
02:23:09,291 --> 02:23:12,381
one.
The wiki leaks thing is one of the most 

3245
02:23:12,381 --> 02:23:15,651
bizarre scenarios where you have this 
guy that if you asked the United States 

3246
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:20,820
or just the United States,
like what percentage of people support 

3247
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:20,820
with Julian assange dead?

3248
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:25,250
What surprised what percentage of the 
people support letting people understand

3249
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:28,860
what is really going on behind the 
scenes be pretty overwhelming.

3250
02:23:28,861 --> 02:23:30,600
I would guarantee you be in the high 
seventies.

3251
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:34,440
Some people are blindly patriotic and 
they would just want their government to

3252
02:23:34,441 --> 02:23:36,450
just have carte blanche.
There's a few of those,

3253
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:38,310
but I think most people would support 
the.

3254
02:23:38,311 --> 02:23:43,311
Yeah,
I want to know what the fuck's going on 

3255
02:23:43,311 --> 02:23:45,050
now.
This guy is trapped in an embassy in 

3256
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:46,050
London.
You can't go anywhere.

3257
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,690
Ecuadorian embassy or something like 
that.

3258
02:23:48,691 --> 02:23:49,800
Right?
Is it Ecuador?

3259
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:55,710
But he's trapped in this embassy can't 
leave and been in this house for your 

3260
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:58,040
potential rape charge.
Right?

3261
02:23:58,170 --> 02:24:00,520
It's not even a rape charge.
Supplies,

3262
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:02,730
sex.
It's hanging over your head.

3263
02:24:02,731 --> 02:24:03,460
I know.
And and,

3264
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:06,800
and he can't leave to go answer the 
charges because they'll grab them.

3265
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:07,390
Will,
they'll,

3266
02:24:07,391 --> 02:24:11,700
they'll grab him on completely unrelated
purposes or unrelated charges.

3267
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:14,490
It has nothing to do with that.
They just want to hold him there.

3268
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:19,530
I mean,
you really think that they'd be chasing 

3269
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:19,530
him for this long because he had sex 
without a condom.

3270
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:20,490
All spooning.
No,

3271
02:24:20,491 --> 02:24:21,510
we all know that.
What is it?

3272
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:26,511
Swedish court to rule on?
Julian assan facing extradition of 

3273
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:29,781
Sweden over sexual assault charges.
The wiki leaks foundation has been 

3274
02:24:29,781 --> 02:24:32,931
confirmed to a confined to the 
Ecuadorian embassy in London for more 

3275
02:24:32,931 --> 02:24:35,210
than four years.
Huh?

3276
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:38,930
The Ecuadorians to to hold onto it.
That so crazy.

3277
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:42,570
He's been in this house for four years,
but here's what they have to do.

3278
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,700
If they want to keep playing the 
straight and narrow,

3279
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:49,910
they have to get ahold of some some leak
documents from the other side because 

3280
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:53,661
otherwise it's like.
It's like if you only get the leaked 

3281
02:24:53,661 --> 02:24:57,221
documents from one side,
that does impact the election and that 

3282
02:24:57,221 --> 02:24:57,221
calls into question the motives of the 
leaker.

3283
02:24:57,510 --> 02:25:02,510
Right?
If you're saying I release information 

3284
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:02,510
right then,
then you can be above the fray.

3285
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:07,550
If you say like a lot of journalists 
understand how to do what you omit and 

3286
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:09,420
don't release has as much value as what 
you do.

3287
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:14,450
Right?
So if the only leaks you're getting are 

3288
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:14,450
from the Democrats and the Republicans 
aren't being leaked,

3289
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:17,400
then that's influencing the election 
because you know as well as I do,

3290
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:22,580
the other side has crap that that is 
just as shocking and upsetting and 

3291
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:23,950
corrupt as the Democrats.
So let's see that too.

3292
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,270
Yeah,
let,

3293
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:28,320
let's see the two and let's see what 
trump does when he finds out that,

3294
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:31,240
but all talking shit about him.
You know,

3295
02:25:31,241 --> 02:25:34,270
I am ashamed to say that there's a part 
of me that says,

3296
02:25:34,271 --> 02:25:39,271
yeah,
let's see that I don't want to be that 

3297
02:25:39,271 --> 02:25:42,321
way,
but I read somebody online said the 

3298
02:25:42,321 --> 02:25:44,581
other day that there's people who are 
going to vote for him just for the 

3299
02:25:44,581 --> 02:25:47,011
entertainment value because they don't 
want to be bored for the next four 

3300
02:25:47,011 --> 02:25:47,011
years.
And I thought to myself,

3301
02:25:47,011 --> 02:25:51,630
that's when the country's really jumped 
the shark when we're voting for 

3302
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:51,630
candidates,
but I don't care what they'll do.

3303
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:52,330
They're both bad.
I just want the most entertaining.

3304
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:54,970
A lot of people feel that it doesn't 
matter.

3305
02:25:55,150 --> 02:26:00,150
They're also thinking that what you look
at as a president is really just a 

3306
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:02,650
figurehead and the military industrial 
job reading that book right now,

3307
02:26:02,651 --> 02:26:03,550
American coup.

3308
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:05,620
So mate,
look,

3309
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:08,830
if you look at what Obama promised and 
you look at what he actually did,

3310
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:14,840
very different things.
Why people forget the George W dot Bush 

3311
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:18,700
actually ran on a more humble foreign 
policy.

3312
02:26:18,701 --> 02:26:21,760
Do you remember that?
He was going to have people.

3313
02:26:21,761 --> 02:26:26,761
He said,
people Americans want a more humble 

3314
02:26:26,761 --> 02:26:26,761
foreign policy.
Could there be any,

3315
02:26:26,761 --> 02:26:31,510
any dichotomy?
Worse than a more humble for polly and 

3316
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,510
people will say,
well,

3317
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,510
nine slash 11 happened.
Yes,

3318
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:35,140
so we attacked Iraq,
didn't make any sense,

3319
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:36,550
and everybody was like,
look,

3320
02:26:36,551 --> 02:26:41,551
we're fucking kicking someone's ass all 
right enough to shut up and wave that 

3321
02:26:41,551 --> 02:26:42,640
flag.
I will tell you this.

3322
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:46,330
Anybody who tells me that they support 
the troops again but are willing to send

3323
02:26:46,331 --> 02:26:49,840
them willy nilly anywhere at anytime.
To me,

3324
02:26:49,841 --> 02:26:54,841
supporting the troops means you value 
their lives and their families and the 

3325
02:26:54,841 --> 02:26:58,471
fact that many of these guys and women 
who have had to go back and back and 

3326
02:26:58,471 --> 02:26:58,900
back and their lives have been on hold 
and all and they suffer.

3327
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:00,670
I mean,
how many stories have we read about what

3328
02:27:00,671 --> 02:27:05,671
these people deal with everyday?
Go to the va and so let's say you want 

3329
02:27:05,671 --> 02:27:07,300
to support the troops,
fixed the VA,

3330
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:12,330
right?
Do the things that matter to the troops 

3331
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:12,400
and then don't send them into harm's way
unless it really,

3332
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:14,590
really matters.
That's supporting the troops.

3333
02:27:14,591 --> 02:27:19,591
To me,
you have the problem is we don't know 

3334
02:27:19,591 --> 02:27:23,670
what is going on when we hear that the 
troops need to invade some certain area.

3335
02:27:24,490 --> 02:27:26,290
We don't know if it's legit or not.
Legit.

3336
02:27:26,291 --> 02:27:28,300
We don't know who the people are that 
are making the decisions.

3337
02:27:28,301 --> 02:27:30,700
Ultimately classify it and the 
classified.

3338
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:32,720
And we also don't think there's,
there's,

3339
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:37,770
there's gotta be some Intel that they're
not sharing that might sway our opinion 

3340
02:27:37,770 --> 02:27:41,671
one way or the other.
They think that seemed like we were 

3341
02:27:41,671 --> 02:27:41,671
talking about the,
um,

3342
02:27:41,671 --> 02:27:44,870
the Gulf of Tonkin resolution,
the last commonsense show with the Gulf 

3343
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:45,280
of Tonkin resolution.

3344
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,460
There were parts of it very important 
parts of it that were not released until

3345
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:51,150
2005,
2005 if it,

3346
02:27:51,151 --> 02:27:54,880
if you found out within a month that the
Gulf of Tonkin,

3347
02:27:54,990 --> 02:27:56,930
which for those who don't know,
this is sort of the,

3348
02:27:57,130 --> 02:28:00,910
the excuse for why we were able to ramp 
up the Vietnam war,

3349
02:28:00,911 --> 02:28:02,320
which killed a ton of people.
Right.

3350
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:05,830
If you had known within a month in real 
time,

3351
02:28:05,831 --> 02:28:09,250
basically that didn't happen the way 
that they said it happened.

3352
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:12,550
That's time enough to impact the 
decision making.

3353
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,860
They classified it so that by the time 
it comes out,

3354
02:28:14,861 --> 02:28:16,930
everyone's dead and it's in a history 
book,

3355
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:19,450
you have no ability to impact the 
decision making.

3356
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:21,800
That's where classification kills us

3357
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,320
because if you,
the electrode say to heck with this,

3358
02:28:24,321 --> 02:28:26,990
we've got to go out in the streets or we
have to have a protest online.

3359
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:29,300
You can't do that if you don't know 
what's going on.

3360
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:33,650
And that was one of the more ironic 
things about Kennedy's assassination was

3361
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:37,080
that they lock the files up for what?
When,

3362
02:28:37,081 --> 02:28:41,150
when did the full files on the Kennedy 
assassination or allowed to be released,

3363
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:46,420
but they essentially made it so that no 
one could investigate it for far longer 

3364
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:49,190
than anyone's going to be alive.
Like I think it was like 2010.

3365
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:51,900
Then it prompts suspicion right there 
whether or not it's desert.

3366
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,830
Why would they do that?
I did.

3367
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:58,870
Well,
I did come up with reasons because I 

3368
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:58,870
felt the same way and I had to figure 
out a cause.

3369
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:59,090
Right?
What would explain it?

3370
02:28:59,091 --> 02:29:04,091
That was rational.
And here's what I came up with and I'm 

3371
02:29:04,091 --> 02:29:04,091
hardly the only person who realized 
this.

3372
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:09,160
You remember Oswald had ties to Cuba and
he defected to the Soviet Union and then

3373
02:29:09,261 --> 02:29:10,820
come home.
Okay.

3374
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:13,910
So if your average joe or Jane and you 
don't know much about what's going on,

3375
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:18,911
but you find out a Cuban defector,
Cuban supporting Soviet Union defect,

3376
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:21,740
you're killed the president.
And that maybe that might.

3377
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:23,960
I mean,
do you see how that,

3378
02:29:23,961 --> 02:29:28,961
you know,
if you were reading the guns of August 

3379
02:29:28,961 --> 02:29:29,870
on how World War One started and you 
thought it wouldn't have taken,

3380
02:29:29,871 --> 02:29:34,871
you know,
that that was an assassination to write 

3381
02:29:34,871 --> 02:29:37,001
in an open top vehicle by somebody and 
Serbians were behind that in the way 

3382
02:29:37,001 --> 02:29:39,410
that the people whose archduke was 
killed.

3383
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:40,090
So,
so I mean,

3384
02:29:40,170 --> 02:29:43,700
if Americans thought that the Soviet 
Union killed their young president,

3385
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:47,420
that they all loved with his wife right 
there and the two little children,

3386
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:49,400
what would the,
and you know,

3387
02:29:49,401 --> 02:29:52,580
this is not even a year after the Cuban 
missile crisis,

3388
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:58,120
how much might that have impacted the 
president's ability to keep us out of a 

3389
02:29:58,120 --> 02:29:58,130
war or not?

3390
02:29:58,130 --> 02:30:03,130
I mean,
I can see if somebody said that you 

3391
02:30:03,130 --> 02:30:05,321
might have a very good reason for hiding
the fact that Oswald had really close 

3392
02:30:05,321 --> 02:30:05,330
ties.
I don't know.

3393
02:30:05,331 --> 02:30:10,331
I was trying to find out a rationale 
that made sense to me and that would be 

3394
02:30:10,331 --> 02:30:14,531
a rationale that made sense to me.
I don't think you have to classify it 

3395
02:30:14,531 --> 02:30:14,960
for a lifetime,
which they basically did.

3396
02:30:15,610 --> 02:30:17,630
What does the year next year,
October 26th,

3397
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:22,631
2017 shit when it comes out.
Redactions will be all over the place.

3398
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:25,760
Oh yeah.
I'm sure you'll have if and,

3399
02:30:25,761 --> 02:30:28,190
but or yeah,
I'm sure.

3400
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:33,640
But uh,
I mean they have leaked some stuff or 

3401
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:36,041
release some stuff through the Freedom 
Information Act that people would 

3402
02:30:36,041 --> 02:30:38,891
consider incredibly offensive and they 
found out about it like 1962 northwoods 

3403
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:45,470
operation northwoods where they designed
a tax on Guantanamo Bay.

3404
02:30:45,471 --> 02:30:48,170
They were going to arm Cuban friendlies 
and attack one tottenham obey,

3405
02:30:48,171 --> 02:30:49,130
potentially killing.

3406
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:54,130
Who knows how many soldiers they're 
going to blow up a drone jetliner and 

3407
02:30:54,130 --> 02:30:57,650
blame it on the Cubans all if you look 
at the stuff that the CIA was doing.

3408
02:30:57,651 --> 02:31:00,200
And I think it's stupid to think that 
they don't do the similar things now.

3409
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:02,720
It's,
it's crazy stuff.

3410
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:06,290
Kills a stuff that is so.
And here's the thing,

3411
02:31:06,291 --> 02:31:11,291
stuff that is so opposed to the 19 
fifties highschool mythology of America 

3412
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:14,840
that it's hard to reconcile the two.
And those people will say,

3413
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:16,790
listen,
it's the real world.

3414
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:17,750
Welcome to,
you know,

3415
02:31:17,751 --> 02:31:20,190
we were trying to survive.
We had hydrogen

3416
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,500
bombs aimed at us.
I mean all that stuff is true,

3417
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:25,400
but how do you reconcile it?
I mean,

3418
02:31:25,570 --> 02:31:26,290
yeah,
that was,

3419
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,740
that was a giant issue with Kennedy,
you know,

3420
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:34,830
and,
and secrecy itself was a giant issue 

3421
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:37,111
with Kennedy,
which is so ironic that they sealed his 

3422
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:39,391
death up for 25 years.
You remember that very famous speech 

3423
02:31:39,391 --> 02:31:39,790
that he had were about secrecy and 
government.

3424
02:31:39,850 --> 02:31:42,040
Oh yeah.
About transparency being important.

3425
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:44,430
Or my favorite line from Kennedy was 
always the one where he says,

3426
02:31:44,431 --> 02:31:47,490
those who make peaceful change,
uh,

3427
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:48,930
impossible.
Make violent change.

3428
02:31:48,931 --> 02:31:49,600
Inevitable.
I mean,

3429
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:52,770
those are the kinds of things where you 
wonder about us now will you say,

3430
02:31:52,771 --> 02:31:55,230
listen,
the ability to have our system evolve in

3431
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:58,920
ways that make it better are going to 
prevent really bad things from happening

3432
02:31:58,921 --> 02:32:00,120
in the future.
If you can't,

3433
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:04,440
if we can't get it together now,
just follow the current trends outward.

3434
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:07,050
If nothing changes,
what is the 20,

3435
02:32:07,051 --> 02:32:12,051
20 election gonna look like?
Are you a Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone 

3436
02:32:12,051 --> 02:32:12,660
type of guy?
I am now.

3437
02:32:12,661 --> 02:32:14,580
I changed my mind on that.
I used to.

3438
02:32:14,590 --> 02:32:15,390
Got You.
Huh?

3439
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,640
Who got,
you know,

3440
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:22,640
here's the thing,
and this is what always upsets me about 

3441
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:22,640
the conspiracy theorists.
I love them,

3442
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:25,050
but I wish they wouldn't leave stuff out
of there,

3443
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:28,820
out of their stories that disprove,
that looked bad.

3444
02:32:28,850 --> 02:32:29,940
In other words,
not everybody does that.

3445
02:32:29,941 --> 02:32:31,410
I don't blame them.
Everybody likes to say,

3446
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:32,730
okay,
I'll show you the things that,

3447
02:32:32,770 --> 02:32:35,280
that backup my theory.
But with Oswald,

3448
02:32:35,281 --> 02:32:36,600
there were a couple of books that came 
out.

3449
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:38,840
Uh,
my friend Vince Bull Yossi had one.

3450
02:32:38,841 --> 02:32:43,841
Uh,
Gerald Posner had another where they 

3451
02:32:43,841 --> 02:32:46,041
included stuff that was not in all the 
conspiracy books that I read and I've 

3452
02:32:46,041 --> 02:32:46,980
read a lot.
And you say,

3453
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:48,150
okay,
one,

3454
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:49,470
why the hell didn't you put that in 
there?

3455
02:32:49,471 --> 02:32:54,471
Now I'm mad at you and I don't trust you
as much stuff can be the fact that 

3456
02:32:54,471 --> 02:32:56,610
Oswald took a shot at a US general 
before he took a shot at Kennedy.

3457
02:32:56,820 --> 02:33:01,820
Right?
If you figured out that he needed to do 

3458
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:01,820
that,
oh God,

3459
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:03,000
I want to say who was the general two to
10 years ago,

3460
02:33:03,001 --> 02:33:06,000
I would have remembered his name go.
We have to look up Lee Harvey Oswald.

3461
02:33:06,090 --> 02:33:11,090
He took a shot at the general and missed
and with the same rifle I believe,

3462
02:33:11,610 --> 02:33:16,610
and it was posner and bull Yossi that 
both pointed that out and when you turn 

3463
02:33:16,610 --> 02:33:16,610
around and go,
okay,

3464
02:33:16,610 --> 02:33:18,300
if the guy was really taking a shot at 
the US general,

3465
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:23,540
now that changes my overall view of the 
Guy Oswald's

3466
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:26,180
earlier attempt to assassinate General 
Walker

3467
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:29,710
interest.
And so when you hear that again,

3468
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:34,740
now that might not be anything,
but why'd you leave some of that out of 

3469
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:34,740
my conspiracy book?

3470
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:35,270
That's important,
you know,

3471
02:33:35,271 --> 02:33:40,271
as an another thing about the Oswald 
thing that always bugged me was that 

3472
02:33:40,271 --> 02:33:42,680
they said that the scope wasn't cited in
properly.

3473
02:33:42,850 --> 02:33:44,740
The man lake,
no rifle.

3474
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:49,980
How could he,
how could he get off that shot when the 

3475
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:50,090
scope wasn't even cited improperly?
Mike,

3476
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,910
how do you know it's not cited 
improperly?

3477
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:57,020
You know,
it's not cited improperly because right 

3478
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:57,020
after they found it,
they shot with it.

3479
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:58,850
How long did it take for they shot with 
it.

3480
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:01,730
Do you know anything about scopes?
Let me tell you something about scopes.

3481
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,000
You fucking drop your rifle in the 
ground and that thing gets off the 

3482
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:07,000
caliber.
It's uncalibrated.

3483
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:11,500
It happens easy.
You could bang your rifle against a log 

3484
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:15,851
or a rock or something like that.
I doubt he was putting it down and 

3485
02:34:15,851 --> 02:34:15,990
carefully after shooting the president.
Not only that,

3486
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,980
who the fuck was handling it.
There was so much

3487
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,930
shenanigans involved in handling the 
right way,

3488
02:34:19,931 --> 02:34:24,931
so that argument I reject because when 
they said that the gun wasn't cited in 

3489
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:25,840
properly,
I'm like,

3490
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:27,670
that does.
That doesn't make any sense.

3491
02:34:27,671 --> 02:34:32,671
You have no idea what,
how it was cited in when he pulled the 

3492
02:34:32,671 --> 02:34:32,671
trigger.
You don't know.

3493
02:34:32,671 --> 02:34:34,210
It's so easy to throw off.
Kennedy had pissed off a lot of a lot of

3494
02:34:34,211 --> 02:34:37,630
people and so when you talk about a 
conspiracy and having motive,

3495
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:39,370
there were a lot of people that had 
motive.

3496
02:34:39,610 --> 02:34:44,610
I always hate it when they know the 
Oliver Stone movie drove me crazy 

3497
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:45,460
because in my opinion,
the movie he did on JFK,

3498
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:50,610
he took every conspiracy theory out 
there and throw them all in which 

3499
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:54,811
discredited all of them to me want to go
with fake general who didn't really 

3500
02:34:54,811 --> 02:34:55,940
exist.
I them all the information.

3501
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:58,900
I can't do that.
Get me started on him.

3502
02:34:59,070 --> 02:34:59,870
No good.
True.

3503
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:01,960
Star John F Kennedy it.
Yeah.

3504
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:07,180
They do that in these movies that are 
supposed to be about real history.

3505
02:35:07,210 --> 02:35:12,210
Oh,
he did it with the doors and then when 

3506
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:12,210
he was,
he was called.

3507
02:35:12,210 --> 02:35:12,820
He was called on it.
His answer was this wasn't a movie about

3508
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:17,880
the doors.
In reality was a movie about what I 

3509
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:17,880
thought about the doors when I was 
fighting in Vietnam,

3510
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:22,350
listening to their music.
Got The dude say that at the beginning 

3511
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:22,350
of the film,
put up this.

3512
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:26,030
This is a fictionalized version of what 
I thought when I was in such a the great

3513
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:26,980
to.
Yeah,

3514
02:35:27,350 --> 02:35:30,530
they alexander the great film to.
You're just going to add this movie.

3515
02:35:30,531 --> 02:35:32,170
The snowden movie.
He's got coming out this week.

3516
02:35:32,710 --> 02:35:37,120
Oliver Stone didn't get funding for 
Stoughton in the US in Germany.

3517
02:35:37,121 --> 02:35:39,520
He found both financial support and 
filming locations.

3518
02:35:39,521 --> 02:35:44,521
First political thriller,
but it's released as low key as a US 

3519
02:35:44,521 --> 02:35:48,151
trying to keep it under wraps is the US 
like visit the US operates as one giant.

3520
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,190
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

3521
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:55,320
The press is keeping it down because 
they don't want everybody to talk about 

3522
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:55,320
the snowden.
If,

3523
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:57,460
if they thought it would make $150,
million dollars,

3524
02:35:57,461 --> 02:35:59,560
the studios,
we'd be pushing it left right and center

3525
02:35:59,561 --> 02:36:02,170
right now.
They'd love a hit of any kind regardless

3526
02:36:02,171 --> 02:36:07,171
of what it said.
What were we just talking about before 

3527
02:36:07,171 --> 02:36:07,870
you brought that up?
A JFK.

3528
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:10,360
I'm oliver stone stuff into those 
movies.

3529
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:11,160
Okay.
So No,

3530
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:12,250
the,
those uh,

3531
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:17,370
I wanted to know what other things led 
you to believe that a Lee Harvey Oswald 

3532
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:19,030
acted alone?
Well,

3533
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:20,610
I mean originally,
you know,

3534
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:23,380
when you follow the story,
so you see it's not just the fact that,

3535
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:28,500
that it probably happened a certain way.
It's when you follow the conspiracy 

3536
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:28,500
talking,
you realize,

3537
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:29,830
you know what they're bringing to the 
equation.

3538
02:36:29,831 --> 02:36:33,330
How much do I believe the David for the 
Cuban idea?

3539
02:36:33,330 --> 02:36:35,680
How much do I believe?
And after going through it,

3540
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:37,720
you know,
if you go read like book Yossi his book,

3541
02:36:37,721 --> 02:36:40,300
he was the guy who wrote helter skelter.
He prosecuted Manson,

3542
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:43,240
he was a guy I liked a lot and,
and he,

3543
02:36:43,241 --> 02:36:45,910
he wrote a book where he did it like a 
prosecutor.

3544
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:48,760
So here's how I would have prosecuted 
Oswald.

3545
02:36:49,150 --> 02:36:51,970
And when he lines it up the way he does,
you sit there and go,

3546
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:54,370
okay,
this is not an I know bull.

3547
02:36:54,371 --> 02:36:59,371
You'll see he was a,
he was a guy that would have loved to 

3548
02:36:59,371 --> 02:36:59,371
have written that it wasn't.
He would have loved to have said Kennedy

3549
02:36:59,371 --> 02:37:01,730
was assassinated by a conspiracy,
but he did.

3550
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:03,340
Then he ran down the list and you sit 
there and go,

3551
02:37:03,341 --> 02:37:08,341
okay,
if I was at the trial and I was on the 

3552
02:37:08,341 --> 02:37:08,530
jury and they said,
what was the preponderance of evidence?

3553
02:37:08,531 --> 02:37:10,300
And did the prosecutor,
you know,

3554
02:37:10,450 --> 02:37:15,450
prove his case.
I would have had to have set after 

3555
02:37:15,450 --> 02:37:16,190
reading [inaudible] book that had less.
I really had a vested

3556
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:21,190
interest in believing the conspiracy 
theory that he had done a damn good job 

3557
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:25,270
of making his case.
Here's my problem with it and this is 

3558
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:27,140
one that for whatever reason I don't see
brought up very often.

3559
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:29,810
I don't think they have to be mutually 
exclusive.

3560
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:34,811
I don't think Oswald was innocent.
I think Oswald very well as the might 

3561
02:37:34,811 --> 02:37:39,370
have shot at the at the present,
but I think it's highly likely they set 

3562
02:37:39,370 --> 02:37:43,691
up more than one shooter.
I think there's a possibility that 

3563
02:37:43,691 --> 02:37:47,200
gunfire echoing from that building could
make people think that it was coming 

3564
02:37:47,661 --> 02:37:52,661
from the grassy knoll,
but there's so many people that said 

3565
02:37:52,661 --> 02:37:55,751
that gunfire was coming from the grassy 
knoll that you have to wonder and you 

3566
02:37:55,751 --> 02:37:58,490
look at the shots that hit Kennedy,
like the one in his neck.

3567
02:37:58,491 --> 02:38:00,740
That's one of the.
One of the more interesting books that I

3568
02:38:00,741 --> 02:38:03,980
read about it was a case case closed.

3569
02:38:04,010 --> 02:38:05,960
I'm best evidence by David.
Lifted.

3570
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:09,170
Lifted was the one that.
Didn't he say that they put something in

3571
02:38:09,171 --> 02:38:12,290
the autopsy and Kennedy's head like 
that.

3572
02:38:12,310 --> 02:38:13,160
That to me,
by the way,

3573
02:38:13,170 --> 02:38:18,170
was it or something,
and that was the part that blew me away 

3574
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:18,170
because when we were kids,
uh,

3575
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:18,410
they didn't have the Kennedy autopsy,
you.

3576
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:23,950
And then to eventually release those.
That was shocking and put it in the 

3577
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:23,950
book.
Yeah.

3578
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:23,950
Yeah.
Well,

3579
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:26,660
they also changed between Bethesda,
Maryland,

3580
02:38:26,661 --> 02:38:29,630
and Dallas in that flight from Dallas to
Bethesda,

3581
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:33,020
they changed the risk,
like what the impact was.

3582
02:38:33,470 --> 02:38:36,890
They were calling it a bullet hole in 
his neck in Dallas.

3583
02:38:37,070 --> 02:38:41,750
And then when it got to Bethesda,
they refer to it as a tracheotomy whole.

3584
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:44,810
Here's my problem.
He was hit from the front end,

3585
02:38:44,811 --> 02:38:49,811
from the back,
like it's entirely possible that Oswald 

3586
02:38:49,811 --> 02:38:51,260
also was involved and that there was a 
bunch of people involved.

3587
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:55,310
It's entirely possible that if you're 
going to assassinate the president,

3588
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,340
if you're going to have a conspiracy to 
assassinate the president,

3589
02:38:58,341 --> 02:39:03,341
you're gonna use a bunch of people.
Why wouldn't they use someone like 

3590
02:39:03,341 --> 02:39:06,071
Oswald?
Why wouldn't they use some crazy fuck 

3591
02:39:06,071 --> 02:39:07,700
who emigrates to Russia and comes back 
with a Russian wife and he's involved in

3592
02:39:07,701 --> 02:39:11,090
communist propaganda and all sorts of 
other crazy,

3593
02:39:11,091 --> 02:39:12,440
unsavory,
shitty shoots.

3594
02:39:12,441 --> 02:39:13,700
It generals.
Yeah,

3595
02:39:13,730 --> 02:39:14,930
that's it.
Exactly.

3596
02:39:14,931 --> 02:39:17,510
A guy you would use and he might've been
involved to.

3597
02:39:17,870 --> 02:39:19,560
It might have been,
and I don't know,

3598
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:24,720
somehow or another it always the.
The debate is always a mutually 

3599
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,761
exclusive thing.
Either Oswald acted alone or the CIA 

3600
02:39:27,761 --> 02:39:29,060
killed Kennedy or the NSA.
Who the fuck with the Cubans,

3601
02:39:29,061 --> 02:39:31,690
the mob and they blamed it on Oswald.
Well,

3602
02:39:31,691 --> 02:39:33,590
it's.
It could totally be.

3603
02:39:33,591 --> 02:39:36,440
He was a part of it all and that there 
was more than one shooter.

3604
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:39,170
That seems to me to be the most likely 
thing.

3605
02:39:41,390 --> 02:39:46,390
It's certainly possible when Jack Ruby 
runs up to him and shoots him in front 

3606
02:39:46,390 --> 02:39:49,781
of all those cops,
those cops were walking them out there 

3607
02:39:49,781 --> 02:39:49,820
and there was assassination.
They're holding onto his arm.

3608
02:39:49,821 --> 02:39:52,040
We've got them.
We've got the guy who shot the president

3609
02:39:52,310 --> 02:39:53,810
out in the open,
in front of everybody.

3610
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:54,860
Who was that?
A guy with a gun.

3611
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:56,330
Oh No,
mine.

3612
02:39:56,390 --> 02:40:01,390
The guy who.
Who was my mentor when I first started 

3613
02:40:01,390 --> 02:40:03,770
in news was a local guy here that 
everybody knows new guide him,

3614
02:40:03,771 --> 02:40:08,771
John Babcock and babcock was a Texas guy
originally and he was in the motorcade 

3615
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:13,750
in the very last car because they had 
press writing and the so far,

3616
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,070
but

3617
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,200
he was in the motorcade,
so they went.

3618
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:21,230
He was at Parkland when,
when it was announced at Kennedy was 

3619
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:21,480
dead and then he was.
He told me the story.

3620
02:40:21,481 --> 02:40:23,600
He had good stories.
He had good Manson stories too.

3621
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:29,060
He was in the room with ruby before they
brought Oswald out before ruby killed 

3622
02:40:30,271 --> 02:40:32,430
him and he said,
what are you doing here today?

3623
02:40:32,431 --> 02:40:36,150
Jack and Jack,
and he had a conversation beforehand.

3624
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:42,530
I don't recall what John Thought in 
terms of conspiracy or not conspiracy,

3625
02:40:42,661 --> 02:40:47,661
but I remember that that was like a 
seminal moment in his career because he 

3626
02:40:47,661 --> 02:40:50,751
was broadcasting live.
He was on the radio while it was all 

3627
02:40:50,751 --> 02:40:53,181
going on and he was there at the scene.
He also had the most awesome Manson 

3628
02:40:53,181 --> 02:40:57,981
stuff because I'm.
The station I worked at KBC was big in 

3629
02:40:57,981 --> 02:40:58,680
the Manson investigation.
They're the ones that actually found the

3630
02:40:58,681 --> 02:41:03,681
bloody clothes a year later on the 
hillside while they were filming a 

3631
02:41:03,681 --> 02:41:06,951
recreation and that's how the bloody 
clothes got found and he would go and 

3632
02:41:07,111 --> 02:41:10,920
speak to Manson all the time through the
Manson was not convicted yet,

3633
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:15,921
so he's on trial and awaiting trial and 
he had Manson became friends and up on 

3634
02:41:15,921 --> 02:41:18,390
his wall he had a photo of Charles 
Manson within Pencil,

3635
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,890
a note and I still remember what it 
said.

3636
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:21,960
It said to the trial,
come early,

3637
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:23,970
stay late.
It will be quite a show.

3638
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:26,010
And he said,
look at that,

3639
02:41:26,011 --> 02:41:29,130
writing that Manson data.
And I looked at it and it was weird.

3640
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:31,290
You could see that the pencil was 
broken,

3641
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:33,090
like he would snap the point off the 
pencil,

3642
02:41:33,091 --> 02:41:34,650
every couple of words.
He said,

3643
02:41:34,651 --> 02:41:36,690
do you know why the point of the pencil 
snapped?

3644
02:41:36,691 --> 02:41:37,080
I go,
no.

3645
02:41:37,081 --> 02:41:38,030
He goes,
[inaudible].

3646
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:43,040
The guy had no education,
but he was pretty smart and he used to 

3647
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:46,290
get so frustrated at his inability to 
express himself that break the pencil.

3648
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:49,830
So then once he was convicted and 
remember he was sent to death row.

3649
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:55,100
John said,
I stopped paying attention to him 

3650
02:41:55,100 --> 02:41:55,100
because you know,
he's on death row.

3651
02:41:55,100 --> 02:41:58,341
I'm moving on.
So manson started sending him messages 

3652
02:41:58,341 --> 02:41:58,341
saying,
why don't you come and visit me anymore?

3653
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:01,500
And so finally John went and he said,
Manson said,

3654
02:42:01,501 --> 02:42:03,110
so why don't you come and visit me 
anymore?

3655
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:03,750
And John said,
well,

3656
02:42:03,751 --> 02:42:04,590
you know,
Charlie,

3657
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:05,610
you know,
you're going to the.

3658
02:42:05,910 --> 02:42:08,100
And Manson says,
so you don't think I can,

3659
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:08,840
you know,
you don't think I'm.

3660
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:09,500
And he goes,
no.

3661
02:42:09,630 --> 02:42:11,250
So he said,
come back in a week.

3662
02:42:11,251 --> 02:42:16,251
And so John says,
so I come back in a week and all Manson 

3663
02:42:16,251 --> 02:42:18,711
did was slide under the table,
like a cocktail Napkin type thing and on

3664
02:42:18,901 --> 02:42:23,460
it was drawn the layout of John's house.
And he said,

3665
02:42:23,461 --> 02:42:28,461
I went home and I bought three shotguns 
and I put them in loaded in various 

3666
02:42:28,461 --> 02:42:28,830
parts of my house.
He says,

3667
02:42:28,831 --> 02:42:33,831
they're still there to this day,
but basically wouldn't that scare the 

3668
02:42:33,831 --> 02:42:34,260
hell out of you that have somebody draw?
In other words,

3669
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:39,290
he'd sent somebody to John's house to go
look around and then tell them what it 

3670
02:42:39,290 --> 02:42:41,790
looked like and then sending the 
cocktail that African.

3671
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:43,950
He had so many good stories that old.

3672
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:48,980
He was old fashioned news guy,
but he was in the Kennedy thing and we 

3673
02:42:48,980 --> 02:42:53,211
used to talk about that all the time and
now I wish I could remember 50 year old 

3674
02:42:53,211 --> 02:42:53,730
brain bus speed.
What John had told me about his thinking

3675
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:54,990
on it.
I guess.

3676
02:42:54,991 --> 02:42:59,991
I guess my attitude is I'm always 
disinclined to believe conspiracy 

3677
02:42:59,991 --> 02:43:03,411
theories and less.
The preponderance of evidence convinces 

3678
02:43:03,411 --> 02:43:03,411
me otherwise.
What we talked about when I read it,

3679
02:43:03,411 --> 02:43:07,510
we talked about the Gulf of Tonkin.
That's an absolute false flag that was 

3680
02:43:07,510 --> 02:43:09,630
perpetrated on the American public 
resulting in us going to war,

3681
02:43:09,631 --> 02:43:11,260
ramping up the war,
killing.

3682
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:12,250
Who knows how many people,

3683
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:17,100
but everybody that the people in 
government don't have to sweat the Kent.

3684
02:43:17,101 --> 02:43:22,101
Okay.
All the people around Kennedy were 

3685
02:43:22,101 --> 02:43:24,150
Kennedy's people,
and so whether you're talking about the 

3686
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,520
defense secretary or a lot of the whiz 
kids,

3687
02:43:24,521 --> 02:43:27,460
they were called when Kennedy brought in
these new people from private industry.

3688
02:43:27,461 --> 02:43:31,030
They were his people and they stayed in 
the Johnson administration.

3689
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:33,880
Those people would have had to.
I mean,

3690
02:43:33,881 --> 02:43:38,881
if they had thought that their boss who 
brought them into government had been 

3691
02:43:38,881 --> 02:43:39,960
killed by Johnson or by the government.
I mean,

3692
02:43:39,961 --> 02:43:40,410
it just,
it's,

3693
02:43:40,411 --> 02:43:42,880
it's hard to believe what.
How do they know?

3694
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:44,500
How would you know?
Okay.

3695
02:43:44,501 --> 02:43:47,800
If you're all in an office and you're 
working with president gets shot,

3696
02:43:47,890 --> 02:43:52,890
you think you're going to get more 
information than the average person on 

3697
02:43:52,890 --> 02:43:52,890
the street.
You're probably not.

3698
02:43:52,930 --> 02:43:57,930
You're probably going to have to read 
the news reports just like everybody 

3699
02:43:57,930 --> 02:43:57,930
else.

3700
02:43:57,930 --> 02:43:57,930
You're going to see Oswald paraded out 
there.

3701
02:43:57,930 --> 02:43:58,900
You're gonna.
See Jack Ruby,

3702
02:43:58,901 --> 02:44:03,901
shoot them.
You're going to have people in your 

3703
02:44:03,901 --> 02:44:05,761
organization tell you that they shot the
guy who shot the president and you're 

3704
02:44:05,761 --> 02:44:09,001
going to believe it until you see this 
approved or film until you watching the 

3705
02:44:09,001 --> 02:44:13,020
Geraldo Rivera show.
And Dick Gregory brings on the Zapruder 

3706
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,020
film.
What was it like 10 years later?

3707
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:15,970
And I remember this wasn't like 10 years
later.

3708
02:44:16,660 --> 02:44:21,660
Well,
what year did it wasn't like they 

3709
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:23,880
assassinated him in 63 and I don't think
he made it on the Dick Gregory show 

3710
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:25,720
until the 19 seventies.
No,

3711
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:28,960
it was late seventies to I think,
or the Geraldo Rivera show.

3712
02:44:29,290 --> 02:44:34,290
Was it then?
Here's the question either if it wasn't 

3713
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:34,290
the government.
So look at all the different people that

3714
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,950
Oliver Stone could throw into a film,
right?

3715
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:39,040
Which the Mafia or whatever.
If it's not the government,

3716
02:44:39,041 --> 02:44:41,740
then the government has no reason at all
to cover it up.

3717
02:44:41,890 --> 02:44:42,360
Right,
okay.

3718
02:44:42,361 --> 02:44:47,361
If the mafia does it,
Robert F Kennedy is going after the 

3719
02:44:47,361 --> 02:44:47,470
mafia all the time anyway.
It just gives him one more reason to go.

3720
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:51,190
So the only way this becomes a 
conspiracy that stays secret and,

3721
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,580
and involves the government not 
investigating it,

3722
02:44:53,581 --> 02:44:58,581
is if the government is in on it.
So that's the only conspiracy theory 

3723
02:44:58,581 --> 02:45:01,060
that makes sense on why the government 
didn't pursue the conspiracy theory.

3724
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:03,370
Okay.
So if the government is in on it,

3725
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:06,880
well,
how many people have to be in on it?

3726
02:45:07,150 --> 02:45:07,960
See,
here's the thing.

3727
02:45:07,961 --> 02:45:09,920
If,
if the narrative that they can find,

3728
02:45:09,950 --> 02:45:11,850
they didn't compartmentalize,
that was standard.

3729
02:45:11,851 --> 02:45:16,851
I do everything,
everything is compartmentalized and 

3730
02:45:16,851 --> 02:45:16,851
there's a need to know basis and you 
know,

3731
02:45:16,851 --> 02:45:21,541
unless you're some dude in a movie who 
wants to get to the bottom of it and he 

3732
02:45:21,541 --> 02:45:24,771
was sneaking into the building in the 
middle of the Warren Commission report 

3733
02:45:24,771 --> 02:45:24,771
and the magic bullet,
all that stuff is,

3734
02:45:24,771 --> 02:45:29,201
is part of the cover up if you buy that 
theory while the Warren Commission 

3735
02:45:29,201 --> 02:45:33,721
report in and of itself is what lyft and
uses and a reason to go in and start 

3736
02:45:34,661 --> 02:45:36,370
investigating the Kennedy assassination.

3737
02:45:36,410 --> 02:45:41,410
Well,
as I told it was a good reason to have 

3738
02:45:41,410 --> 02:45:43,171
covered it up.
If you believe that the American people 

3739
02:45:43,171 --> 02:45:45,571
would draw a natural conclusion that a 
Soviet agent killed our president and 

3740
02:45:45,671 --> 02:45:46,270
remember,
you know,

3741
02:45:46,271 --> 02:45:48,700
Kennedy had been trying to assassinate 
Castro to.

3742
02:45:48,701 --> 02:45:52,500
So there were reasons for a Cuban group 
of people to take.

3743
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:54,730
I mean,
there's a lot of enemies.

3744
02:45:54,731 --> 02:45:57,460
There's a lot of enemies also in 
government.

3745
02:45:57,461 --> 02:46:02,461
He was trying to get rid of the CIA.
He was trying to do a lot of stuff that 

3746
02:46:02,461 --> 02:46:06,331
people didn't like,
the speech that he gave about 

3747
02:46:06,331 --> 02:46:08,731
transparency,
about secret secrets and secret 

3748
02:46:08,731 --> 02:46:10,250
societies being a damaging part of our 
culture.

3749
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:15,780
Does that mean that was all.
That's all not good if you want to stay 

3750
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:15,780
alive.
Well,

3751
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:17,780
and I want to make it clear when it 
comes to these kinds of theories,

3752
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:20,040
I try to have an open mind and,
and,

3753
02:46:20,041 --> 02:46:20,900
and,
you know,

3754
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:25,960
try to look at every angle and I'm not 
saying that these things are not 

3755
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:25,960
possible.

3756
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:28,990
You had asked me if I had a view and I 
used to have one view and now I have 

3757
02:46:28,990 --> 02:46:28,990
another view.
Uh,

3758
02:46:28,990 --> 02:46:33,880
if evidence came out tomorrow that said 
that made it look like it was a 

3759
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:35,150
conspiracy or I would be perfectly happy
to switch again.

3760
02:46:35,151 --> 02:46:35,720
I mean,
I try,

3761
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:38,510
I try to,
to be flexible on these things.

3762
02:46:38,511 --> 02:46:41,240
I don't have a vested interest.
So when you say those things,

3763
02:46:41,241 --> 02:46:41,900
I kind of go,
okay,

3764
02:46:41,901 --> 02:46:42,800
yeah,
I can see that.

3765
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:45,380
It's not what I believe lately,
but I can see that.

3766
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:50,520
Yeah.
I don't really believe anything when it 

3767
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:50,520
comes to that.
It becomes the Kennedy assassination,

3768
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:54,701
other than some fuckery was a foot well 
and the story when the conspiracy 

3769
02:46:55,161 --> 02:46:58,040
theorists who write these books and it's
an industry as you well know,

3770
02:46:58,190 --> 02:47:03,190
I get angry when they don't include 
things that might disprove what they 

3771
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,230
say,
you want me to believe you?

3772
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:05,310
I want.
I want you to lay it all right,

3773
02:47:05,810 --> 02:47:10,810
and so I became suspicious.
Once those books started coming forward 

3774
02:47:10,810 --> 02:47:10,810
saying,
well,

3775
02:47:10,810 --> 02:47:11,660
look what they left out here and look 
what they left out here.

3776
02:47:11,661 --> 02:47:12,350
And you go,
okay,

3777
02:47:12,351 --> 02:47:14,360
well now you never told me that.
You know,

3778
02:47:14,361 --> 02:47:18,120
there's some tightly grooved paths when 
it comes to discussing that scarcity.

3779
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:23,170
That's why I've always found it so weird
that no one mentions or very rarely is 

3780
02:47:23,170 --> 02:47:24,290
it mentioned that Oswald might've been a
part of it.

3781
02:47:24,590 --> 02:47:29,590
The idea that he got off those three 
shots because they determined that it 

3782
02:47:29,590 --> 02:47:31,190
was three shots based on people's 
reporting and you know,

3783
02:47:31,550 --> 02:47:36,550
if you,
if you believe that he got off those 

3784
02:47:36,550 --> 02:47:36,650
three shots in a shorter amount of time 
and then you see Jesse Ventura trying to

3785
02:47:36,651 --> 02:47:39,560
recreate it and say it's impossible.
No one dropped all.

3786
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,240
Well,
someone can do that.

3787
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:42,190
That's not true.
Like there,

3788
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:47,200
there's people that are capable of 
getting off three shots in six seconds 

3789
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:47,200
or whatever it was.
And,

3790
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:51,440
and if I recall Oswald was a marksman.
Look,

3791
02:47:51,500 --> 02:47:55,340
it's him.
He probably was okay with a rifle.

3792
02:47:55,430 --> 02:47:57,560
But if you're leaning,
here's the reality,

3793
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:02,680
you're leaning on a window sill and 
you've got a scope with the bolt action.

3794
02:48:03,410 --> 02:48:08,410
Ancient rifleman.
I mean if you really wanted to kill the 

3795
02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:08,570
president,
a mail order man,

3796
02:48:08,571 --> 02:48:13,571
liquor carcanos rifle is not what you 
would achieve that shooting that far of 

3797
02:48:13,571 --> 02:48:13,571
a shot?
No,

3798
02:48:13,571 --> 02:48:13,850
I mean,
what,

3799
02:48:13,851 --> 02:48:14,840
how many yards was it?
You know,

3800
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:17,460
and plus after the first one you just 
spray Kinda,

3801
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:19,160
you just pull the trigger a couple 
times.

3802
02:48:19,161 --> 02:48:22,100
But if someone else was involved,
that's where it gets even weirder.

3803
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:25,340
Like he shooting down someone shooting 
from the front.

3804
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:28,070
That seems like what they would do if 
they were trying to kill somebody.

3805
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:30,080
If it's a conspiracy theory 
triangulation,

3806
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:34,520
although let's be honest,
that becomes a lot harder to hide later.

3807
02:48:34,550 --> 02:48:36,410
Right?
So if you're worried about exposure,

3808
02:48:36,411 --> 02:48:40,940
because exposure would would show the 
tentacles and well then you want to make

3809
02:48:40,941 --> 02:48:43,040
it as cut and dried and simple as you 
can.

3810
02:48:43,041 --> 02:48:47,540
You start triangulating on a president 
that you know you don't know as you well

3811
02:48:47,541 --> 02:48:49,850
know what those bullets are going to do,
right?

3812
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:53,000
I think you open yourself up to massive 
problems.

3813
02:48:53,001 --> 02:48:56,000
If those bullets go.
I mean if in other words,

3814
02:48:56,270 --> 02:49:01,270
if something had gone another way and it
would have been impossible to deny that 

3815
02:49:01,270 --> 02:49:04,841
there was another shooter,
how does that change the whole 

3816
02:49:04,841 --> 02:49:07,121
investigation but actually did happen.
That was part of the investigation 

3817
02:49:07,121 --> 02:49:08,160
itself leading to the magic bullet

3818
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:12,550
theory.
The magic bullet theory was was the well

3819
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:18,040
was created because a guy was walking 
under the underpass and the Kerbstone 

3820
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:21,540
got hit by a bullet.
He was hitting her head with a ricochet.

3821
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:24,390
So because he was hit with a ricochet,
they found the spot with a bullet.

3822
02:49:24,391 --> 02:49:26,940
It hit and they had accounted for one 
bullet.

3823
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,250
So then they had the head shot that 
killed Kennedy,

3824
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:32,820
and then they had this neck thing and 
then they had this other bullet.

3825
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:35,250
And then they started like trying to 
figure out,

3826
02:49:35,251 --> 02:49:39,600
well how many bullets are involved here 
and how does colony connolly rather have

3827
02:49:39,601 --> 02:49:41,760
a bullet lodged in his,
in his leg,

3828
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:43,740
like how does this happen?
Or how did he get shot?

3829
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:48,900
And a bullet that shattered his bone and
went through his leg also went through 

3830
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:48,900
Kennedy.
Is that what we're saying?

3831
02:49:48,930 --> 02:49:53,930
Like what are we saying?
So they had to come up with that one 

3832
02:49:53,930 --> 02:49:57,591
bullet,
doing all that damage specifically 

3833
02:49:57,591 --> 02:49:57,591
because somebody got hit with some 
spray.

3834
02:49:57,870 --> 02:50:00,020
That's mean that that did happen.
That was okay.

3835
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:05,070
Part of the investigation,
there's a part c and this is the part 

3836
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:05,070
where it's kind of hard if,
if,

3837
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:06,880
if you want there to be anything cut and
dried.

3838
02:50:07,570 --> 02:50:12,570
If you're the Warren Commission report 
and you're doing this not that long 

3839
02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:15,481
after Kennedy's assassination,
I think you have to allow for the idea 

3840
02:50:15,481 --> 02:50:16,450
that there are going to be unknowables 
right?

3841
02:50:16,451 --> 02:50:20,560
And especially ballistics,
ballistics or crazy write bullets,

3842
02:50:20,561 --> 02:50:24,070
tumble bullets and you know,
you fire 900 bullets.

3843
02:50:24,071 --> 02:50:26,350
It's something,
most of them are going to be deformed,

3844
02:50:26,351 --> 02:50:31,351
but some of them might not be,
but they're never going to look like 

3845
02:50:31,351 --> 02:50:32,320
that.
Pristine bullet is bullshit.

3846
02:50:32,630 --> 02:50:36,220
That's the most bullshit aspect of the 
entire investigations.

3847
02:50:36,230 --> 02:50:38,510
That's silly bullet.
What does that a t shirt,

3848
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:42,390
Kennedy assassination or how it would 
have had to travel through

3849
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:45,630
body to surprise me.
Bullets can do that.

3850
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:48,090
Can hit bones and you'd ricochet and you
tumble

3851
02:50:48,230 --> 02:50:53,230
and this is not totally accurate to.
This gets exaggerated like the entry 

3852
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:57,170
point and the exit point,
but the point is when bullets hit bone,

3853
02:50:57,550 --> 02:51:02,330
they bend and they changed shape.
When bullets don't hit bone,

3854
02:51:02,331 --> 02:51:07,331
when you shoot bullets into ballistic 
gel or when you shoot them into water 

3855
02:51:07,331 --> 02:51:08,640
especially,
they don't form that bullet.

3856
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:11,000
Looked like a bullet that was shot 
through something soft.

3857
02:51:11,001 --> 02:51:16,001
Look at it there so it doesn't look like
what a bullet looks like when it hits 

3858
02:51:16,001 --> 02:51:20,120
bone and that that hit bone.
It shattered connolly's wrist,

3859
02:51:20,121 --> 02:51:25,121
that same bullet and they apparently 
just found it on his Gurney in the 

3860
02:51:25,121 --> 02:51:29,531
hospital and we're supposed to think 
that that's a bullet that went through 

3861
02:51:29,531 --> 02:51:32,501
Kennedy and connally and it's.
I've never talked to a single actual 

3862
02:51:32,571 --> 02:51:37,571
ballistics expert or firearms 
enthusiasts that believes that.

3863
02:51:38,230 --> 02:51:38,650
No.
See,

3864
02:51:38,651 --> 02:51:40,900
this is where she had I known I was 
coming here.

3865
02:51:40,901 --> 02:51:42,340
I would have brought both those books 
will be.

3866
02:51:42,341 --> 02:51:47,341
Could've looked up how the POC and 
posing or explain the magic bullet 

3867
02:51:47,341 --> 02:51:47,890
because they the path,
it

3868
02:51:47,940 --> 02:51:52,940
can be explained.
I think bullets hit things that people 

3869
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:56,310
have had bullets ricochet around inside 
someone's skull and come out there.

3870
02:51:56,311 --> 02:51:59,100
I,
when you shoot them in the face of weird

3871
02:51:59,101 --> 02:52:04,101
things happen with bullets when they hit
bones and they ricochet and they move 

3872
02:52:04,101 --> 02:52:04,440
around,
so that's the path of the bullet.

3873
02:52:04,441 --> 02:52:06,490
Seems crazy but possible.

3874
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:09,820
What's weird is that they think that is 
the bullet.

3875
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:12,580
That doesn't make any sense at all.
If they just said,

3876
02:52:12,581 --> 02:52:14,620
that's a bullet that we found and maybe 
you know,

3877
02:52:14,621 --> 02:52:19,621
he had another one.
I mean maybe something hit something 

3878
02:52:19,621 --> 02:52:19,621
else.
Maybe,

3879
02:52:19,621 --> 02:52:23,220
I don't know,
but saying that that went really points 

3880
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:23,220
to the conspiracy.
Yes,

3881
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:23,220
it does.
To me,

3882
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:27,460
it points to people being full of Shit.
The fact that they conveniently founded 

3883
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:27,460
on the Gurney way.
Okay.

3884
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:28,240
So the government,
you say,

3885
02:52:28,530 --> 02:52:29,170
okay,
okay.

3886
02:52:29,410 --> 02:52:31,070
I guess what I'm saying is outcomes 
razor.

3887
02:52:31,390 --> 02:52:33,610
You're not going to have to convince me 
of that.

3888
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:39,120
I'm also that the Warren Commission 
report might've had all sorts of 

3889
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:42,781
domestic and foreign policy reasons for 
doing what it did and just imagine if 

3890
02:52:42,781 --> 02:52:45,370
you're the CIA in 1962 and you,
uh,

3891
02:52:45,371 --> 02:52:50,371
you're getting together with all your 
cronies and you've been responsible for 

3892
02:52:50,371 --> 02:52:53,610
Jack and people all over the world and 
you got this guy and he's going to 

3893
02:52:53,610 --> 02:52:54,480
disband your entire organization,
you know,

3894
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:57,490
and then you're talking to some other 
people that are upset at them because of

3895
02:52:57,491 --> 02:53:02,491
the Bay of pigs and he talking about 
some other people that are upset about 

3896
02:53:02,491 --> 02:53:03,460
them because of this and have that and 
all the other things that he's trying to

3897
02:53:03,461 --> 02:53:05,020
do that people don't agree with.

3898
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:05,950
And they go,
look,

3899
02:53:05,951 --> 02:53:10,951
there's a simple solution to this.
And then you bring in that Lee Harvey 

3900
02:53:10,951 --> 02:53:12,010
Oswald character and you get that ball 
rolling.

3901
02:53:12,011 --> 02:53:14,740
You setup a bunch of different people 
that are really good at rifles.

3902
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:18,070
It's,
I think it's totally possible.

3903
02:53:18,071 --> 02:53:18,950
It's one of the most.
Wait,

3904
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:19,300
wait,
wait,

3905
02:53:19,350 --> 02:53:22,450
conspiracy.
It's totally possible branch.

3906
02:53:22,790 --> 02:53:25,300
You don't bank on it.
I mean it's also possible.

3907
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:27,880
Here's one thing that always bugged me 
about the router film.

3908
02:53:29,050 --> 02:53:32,890
When you watch his head,
his head does go back into the left.

3909
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:37,920
But the spray from the bullet in my eyes
seems like it's going forward.

3910
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:42,220
Like he was hit from behind an exit 
wound.

3911
02:53:42,221 --> 02:53:44,830
Yeah.
Well it seems like a little bit of it.

3912
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:49,831
But then sometimes when you hit someone 
like you could hit things and just the 

3913
02:53:49,831 --> 02:53:51,730
impact of the bullet causes a 
reverberation.

3914
02:53:52,030 --> 02:53:55,840
And also if you watch,
there's a lot of executions online.

3915
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:58,700
And I'm ashamed to say I've seen some,
all of them all.

3916
02:53:59,910 --> 02:54:01,380
If there's a new one tomorrow,
uh,

3917
02:54:01,690 --> 02:54:02,170
no.
But.

3918
02:54:02,171 --> 02:54:06,010
But the one thing you notice is that 
there are probabilities.

3919
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:08,650
But remember,
I mean the reason Kennedy's arms went up

3920
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:13,651
like this when he was shot,
it was because it hit a kind of a nerve 

3921
02:54:13,651 --> 02:54:13,651
cell.
In other words,

3922
02:54:13,651 --> 02:54:15,280
things happen when you start striking 
nerves and,

3923
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:18,010
or unpredictable or it could have hit 
him in the neck.

3924
02:54:18,070 --> 02:54:19,750
What did hit him in the neck or behind 
the shoulder.

3925
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:22,050
But,
but that caused the arms to Jasper.

3926
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:24,580
Watch this real quick.
Here's the seat.

3927
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:25,880
When you see it,
it,

3928
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:28,360
it,
it's like an exit wound to me.

3929
02:54:28,390 --> 02:54:31,940
It kind of sprays for he his bow,
his head goes,

3930
02:54:31,941 --> 02:54:36,941
but nowhere to the left.
But that could easily have been because 

3931
02:54:36,941 --> 02:54:37,250
of the,
you know,

3932
02:54:37,270 --> 02:54:40,780
just the nerve reaction like that.
So that's what I'm saying is that it's,

3933
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:43,430
although it does go back into the left 
leg,

3934
02:54:43,431 --> 02:54:44,230
it,
I know,

3935
02:54:44,231 --> 02:54:45,380
but that's predictable.
There's,

3936
02:54:45,390 --> 02:54:45,960
there's,
um,

3937
02:54:46,030 --> 02:54:51,030
there's executions of a Chinese 
nationalists killing Chinese communist 

3938
02:54:51,070 --> 02:54:53,740
and you watch them and they'll do it 
over and over and over again.

3939
02:54:53,741 --> 02:54:56,380
And most of the time things go the way 
you think they should.

3940
02:54:56,381 --> 02:54:59,350
And sometimes they don't know.
Bodies are weird.

3941
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:02,560
There's a delay when it goes back into 
the left,

3942
02:55:02,830 --> 02:55:04,220
there's a delay that almost

3943
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:06,840
seems to indicate that maybe it was,
um,

3944
02:55:07,630 --> 02:55:12,630
a nerve reaction.
We'll see that the arm is going up 

3945
02:55:12,630 --> 02:55:13,250
because the bullet goes,
but watch the bullet hits,

3946
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:14,390
can't believe or watched it.
So again,

3947
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:18,560
the bullet hits and then there's this 
back into the left.

3948
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:21,430
That could be from the impact of the gun
to it.

3949
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:25,460
Remember the car is also moving,
which is making you,

3950
02:55:25,490 --> 02:55:26,020
you know,
it's,

3951
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:27,680
it's,
it's hard to tell.

3952
02:55:27,681 --> 02:55:29,930
And then here's another thing to take 
into consideration.

3953
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:33,380
It's entirely possible that he was hit 
with two bullets in the head at the same

3954
02:55:33,381 --> 02:55:35,360
time.
That is a possibility.

3955
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:40,400
I'm not going to deny it.
And I'm also going to say the reason 

3956
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:40,400
that it would be interesting to know the
answer.

3957
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:44,681
I mean,
if somebody could come down from the 

3958
02:55:44,681 --> 02:55:44,681
extra terrestrials to tell,
you know,

3959
02:55:44,681 --> 02:55:47,621
this is what really is,
that it would tell you a lot about 

3960
02:55:47,621 --> 02:55:47,621
subsequent history,
right?

3961
02:55:47,621 --> 02:55:48,440
Um,
in that sense,

3962
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:53,560
the problem with it though is if you buy
into the conspiracy theory as it's 

3963
02:55:53,560 --> 02:55:57,581
normally told,
then that basically takes you down this 

3964
02:55:57,581 --> 02:55:57,581
road that,
okay,

3965
02:55:57,581 --> 02:56:01,871
there was a coo,
the president was killed by the 

3966
02:56:01,871 --> 02:56:04,511
government,
and then that all subsequent history 

3967
02:56:04,511 --> 02:56:04,820
from that point on then takes a,
you know,

3968
02:56:04,821 --> 02:56:05,170
like,
you know,

3969
02:56:05,210 --> 02:56:07,580
they say with time travel,
you change something and you go off on a

3970
02:56:07,581 --> 02:56:12,581
totally different course.
All history goes on a totally different 

3971
02:56:12,581 --> 02:56:12,800
course if that's what really happened.
In other words,

3972
02:56:12,801 --> 02:56:14,930
everything must be looked through a 
different lens.

3973
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:19,400
If I was to believe as I used to,
that that was done by the government,

3974
02:56:19,401 --> 02:56:21,530
then my whole common sense show would be
totally different.

3975
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:26,560
But it doesn't mean don't.
You have to look at everything from a 

3976
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:26,900
different lens when you find something 
like operation northwoods,

3977
02:56:26,930 --> 02:56:31,930
when you find the northwoods documents,
you see that it's signed by the Joint 

3978
02:56:31,930 --> 02:56:32,180
Chiefs of staff that this was a real 
plan.

3979
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:35,360
They were thinking about implementing 
and Kennedy put the boycott on it.

3980
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:37,430
Well,
what they did,

3981
02:56:37,431 --> 02:56:42,431
some of this,
I mean operation northwoods is not that 

3982
02:56:42,431 --> 02:56:43,100
far from things they did in other 
places.

3983
02:56:43,460 --> 02:56:45,440
Um,
you know,

3984
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:47,060
and wasn't Cheney,
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

3985
02:56:47,061 --> 02:56:49,610
but we're trying to do something about 
that with Iran.

3986
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:54,260
Wasn't there a similar thing that was on
the table for a false flag to try to get

3987
02:56:54,261 --> 02:56:56,840
us into Iran before the end of the Bush 
administration?

3988
02:56:57,130 --> 02:56:58,700
Was there something that was being 
reported?

3989
02:56:58,930 --> 02:57:01,160
Maybe that was on infowars.com.
I don't remember that.

3990
02:57:01,270 --> 02:57:02,990
Can you find that?
See if you can find that.

3991
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:07,820
But false flag.
I ran a Rumsfeld or Cheney,

3992
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:12,940
I don't remember who it was.
The problem that all those people have 

3993
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:15,371
is if they think.
I always try to give people the benefit 

3994
02:57:15,371 --> 02:57:17,771
of the doubt and say,
if you came to me with secret 

3995
02:57:17,771 --> 02:57:17,771
information and says blah,
blah,

3996
02:57:17,771 --> 02:57:18,530
blah,
the country needs to do this now and you

3997
02:57:18,531 --> 02:57:23,531
say to yourself,
but I could never get the American 

3998
02:57:23,531 --> 02:57:23,531
people to go along with that.

3999
02:57:23,531 --> 02:57:25,820
So if they knew what I knew they would,
but they won't.

4000
02:57:25,821 --> 02:57:27,590
So because of that,
I'm going,

4001
02:57:27,700 --> 02:57:28,010
you know,
see,

4002
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:33,020
you start to try to figure out,
instead of just automatically going to 

4003
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:33,020
conspiracy,
right?

4004
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:33,020
You Go,
okay,

4005
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:37,660
could there be a logical reason that I 
would accept and understand that would 

4006
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:41,510
explain the same sequence of events?
But I always try to do that.

4007
02:57:41,511 --> 02:57:44,360
Now.
I say that as somebody who clearly knows

4008
02:57:44,361 --> 02:57:49,361
the CIA's record,
I mean that's been one of my interests 

4009
02:57:49,361 --> 02:57:49,361
forever.
The stuff that they do,

4010
02:57:49,361 --> 02:57:51,890
I can't think of any natural limitations
on.

4011
02:57:52,070 --> 02:57:54,830
I can't think of anything with the CIA 
would have said no,

4012
02:57:54,831 --> 02:57:56,990
I wouldn't do that if the president 
wanted us to.

4013
02:57:57,860 --> 02:57:59,930
I don't think many people know this,
but you know,

4014
02:57:59,931 --> 02:58:03,240
in the Nixon administration there was 
talk about killing Jack Anderson,

4015
02:58:03,241 --> 02:58:08,241
the investigative reporter,
and it was g dot Gordon Liddy who had 

4016
02:58:08,251 --> 02:58:10,230
offered to run him down with a car.

4017
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:15,620
So when you talk about that and there 
are people around the president who are 

4018
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:18,000
willing to consider the option will then
I have to say,

4019
02:58:18,110 --> 02:58:18,780
you know,
Dan,

4020
02:58:18,781 --> 02:58:23,781
you have to open up your mind to the 
possibility that these things can 

4021
02:58:23,781 --> 02:58:23,781
happen.
And as I said,

4022
02:58:23,781 --> 02:58:25,920
my opinion for years was that it did.
So I'm so,

4023
02:58:25,921 --> 02:58:30,690
I'm not not open to the idea to propose 
this,

4024
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:35,780
to provoke war.
Cheney considered proposal to dress up 

4025
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:38,331
navy seals as Iranians and shooted them.
It's a real source of this.

4026
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:43,590
Got To be careful.
What is it after he knows how to Seymour

4027
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:44,070
Hersh,
he's,

4028
02:58:44,071 --> 02:58:49,071
you know,
Seymour's getting a Pulitzer prize 

4029
02:58:49,071 --> 02:58:49,071
winning journalist for the New York,
New York Seymour.

4030
02:58:49,071 --> 02:58:50,820
Seymour Hersh is the one who broke 
things like,

4031
02:58:50,821 --> 02:58:53,580
I think he broke me.
Eli massacre and things like that.

4032
02:58:54,550 --> 02:58:59,550
As I said earlier though,
Cheney is really a nefarious character 

4033
02:58:59,550 --> 02:58:59,680
in terms of,
you know,

4034
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:02,470
if you weigh him next to the 19 fifties,
the,

4035
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:04,320
the idea of fair play and the American 
way.

4036
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:09,620
He didn't believe any of that stuff.
It's a doggy dog world and whatever you 

4037
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:13,520
and I considered an American values is 
marketing and you reacted to.

4038
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:14,820
I mean it's all about,
you know,

4039
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:17,670
it's,
it's real politic as they can.

4040
02:59:17,940 --> 02:59:20,850
Right?
It's such a weird character because he's

4041
02:59:20,880 --> 02:59:25,880
almost biblical.
Like when he had that heart implant and 

4042
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:28,440
his body wasn't giving off a pulse 
anymore and the heart was just,

4043
02:59:28,470 --> 02:59:30,900
this artificial heart was just circling 
the blood,

4044
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:32,850
like he literally was alive without a 
pulse.

4045
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:35,390
How do you listen to the Bible anymore?
The WHO listens to him.

4046
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:37,510
I mean Fox News people.
Ugh.

4047
02:59:37,710 --> 02:59:38,410
What is weird?
Why?

4048
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:41,430
While he wants to do it,
like why wouldn't you want to fade back?

4049
02:59:41,431 --> 02:59:46,431
He still wants to influence the process.
Are you talking about the guy with the 

4050
02:59:46,431 --> 02:59:46,431
Rolodex?
Right.

4051
02:59:46,431 --> 02:59:48,810
He must clearly enjoy it.
Shots and people in his Rolodex.

4052
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,840
I bet bird seed wasn't incidentally 
shuttered.

4053
02:59:51,860 --> 02:59:53,850
Shot face.
I used to do a joke about it.

4054
02:59:53,851 --> 02:59:58,851
That's how you know you were gangster.
You shoot your friend in the face and 

4055
02:59:58,851 --> 02:59:58,851
your friend apologizes.
That's right.

4056
02:59:58,851 --> 02:59:59,340
That guy got on TV.
He's like,

4057
02:59:59,341 --> 03:00:01,440
I looked like a bird.
So sorry.

4058
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:03,960
I was drunk.
He was totally sober.

4059
03:00:03,990 --> 03:00:06,240
That's right.
Listen,

4060
03:00:06,250 --> 03:00:08,160
Dan,
we just did three fucking hours.

4061
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:10,070
We did.
I thought we were just getting started.

4062
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:13,620
We just did three hours was every time 
we do you know what you're going to hear

4063
03:00:13,621 --> 03:00:14,300
afterwards,
right?

4064
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:16,920
We didn't talk about any history unless 
the JF Kennedy assassination.

4065
03:00:16,921 --> 03:00:19,110
Sounds like it's a history.
That's certainly true.

4066
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:22,820
We talked about a lot of good shit.
Now,

4067
03:00:22,821 --> 03:00:23,830
the three hours of the.

4068
03:00:24,170 --> 03:00:25,370
Anytime you want to do it again,
man,

4069
03:00:25,371 --> 03:00:26,690
we'll do another three.
Thank you buddy.

4070
03:00:26,691 --> 03:00:28,190
You're always so good to appreciate your
brother.

4071
03:00:28,191 --> 03:00:33,191
Your.
Your podcast is one of my favorite 

4072
03:00:33,191 --> 03:00:33,950
things in all of audio recorded history.
I just want to thank you for it.

4073
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:37,220
Thank you for introducing me to the cons
because it wasn't for that.

4074
03:00:37,221 --> 03:00:41,750
I would never have been Mongo obsessed 
and thanks just for being awesome,

4075
03:00:41,751 --> 03:00:42,560
man.
I appreciate it.

Thank you for having me.
Thanks everybody.
