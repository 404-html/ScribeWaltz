1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,251
You boy,

3
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:02,840
you fucked up.

4
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,790
Then I could get over is a,

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,450
and this video is how weird are dresses
that cross both of their vaginas just

6
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,770
out there in the breeze.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,640
Strangest dresses that she's got on.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,520
She's got this little station.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,990
It's draped over the
opening of the vagina,

10
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,130
just so cleverly,

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,241
so clever.

12
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,260
Like the parts that we're going to show
is right up to the gateway of the vagina

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,140
and then from there there's
nothing but a breeze.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,980
Nothing but a breeze and to
cross legs and this tiny,

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,100
the thinnest possible type of cloth
we can make the stiffness lightest.

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,130
Most Times seethrough you could see pubic
hair right through the fucking thing

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,000
that's there.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,451
Hey man,

19
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,430
you're getting a little too
detailed and it's just weird.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,990
It's just weird how women
are allowed to do that.

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,980
It's so rude.

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,500
No wonder why you alimony laws
are in the position they're in.

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,900
We're at a severe disadvantage
is by their attire.

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,340
They're there.

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,010
They're there.

26
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,100
New fucking dangling,

27
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,681
a carrot there,

28
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,550
dangling the carrot.

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,390
It's rude.

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,450
I never realized that it's total
drying the chairs and move.

31
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,021
Not only that,

32
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,170
how about the fact they've got shoes on
that make their ass do something that it

33
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:07,920
never doesn't.

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,310
Real life you're leaning forward is
if you're just begging for someone to

35
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,270
fucking doggy style,

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,740
like all day long,

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,360
you're just accentuating your ass.

38
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,860
You're leaning forward.

39
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:17,694
Like you're just,

40
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,140
you're giving step one to a five step
process of doggy style and you're already

41
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,220
at step one everywhere you go.

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,500
Genius.

43
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:24,720
Why?

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,700
Why isn't the man who invented high heels?

45
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,060
Why is it that a household name
that that's the most genius thing?

46
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,200
Because you can get,

47
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,370
guys will spend,

48
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,630
I put myself in debt buying girls dinner
who looked that good and high heels and

49
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,390
then I then the heels come off and
they're back of your house and everything

50
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:39,960
else changes.

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,230
You're like,

52
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,741
aw man,

53
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:43,410
that's just somehow
that's a huge difference.

54
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,960
I mean I do see I'm totally different.

55
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,970
That doesn't do a damn thing to me.

56
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,950
Really doesn't do anything to me.

57
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,360
I don't get it at all.

58
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,910
I mean,

59
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,310
if a woman has beautiful legs,

60
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,990
the legs are beautiful and like
if she's barefoot is just as hot

61
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,210
blocks with confidence and heels,

62
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:07,370
not like those big stripper fuck
stiletto things like nights chair.

63
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,463
Nice,

64
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,370
nice high heels.

65
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,540
When you see a woman who
was like walks confidently,

66
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,460
what I'm saying?

67
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,550
It's like it.

68
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah,

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,870
it is definitely a debilitating,

70
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,201
yeah.

71
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,130
It's like a man who's really
good at the trap piece.

72
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,800
Save men.

73
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,450
Julia said it's like a man is
really good at the trapeze.

74
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,333
Wow.

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
What skill he's acquired.

76
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,593
Look at her.

77
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,650
Oh.

78
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,690
What I'm saying is that a woman can have
not such a great ass and legs it when

79
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,630
and if they had the right
heels you can get very fooled.

80
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,070
Wow.

81
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,580
Yeah.

82
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,650
It definitely accentuate,

83
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,920
things come off and you're like,

84
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,160
oh,

85
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,980
well that wasn't exactly what I like.

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,940
Lingerie doesn't do shit for me.

87
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,660
I mean,

88
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,560
I guess it does.

89
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,161
If it looks good,

90
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:44,820
it looks good.

91
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,061
I mean,

92
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,020
but if like,

93
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,740
you know,

94
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,640
is it necessary?

95
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,510
No,

96
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:48,900
no.

97
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,880
I noticed when a woman
dresses well and cool,

98
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,430
like some girls dress really
cool in an effortless way.

99
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,470
I find that very attractive.

100
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,100
You're a weird motherfucker.

101
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,690
That's why you're into fashion.

102
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,991
Yes.

103
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,840
I am turned to the fashion whatever
girls showed up at your house with velcro

104
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,250
shoes on and a fanny pack,

105
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,140
but she had a banging ass banger.

106
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,570
Yeah,

107
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,430
wouldn't really bother you.

108
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,190
Right me at all.

109
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,730
When you're talking about a
girl can be in a burlap sack.

110
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,541
I don't give a shit.

111
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,171
Forget that.

112
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,760
In moments when she was naked,

113
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,181
it's like,

114
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,481
guys,

115
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,550
I've always been the kind of
guy like my friends be like,

116
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:15,831
Nah,

117
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:16,451
I wouldn't do that,

118
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,980
but I couldn't get past her feet.

119
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,510
Shut the fuck up you baby.

120
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,480
There are some feet that
really will fuck you up.

121
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:22,901
She could have,

122
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,040
she could have hooves.

123
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,250
She's got a banging ass.

124
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,090
If there's an evolutionary
thing for that though,

125
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,040
if someone's got some
crazy fucked up feet,

126
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,671
you're like,

127
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,510
Hey,

128
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,890
am I going to have to carry you?

129
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,230
That's what I'm looking for.

130
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,960
Food is going to be a certain point in
time where you're not going to be able to

131
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,340
make it.

132
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,650
It's really funny you going,

133
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,500
I wonder if that's true.

134
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:41,920
It's 100% what it is.

135
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,521
Cause I do.

136
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,540
I also did be feet.

137
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,380
How can we like,

138
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,880
we're not about her elbows.

139
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,960
I like petite arched feet that I
think are an arched foot is very sexy.

140
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,160
A petite foot.

141
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:51,521
Really?

142
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,330
That's so weird.

143
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,840
Yeah.

144
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,021
Yeah.

145
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,650
That's not good.

146
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,680
I just like using a flat foot on a,

147
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,380
I like the foot of a woman
who couldn't go hiking.

148
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,360
A woman who's got some sturdiness tour.

149
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,870
Yeah,

150
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,010
you'd have to have a little tiny feet.

151
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,850
You fucking Weirdo.

152
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,760
He wants these chicks to be
like barely able to talk.

153
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,653
Hey Bro.

154
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,240
Excuse me sir.

155
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,270
He just slipped me into,

156
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,910
I can and see if you can't,

157
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,741
it's too high.

158
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:13,011
Can you,

159
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:13,844
do

160
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,810
they have to have a German accent?

161
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,820
I don't know why

162
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,263
that girl,

163
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,870
what's the ideal weight?

164
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,760
What's the ideal weight for me?

165
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:24,361
Another dimension.

166
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,194
If you weren't married,

167
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,920
what's the ideal way?

168
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,753
About 80 pounds.

169
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,260
No,

170
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,093
no,

171
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,560
no,

172
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,741
no.

173
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:28,890
Okay.

174
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,910
It's a breeding thing I need,

175
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,420
I need about one 15 is good.

176
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,810
One 15 one 2015 but but athletic.

177
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:34,501
I like athletic.

178
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,550
I like broad shoulders,

179
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,880
small waist and a and
high insertion calves.

180
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,971
It's funny,

181
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:42,470
man.

182
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,641
The,

183
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:42,861
the,

184
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:43,710
the skirt thing,

185
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:44,000
it's a,

186
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,400
it's a very weird thing when you see them
walking down the street and especially

187
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,990
in Hollywood on Melrose,

188
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,830
you'll see people walking down the street
where their skirt and these are not

189
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,970
sluts.

190
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,290
I shouldn't even use that word.

191
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,280
Shouldn't slut shame.

192
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,240
It's really not nice.

193
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,540
Yeah,

194
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,010
and women who want to
have sex with people,

195
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:01,700
they're not slots know
enjoying their life.

196
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,333
The Lord,

197
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,130
I hate myself for using
that angel of the Lord.

198
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,160
What I should say,

199
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,980
stress for these are,

200
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,870
these are not prostitutes.

201
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,480
These are just girls like to dress in
style and sexy and that were in these

202
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,480
shorts that are just,

203
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,830
there's just a little
canopy over your vagina.

204
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,071
I never had that.

205
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,570
So much is dangling.

206
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:21,750
Right?

207
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,081
I mean,

208
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,980
right there you're talking about maybe
three inch hard to get work done,

209
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,510
maybe three inches.

210
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,110
And they have a skirt that like
they'll lowered part of their ass.

211
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,100
It's a normal thing to see the lower
part of a girl's ass and a skirt in

212
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:35,630
Hollywood.

213
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,740
Yeah.

214
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,690
It's a normal thing.

215
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,524
Exactly.

216
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,001
It's ridiculous.

217
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:39,480
It's,

218
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,600
it fucks the whole game
up and completely ruined.

219
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,543
Be Distracting.

220
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,770
It completely ruins our ability to form
rational thoughts and figure out what we

221
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,150
were talking about,

222
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,600
how important it is to keep your
mind on the right things in a way.

223
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620
Some societies are like,

224
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,100
you know what?

225
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,450
All women are going to be completely
covered cause nobody's getting any fucking

226
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,260
work done.

227
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,020
Maybe that's where the burger came from.

228
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,040
We need to build a fucking pyramid,

229
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,570
goddammit.

230
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,750
We don't need to be staring
at my ass all day comedy.

231
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,340
These bitches,

232
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,180
we got work to do.

233
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,590
Yeah.

234
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:08,901
Cover.

235
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,531
I'm covering lab.

236
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,220
We got to build pyramids,

237
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,053
going to put rocks.

238
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,800
Nobody wanted to push push rods.

239
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,860
We just want to stare
at chickson ministerial.

240
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,070
We'll hook up eventually.

241
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,250
If you have enough attractive people in
the of the opposite sex in the same room

242
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,000
for long enough,

243
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,820
things are going to ask.

244
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,620
Yeah.

245
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,360
Even if you hung out in the same room,

246
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,313
it's exactly accurate.

247
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,310
They smell each other.

248
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,240
We're fucking Weirdos.
