1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,300
Oh,
sweetness.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,660
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,490
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,610

and entering the code name Rogan,

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,570
you will get 15% off the
number one sex toy for men.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
I have used it. Our guests today, Bert
Kreischer can neither confirm nor deny,

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,700
but I did have a run in in Miami
that was seemed close to it.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,940
I don't know what that means. Called sex
in a cam. Oh, it's the same. Same Guy,

9
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:33,290
but it looks like a beer can really, and
then there's the lips. You got to it.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
Yeah. Which is not cool. You
have some dude looking back
at you. Look, come on dude.

11
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,570
Super Sleuth. It looks like dude's
lip, so it does to me. I mean,

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,520
it doesn't look like a chick
slips. It doesn't look very
check anyway. Right? Well,

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,760
at least the vagina,
you can guess.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,130
Yeah.
I say I vote for,

15
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:49,990
I think to have one form of
it where it's like anonymous.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,480
It's neither a butthole nor a
vagina is just sort of a hole,

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,110
which is probably the best move.
It's just the whole script.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,500
No one's looking at it getting turned
on by this little circle of fake vagina.

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,330
It's like a whole,
like you're in Thailand on vacation.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,800
So I'm talking about dog
Andrew and the code name Rogan.

21

You'll get 15% off the norm.

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,280
I'm trying to shorten these things
cause I drag them on forever.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,540
We were also brought to you by on it.com

You ever heard of cyber Monday?

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Yeah, I tried to. I tried
to buy a zoom h to Z.

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,770
Do you know I'm talking about
Brian? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,220
And I'll try to buy it on cyber Monday
cause apparently black Friday last black

32
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,220
Friday, my dead shit, his pants on a
banana republic, he shit his pants,

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,090
his pants and a banana republic.
What happened? I was buying a jacket,

34
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,700
this leather jacket, and he wanted a
sweater and all of a sudden he comes up,

35
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,280
he's got my daughters in my head, in
his hands, and he goes, buddy, buddy,

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,340
we're about to have a problem.
What's the matter? And he goes,

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm about to shit my pants and we're in
Beverly hills. He goes, what do we do?

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,710
What do I do? I said, I think
you just cheat your pants,
your fucking 60 years old.

39
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,970
You just shoot. Your band's goes, wow. I
gotta go. And he could walk. Oh my God,

40
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:16,210
it's bands in Beverly Hills. Oh my
God. Oh my God. How far is the walk?

41
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,280
The pretty woman hotel,

42
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,890
we were on the banana republic in
Beverly Hills and he walked with a pretty

43
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,860
woman hotel, we shit in his pants and
then got up to the house and he was like,

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,290
oh, it was bad. But it hasn't
happened in a long time.

45
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,890
Did his underwear contain this shit or
did that on his leg? I have no idea.

46
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,270
But he,
when he was in his thirties,

47
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,880
he used to shit his pants
all the fucking time.

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,910
Like my pants on the reg.
Like

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,430
Shit. I went a nickel for every
time. This is before cell phones.

50
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,790
This is too good of a story they use
up during this commercial. Oh come on.

51
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:49,430
We're in a commercial to the music
and then I need to hear about your,

52
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,960
your old man shit and I'm sorry.
Okay,

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,000
hear this. But we need to get this out
of the way where people go fucking crazy.

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,700
So, uh, anyway, today, cyber Monday,

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,040
we're going to get right back to your
old man and shit in the pants story.

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,540
Just people been complaining so much about
the length of these commercials and I

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,640
Last return trying my day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

82
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,843
All Day.

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,980
Yeah,

84
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,300
in our long drawn out commercials that
I do to sponsor this podcast to keep it

85
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,170
free,
ladies and gentlemen,

86
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,570
because otherwise it would be unbearable
if we couldn't make money from this

87
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,560
fucker.
Um,

88
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,180
w Burke Chrysler was telling what I
smell might be one of the great stories.

89
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,640
No, his dad. No, he used to shit his
pants all the time. All the time.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,660
How long would you said the story began
with you saying that he shit his pants

91
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,530
in a banana republic in
Beverly Hills and uh,

92
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,040
it was, it was like real, it was like,

93
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,950
like the real coming of age part of my
life when my dad looked at me and he was

94
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,770
like, buddy, I'm about to shit my pants.
What do I do? We, here's the word,

95
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,860
here's where public have a
bathroom. Here's the fucking
horse part of it, right?

96
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,930
So I look at him and I go to shit,
your pants dad,

97
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,700
I think you shit your pants and I go,

98
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,060
Shit your pants a little bit and then
walk as far as you can and get to your

99
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,080
hotel.
And he just left.

100
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:09,040
My daughter's with me like fucking drop
them and was like, I'm talking out.

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,650
And so he started walking down
Rodeo or whatever, you know, Burton,

102
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:16,550
one of those roads to get to his hotel,
right? So my mom comes up and she's like,

103
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,580
she's like, where's your dad? And I
said, oh, he left me this sweater,

104
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:21,830
I got to buy it for, I bought them, ended
up buying them the sweater and I go,

105
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,100
he had he shit his pants. She goes, what
do you mean he had he shit his pants.

106
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,860
I go, we had to, she had to shit. So
he shit his pants and then he just,

107
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,260
he's walking down the street. I
go, I'm sure we can catch him.

108
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,290
He's walking slow and then my wife comes
up, she goes, where's your dad? And I go,

109
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,420
he shit his pants. He goes, why didn't
you just use the bathroom? I said,

110
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:37,660
where's the bathroom? She goes
downstairs and I went, Ooh,

111
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,400
I probably should have told them that
and so you didn't think you were in the

112
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,980
past? I don't know. I was in panic mode.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,610
It was black Friday and I'm waiting in
line too when I got a leather jacket on

114
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,030
sale.

115
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,781
Well,
it's even worse.

116
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,350
I think if you shit your pants in line
for the bathroom because then everybody's

117
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,681
going to know.

118
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:55,070
If there's a big line of people that
you just blow is dumping your pants,

119
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,070
then you like close proximity.
There's no way to

120
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,960
play off shitting your pants
when you shit your pants.

121
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,630
I say that shit in your pants
is a lot like getting a Dui.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,470
You roll the dice so much and get away
with it that when you do get caught with

123
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,550
your hand and cookie jar,
you're like,

124
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:11,450
mother fucker just never thought that
was going to happen. Are you kidding me?

125
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,900
Why? I do this all the time.
Why today? Oh, that's so true.

126
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,200
When his thirties, he was running
marathons and he used his shit,

127
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:23,570
his pants all the time. Not even
like, I'm not even saying like,

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,100
I'm not even saying like, oh, uh,
once a month, I'm talking once a week.

129
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,880
He would, this is before cell phones
too. He lives in his thirties.

130
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,300
He was in his thirties. I was a,
I was a kid. We were living in,

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,070
in like North Tampa and not
in like the nicer north Tampa,

132
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,900
but in the Shittier redneck
verse, Black North Tampa. And uh,

133
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,280
first time I ever heard her,
the n word was in this neighborhood,

134
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,460
but my dad used to run marathons
so we'd run like five miles,

135
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,850
10 miles and he'd go out and on these
10 mile runs, he shit his pants.

136
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,700
So he go into these orange
groves, shit himself, right.

137
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,600
Clean himself the best he could and then
run home. But there were some nights,

138
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,550
I remember these distinctly, it was
before cell phones where it get dark.

139
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,430
And my was like,
we got to go look for your dad.

140
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,440
And we'd be driving his
route where he'd run it.

141
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,950
All of a sudden like a naked happy.

142
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,060
My Dad would come out of the
fucking orange groves like I'm here,

143
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,280
give me in the car right now. If he knew
who he come get him. Oh, he just would.

144
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,123
Yeah,
it would be.

145
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,190
I remember thunder and lightening and he's
just sitting in an orange grove naked,

146
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:19,970
like how did it shit his pants and, and
we'd be like over here and he'd be like,

147
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,420
all right, you just hop in the front
seat, go home, let's go real quick.

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,070
He shit his pants. He hates
my stories. I hope someone,

149
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,780
if anyone is listening to this,
knows my dad.

150
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Let him listen to this because every
fucking story I ever tell he fucking Oise

151
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:39,530
goes, God damn, you're fucking
imagination. Not how it fuck.

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,100
I did not shit my pants. I Shit
a little bit. I didn't Shit My,

153
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,980
you're making people digging shit
in my pants. He just squirts.

154
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,950
He's just a little squirt her, I dunno.
Let's call him on the phone. Do it.

155
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's get my dad on the phone.

156
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,540
See this is a perfect example of my dad
and I are night and day human beings.

157
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,710
We were telling stories this
weekend about like, like one time,

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,870
one time, one morning I thought I
was, my parents were out of town,

159
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,670
my little sister was 10, I was probably
21 I was drinking a lot at the time.

160
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,740
So it was you know, party,
Animal Shit. And then,

161
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,460
and I was pissing a lot of places that
like in the round houses, like a pistol.

162
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,420
My ex girlfriend's dining room
table and was walked in by her dad.

163
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,530
Do you want to talk about a fucking
nightmare? Only waiting. Waiting, waiting.

164
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,230
Wait a minute.
You pissed on the dining room?

165
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,370
MEDOC her dad walked
in and caught her dad.

166
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,390
Larry MEDOC in Orlando. Larry,
if you're listening, I, I,

167
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,870
I'm guilty.
I so here's,

168
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,230
okay cause I never really
accepted blame for it.

169
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,930
I always said it never
fucking happened cause it,

170
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,920
cause I didn't want it to cause I
didn't want, okay. Why did you do it?

171
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,540
It was thanksgiving. It was right after
the rolling stone magazine came out.

172
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:47,991
And so,

173
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,750
and I go back to party on what do you
mean the rolling Stone magazine with a

174
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:54,320
number of the rolling stone in 1997 called
me the number one party animal in the

175
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,660
country just for someone
who's not, doesn't know. And
then that was a big deal.

176
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:02,250
I became famous and I became famous
in like Tampa, Florida, Tampa,

177
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,810
Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando.

178
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,930
Anywhere that I had people with four
went to Florida state lived. I was,

179
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,330
they knew who I was. They were
like, cause the fucking party guy.

180
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,310
So if I went out shots, really we'd
any do people put drugs in my hand.

181
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,970
Like it was fucking insane. I get roof
feed. I got referred a couple of times.

182
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,400
So you became like a sort
of celebrity partier.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,210
I became the guy that I'd walk after the,
before the article I was just the loud,

184
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,200
fun, shirtless guy on top of the
bar, getting everyone in a frenzy.

185
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,060
And then when the article came out it was
like the fucking lineman would come to

186
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,060
the bar. I drank at Yonnie's and
they'd pull me aside and they're like,

187
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,990
you're drinking with us tonight.

188
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,170
We want to drink with a party animal and
then I just be up with these lines and

189
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,530
like four lineman and we'd be just doing
shots and shots and shots and these

190
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,590
guys are 350 pounds,
two to 18 at the time,

191
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:50,040
probably like going through to 18
and probably more like two 25 but,

192
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,370
but and so I became like,
like I say famous,

193
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,620
I say like reality show famous like
the way Snookie her first season was,

194
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:02,580
you know, so that's how you were in
your town and you're in Tallahassee.

195
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,820
If I went and read right after that
article came out in Tallahassee,

196
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:10,530
definitely in Orlando, I knew 40%
of the bar knew who I was in Tampa.

197
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:14,100
Everyone knew who I was back when
people actually read magazines that it's

198
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,490
before reality shows. Before the Internet,
before the Internet is a big one.

199
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,740
It's like you were in this,
so like you were,

200
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,530
I was on Oprah called and
wanted me to be on her show,

201
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,030
but she wanted my parents to be on two
and I was like, I'm not gonna do that.

202
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,550
And My fucking parents.

203
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,870
So I did everything I did like
fucking they sent you ready for this?

204
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,130
This is how bizarre this eight
period period got, they sent ESPN,

205
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,510
sent a tour bus with two actors in it
to come shoot a commercial of partying

206
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:42,750
with me of what it's like to party with
a number one party animal for the x

207
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:46,710
games. Right. They wanted to like the, and
one of the actors was Johnny Knoxville,

208
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,180
fucking bizarre shit. So Johnny Knoxville,
we meet and he says, you do drugs.

209
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,950
And I was like, I was like, in my head,
I'm like, yeah, I'm an adult. Let's do it.

210
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,330
So going to this tour bus,

211
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:01,650
I had never done pills like
pills and so he like pores,

212
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,770
I click send on Shit.
No, no. Little stronger.

213
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,890
Probably like Pete title pom probably
still, he's just poured some tea,

214
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,740
some Tylenol's, whatever it
was. He pours him in my hand.

215
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,010
And so I like thumb one finger,

216
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:17,910
one hold it down and he gives me too when
I pop one and then he starts passing a

217
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,980
bow. So you're being calculated
about it. I was like,

218
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,750
I don't know what the fuck I'm taking.
I have no idea.

219
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,330
And I haven't started drinking. I haven't
done like, I'm just like, what the fuck?

220
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,590
And there's not like someone might not
got dive a fucking overdose around that

221
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:32,940
guy. Yes, but he, this was before jackass,
right? This is, this is like five,

222
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,820
10 years before jackass.
And those were wild dunes.

223
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,830
And Johnny Knoxville is passing bills
around and he's lightened a bong and we're

224
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,860
doing bong hits and he's,

225
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,410
you gotta be careful of that and videos
he's putting in videos of, of, of uh,

226
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,100
of Bam. Margera trying to bring a bottle
over his head and he's like, watch this.

227
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,930
And I were laughing our tits off.

228
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,180
This is well before anyone
knows what the fuck this is.

229
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,760
And then I look at the other guy, I forget
the other name, but I go, what was that?

230
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,910
And he was like, dilaudid, you never had
dilauded go. It's dilaudid. And he's like,

231
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,920
it's like pharmaceutical heroin.
It's awesome. You're gonna love it.

232
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,980
And I was like, thank God I only took
one. Jesus Christ. That's like what?

233
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,980
Like they used to give chicks
in the wild west movies. Yeah.

234
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,400
When they had an issue. I have, she needs
some dilaudid was a little dilauded.

235
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,710
So we end up partying all night. We take
this tour bus out, fill it up, dresses,

236
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,920
women, throw herself down the stairs
that says women fucking the corner.

237
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,130
The craziest nights over that drinking
and beer bottles over our heads.

238
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,570
It was the craziest fucking night of
my life. Cut. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

239
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:30,550
yeah. So, um, there were no, they were,
they were a fake breakaway beer bottles.

240
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,360
But we were like, but we had seen Bam
do it and we thought it was funny.

241
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,310
So we were doing it with
these fake breakaway bottles,

242
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,760
but we're hit it with a real bottle. Bam.
And I think it was Bam. In his posse,

243
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:44,470
but it was a CKY posse. They were trying
to break a beer bottle over their head.

244
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,160
How did that happen? That that
became my genre of entertainment.

245
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,850
Like the Jackass Watch. Dude's do
fucked up things and get hurt. Well,

246
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:55,870
what happened? I have no
idea. I don't know, but I've
made a living doing it start.

247
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,780
It started off with like Charlie
Chaplin falling down the stairs,

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,910
like the Buster Keaton pro,
like physical comedy.

249
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,600
Like I didn't see jackass three but I
laughed my ass off at the fucking trailer.

250
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,690
I just, Oh, there's a bunch of movies and
I just haven't gotten around to seeing,

251
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,500
and that's one of them.

252
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,210
But when that guy walks in the door and
the giant hand fucking clobbered him

253
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,730
with the face and he goes flying, I'm
sorry. That's hilarious. It's a great,

254
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,700
it's fucking hilarious. It's
great. And it's funnier than,

255
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,780
I'm 39 years old with two kids and
it still makes me laugh. My Dad's,

256
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,810
it's like an advanced version of like
that Charlie Chaplin Shit, right? Oh yeah,

257
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:32,140
that's exactly what it is. The
thing is, it's guys, it's buddies.

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,540
They're all in it together.
Retard shit playing.

259
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,980
When Johnny Knoxville put
a fucking blindfold on and
stood in front of the bull,

260
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,550
he's out of his fucking mind. And this
is after he's already a movie star,

261
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,730
doesn't need to do it.
And that was one upping them.

262
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,240
So they had to do it and you're just like,
this guy says fuck.

263
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,360
He was doing movies with the Rock and yet
he would put a blindfold on a stand in

264
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:56,770
front of a fucking real bull. A
real bulls. Oh, that was terrifying.

265
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,490
And the way he got launched easily could,
a horn could, could've gone through him.

266
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,700
Oh, I got mauled by a bowl and
I'll tell you right now. Yeah,

267
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,990
I got my bible and heard Burt.
It was, yeah, this is before
you're riding it. No, no,

268
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,880
no. I was a Rodeo clown. They just go,

269
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,310
they just taught me how to put the
makeup on. They're like, all right,

270
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,040
you're ready. I go, hold on. I'm gonna
learn anything. And they're like, oh,

271
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,700
stay away from the bowl. And I was like,
that's it. And then they pull the pin.

272
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,573
You hear that?

273
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,300
Or the gate opens and a real fucking
bull comes at like a real book.

274
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,060
Jesus comes and I just,

275
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,170
we just met in my rib cage and he broke
my ribs and broke my foot. Oh my God.

276
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,440
Yeah. And then, and then the
producer, Tim Scott says,

277
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,930
you say Tim Scott with a little bit
of them and you're going to fucking,

278
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,530
I love the guy, but he did a
cock sucker says to me, uh,

279
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,650
that was really good. That's really
good footage. We're going to do it.

280
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:45,010
We need to do it like two more times.
Hold on. You're out of your fucking mind.

281
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,220
After you got your rib broke you
five broken ribs and a broken foot.

282
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,980
And I'm sitting on the ground wind
knocked out of me just eh, and he's,

283
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,070
well it's only

284
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,220
like eight seconds of
footage. Like whoa. He goes,

285
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,210
we need it to be a segment and in segments
three and a half minutes and we can't

286
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:01,340
make a footage out of
eight, three, eight seconds.

287
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,100
I mean if you watch it online it's
they just reap, cause I didn't,

288
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,310
wouldn't do it again and they just
replay it over and over and over.

289
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,550
Pretty uncreative of him that you couldn't
come up with some sort of a way to

290
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:15,551
fill that time where you would talk over
it and describe what a terrible idea it

291
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,590
was. Yeah, that's what we ended up doing.
Believed that he was so irresponsible.

292
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:21,290
They would ask you to do it again.
It's Tim Scott for you.

293
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,410
Why were you willing to do it
the first place? I love Tim.

294
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,990
He's still a friend of mine, but
because I was, I don't know Tim,

295
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,250
I don't know it was, but he sounds
like a douche bag now. He's, he's,

296
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,470
he's in the Philippines right now.
He's not listening to me this good so,

297
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:37,580
but I'm sure he's a nice guy. But to
ask you to do that after your ribbon,

298
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,280
your foot is crazy. It was also, it
was like a, I don't know, we told him,

299
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,480
talked about this a couple of times.
It was like a new discovery of of there.

300
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,600
This is me getting mauled by the ball
right here. So that's the book, right?

301
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,050
That's not a baby bull at all. And
that's me. Now if you're on the clock,

302
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:56,051
you're probably looking at like right
now it's four seconds and they're cutting

303
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,850
this up to make it look longer.
But this is exactly how quick it took.

304
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:02,830
Just the bull comes and they go,
all right, this is the [inaudible].

305
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,370
And then right now I'm trying to run,

306
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:08,830
but my foot's broken so I can't
stand on it. Oh my God, Dude.

307
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:12,470
Like you got hit by a truck. Yeah,
I got hit by a fucking truck.

308
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,680
Backed down just a little bit. Just
the impact. Let it play for a second.

309
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,270
It'll start. Yeah, replace
it itself. I mean it'll,

310
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,910
it'll replay it. Yeah, no, back
up a little bit more, Brian.

311
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,090
So we can see the impact.
Oh,

312
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,750
this is the first shot of the day. This
is, we haven't shot anything right now.

313
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,200
All we've done is we shot me put
on makeup that weighs nothing way.

314
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,830
It's gotta be 800 pounds. That's it.
Fucking, I dunno. I Dunno. I guess.

315
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,350
I don't think that's
he's going to be sued.

316
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,500
I think that's a lot bigger than that.
Oh my God, that thing nailed you.

317
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,900
It Hits me Square. I've never been hit
that solid by anything. I was just,

318
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,070
I said that the clip I got to hit
them mouth with a baseball bat.

319
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,910
I've been hit by cars. I've been
hit like in a car accident. But man,

320
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,720
when that bowl,
it's whole head connected with my whole,

321
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,800
and we met where my mic was right now.
Um, this is after, this is me going,

322
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,460
I'm not fucking doing it again. Look, I'm
pretty face too much. I was skinny. I was,

323
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,960
oh my God does show it like nailed. Oh
my God, look at that impact. I know.

324
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,470
Holy Shit. And you're lucky.
The thing that stumped on
your head. Wait, watch, watch.

325
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,580
You can see where it breaks my foot.
It doesn't look like those,

326
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,740
those look, watch it right. Here you go.

327
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,110
That's the hope print.
God,

328
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:29,111
just get this boy away from me so that I
don't speak with a slur for the rest of

329
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:32,360
my life. And have it in my head. I do

330
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,010
more cushioning in your face.
It's filtered from your beer

331
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,893
checked.

332
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,320
You are right where you should
have been charged for first time.

333
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,570
How many times these guys would hit.
These are professional. This guy fucking,

334
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,790
he was, he was cut like
all stitches. Broken bones.

335
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,330
What a crazy way to make a living. Right.
I don't know how he's, Oh we, okay.

336
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,330
So wait, I'm going to bring it
back to where we started. So,

337
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,390
so that is my connection with Jack Ass
and that I didn't show very similar to it

338
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,400
for six episodes.
We did six episodes,

339
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:15,520
but I met Johnny Knoxville
after the rolling stone stuff.

340
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:19,090
The rolling stone stuff was crazy when
that came out it was like being famous

341
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,530
cut back to how I pissed on my
girlfriend's table. So thank you.

342
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,210
So that was like unwinding. I was like,
that was like untangling a necklace.

343
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,870
Is that so and so we go out in Orlando,

344
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,820
this is right after Thanksgiving
when everyone's home.

345
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,310
So everyone I know from
Orlando is at every bar.

346
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,470
All in like Church Street I
think is the name of the street.

347
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,260
So we go out and it's fucking
chaos on with my girlfriend,

348
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,030
her sister and her sister's boyfriend
who was the coolest fucking guy and he'll

349
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,360
always have weed. So we go out
and everyone's buying me shots.

350
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,610
We're getting fucking hammered.
Her parents had just bought a house,

351
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,350
just bought this brand new house just
like I ended. It was their dream house.

352
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,830
We had Thanksgiving together. We held
hands, talked about how at the table,

353
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,710
how this is everything we've worked
for guys as a team. We saved,

354
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,030
we scrimped we buy. Anyway, we go
back to her house and I'm like,

355
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm not fucking done. Like I want to keep
drinking. And this Guy Dan, he's like,

356
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,923
oh yeah,
me too.

357
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,840
So we got like a 12 pack of beer and
we'd go out to the dock and d and that's

358
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,280
all I remember Danny.

359
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:19,180
Then the next morning we counts
everything to me because I might,

360
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,350
she walks in the first
thing in the morning,

361
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,930
could you piss on my dining
room table? And I'm like, no.

362
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,230
Why would I fucking do that? I'm a
grown man. I don't piss on tables.

363
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,130
You'd like my dad said he
caught you pissing on her table.

364
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:28,150
Make your dad is crazy.

365
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,520
He doesn't like me cause I'm in the party
animal and he's trying to get me out

366
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,720
of your life.
That's what's fucking going on.

367
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,820
And you got the fucking room for
going to blame it on me. Shit,

368
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm the party animal. I'm sure. I'm sure

369
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,920
you know what the fuck you're talking to
right now. He wants me out of your life.

370
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,470
Number one party animal. The
country, but something to the, yeah,

371
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,700
I'm sure I actually use the words so

372
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,080
you probably had to Kesha explaining it.
Aw. Did you ever think about getting it?

373
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm the party animal tattooed
anywhere in your body.

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
I was thinking about getting a squirrel
with a beer can in a cigarette that said

375
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,450
the parties squirrel on at one time.

376
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,780
Who's going to fuck a question that too
so we can tell me what your tattoo about

377
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:07,520
it.

378
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,340
If I was a cop and I pulled you over and
you had a party squirreled Tatooine I'd

379
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,230
immediately take you to jail.
I'm like,

380
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,140
I know this guy did something fucked
up in the last couple of months.

381
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,290
You've just got to get it out of them.
We just going to sit down and go,

382
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,560
you know what you did? Just tell me
you know what you did. Just tell me.

383
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,260
We'll all get out of here early.
We'll get you a nice quick sentence.

384
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,280
Just tell me what happened so I don't
even know what you're talking about. Okay,

385
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,470
so, so she, I party, Squirrel foot.

386
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,830
She goes out to the breakfast
table where family is. Oh my God.

387
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,820
How much pissed are we talking about here?
In my head it didn't happen.

388
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,200
And your head, it didn't happen. You
didn't have any black out fucking,

389
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,280
I swear to you, all my children
right now, I laid in that bed,

390
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,540
rolled over and I went, how?
Fuck, wait a minute. How do you,

391
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,380
how do you know your home?
He didn't fucking sell you down the river.

392
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,390
Maybe he pissed on a table
and then say that you did it.

393
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,770
That's why he woke you up in the morning.

394
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,800
He knew you blacked out and then they
blame you for pissing on the table.

395
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:59,350
That's what's going through my head
right now is I rolled back over and I go

396
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:03,280
fuck them. Maybe, maybe, maybe
that would be called shitting,

397
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,430
but yet maybe we call
it a Brian train wreck.

398
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,710
You smoking a regular cigarette
over there? No, it's got
wheat in it. All right, so,

399
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,630
so Danny,
the boyfriend comes in and he's like,

400
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
comes in and his eyes are like so excited.
He goes,

401
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,070
I heard you piss on their
table. And I'm like, no,

402
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:25,660
why is everyone fucking saying that?
And he's like,

403
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,780
cause her dad walked in on your
pissing on the table and I said,

404
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,010
he's fucking lying. He goes,
man, he is pretty set in the,

405
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:36,520
he saw you pissing on their dining
room table. And I go, Danny,

406
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,910
I don't remember fucking anything. He
goes, he goes, well we got these beers.

407
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,700
We went out to their doc, do remember
that? And I go, yes. And he was like,

408
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,560
and I had a joint. And I go, okay,
I remember that. And he's like,

409
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,130
and then you ate the joint. And I was
like, I don't remember that. And he goes,

410
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,920
yeah, I said, hold this
and you ate it and laughed.

411
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,390
And then we killed all the beers out there
and I go, fuck, we did. And he was like,

412
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:57,730
yeah. And then you start piecing
back like little things. I go,

413
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,270
did we get stuck in a phone booth
last night? And he's like, no,

414
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,680
we got locked in their food cabinet,
like in their, in their food closet,

415
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,530
like a pantry in their pantry because
we were eating in their kitchen.

416
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:12,080
And then this and this. I start, remember
I go, yeah, so like a girlfriend,

417
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,250
the girlfriend's coming in, it
was a sliding door. So it was,

418
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,040
we were eating and the girlfriends
came out, the sisters and they go,

419
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,390
you're fucking making a ton of noise.

420
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,880
So me and Danny went into
the pantry and shut the door.

421
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,570
But then we couldn't figure out how to
open it because there wasn't a handle.

422
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,270
You guys were hammered and you had a
pantry may shoved you in the Pantry to

423
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:29,170
quiet you down.

424
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,410
We shoved ourselves into the pantry so
that we can continue eating. We're like,

425
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,930
we're going to bed. They left, we
went to the Pantry, shut the door,

426
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,250
and then I remember sitting in the pantry.

427
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:40,000
I do remember this distinctly is us being
in the pantry thinking we in a phone

428
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,950
booth laughing how hard all,

429
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:44,170
they had all this food in this
phone booth and we're like,

430
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,570
he believed this bull Moose
heads fucking Doritos in it.

431
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,890
So then that's all I remember.

432
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,110
So then he says to me,
he goes,

433
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:56,320
them man, he's really adamant. So he
leaves. I lay back down and I'm like,

434
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,310
I can't believe I'm in frame for
this shit. All of a sudden I start.

435
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,030
You ever have one of those where you
remember the dream you had last night?

436
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,290
And I distinctly remember seeing her dad
in his underwear. In my dream, I'm like,

437
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,680
I'm like, wait. I did have a dream about
her dad and his underwear. That's odd.

438
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,680
And then I was like,
but he was in here yelling at me.

439
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,670
There's not a jury and you had sex with
an old man. No, he, what happened was,

440
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:21,940
and this, and then I start going,
oh shit, this totally did happen.

441
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,140
I woke up in the middle of the night,
walked out to their dining room table,

442
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,980
erect and tried to go to the bathroom.

443
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,900
You know how you would kind
of try to lean it down.

444
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,350
So I must've been making a ton of
noise at their dining room table.

445
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,280
Pissed on their dining room table, full
blown, pissed on their dining room,

446
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,350
whatever. This now, now I'm
remembering. I'm like, Oh shit,

447
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,770
I fucking do remember you. I remember
being erect. I remember, yeah, I remember.

448
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,530
I remember, I just remember trying
to pee. You know how when you,

449
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,610
you have one of those nights where you're
like in the bathroom and you're like,

450
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,860
I can't get to like lean forward.

451
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,170
So I'm leaning forward over their
dining room table, trying to Piss,

452
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,920
making a ton of noise, knocking everything
off of it. He comes out and is tidy.

453
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,590
Whities I remember that because she came
back in and I go to is your dad were

454
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,780
tidy? Whities and she goes, he does.
Why I don't want it. Nevermind.

455
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,680
I mean you can't dream. I like,
no one wears off. So anyhow,

456
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:12,070
I dream about tighty whities twenties
let's say 26 25 so here's the worst part.

457
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,440
He yells at me and he goes, where the
fuck? What the fuck are you doing?

458
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:23,070
And I said, I'm going to bed. And
he said, where's your bed? And I,

459
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,220
and I pointed to the dining room table.
I go right here. And he goes, what? I,

460
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,460
David Blaine the tablecloth,
pull it, lay on the bed on the,

461
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,780
on top of their table at the table.

462
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:36,830
He pissed him in my own business and my
this in a superman, cape full of Piss.

463
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,950
Just let Kurt and myself go back to sleep
and he gets me up and walks me into my

464
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,320
bed and puts me back in my bed.
And I'm like,

465
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,070
what a nice guy. We it with, our
relationship was fucking doomed.

466
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,770
Like there was no,
I get up that he's a nice guy.

467
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:56,970
He's a really nice Larry Maddock is a
saint because if that happened to one of

468
00:24:56,971 --> 00:25:01,020
my daughters and my house, I would have
beat the fucking kid's ass. So I get up.

469
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,270
What'd you really man? No,
do it like that again though.

470
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,200
I would beat the fucking
kids as passionate voice.

471
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,480
Have you ever considered
acting? Maybe, maybe Ip.

472
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,730
All the time when I'm really wasted.
Like if I black out like drunk night,

473
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,440
I'll wake up and think like,
Oh I have to pee right now.

474
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:18,870
And I always like put on a
shirt the next morning like, oh,

475
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:21,660
why is it smelled like urine?
All that did it again. I've done,

476
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,950
I do it all the time when I drink a lot.
So when you a lot, you'll piss the bed.

477
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,230
I think I get confused and
I wake up and I'm like,

478
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,170
I just pee on my suitcases lie.

479
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,930
Like if I put in hampers
hammered of really drunk
people. Peanut suitcases. Yeah.

480
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,510
That's actually fairly common.
Yeah, it happens maybe twice a year,

481
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,930
but it's still happens enough where I'm
just like ever do something like that.

482
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,460
Ready?
Never did something like that.

483
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,890
That sounds like something right up
Eddie Bravo. He probably peed on the,

484
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,580
Eddie used to have these
blackouts that were so bad.

485
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:53,910
I had to write a story about it.
I wrote a blog entry called drug Eddie.

486
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,610
I think I read that it was that about
when you guys were in Rome and he missed

487
00:25:56,611 --> 00:26:00,310
his flight. Germany, Germany. Well,
he didn't miss his flight. He took my,

488
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,070
my car to the airport.

489
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,980
He was so hammered and he woke
up in the backseat of the car,

490
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,490
didn't know anything. I go downstairs,
I'm like, where's there's a car?

491
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:11,370
It's supposed to be to take me to the
airport for Rogan and they go rogue and

492
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:15,960
already left and I go, what?
He goes, yeah, long hair,
tattoos like mother fucker.

493
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,830
So I called Joe Rogan airports
like an hour and a half away.

494
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:22,050
He's only five minutes away
from it by the time I call him,

495
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,410
like the car is already there
and I'm like, what happened
man? What are you doing?

496
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:28,470
He said, I don't know. I woke up in
the back of this car. To be fair.

497
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,850
He was wearing Joe's clothes.

498
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,030
He was wearing an outfit that
looked the resembled me. No,

499
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,110
it was um,
just a,

500
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:43,890
a party time and I just got got
hammered and some man, they just,

501
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,560
they, they just can actually
forget what happened.

502
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,660
Oh yeah, I've definitely blacked out. I
don't drink like that anymore. I haven't,

503
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,020
I have not had an episode like
that in a really long time.

504
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,760
Like in years ago,

505
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,830
you and I stopped doing it
or just the last few days,

506
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:01,800
like four days I stopped
drinking caffeine. I needed
to cut it all out. I'm dude,

507
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,660
I've never done that ever. Like
consciously cut it out. But I'm like,

508
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:08,590
I love coffee. I like the smell of
it. I like the ritual of it. I, I,

509
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,080
I make French press coffee, so I
grind the beans and I, you know,

510
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,600
nice water. You know, I use clean
filtered water and I, you know,

511
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,040
I get this Kona coffee beans for
Hawaii. It's delicious. It tastes good,

512
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,050
but you know, it's, you,

513
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:27,010
you get these spikes and then the crash
is that the really fucked up thing.

514
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,700
And the last couple of days I've
had no caffeine like the last five,

515
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:33,910
six days and there's no
crash. It's weird. It's like,

516
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,790
just scream. Anything else? Do you find
yourself eating tons of chocolate? No,

517
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:42,020
but I want to drink the coffee and
it's not that I need it, it's that.

518
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:45,560
It's a ritual. It's a, it's etched
in my mind. Like, you know, Oh,

519
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm at Barnes and noble by an emagazine.
Let me just get a cup of coffee and say,

520
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:49,754
I gotta take a shit.

521
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,900
I gotta take a shit at Barnes and
noble has some of the worst shits ever.

522
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:56,480
You walk into that bathroom, if
you have to pig, God bless you.

523
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,380
God bless you in your nostrils.
Smell some coffee shits.

524
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,420
But to me with just eaten those
fucking cookies and drinking coffee,

525
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,370
I can't, I can't. Here's my problem with
coffee. Here's why I want to cut it.

526
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,950
Cut it out. Because I had my first
cup and I feel really good. Then I go,

527
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:14,510
let's have another card.
Let's have another cop.

528
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,240
So I have my other cop and then I'm
like, man, I'm fucking tweaking.

529
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,450
I need to write. You need to get
some shit, laundry. And then,

530
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,320
and then I had my third cup and now
my eyes are twitching and I'm like,

531
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,570
I don't feel so good. I want to take,
I want to take a Xanax and go to bed.

532
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,340
Then I'm like, why can't I just
find a happy middle ground? Yeah,

533
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,610
it's good if you want to get something
done. Like it's good. I I um,

534
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,860
I debated back and forth whether or not
to have one right before the podcast

535
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:40,830
cause like it's always good to be charged
up. I do the podcast and I was like, no,

536
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,650
let's see what happens. Cause I've, I've
been doing this for the past. Like I said,

537
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,830
I guess it's probably been about five
or six days now and very little alcohol.

538
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,670
The only alcohol I've been limiting myself
to like one drink, one glass of wine,

539
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,360
maybe two at the most. But that's it. I
read this thing recently about drinking,

540
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:58,410
about like going out and getting fucked
up and how bad it is on your muscles and

541
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,290
he's off.
You do this,

542
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,750
you're your body's ability to recover.

543
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:08,100
And then it takes you three weeks
to get back to 100%, three weeks.

544
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,830
All sorts of shit that it does.

545
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:13,920
Like when you get severely dehydrated
from really getting hammered, really,

546
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,783
really hung over.

547
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,230
There's also an effect on cerebral spinal
fluid that takes two weeks to recover

548
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:23,220
from. So there's like all these different
things, the different processes that a,

549
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,450
that happened when your body gets severely
dehydrated and so really fucked up

550
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:30,750
from alcohol. And there's just like this
rebuilding process. It's like, you know,

551
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:33,780
it takes a long time and if you're
fucking hitting it hard all the time,

552
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,360
you really never given
yourself a chance to recover.

553
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:41,010
That's why pre prematurely
aged, you know. And I um,

554
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,900
started feeling recently that like,
like I've never taken time away from,

555
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,363
from coffee.

556
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,740
I've never taken time away from alcohol
and I've always done whatever I wanted

557
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:52,510
to do and fall and I have a couple of
years, we'll have a couple of years.

558
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,670
I wanted to drink wine, I drink
wine. I never thought about it.

559
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:55,780
I never really tried to limit myself.

560
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,060
So this is a psychological pulled
is a problem. It's like you,

561
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:02,440
you start thinking about
it and psychologically you
could see how people can get

562
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:07,280
addicted to things because psychologically
when you resist something, I could,

563
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:11,650
I went on a diet once for a little while.
I tried to Atkins Diet just for a goof,

564
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:15,640
just to see what his life fucking
diet. Yeah. It's good. Except you.

565
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,940
If you cut something out of your
life like pasta. Yeah, Dude.

566
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:22,000
That is the shit you're going
to crave and such a a rabbit.

567
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,000
Hey man, I never want cookies, but I
want as I'm Atkins, I want to cook all.

568
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,853
Exactly.

569
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,140
It's easy to eat clean if
you decide to eat clean,

570
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:30,030
but if you've got some crazy law,

571
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,670
like if you have some rules and now
you know you're following those,

572
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:35,760
you're not just eating clean. You know
you're following those specific rules.

573
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,280
All of the things that aren't on there.
The thing is you start crazy.

574
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,820
Yeah. It's the second
I quit drinking. I go,

575
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,970
that's when all the beer commercials
look awesome. Yeah. Like, man, I can't,

576
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,850
I can't ever quit.
I can't ever quit for good.

577
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,820
That's why I need to reel it in
every now and then and go, all right,

578
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,790
I need to be in control of everything
so it won't be a fucking alcoholic.

579
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,020
I don't want to be something lush.

580
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,800
Who who you see on stage and all he does
is slur his words and lays down on the

581
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:58,634
stage

582
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,620
and alcohol, commercial,
a beer commercial.

583
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,190
That's all you really need is just
that little push. It's like your,

584
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,340
what it is is you're already
thinking about getting drunk.

585
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,420
That alcohol commercial,

586
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:12,490
like people say that targets children and
it looks like what a great party. Yeah,

587
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,600
sorta.
But you know who it really targets.

588
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:19,130
It really targets guys who
aren't partying. That's
thinking about have that beer.

589
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:24,050
Maybe they broke up the black. Now I'm
only 50 and I got another shot in me. Man.

590
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,750
I've seen some fucking
old guys and young girls

591
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,830
today start thinking things like that.

592
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,290
But it's such a natural feeling. Normal.
It's a normal part of being a monkey.

593
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,240
So my dad is going through,

594
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,490
going through like Dad's ready to
get some young person, I dunno,

595
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,300
but being around the podcast,
we'll see what sucked he was he,

596
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,840
if there's a girl out there and there's
a million people on this podcast,

597
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:51,580
there's a girl in there that this was
never know his pants. Some girls like that

598
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,110
smell of urine and true.

599
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,010
He had a blood infection and almost died.
Whoa.

600
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,030
Like a couple couple, like a
week ago, two weeks ago we sent,

601
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,720
now you got that charity
posts coming your way.

602
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:10,460
I see what you're working is that,
that somebody puts their gum,

603
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:15,080
old shit is really in his fucking head
about almost over and then you start.

604
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,190
Then it got into my head and I was like,
wow man, I'm 39 like this is coming.

605
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,190
You're healthy dude. You enjoy the
moment. That's the most important thing,

606
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,960
but take care of your vehicle.

607
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,650
You know the real problem with fucking
alcohol is alcohol kills your vehicle.

608
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,030
You know the marijuana, alcohol, and
when you're costing for your world,

609
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,320
the body is a vehicle. Brian Red
Band, the body, the human body.

610
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,140
The problem is alcohol is fun as fuck.
You know,

611
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:44,141
this is the very few things like that
are as fun as just a good night out.

612
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:48,440
When you're drunk with a bunch of fun
friends and you're all laughing and

613
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:51,230
cracking up and the end of the
night you go eat somewhere stupid.

614
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,350
Eat some greasy meat concoction with
cheese and gravy and you and you take your

615
00:32:56,451 --> 00:33:00,080
fat stupid ass to bed. And
all those nights are fun,
man. Those, those are some,

616
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,910
some brilliant nights. But God damn those
Sunday morning suck a bag, don't they?

617
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,270
They suck dude.
That,

618
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:09,380
that feeling of hung over as you're
headed to the airport and you can't drink

619
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,750
enough water and you're like I said,
Vegas ones.

620
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,700
I think the biggest ones are the worst.
Yeah,

621
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,480
because also you get outside of those
casinos and there's no longer oxygen

622
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:19,160
pumping everywhere.
Is that a myth?

623
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,790
They actually do that and there's
no clocks in any casinos. It's true.

624
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,600
But you don't, you ever
watch a stupid fuck? No.

625
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:27,960
Cause they didn't because my watch is my
iPhone and they scramble all the iPhone.

626
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:30,900
So none of the phones work,
so you have no phone shit.

627
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,660
Do you believe that you believe they
scramble the phone? Fuck yeah, I do.

628
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,130
I don't believe that they scramble it
100% but I believe that as soon as I walk

629
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:41,610
in there, I'll go from three to four
bars to no service back and forth.

630
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,110
Yeah. That just goes back and
forth almost like they're,

631
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,140
they're making your phone's cut off so
that you could just say to your wife,

632
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,960
what honey, honey, I'm, I'm by the
tables. I'll call you in and out.

633
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,450
No, it's, it's a good thing for that.

634
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,740
And they set these places up like
you get lost in them. Oh yeah.

635
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,520
All the carpet's fucking confusing.

636
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,780
Yeah. And there's a amaze. You realize
who you going through all those machines.

637
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,930
They're not set up in some sort of an
orderly way that's easy to see for your

638
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:08,140
space. Now there's a God damn maze.
It's like the mains of the shining.

639
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,250
That's exactly what it's like.

640
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,880
I want to get you in there and
hopefully suck everything out of you.

641
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:15,250
Suck the money out to you
either through your balls,

642
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:19,750
there's hookers and those mazes or
suck the money out to the machine.

643
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,130
We had a hooker one time at Vegas,
not had a hooker,

644
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:26,620
but we had a hooker proposition.
Me and my buddy Eddie and, and my,

645
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,970
and she was the one of the hottest
chicks I've ever seen in my life.

646
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,350
And my buddy Eddie was like, how
much? And she was like $1,300. I can't

647
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,510
cause I'm a cause I'm trying to drive
home tonight. This is good for driving.

648
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,350
Yeah, it's just a cigarette.
Yeah. Until I go. Wow.

649
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:45,960
My feet feel like they're glued into the
space. We'd is good for driving. This is,

650
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,700
this makes you think you're not even
driving anymore and driving here on the,

651
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,860
which Macola, I was like, felt
like I was in a video game.

652
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,840
It's called the highway son. Who's the
stone one? Yeah. Where's that? You know,

653
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,540
driving in on that.
Which McAllen in that thing don't do.

654
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,970
It's a new fangled hard surface.
The earth is using.

655
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,940
It's the thing I put the alcohol and all
those new mind vehicle. The new monkeys

656
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,360
transporting themselves in a much more
rapid way and it's a hard surface,

657
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,430
what is it called?
Whatever. Whatever. Anyway,

658
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,450
point being Marijuana Fox,
my driving up,

659
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,770
I could never, I could never drive high.
Really? How can you drive or did you do?

660
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,350
Why don't drive that high? I'll
be here for a few hours. I, I'm,

661
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,330
I'm pretty sober by the time I
actually leave, but I do Jujitsu hard.

662
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,220
I did a lot of things. I do comedy,
high sugar stop your buzz, but it also,

663
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:34,400
you don't have to realize I have a high
tolerance, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,560
When you're smoking a leg.

665
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,990
And then my last year of college I
was smoking a lot of weed and I could,

666
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,700
I could smoke all night long and be fine,
but I now if I, if I took like a hit,

667
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,430
I definitely feel it. Especially I
think we'd was different back then too.

668
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,570
We'd good for you for Christ. Let me
tell you something. Don't listen to me.

669
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,920
I don't follow my advice because
it's faulty. I have, you know,

670
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,320
it's a lot of trial and error and a,
I mean quite a few errors.

671
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,230
I'm not saying I'm right about everything,
but I'm right about this.

672
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,980
We'd my friend, I'm not right
about everything, my friend

673
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,210
good for you. And what you are afraid
of with weed is what we all need.

674
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,130
We all need a little humility.

675
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,550
We all need to be terrified by the Matrix.

676
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,620
We all need a view of the great beyond.

677
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:22,420
And what we gives you is a terrifying
feeling of of your mortality.

678
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:26,290
It gives you a feeling of insecurity,
a feeling of what you can call paranoia.

679
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
But cause what it is is you've dropped,

680
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:31,830
dropped all the blinders all around
you and you realize how ridiculous his

681
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,780
proposition is. Period. There is no way
around the fact that it's ridiculous.

682
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:38,620
We are in fact just
one part of a universe.

683
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,720
It's above our head. We, there's no,

684
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,380
there's no actual ending to any of it
and just goes and we're a part of it and

685
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:48,040
we're floating in it and we're only here
for a little bit and we don't know what

686
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:52,060
we're doing. And everybody knows as much
as you do and you don't know anything.

687
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:53,470
I mean,
there's some people who know more facts.

688
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:55,340
They know more about the laws of physics,
they know more about,

689
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,460
but the purpose of it all or
where it ends or what's for what?

690
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,560
Is there a meaning to this? Is this
just a device to move entropy forward?

691
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,830
Is this a device for innovation?
What? What are, what are the humans?

692
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,790
What does this life? No one
knows. Not a fucking one. No one.

693
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,470
That's why you need marijuana. Shit, man.

694
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,260
I want to let you know man. I got to
later. That's what she know, Dude.

695
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,590
That's what we need. Marijuana
commercials. It's not bad for you.

696
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:28,050
It's just bad for pharmaceutical
companies. Yeah. Cause fuck heads with,

697
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,430
I mean it's supposed to be on America
land of the free home of the brave.

698
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,650
You're locking people up for
a plant that makes you silly.

699
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,430
There's nothing fucking free. You're brave
about that. That's pitch moves, right?

700
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:38,050
That's, that's, that's a bitch move.

701
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,740
That's the only person who would lock
you up for weed. You know what I mean?

702
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,960
If you had,
if you had to create your own society,

703
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,210
if it was Bert world and you had,
you know,

704
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:49,180
there's a hundred people and you claim
that you were the king of Burt world and

705
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:52,090
you've got to establish all the loss.
Could you imagine if you said no pot,

706
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,950
I'll be like, fuck you Bert.
That'll allow pot. Yeah,

707
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,240
a hundred people and make
everyone shaved their heads.

708
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,810
I think we all need to live like they
live in Afghanistan, man. Just warlords,

709
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,380
warlords residing over small pieces of
land. Do you think you'd be a warlord?

710
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,290
I Dunno. I'd worked for
one. Maybe that's better.

711
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,440
You don't want to be the guy in front.
You don't want to be the figure head.

712
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,900
You know you don't want to be Bush.
You'd rather be Dick Cheney.

713
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,780
Yeah.
What I would do is I would,

714
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,070
I would teach the warlord Jujitsu
or something. Warlord. Blacksmith,

715
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,670
you know, I always wanting
to learn how to work shirt.

716
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,220
Make one of those Samurai swords
where they fold the blade over,

717
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,090
over and over again.
I would to take a trade.

718
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,500
That's what I would do.

719
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,110
Really what I'm saying is that I think
we really would be better off if you want

720
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,300
to have any government at all.
It should be very local,

721
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,990
but just a small group and then the only
time the federal comes in is when the

722
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,110
group started arguing and then the
federal comes and goes, Dude's relax.

723
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,800
We're all here to temporarily keep
it together. Hundreds of people, not,

724
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:51,000
not millions. If in a war.
Lord Brian, what do you,

725
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,510
where do you think you'd fit in in a
world war two he would dominate per crash.

726
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,353
Are we talking about you?

727
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,060
Yeah,
the life of the party part.

728
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,490
I'd be the guy by the fire
lighting the fire first,

729
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,560
putting it out at the end of the night,
like going,

730
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,650
I don't know why I'm all of a sudden
in a fucking village with a fire.

731
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,783
I'm sure we spell it out.

732
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,800
Some story. Yeah. That's why Conan the
barbarian. Barbara was always cool.

733
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,083
I wouldn't make them.

734
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,090
When I was 13 years old is when I became
addicted to Conan the barbarian books,

735
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,320
the Robert E. Howard books.
Really ever read them? No,

736
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,690
I didn't know there were books.
Oh, brilliant. Brilliant books.

737
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,310
We've talked about him a
few times so it couldn't,

738
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:23,050
wasn't a man a much words
like what would they,

739
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,360
did they just write with
a lot of like narrative?

740
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,870
Oh that's not necessarily true in the
the books he would, he talked really,

741
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,940
but the adventures were sell fucking deep.

742
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,770
It was all about this guy named Robert.

743
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:37,660
He Howard and what's that guy's
name that's on? Um, he was in, um,

744
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,920
he was in full metal jacket. He played
pile and full metal jacket. Wait,

745
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,040
Vincent Vincent D'onofrio.
Thank you very much.

746
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,090
Vincent D'onofrio played this Guy Robert.

747
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:52,120
He Howard in a movie about his life
cause Robert Howard was his like really

748
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:56,440
eccentric, eccentric character who wrote
all these fantastic novels, a fantasy,

749
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:00,940
but like lived with his mother and his
thirties and shot himself, killed himself.

750
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,320
But he was responsible for Conan the
barbarian and crawl the conqueror and all

751
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:09,430
these different fantasy books. This dude
wrote. They were fucking awesome dude.

752
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:12,950
When you're 13 it's a 13 year
old boy's version of twilight is.

753
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,750
It's like they're just these fantastic
fucking stories of, you know,

754
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:21,751
of sorcerers and fucking sword fights
and demons and it's just awesome shit

755
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,670
man. That's, and you read
that. I never read chapter two.

756
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,860
Those were the books I read. That was
then. This is now they're watching.

757
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,980
That was my shit. Swan Lake or
the route? The little mouse.

758
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,320
That road there might
motorcycle. No, Ralph.

759
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,990
You never got into comic
books or anything? No,

760
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,460
I never had a common goal with my
life. Really. What about you Brian?

761
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:41,294
You got into college?

762
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,570
I actually just read the walking
dead and I read the hallway.

763
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,970
I started watching it. I just watched
the first episode getting goals,

764
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:52,550
the comic almost exact like
look at the timelines. A little,

765
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,780
little switched around,
but it's so amazing how well they did it.

766
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:58,070
So good.

767
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:00,500
That's the only show I'm watching these
days and the only fiction show I'm

768
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,860
watching walking dead. I tried
to get into everything up. Well,

769
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,860
I still like breaking bad next time I go
to get them when I'm getting my tattoo.

770
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:09,110
Finished. I'm going to go back and
watch the rest of breaking bad.

771
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,330
You're going to get different braking,
right?

772
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,960
Oh, my shoulder blades. Let everybody
know I'm down a fucking party.

773
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,690
I saw something new, Dude. Some new
white rap dude on TV last night.

774
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,360
Last night. I was up late at
night watching the PAC man
fight. I had it on a DVR.

775
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,120
I hadn't watched it yet.
No

776
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,783
one.
No.

777
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,033
Well

778
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,790
see that's the reason he keeps putting
these bombs out there because every now

779
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,800
and then he just went out of the park.

780
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,850
One memo, Marcus. Anyway,

781
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,750
they had this awesome fighting
and I still hadn't watched it,

782
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:53,700
so I was up watching it and uh, what was
it? What the hell were we talking about?

783
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:57,090
What was the point on Pac man?
No, it was before PAC man.

784
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:59,450
What was the breaking bad tattoo?
You're getting your tattoos.

785
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,910
He only shows you watch. God
dammit. I completely forgot
what I was talking about.

786
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,230
Can someone tweet us real quick and
tell us what we're talking about?

787
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,970
We smoked too much pot folks. It helps
and it hurts. It's there and yet it's not.

788
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,260
What? Ethereal. I apologize. It's
probably my fault. How's it your fault?

789
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,050
Cause you brought a pack. Definitely
threw, threw us off the fuck he did.

790
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:21,030
But it was worth,
it was worth doing.

791
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,680
You were the one on the fucking Nina,
the Pinta and the Santa Maria.

792
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:27,020
Go and look at it's a whale and
Columbus was like, whoa. Something

793
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,890
I was watching on TV. That's what I was
talking about. Oh, this new white rapper.

794
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,900
Thanks. Some guy and it's got a song.
I don't know who he is. I don't know.

795
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:40,490
But he was with that Birdman guy. Manny,
do you know who the Birdman Guy is?

796
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,660
The guy from fresh, I mean
fresh from the hot boys. Yes.

797
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,880
And uh, apparently that is like
the number one guy in the car game.

798
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,080
You know what that means?
Like he always has the freshest cars,

799
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,950
got his cars or read articles
about him and dub magazine.

800
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,780
You should do all the money from juvie.

801
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,140
He gets like $1 million worth of
cars every year plus every year.

802
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:07,460
Just new cars constantly hooks him up.
Make some like super stereos,

803
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,430
bad ass rims. Customizers
custom colors, like a white,

804
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,340
like a white rapper that
you were talking about.

805
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,980
This guy's in the video with them
so that he's in the video and this,

806
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:22,930
there's this new guy and he's like, who
in the club doesn't give a fuck? Like,

807
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,500
that's like essentially the song.

808
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,220
And the guy's like got all these crazy
tattoos all over his body and I'm looking

809
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:32,300
at this bird man guy and he has
this star tattooed on his head.

810
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,130
He's got like something
tattooed on his face.

811
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:37,820
He's got like teardrops tattooed and he's
got a star tattooed on the top of his

812
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:40,210
head. And I can watch him. Yeah,

813
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,200
he's the recent images you want because
I'm sure he gets tattooed a lot. Um,

814
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,410
you know, he's, he just crashed. Fuck.

815
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,660
And I'm watching this parental controls.

816
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,390
I'm watching brian.com, by the
way. What am I searching for? Oh,

817
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:57,500
you're searching for refreshes.
Butthole Birdman, tattoos. Uh,

818
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:02,090
top of head looked for that. Um, and
I'm, I'm watching this. I'm like, wow,

819
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,270
this is some crazy music.
I'm like,

820
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:08,420
I wonder what my grandfather would think
if my grandfather who came here from

821
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:11,540
Italy, you know, in the
1930s I think he came,

822
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:15,260
maybe it was the 1920s came to America
from Italy. I wonder, you know,

823
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:17,870
he was like innocent Natera
and shade go over his house.

824
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:20,630
They would be playing opera music.
I wonder what,

825
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,800
how alien that would be for him to like,
if he could be my age,

826
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:28,310
if he could be in his 40 sitting in
front of the TV watching absolutely

827
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:30,770
hysterically. I bet he'd think
it was a joke. I bet he'd go,

828
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,040
I bet he'd look at it and go,

829
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,800
oh, I like really go get a gut laugh and
go, I can't believe this is all areas.

830
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,010
I don't think you would've taken
it that well. Birdman Tattoo.

831
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,490
No, don't put butthole in that
fucker. All right. Hey, Brian.

832
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,760
Brian Olive Garden there. I already
said it. Now you can't say it.

833
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,280
Go Fuck Yourself. How about that?
Huh? Are you kidding me? Yeah.

834
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,910
He's got a bunch sometimes too far east
as west. Isn't that nuts, homeboy? Crazy.

835
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,470
That's wild,
man.

836
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:05,880
He's got stars tattooed all what the
like look at this guy like writing on his

837
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:10,620
head, man. Hit Him and get
get some more face tattoos.

838
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:14,160
W W we've got face tattoos cause I think
he's got something big on his cheek to

839
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,560
man. I was, I was doing,

840
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,570
I was googling Wayne's tattoos because
Wayne's tattoos are crazy to little

841
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:21,271
Wayne.
Oh yeah.

842
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:24,600
Those guys are and then I got into the
UFC guy with the swastika tattooed on his

843
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:28,280
stomach. You know what I'm talking about
and know who got a sweat look at it.

844
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,970
No backup one Brian

845
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,243
God.

846
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,130
But not her. Not Him, but there was
one, there was birdman is above you.

847
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:40,770
It's above you right there.

848
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:45,480
See that click that bird birdman
is the lighter skin black ball. Oh,

849
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:47,610
you've got fucked. This is probably
not what you're looking for,

850
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,610
but here's the virus bitch. I
have, oh wait, you have a Mac.

851
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:53,400
The virus just don't work.
Amazing.

852
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,000
How many PC people want to
still stick with pcs after that?

853
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,760
Just due to trust me man. The moment,
the numbers of Mac users moment,

854
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,360
they get up to a certain amount
where it's worthy of their time.

855
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:08,520
Then they'll start writing viruses
we need to do worthy of their time.

856
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,420
Don't understand, but they don't have it
now. Dummy. What kit? What do you care?

857
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:16,370
You don't can get them now where
there's no viruses. That's better. Whoa.

858
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,430
That's now. There's another side
of his head. The other side.

859
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:20,510
It's got a bunch of shit
too. I would say. Got,

860
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,000
got someone that's cheek right there.
That one right there. Boom. Fucking shit.

861
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,270
I'd love to be as nurse if he
was in a coma and just read him.

862
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,740
Read them. Yeah. Like just look at his
body while he's out. Like, Oh yeah.

863
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:35,790
So you don't have to worry about him and
just read everything about his body and

864
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,260
have one of his friends to explain,
oh,

865
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:42,261
CMH is the neighborhood in New Orleans
who grew up in this cash money hose.

866
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,340
It's a weird way of living, man.
I mean, they, they're making, uh,

867
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,210
like they're making a living,

868
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:56,340
a sensational one out of just live in big.
I mean that's what they're offering.

869
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,310
They're talking about how big they live
and showing you how they don't give a

870
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:02,700
fuck getting tattoos and their head
driving around Bentleys. What bitch?

871
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,590
Literally. Yeah, exactly.
Stop me. Stop me from women.

872
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,170
I dare you fucking face.
That's before the stars on the head.

873
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,700
Yeah. That's the one man. He's got
something. He's got something crying.

874
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
He's killed three rain belts cheat that
you're not catching in that picture.

875
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,040
I have something written on his cheek.
It's hard to see in that picture,

876
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,630
but in the video you kind of see it,

877
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,630
you know essentially got
writing all over his face.

878
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,980
He's really does have
writing over his face. He's

879
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,890
a wild dude. I'm just wanting to get a
tattoo lately. What do you want to get?

880
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,260
How about that squirrel with
a beer. Huh? I would have,

881
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,050
I would have to get done sleeved.
What was your first one?

882
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,930
You didn't have any on
news radio, right? No,

883
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,000
I had one that I got the graphics logo.
I remember

884
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,700
there's like a demon with a
jester's hat on. I was a retard.

885
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,230
I was like 23 or something like that.
When I got that,

886
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,190
I was such a dummy and I still
have it. Yeah, you still have it.

887
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,320
I, for some reason I thought
you kind of covered up.

888
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,990
Oh, shut up. I drew it
actually. That's right.

889
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,340
I had a guy,

890
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,260
it's actually a pretty
cool tattoo for 1980 89.

891
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,840
I drew that in.
Uh,

892
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,190
fuck.

893
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,280
I drew that in whatever
it was when I had it done.

894
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,140
I guess it was probably
like 1990 or something.

895
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,770
I guess it's not a good idea to
mix electricity. Uh, with the,

896
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,230
the new stadium.
Everything's under control.

897
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,280
We've got it handled. What are you
doing your next hour? I don't know man.

898
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,713
Hopefully soon.

899
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,010
Louis C K style. I like
the way he's doing it, man.

900
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:55,950
He's just releasing it on the Internet.
That's really the smart way to do it.

901
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,610
We want to figure out if there's a
way to do that. Five bucks, two bucks,

902
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,590
five bucks. You get stream
it live or it doesn't matter.

903
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,210
He doesn't have to be live.
You know,

904
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:09,180
you should be able to just get it whenever
you want it and then just make it a

905
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:12,900
podcast. But a paid born on
iTunes, like a rental, you know,

906
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,780
that's sort of a good idea.
But I would have to like,

907
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:18,060
I would have to set it up correctly.
Can I tell you,

908
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,180
I mean maybe cameras and you know,
make sure it's directed well. You know,

909
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:24,450
that's kind of a part of a standup is
like when you watch a standup special,

910
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,220
what's really cool is a special,

911
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:29,460
but what's really underrated is like all
the people that do it behind the scenes.

912
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,390
Like the guy who directs the UFC is a very
good friend of mine, Anthony Giordano,

913
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:36,390
and he's the one who did my, uh,
my special too. But I'm like,

914
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,940
he's a guy who understands like
how to make something look cool,

915
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:42,540
how to cut things, how to shoot things.
Like, you know, bring some life to it.

916
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,640
Not just here to record this but
record this and put it into focus in an

917
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:49,890
artistic way that makes it more exciting.
Yeah.

918
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,250
So I have to have fraud and I were
talking about doing dates together in

919
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:56,370
February. Oh really? That's awesome.
When I was going to do it, I don't know.

920
00:49:56,371 --> 00:50:00,420
I think uh, Dorfman's brother,
uh, I love half Ron. He's great.

921
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,060
He's a great guy to have on the
road with you too. Great Guy.

922
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,220
He's and he's put together.
What's that?

923
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,880
Well,
nothing microphone me.

924
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,530
Yeah.
Am I talking into it wrong?

925
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,830
So yeah, we were talking
about doing dates in February.

926
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,030
You turn it that way on
purpose. Did I? Yeah.

927
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,030
You were getting really upset
during when we were talking earlier.

928
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:27,500
Blacked out Bro. He all over the
table. It's all over. Remember? No,

929
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,550
I don't imagine

930
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,660
you had a boat. Get a huge bonus. Do
you guys were tidy? Whities no, I don't.

931
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,510
I've been going back to the tighter ones
lately because I did boxers for like 10

932
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:41,330
or 15 years, but it was just
too dangerous. You know,

933
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:43,730
boxers entangled with your dig and
you're like waking up and you're like,

934
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:47,320
why is my Dick like asleep? And then
you realize your boxers all wrapped up

935
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,760
tidy whities style.

936
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:51,090
But I wear black underwear because
I don't want to see my farts

937
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,990
splatter paint, all want
to be reminded of it. Look,

938
00:50:55,991 --> 00:51:00,310
this is just a part of being a human
being. We've got to be. That's that whole,

939
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:01,750
that shit comes out of that.

940
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:04,540
Occasionally air doesn't leak out of
there and occasionally it stains your

941
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:08,740
underwear. Are we playing games here?
Why are you giving me white underwear?

942
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:13,660
Is this a fucking test that I can't
win? Is this a test I cannot. Yes. Yeah.

943
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:16,750
There's this yellow by my Dick.
This cause my Dick drips pissed.

944
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,850
What am I supposed to do? Get toilet
paper out and dammit. No, I'm a man.

945
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,820
I stick it back in my pants and then we
clean the fucking underwear and then a

946
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,810
couple months I buy new pairs.
That's right. Amen. Amen.

947
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,880
Black ones and I don't
need a fucking hole.

948
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:35,360
Somebody please provide a solid pair
of underwear thing. Dick Nicole is.

949
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,950
It's just more embarrassing than anything.

950
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:41,370
Like you're fucking like getting a ups
guy looks of your penis and the only way

951
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,840
you should use that vehicles.
If you have

952
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,000
ugly balls, if you have some
like pomegranate looking balls,

953
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,510
you have some deal breaker
balls. You're like, listen baby,

954
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,310
I got a pretty deck but I got some balls.

955
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,270
It'll scare the fucking paint
off your car. You don't want to,

956
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,900
you don't want to scare off the listen
baby. You can see my balls eventually,

957
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:04,790
but right now it's just a beautiful day.
It's a glowing sort of passion, lust.

958
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,880
But then you see the balls and
they just like troll eyeball.

959
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,560
The halls are horrible and they drip
the leaking. My balls are so bad.

960
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,750
How bad are there bad? What's
wrong with them? They're,

961
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,780
the ball stops at like say like four
inches five but the scrotum keeps going.

962
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,260
That's because you have a lot of
potential for manliness and it is,

963
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,130
is it's like say if you went to a
surgeon and they were going to give you

964
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:28,941
artificial breasts,

965
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,730
they would make a nice deep pocket
for a good set of double D's.

966
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,940
You gotta create some space and that's
what it is. You just got a lot of room.

967
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,170
Nice. I, it makes me feel a lot better
about my balls to do that by giant balls.

968
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,270
You can be totally running
shit. That'd be great. If a man,

969
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
a doctor told you that he could give
you a them examine. He's like, man,

970
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:47,330
you're gonna be a great man. This is what
he has to say about a lot of potential.

971
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,940
It should be the greatest
American ever measure.

972
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,090
Potential ball size when it counts in
America has, how big are your balls?

973
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:57,570
That's really what we admire and if you
really want to get real well we admire

974
00:52:57,571 --> 00:52:59,860
is how big are your balls? What
are you willing to do? Yeah.

975
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,570
How crazy he wanted to get. That's
why I shall look. Jackass works.

976
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:05,390
That's why you know standup comedy works.
That's why fighting works.

977
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,990
That's why anything crazy, crazy.
Are you willing to, again, I like,

978
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,250
I was watching this show where they were
talking about his guy who died recently,

979
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:15,260
who is a professional snowboarder.

980
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,240
Apparently he caused an avalanche and
I think I heard about this guy. Yeah.

981
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,790
You know, or I believe it was. I mean
it's happened more than one time.

982
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:26,160
You know where these like extreme
athletes, they go back home.

983
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,540
Try dropped off in a helicopter. Yeah man.
I like Whoa. Like what the fuck? Yeah,

984
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,040
that's, that's as real as it gets. Oh
d two for a sport. Have you seen you,

985
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,130
I think our only reason I, I take this,
I say I say to you, have you seen,

986
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,360
but the only reason I probably saw it as,

987
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:41,220
cause it'd be your news feed on Twitter.

988
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,280
Have you seen the guy in the squirrel
outfit jump off the fucking thing and Ms.

989
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,840
Brown miss the ground by like six
fucking Oh my God. It's incredible.

990
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:50,450
And he's going a hundred miles an hour.
Oh,

991
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,180
that is one of the most amazing
videos I've ever seen. Insane.

992
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,180
What are those called?
Is Wingstop at squirl up as well?

993
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,880
I think they're called squirrel shoots.
That's what it looks like.

994
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,680
It was like a flying school.
Yeah. It's incredible.

995
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,470
It's one of the baddest things I've
ever seen in my life is you'd have to be

996
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,920
absolutely fucking fearless to
do that because one mistake,

997
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:11,760
one miscalculation of the terrain.
Yeah. Well you don't pull up in time.

998
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:15,690
And you slam into the fucking mountain.
You're getting a hundred miles an hour.

999
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:19,680
You are following that is that
is a game changer. A crazy idea.

1000
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,800
Who is the mother fucker
that tested that out? Oh,

1001
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,540
that it was when I jumped out of a
plane with Rachael Ray. I did the,

1002
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,230
I was fucking hardcore
panicked, but I was like, man,

1003
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:34,440
when you're screaming at the
earth at a hundred miles an hour,

1004
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,300
there is a fucking surreal moment where
you go, all right, this is it. Oh my God.

1005
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,940
If this shoe doesn't open,

1006
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:45,990
it doesn't open and I die with some
dudes strapped on me like a rape harness.

1007
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,320
Some horrible fucking in Rachel
Ray Goes Home Pi. That's a guy.

1008
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,640
Rachel is like a gangster
and Rachel does I ship? Yeah,

1009
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,750
he's got my back permanently
stapled to your back.

1010
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,410
He's literally harnessed into
where you can't get, you couldn't,

1011
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,520
you can't get rid of the guy.

1012
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,430
And it's the most uncomfortable position
to have a man in sitting on a man's

1013
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:08,430
Dick in the,
on the flight up to get to 13,000 feet.

1014
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,760
So you can jump out and you're having,

1015
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:10,800
you're trying to have
your own little moment,

1016
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:12,930
but you've got some East German
with his arms around you.

1017
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:17,170
Hold onto you like go and let's,
let's start you up. Tighten up what a,

1018
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,950
what a crazy fucking activity you.

1019
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:23,880
But that is 26 people died and there
was like 2006 was a little last year.

1020
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:26,280
We looked at it, an alarming
amount of people die. Skydiving.

1021
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,060
An alarming like when you wait, not
that morning. I woke up, I was in the,

1022
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:34,170
I was at the W in, in Union
Square, beautiful hotel.

1023
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,000
And I think what could go wrong,

1024
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:39,020
I'm going to just check the odds and
see how many people die skydiving.

1025
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,460
And there were like up to this
year. Mind you. I was like, Jay,

1026
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,230
it's like fucking August and they're
like 46 and I was like 40 fucking six.

1027
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,240
That's a lot of people like that.
I'm not comfortable with those odds.

1028
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:54,660
And that is in a year in a year here and
then you two and then you see a video,

1029
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:57,810
they show you a video and they go the,
it's a, it's an old dude and he goes,

1030
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,750
you have to know you're entering
into an activity that you,

1031
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:05,100
that will is likely to cause death. You
May die today and you're like, wait,

1032
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:08,310
why would I want to do this? It's not
that cool. Yeah, it's not that fun.

1033
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,450
Like I don't want to fucking die.

1034
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,150
But then you do it and you land and you
live and there is a week where you feel

1035
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:20,151
like you have a secret that no one knows
like a fucking week where you are the

1036
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:22,950
most powerful human being in your head.

1037
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:27,130
You see movies where a guy's
running across the top of
the thing in in your head,

1038
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:30,120
you go, I could do that. I jumped out
of a fucking plane. Like you really,

1039
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:34,990
you feel limitless, you feel like you've,
you've climbed the tallest mountain,

1040
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:38,290
new jumped out of a fucking plane
and you live, you, you beat the odds,

1041
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:40,730
you fucking one. And then you
get addicted to that. And like,

1042
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,750
like I know Rachel and I have
been doing some crazy shit,

1043
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,520
like just doing some bizarre shit lately.

1044
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,820
And in February we're going swimming with
sharks and I was like in the cage and

1045
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,980
she goes, fuck it out of
the cage. So we're doing,

1046
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:53,800
going swimming with sharks out of the
cage and then we're going to do what's

1047
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,900
going on with you and Rachel
Ray's been doing, I mean,

1048
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,240
we could do a lot of Jaeger bombs
and then like, you're like, hey,

1049
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:03,150
let's do these ever black out really
nice wine. I have blacked out. Rachel.

1050
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:08,110
Ray's being on you. No, no, no, no,
I'm definitely, we party black car.

1051
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:10,090
You blacked out with her
before we partied in Mexico.

1052
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,150
Meet her and her husband and we killed it.
I killed.

1053
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:16,480
I will say I cause I don't want to fucking
thing anyone to think that she drinks

1054
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,730
a lot,
but I murdered some wine,

1055
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,780
nice wine and her in her room and
her husband listen to comb your hair.

1056
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,290
Did he come here to suck?
Cock hold story. Very cool.

1057
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,790
Very cool.
Do you want to keep the party going?

1058
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,390
You have to tell no tales.
I understand. Listen,

1059
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,430
I wouldn't, I would do this exact same
thing. I Love Rachel and I love John.

1060
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,100
Who Doesn't love Rachel Maddow,
whatever names current.

1061
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:44,170
Her husband makes me some Lasagna
and we're in a hotel room.

1062
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,530
I'm not going to like fuck the guy. She
looks like she's got a great personality.

1063
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,510
She's a lot of fun.
She's a human being.

1064
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:52,150
She just seems like like a fun
person to be around. She's a blast.

1065
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:54,760
She doesn't seem negative at all.
Not at one part. Yeah, I haven't.

1066
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,490
I don't think I hear it.
She's a rare person too.

1067
00:57:57,491 --> 00:58:00,520
That's like a celebrity that you don't
hear people criticizing that much.

1068
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,610
I don't really hear people talk shit about
Rachael Ray. No one really liked her.

1069
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,860
She's great. She has a loft
down in Soho. You go over,

1070
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,020
she has parties really and
videotaped the whole shit.

1071
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,200
She for her show and then she'll like
cut the cameras and they show up.

1072
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,060
Let's talk shit. I saw Ricky Gervais'
here the night like me, just,

1073
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,860
just like really gospel has comedy,
comedy and she loves comedy.

1074
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,230
She fucking loves comedy
and I guarantee you,

1075
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,080
I guarantee you she's on a treadmill
or an elliptical right now listening to

1076
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:27,820
those shit. If you had another life. I
love these. I love these. If you know,

1077
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:31,480
if young Burt had gone left
instead of right one day,

1078
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:34,630
you know it just spike
some weird stroke of luck.

1079
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:38,770
A 30 year old Bert meets a, who knows
how old she was and you're both Sangal.

1080
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,500
Yeah. Let me think, man. It's happening.

1081
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:46,240
You think like if we're not famous, if
you guys had met, no, no, not on payments,

1082
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:49,820
but I'm like saying like just a parallel
universes. I meet her at a Bar, right?

1083
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,220
All Dream Girl. She dreams.
She's mothers. Will your wife,

1084
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,860
I know my wife's listening. You, your
mother, your mother. Do you want me this?

1085
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,990
Rachel's and kind of chick that you
who he's got a son. I've got a son.

1086
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,383
You don't know about him yet.

1087
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,060
Oh my God.

1088
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:14,190
She's the kind of chick that I will say
that any dude that met her in a bar with

1089
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:16,300
lug it in a heartbeat.
She's so cool.

1090
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:21,260
Does your wife that you talk about her
like this damn, cause there's nothing.

1091
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,580
You can't say anything
bad about it or like,

1092
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,200
and usually I'm pretty honest
about everyone and, and I,

1093
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,880
and I'll find something that I go, yeah,
but you wouldn't like this about it.

1094
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:31,700
But with Rachel it's like everything
you love, you love everything about her.

1095
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:35,480
She's cool. She fucking gets it. Like,
or you can tell a joke, they're like,

1096
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:36,950
we got two bodyguards,
you go to Mexico,

1097
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:41,480
we each got bodyguards and then
as those Gary, oh so great.

1098
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,930
And so, and I told her, I said, what
does that, who were the bodyguards?

1099
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,800
Mine was Edgar and hers was,

1100
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:49,940
I think his words were worried that the
body guards of like sold information

1101
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,700
cause they've seen birth to conquer
and they want you to do a bunch of shit

1102
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:57,200
around their house. I haven't dealt with
cartels. I didn't speak any English. No,

1103
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,410
none. But I see it as a joke. I go, oh,

1104
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,280
let's take our body guards down
to the beach and make them fight.

1105
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,300
And she laughed. She was
like, oh, it'll be fucking
hilarious. Like, like as a joke.

1106
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,870
Right, right. But you tell it to some
people in the industry and they'd be like,

1107
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,840
come on man, let's not be disrespectful.
They're working very hard.

1108
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,600
They tell you the politically right
answer. She just laughed and she's like,

1109
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,270
that'd be funny. Like just
a real cool, wait a minute.

1110
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,390
You're talking about two trained
killers to train killers.

1111
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,370
It's natural to see which
one would kill the other one.

1112
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,090
I wanted to track them down at the beach.
She's her correct and her interest.

1113
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:27,890
And so you,
it doesn't mean they should do it.

1114
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,560
And then we get to pistol whip the loser.
Whoa.

1115
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,030
That's where you want to cross the
line, Mr. Not with me. Really. Aw. Aw.

1116
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,790
Come on man. We're in
Mexico. Shit's going down.

1117
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,820
What do you do you think it's weird that
there's a third world country that's

1118
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:43,340
connected to us? I
mean, how crazy is that?

1119
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:48,170
The way where we got fucking everything
over in Afghanistan right now.

1120
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,130
You know, think about all the soldiers
we have over there. Meanwhile,

1121
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,670
right next door is a third world
country with a drug war going on.

1122
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,030
It's like having ripped arms
and a perfect uh, chest,

1123
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:03,230
but then just a gut like no in a
rotten ass hole and a small Dick,

1124
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,700
a broken small deck, small digs. It
doesn't even work. Like we cut it off.

1125
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,940
Like it goes, it goes, it goes money,
money, money, money, money, money.

1126
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,440
Like you do not get the mother's money
in Mexico, but you know, the, the big

1127
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,140
Mexico City and stuff like that.
I mean,

1128
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,500
there's really nice sections
in Mexico City. We were,

1129
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,260
we were saying that Miguel de Allende
and it was a very fucking nice,

1130
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,220
they showed the Hbo Special, uh, the 24,

1131
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:27,730
seven with Pacquiao and Marquez
and they showed like Mexico City,

1132
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:31,090
like Mexico City is like a real city,
you know, it's a, it's a, a high entity.

1133
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:34,660
It's fucking huge. I think Mexico City is
the biggest city. In fact in the world.

1134
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,780
It's really high up.
The altitude is high shit.

1135
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,780
I'm guessing it might
have just made that up.

1136
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,060
I know that the air quality
there is fucking terrible.

1137
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:46,300
It's really hard to break it
to smog issue. It's real bad.

1138
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:49,600
This is more people in Mexico City I
think than any other city in the world.

1139
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:53,050
I might be out of line though. I think
it's close though. Whatever it is. It's,

1140
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:55,750
it's top. It's right up there. But it's
bigger than any of the American cities.

1141
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,850
It's a massive fucking city.
Yeah,

1142
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:02,650
it's got one and I mean you figure our,
the quality of life there has got to be,

1143
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:05,750
it's got a soccer well in some
areas. Yeah. It's, I mean we,

1144
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,660
they showed one main wall.
Mark has his place,

1145
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:12,210
like he had fucking a Mercedes and a
Porsche. How do you have that right next?

1146
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:16,420
All that shit. You got to live dangerously
with sun, you know, because you're,

1147
01:02:16,421 --> 01:02:19,890
you're flaunting in front of
a large population, half nots.

1148
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,690
Oh Lord.

1149
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:24,880
Population of have nots. Who Don't, who?
I'm a man. I'm assuming there have nots

1150
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,410
10 times worse than our have.
The difference between, um, uh,

1151
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,910
Marquez who's rich in America.
You know,

1152
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:35,740
one Limo Marquez is a world champion
boxer, a famous athlete in his country,

1153
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,560
loved by millions of people.
One of the, you know,

1154
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:42,370
tough his boxers on the fucking
planet in this country, in America,

1155
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:47,500
he's rich as fuck in America.
He's made millions of dollars in Mexico.

1156
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:52,120
That must be staggering. Like the
difference between him and you know,

1157
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,320
you know, in America him and a
minimum wage worker is substantial,

1158
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,610
but it's almost,
you could see it in the distance possible.

1159
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:04,300
Insurmountable in Mexico.
Mexico is insurmountable.
It's insane. It's impossible.

1160
01:03:04,301 --> 01:03:07,410
How could someone stay in Mexico
and you know, and you know,

1161
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,600
what are the percentages of earning the
amount of money that this guys are like,

1162
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:14,770
this is insane. And so for him to be
flaunting light it in Mexico is like, wow,

1163
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:17,270
that's a, it seemed to me, I don't
know anything about the college

1164
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,690
really talking about my last bet, I
bet seemed extravagant, but I bet,

1165
01:03:20,691 --> 01:03:25,691
well we're not putting into this
is that he is a Mexican hero.

1166
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,100
He's a hero.

1167
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,130
No one's fucking with him because he
is the golden boy to them because he

1168
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:35,510
represents them every fucking day.
The, the guy who came from nothing.

1169
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,850
You got somewhere.
And I bet that is what keeps him safe.

1170
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,070
I bet no one touches him cause they go,
they go,

1171
01:03:40,071 --> 01:03:43,460
what are we going to fucking take
away? Or, or, or Adam Rodriguez,

1172
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:46,110
whatever the fuck guys name is baseball
and Menlo Marcus, I don't know,

1173
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,420
element like our Derek Jeter.

1174
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:52,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is, you know, he's
a, he's a bad ass mother fucker. You know,

1175
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:55,630
he and he like fights for the pride
of Mexico to along with it. Yeah.

1176
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,190
And he's a Mexican boxer man. Mexican
boxers are fucking gangster. Punched me.

1177
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,320
Beat me somebody.
Why you will not stop.

1178
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:02,901
Yeah.

1179
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:06,140
There has been some of the best fighters
ever as Julio Cesar Chavez in his prime

1180
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,040
is probably one of my all time favorite
boxers to watch cause he would just beat

1181
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,080
dude's down with like volume punching.

1182
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,200
He wouldn't punch like
even like full blast.

1183
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:18,110
100% wouldn't you like eight
engage in wild slug fest.

1184
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:22,690
He would just fucking and methodically
move and throw Beaton's on dudes and hit

1185
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:27,290
him with body shots and break guys just
slowly, slowly break guys. You know.

1186
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:29,270
And even guys there were
two more talented than him.

1187
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:30,980
Like did you see the
Meldrick Taylor fight?

1188
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,170
Wait, metal teller tellers.
The guy who can barely speak.

1189
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:39,230
Yeah Dude. Yeah. Don't do
what a fight. That was what
our board where it was. Yeah,

1190
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,930
I did see that. Taylor was
boxing. Julio, Cesar Chavez,

1191
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:47,820
his face off for most of the 12 round
fight. And then towards the end,

1192
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,380
Chavez connects and starts connecting
on them in the final round and nails and

1193
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:54,090
with a right hand and drop some.

1194
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:58,170
He gets up with like three seconds to
go or something crazy like that on the

1195
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:01,500
clock. Richard Steele waves
it off and he calls the fight.

1196
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,130
So Chavez came from this
beating but as young,

1197
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,810
incredibly fast,

1198
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:11,880
like technically sound Olympic boxer or
he was just getting lit up and it looked

1199
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:15,750
like, wow, you know, he's just too good.
It's too good, you know, he's too fast.

1200
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:19,240
But Chavez just slowly kept
methodically breaking them down,

1201
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,720
slowly breaking down to the body
and then eventually overcame them.

1202
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:26,010
And the very last seconds of the
fight overcame him and it would,

1203
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,120
would've for sure stopped him if
Richard Steele would make him,

1204
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,610
made him stand up again, it didn't
matter. He would have stopped him.

1205
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,040
He would have jumped on him again.
Eight seconds is not enough.

1206
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,070
He would have last and he was
done or whatever it was. It was,

1207
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,520
it was two or one seconds. It was the
right call. Meldrick Taylor was fucked up.

1208
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:42,820
He was pissing blood and
he was never the same again

1209
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,490
and he's,
and if you watch videos of him,

1210
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:48,000
he starts with a dip pronounced
that stagger and stuttered.

1211
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:53,070
Well that is one of the most like w like
obvious examples of a fighter who has a

1212
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,430
really tough fight,

1213
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,240
like an all time epic battle and
then essentially never reaches that.

1214
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,780
That performance level again, you don't
know whether or not it's physical,

1215
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:05,030
like it took a lot out of their body,
which you know,

1216
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:08,740
that does play a factor of a real
big beating like that. Like that,

1217
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,850
I mean a real war that can really,

1218
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:13,310
those body shots at Chavez hit
him with over and over again.

1219
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,170
That can really wreck havoc on you.

1220
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,380
And then you also got to consider his
motivation when a guy gets beat up,

1221
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,250
sometimes they don't have the zest and
the fire that they had when they were

1222
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:25,070
undefeated and they thought they
were unstoppable. That's me. Yeah,

1223
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:29,420
piss strong dudes, man. They just talking,
you know, young and full of confidence.

1224
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,650
They got the world and they feel like
there's, I run into so many guys,

1225
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:34,550
especially in the UFC,

1226
01:06:34,551 --> 01:06:39,230
these young guys with this incredible
confidence and incredible confidence,

1227
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,470
and then you see them
have a really tough fight.

1228
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,490
You'll see them have a really tough fight
and then you'll see a marine gauge and

1229
01:06:46,491 --> 01:06:49,070
sort of look at this a little bit
different and go, okay, you know what?

1230
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,410
Everybody's vulnerable. Okay,
let's not get crazy here.

1231
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,750
Let's not do something stupid.
You're going to do this.

1232
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:56,360
Let's do this intelligently.
And the ones that think that way,

1233
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,910
they have a long life in the
sport and the ones that don't,

1234
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,360
those are the ones that, you know, they,

1235
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:04,910
they have a few epic contests where
they essentially have a really,

1236
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:07,790
really difficult time recovering from,
whether it's psychologically,

1237
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:10,580
whether it's physically, you know,
those really, really tough ones.

1238
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:11,870
Those are the hard ones
to come back from it.

1239
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,230
Getting your oil,
you have one.

1240
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,040
Well I think it is, but it's important
for people to, it's a humility thing.

1241
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:21,190
You need to know that that's possible
to you. You can't always be the hammer.

1242
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,820
And for a lot of young, fast people,
especially a lot of young athletic people,

1243
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:26,300
they're always the hammer and
it used to be in the hammer.

1244
01:07:26,301 --> 01:07:28,450
You're terrified of being
in the nail, you know, once,

1245
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,900
once you've taken some shots before and
you understand like this is a give and

1246
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:32,830
receive bitch,

1247
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,680
this isn't just to give and sometimes
you're going to get fucked up.

1248
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,950
Just like the way you like to fuck up
other people. Sometimes you're going,

1249
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,240
as long as we can accept
that and understand that,

1250
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:43,270
then you can look at this whole thing
rationally and instead of thinking,

1251
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:45,910
you know, with this crazy confidence
that you're on top of. So guys,

1252
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:48,970
games change and I could change for the
better or could change for the worst,

1253
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,130
all dependent on how committed
they are to their goal.

1254
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,670
I follow. It was a bad ass at 15
like bad ass. Why'd you think that?

1255
01:07:55,790 --> 01:08:00,280
But I dunno then been beaten up. I was
terrified at 15 really? Very, very, very,

1256
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:04,130
really? Yeah man. And you, I really got
into taekwondo. Yeah, I would didn't,

1257
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,060
I just thought I was tough. I
was big, like I was a bigger kid.

1258
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:11,810
Like I was the in the top of the level
of the height and size and I just thought

1259
01:08:11,811 --> 01:08:12,650
I was tough.
And then,

1260
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:16,040
and then you get your dick knocked in the
dirt a couple of and you're like, okay,

1261
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,370
I got humiliated in what wasn't
really a fight. It wasn't a fight,

1262
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,410
but it was a bigger kid who
just did something to me. No,

1263
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:26,330
he wrestled me to the ground. He thought
he like, like hip toss me to the ground.

1264
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,780
We were just playing around,
you know, like, um, I don't,

1265
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:32,330
I don't remember what started it off.
I wasn't really that friendly with them,

1266
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:33,440
but I was like, Hey, what's up? You know,

1267
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:38,441
it was one of those things and somehow
or another we were in a of the locker

1268
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:40,280
room, like leaving and we got, we,

1269
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,970
we said something and we were joking
around and he pushed me and I pushed it

1270
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:44,160
back.

1271
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,210
We grabbed each other and the hip toss
man on the ground and just laid on top of

1272
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,890
me for a couple seconds
and I couldn't get up.

1273
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:52,640
I got into how to get up and
they let me up and you know,

1274
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,410
he laughed about it and
it wasn't really a fight,

1275
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:58,520
but it was he and humiliated was enough
was you weren't cool with it. I wasn't.

1276
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:02,700
I wasn't cool with the fact that he
could do that. I was like, Shit, fuck.

1277
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:06,470
It threw me on the ground and I couldn't
do it. So then I started wrestling.

1278
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,090
I just, I, that's when I took wrestling.
Seriously. Yeah. Yeah. I was like,

1279
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,210
that was ridiculous because it was,

1280
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:14,600
I had an inflated sense of what I could
do physically because I thought that

1281
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:17,500
physically I'm a really strong guy.
I know how to strike. Like, you know,

1282
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,150
if anyone's going to want to get in a
fight, I'll fucking kicking in the balls.

1283
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,970
You have all these stupid ideas in your
head of what you're going to do with why

1284
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,833
you're a Badass.

1285
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,210
Then some guy just hip tosses you had
lays on top of you and you're like,

1286
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,300
I can't give this guy off me. Like I
really, I couldn't get him off of me.

1287
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:31,700
I just couldn't.
I had to give up and he let me up.

1288
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,980
It was a huge eye opener, you know?
And then luckily he was a nice guy.

1289
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:40,030
He didn't beat me up or anything
when she had me down. But you know,

1290
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,110
it was a good eye opening message.
That's

1291
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,080
so funny because I,
I'd practiced none of the real striking.

1292
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:49,620
I would practice the talking before
the fight. You were good at that.

1293
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:54,240
I would do it in my
mirror. Yes. I'd be like,

1294
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:56,370
you want to fuck a piece of this?
I'll fuck you up.

1295
01:09:56,371 --> 01:09:58,840
I'll fuck you up three ways from Sunday.
And I'm,

1296
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:03,690
we just practice it and I would like,
like shirt off and like flags every,

1297
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:08,460
every kid did that and every one of our
kids are our guys in like there was a

1298
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:12,780
gang called the caveman. No, no,
no, I wasn't. I wasn't, well, I was,

1299
01:10:12,781 --> 01:10:15,060
I was in the gang Corolla,
the caveman,

1300
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:18,600
there's a gang called the caveman in
Tampa and the cave men were like these

1301
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:21,930
public school kids book from the Rich
Public School. And they were like,

1302
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:25,230
they were, they would just get in
fights all the time with Jesuit kids.

1303
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,480
I went to Jesuit and I was in a get,
and they're not a gang,

1304
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:30,930
but a club called Apu and Ebu
and cave men fall all the time.

1305
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:35,250
So when from like my junior year, until
my senior year, even my sophomore year,

1306
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,590
you always had to be aware of the cavemen.

1307
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,100
And so like you'd go to a party in a
fight would break out and would be the

1308
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:44,910
caveman. And so then that's when I,
I was like, I was like, that's it.

1309
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:46,860
I got to learn how to fight.
But I never really learned how to fight.

1310
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,080
I just learn how to talk shit.
So,

1311
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:53,070
and then as you're opening move
just to be loud and crazy, man,

1312
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,230
let them know that you're
in for some dangerous shit.

1313
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,660
I remember the first time ever
punched someone. It was, uh,

1314
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,920
the first time I ever punched
someone was a black dude. Uh,

1315
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,110
it was the rob that another girl gang,
I think from Robinson.

1316
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:09,660
I think it was called chain again.
No, no, no. I wasn't in a gang.

1317
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,790
I was just going to a club. I was in, Hey,

1318
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,660
a afterschool club at my school
and everyone else had gangs.

1319
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:19,620
But then our afterschool club was the
one that got involved with gangs because

1320
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:21,690
of the, but it wasn't even
gangs. It wasn't any gangs.

1321
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:25,680
It just fucking high school
kids. It wasn't like real
gangs. So nobody got killed.

1322
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:29,340
No one got killed. Just heat up this
fight. Definitely guys got beat up.

1323
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,010
And then there was one like
gang from I think Robinson.

1324
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:36,330
I think they were called TWT together we
foliated with anybody. No, no, no. Yeah.

1325
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:40,500
Well yeah, it was a part of this like
Ebu Group, like the EPA pluribus unum.

1326
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:44,580
It's on the penny that's ours.
Had like some Latin significance to it.

1327
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:48,780
Everyone else TWD together. We thought
so. Cave men. So you were in gang,

1328
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,250
not gang is a very strong
word for what we were.

1329
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:55,650
We were a group of guys who are at
school together who likes guys played

1330
01:11:55,651 --> 01:12:00,651
football and baseball and wrestled and
we were like the cooler guys at our

1331
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:06,110
school and we were in this group called
Gpu that was a sanction group by this

1332
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:10,830
school. You had initiations where you got
paddled and you initiated into it and,

1333
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,810
but it just happens that the one guy,

1334
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,380
the head of EPO in like 1988
got into a fight with a caveman.

1335
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:20,400
And so all the fucking Apu
or is for cavemen, Ebu,

1336
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,920
fought whoever when
Robinson or Hillsborough.

1337
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,190
And so at a young age you realized you
had to stay away from those fucking

1338
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:30,720
people. So the first punch I ever thought,
so it was, I heard a fight is a story.

1339
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,530
I've told him stand up many a time,
but the, the short, the short,

1340
01:12:34,531 --> 01:12:37,680
honest version of it is, and was
at a party, someone you'll fight.

1341
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,430
And I thought all of Ebu, all my
friends were going to come and watch it.

1342
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,150
And I roll out. And it's,
it's one caveman, right?

1343
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:48,660
And the whole TWT together.
We thought posse,

1344
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,390
like it's all black dudes
and one white caveman.

1345
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:54,270
And I stick my head in and I actually
know this cave man. I know, I know who,

1346
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,901
I know his reputation,

1347
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:57,570
but he's unconscious on the fucking
floor because there was Mario,

1348
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,231
he was fighting this guy,

1349
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,950
Donovan and I stuck my head in and second
I stuck my head in. They were like, oh,

1350
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,560
here's his brother, get him to, and
they pushed me in and I was like, well,

1351
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:07,350
I'm not as brother. I know he was friend.
Like we're not, I'm not on anyone's team.

1352
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,810
I'm on a different team like,

1353
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,490
but they think we're on the same team
because we're wearing the away uniforms,

1354
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:12,000
you know,

1355
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
so this guy be the beat the
shit out of me standing.

1356
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,010
Does that make sense? Like I
didn't fall, he didn't kick me,

1357
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,810
but I never at any point did,

1358
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:25,920
it looked like I won and I did a lot
of trying to talk my way out of it.

1359
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,140
But while he was hitting you, you were
trying to talk to him. I was like, man,

1360
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:31,470
I'm not, and you just pounded me.
And he was like, he was like, oh.

1361
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,100
And he was talking shit. Like as he was
fighting me, like I just weird shit.

1362
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:37,680
Like you follow me, you me round them
all mother fucker. And I was like, what?

1363
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:40,320
And he's like, follow me around them all
bitch. See what happens. See what happens.

1364
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,410
This is what's up, this is what's up
and just pop in me. And I was like,

1365
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:46,920
I got the chicken. So the first
punch I ever threw was then, uh,

1366
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,710
and I go to throw a punch,
but I never thought a punch before.

1367
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:54,090
I'd only worked on talking shit.
So my shit talking without door.

1368
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,180
So I'm getting my ass kicked.
So I go to the hole punch by just,

1369
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,200
it was more like a hey, like it
was like a, like a, yeah, like a,

1370
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:05,060
like a stop. Like, Oh,

1371
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,800
you break my heart. They
get, oh, and I literally,

1372
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:12,310
my hand landed in this high top fade.

1373
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,760
It went into his hair. Okay. And, and
I remember thinking to myself in this,

1374
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,650
this is,
the joke is very different than this,

1375
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,880
but the truth is when into his hair.
And I held it there.

1376
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:23,430
So I thought I'd never talked to a
black person's hair before and I,

1377
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:26,230
Collagen moved my fingers around
a little bit. He didn't move.

1378
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,410
And then all of a sudden the
cop showed up. Oh my God.

1379
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,670
When the cop showed up and then all the
fucking brothers fucking took off except

1380
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:36,120
for this guy, the cop showed up because
they knew there was a fight going on.

1381
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:39,880
Cops showed up. Tuesday, odd cars,
conscious two squad cars, two rednecks.

1382
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:43,840
And the other guy is still out cold. I'll
fucking cold. Would they do to him? Uh,

1383
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,080
he was just laying on the ground.
He's the lanes you got there he is.

1384
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:49,330
He'd already been knocked down.
He was that guy when I stuck my head in,

1385
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:54,160
he was unconscious. And this Guy Donovan,
who is standing over him, beating him,

1386
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:56,930
pummeling him though. And I fucking
stuck my head in, thank God I did.

1387
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,380
The kid might be dead, but I stuck
my head in and I was like, oh,

1388
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:01,930
I don't want any of that. What? He
ordered it. I'll take something else.

1389
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:05,800
That kind of damage when a guy's out
and a guy gets beat up while he's out

1390
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,920
kicked his head. Like sometimes
people never recover. Yeah.

1391
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,910
That dude that got really fucked up
and a in La Dodgers. Dodgers. Same.

1392
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:17,020
Yeah, cause he was wearing, I guess he
was wearing another Jersey from another.

1393
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,530
I should have scares them. Who knows.
I mean maybe he did other things.

1394
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't know why they beat his ass,

1395
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,530
but they definitely shouldn't
have done what they did.

1396
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,600
What they did was horrific man.
It was a nightmare.

1397
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,080
I have no idea how that guy behaved,
but you know they need,

1398
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,640
obviously they need more security.

1399
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:34,450
There's no way they should be allowing
that many people that do a place like

1400
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:38,110
that to a position where that kind of
shit can happen. Oh the dodger stadium.

1401
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:42,860
Sketchy. Tighten that down man. You know
when a guy gets beat down like that,

1402
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:46,390
like shit man, you, you need to be
able to protect people from thugs.

1403
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,180
There should be out fucking guy.
Code numbers are too high.

1404
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:51,880
What this first of all
those people or who?

1405
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,390
Anybody who would do that as a sick fuck
and you know what we're having here man,

1406
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:59,260
it's, it's a classic example of people
not caring about terrible neighborhoods.

1407
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,340
Those terrible neighborhoods have more
kids come out of him and more kids come

1408
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:06,250
out of them. They want to do fucked up
things and that just the way it goes,

1409
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:09,520
it's not part of the country. You know
what, that's a very accurate statement.

1410
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:10,060
Cause I,

1411
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:14,590
the other day I realized I don't judge
a man based on his skin color in the

1412
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,740
slightest.
I judge them based on their age.

1413
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,810
Age is the most fucking determining
factor when we were in Amsterdam. Dude,

1414
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,420
a lot of smart young dudes,
man.

1415
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,110
I mean there's a lot more today I
think than I've ever met in the past.

1416
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,040
I meet dudes that are like 20 years old
that are on the fucking ball and that

1417
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:34,060
does happen, but it's a lot. You know
who's throwing punches at bars and bars?

1418
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,240
20 year olds.
It's always going to be that man.

1419
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,600
He's always gonna be a
certain percentage of them,

1420
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:40,780
but I think not a lot of 39 year
olds stolen fucking sucker punches.

1421
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,980
He's there are planning some losers.
It never got it together. Yeah man.

1422
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:47,160
You underestimate.
There's a lot of good of Vegas.

1423
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:51,070
Go ahead and hang out in those fucking
crap dens and watch the degenerate

1424
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,370
gamblers head of the horse track.
You know there's,

1425
01:16:53,371 --> 01:16:56,830
there's plenty of 30 and nine year old
man. She can't share anything. Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:01,840
They're just tired or less white and I'm
happy you don't have the gumption ended

1427
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:02,921
quicker.
Yeah.

1428
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:05,790
They just got the gumption to get up
and give me a fucking ass kicking.

1429
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,570
It really depends on what
they ate for lunch. Yeah.

1430
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,010
They might've had a
burrito and they just got

1431
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,220
no energy and they're just ready to shit
their pants. The Guy Talk Shit to you.

1432
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:15,140
When was the last time
a guy talk shit to you?

1433
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,790
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it happens, you
know, it hasn't happened in a lot of time.

1434
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:23,210
Most people were really nice
to me. I'm very lucky, you
know, when people say like,

1435
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:26,090
what's the downside to, you know, people
knowing who you are when you go to the,

1436
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,800
like a stranger or
somebody paid to do that.

1437
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,850
A stranger,
what the fuck are you eating Dick?

1438
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:38,360
Who paid to do that?
Thank God you're broadcasting meeting DMT.

1439
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,860
So yeah. You haven't had, you
haven't had a confrontation?

1440
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:49,870
No. People are generally cool. Did you
ever think I'm nice? You know, I think,

1441
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,750
you know,
if you come to me with some sort of a,

1442
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,050
a predetermined idea of who I am or you
know what you think about something I

1443
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:59,470
said once and you know,
you're angry at me, dad,

1444
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,650
it's probably not gonna be a fun
conversation to have that had that happen

1445
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:06,370
before where people misinterpret
something I said or taken out a contact or

1446
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:10,480
disagree with it, you know, and that,
that can happen. But for the most part,

1447
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:14,020
most of the people that meet me or Nice,
Nice. And even when someone does like,

1448
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:15,670
listen man, it's just
an opinion. You know,

1449
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,690
they'll have to get people get so God
damn attached to their opinions, you know,

1450
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,170
if you know,
if you just just stop and go,

1451
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:26,290
who the fuck knows and stop and go,
well maybe you're right.

1452
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:31,210
That clears up a lot of shit. You know,
it's really simple and you know, and,

1453
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,790
and they had a little Google add
that to the mix and you know,

1454
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,500
you should be dealing
with much less problems.

1455
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,680
We should have because of Google for real.
And we should probably have,

1456
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:43,750
I'd say a 75% reduction in
arguments between human beings.

1457
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,440
They should be resolved 75% quicker
just from the access to information.

1458
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,310
Because how many goddamn arguments when
we were kids came out of one guy talking

1459
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:53,160
about his fucking ass and you know in it,

1460
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,210
but you not having an encyclopedia handy.

1461
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,840
Oh yeah.
And you just would fight that.

1462
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:58,700
You don't fight that until
the day he knows you.

1463
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,710
That's a cock sucker that thinks
that movie went straight to video.

1464
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:01,640
It didn't go straight to video.

1465
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,830
They don't even make movies straight
to video that it was fucking,

1466
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,140
it was all in the movie theater
theaters for at least two weeks.

1467
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,440
I know because my dad told me those
are frustrating conversations man,

1468
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:10,970
and you never had closure can,

1469
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:14,750
it's more as knows that Kenny's worries
was even say fucking the movies go to

1470
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,670
straight to fucking video. And
I was like, that doesn't happen.

1471
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,300
It was a fucking nightmare fight when
we were kids when I still remember it.

1472
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,620
Yeah, we had fights. We had, I would,

1473
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,280
you'd argue with someone and you just
get into it with them and you just would

1474
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:27,320
never have closure and
you'd fucking be like, fine,

1475
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,750
we agree to disagree and I'll just hit
your guts secretly behind your back.

1476
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,840
Bert Kreischer talking about how
he and handles relationships.

1477
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:40,760
Everybody has their own approach to,
what's yours? Call us now at one 800.

1478
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:45,550
What is it? Chicago right now. And I have
a question for brick right here. Shoot.

1479
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,970
Um,
my wife has three nipples,

1480
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,460
but both of them are on her ass home.

1481
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:54,243
She has three

1482
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,910
circling her asshole.
Like crop circles.

1483
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,530
Yeah, they're in there inside. But if he
can feel them with your finger, right.

1484
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:04,160
And if you come down here, we'll
what we'll show you. It's um,

1485
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,770
I need to know what to do that

1486
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:09,930
he needed to bail on this. Wait,
no, no. Wait. [inaudible] failed.

1487
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:15,470
Impromptu actual breast area where the
nipple would have been where the Areola

1488
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:17,160
is.
There's an aerial would no nipple.

1489
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:22,800
You ever dated a girl who essentially
an aerial and no nipple of your dating

1490
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:23,960
girls like that?
I've had,

1491
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,060
I've dated girls that's aerial is have
been chopped off and then they've had

1492
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:30,000
boobs put in when it's so dry.
And then it's like,

1493
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:33,190
that's like a ghost nipple in some
ways. You know, that's not like a,

1494
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,820
you know what I mean?
It goes,

1495
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:44,150
what is that? Is that a real
song? I just made that up. Listen.

1496
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,940
Yeah, that was, that was a song that I,

1497
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:51,270
we were barbecued one night and we
were hanging out with him and he was,

1498
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,500
he had just started dating this particular
last and for some reason we started

1499
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:57,920
singing a song called,
I saw your girlfriend's buttle

1500
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,970
photographs of her.
And here's a picture of her right now.

1501
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:07,670
Is that, that's a nice picture.
It's from Howard Stern pitcher,

1502
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:12,270
but Brian, how'd that happen? How'd you
ever hook up with a chick like that?

1503
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:18,750
You Sir? Do you have sex magic? Do you
have sex? Totally Naked Brian? Yeah.

1504
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:23,400
Well when he's like the pool,
I certainly like the pool.

1505
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,510
I usually wear a jersey like a polo.
Like have you ever had,

1506
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:28,080
if you ever had sex with clothes on,

1507
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,480
I guess you have like
quickie sex with a shirt on.

1508
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:35,060
Kevin James I would think would have sex
with his shirt on because I didn't know.

1509
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,530
But he seems like a guy that he's
always got a hat on and he's always got

1510
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,900
something covering, you know,
Kevin is an interesting guy.

1511
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:41,190
Kevin's a really interesting guy.

1512
01:21:41,191 --> 01:21:45,090
I went to his house one time a long time
ago and got fucking Ballato in front of

1513
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:48,210
him and I just watched him
look at me like studying me.

1514
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,020
Like how does this happen? Like how it
would be like blotto drunk toy. Yeah,

1515
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,620
it was me and Gary [inaudible].

1516
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,640
Gary knows how to put them away
and Gary started drinking in Vegas.

1517
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:57,750
I've been an ended at,

1518
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,930
at Kevin's house many evening
drinking with Gary back in the day.

1519
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,080
God Damn he is a,
he'll put them back and he's a good dude.

1520
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,320
I saw him all the time, guys. I saw
Gary Valentine one time at the Improv.

1521
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:10,170
Take a shot of a candle.
He took a ship time,

1522
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,410
shut up and put it back into the stuff
that was on a funny shot. All right,

1523
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,560
let's keep going guys. Keep
going. No, he drank it for you.

1524
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:20,430
Just fucking shot it back. Get a
candle shop. Let's keep going guys.

1525
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:24,570
Man. Gary Valentine's a
fucking party. Got, did I ever
tell you what happened? Oh,

1526
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:27,750
this is my favorite. Sweet. I maybe
I did. Wait. So did I ever tell you,

1527
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:31,800
what did you do you remember Mike? You
know Mike Burton, Mike Burton, comedian,

1528
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,930
bald, Jewish, good, good body. And he's
a man. I don't know what I'm saying.

1529
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,990
That
caring,

1530
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:46,310
not like it just works out.
He's working hard. Comma,

1531
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:51,060
guy he preaches is really
system of martial arts. He
teaches Krav Maga right now.

1532
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,740
So anyway, so one time me, Gary,
and this Guy Scott Henry and,

1533
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:59,880
and Mike Burton are all drinking it for
most of cafe. This is like Thursday.

1534
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,060
We don't have to work. Gary
and I are making money. We're
doing an show. And I go,

1535
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:06,070
I go guys, let's go to Vegas. And
everyone's fucking, and except for Burton,

1536
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,470
he's like, I don't want to go.
Burton was a comic and he was,

1537
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,680
he's stopped doing comedy since he was
funny, but he wasn't like that funny.

1538
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,070
So he goes, I don't want to go. And Gary's
like, come on, come on, burden, let's go.

1539
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:17,140
And he's like, I don't want to go. I don't
want to go. So we got to go. Fuck it.

1540
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:18,400
I'm going to my house,
I'm packing my bags.

1541
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:22,750
I'll meet you guys at Scott and Burton's
house in like in like 30 minutes.

1542
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,130
So we go meet me,

1543
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:27,010
Burton and Scott go to Scott and Burton's
house and burn goes off. Fuck it.

1544
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:30,220
I'll go, I'll go burn. And there's what
you do hide in the back of my truck.

1545
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:31,054
We're taking my Escalade,

1546
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:34,360
a navigator or whatever and the
way back hiding the way back.

1547
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:37,750
And we won't tell Gary you're
going until halfway there.

1548
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,900
Well when when we get halfway to Vegas,
you pop him and go, surprise, I'm coming.

1549
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:43,480
So he goes, that's a great
idea. That's a great idea.

1550
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,580
So we fucking pack the
car and we're waiting.

1551
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,080
Gary Valentine pulls up and his parks
his car and he comes up and he's like,

1552
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:52,240
what's up? I said, hop in and we're
ready. And he was all right, Scott.

1553
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,540
Henry's driving my truck, Gary Hobson,
the backseat, and he goes, where's Burton?

1554
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,870
And we'd go, well he couldn't
come. And Gary Goes, let me
tell you something about,

1555
01:23:58,871 --> 01:24:02,170
about motherfucker. Let me tell you
why he's not a good comic for one.

1556
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,960
And all of a sudden I'm looking
in the rear view mirror.

1557
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,430
I see Burton's heads sit up
in the way back and he goes,

1558
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:09,490
because he's not fucking funny and I
don't have the heart to tell him he

1559
01:24:09,491 --> 01:24:12,070
shouldn't like,
and he starts fucking tearing.

1560
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:17,190
Burton apart ended and we are in Hollywood
until we get on the fucking 10 all of

1561
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:21,280
a sudden Burton go, I go, Gary, can you
reach in the back of Basmeh and beer?

1562
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:24,360
He reaches back and he sees
Burton. He goes, hey, burden.
Hey turns, it looks to me,

1563
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:29,230
cause you're going to tell him he's in
the fucking car. Oh, most uncomfortable.

1564
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,740
The whole rest of the ride to Vegas,
they just spoke like in the backseat,

1565
01:24:32,741 --> 01:24:33,550
just talked,

1566
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:36,190
hashed it out and no one spoke to
each other the rest of the weekend.

1567
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,170
Fucking uncomfortable.

1568
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:42,440
There's sometimes dues will blow up
and they don't even mean exactly what

1569
01:24:42,441 --> 01:24:42,861
they're saying.

1570
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:46,790
They're just frustrated with their own
lives and they find something about

1571
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:50,780
someone else, whether it's a minor
glitch in their system or whatever,

1572
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,220
and they just start poking at it.

1573
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:56,420
And it's sort of a distraction
to turn that same, you know,

1574
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,600
objectivity and insight to yourself.
You know,

1575
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:03,390
I, I, yeah, I've, I've done it.
I've done it like when I was less,

1576
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,300
but when I was younger in this business,

1577
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:10,830
like I would definitely take apart someone
I did not know and look at their act

1578
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:12,210
and be like that fuck.
And I would,

1579
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,900
you could get me started on someone and
I would destroy that motherfucker and

1580
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:18,570
pick apart everything. And then
all they had to say was, hey man,

1581
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:23,430
I'm a big fan of your stuff. I'd be
like, I'm a big fan of you too. Love you.

1582
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,960
I've been a big fear for a long time,

1583
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,850
but there are dudes that are annoying.
I mean, there's no getting past that.

1584
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,560
There are guys who get up
there and they're annoying,

1585
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:33,490
but you just can't avoid them. You know?
I just avoid their acts, you know? That's,

1586
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:35,450
that's the best way.
Just to just, you know,

1587
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,410
kind of get out of their way when
they're up and just, but you can be that,

1588
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,110
you can do it when you're young a lot of
the times you got to follow that person.

1589
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,940
Well the follow was not the real issue.

1590
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:44,980
It's when someone tells
you what you can't,

1591
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:47,090
do you ever have that
when you opened for those?

1592
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,960
Oh fuck that. Yeah, that is, that is a

1593
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:55,230
some real negative dudes out
there. Oh, that will start to like,

1594
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:59,630
like micromanage your act when you work
at like be clubs. That happens a lot.

1595
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,890
Oh yeah. The headline. I will tell
you, you could, whatever you do,

1596
01:26:01,891 --> 01:26:04,050
you can't talk about,
you know,

1597
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,710
you can have like your whole opening
bit about farming. Like yeah.

1598
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,290
How about I have a different bit about
farming and you do, is that okay? Yeah.

1599
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,990
You know like what the fuck dude,
you can't tell me what I can't talk about.

1600
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,741
It's one thing.

1601
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:16,940
It's like a guy purposely tried to step
on your material in that I'm sure you've

1602
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:21,740
had happened where they you
open or you have like one day,

1603
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,800
well you'll be the headliner and he'll
be the middle act and he'll have a

1604
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:27,740
certain set and it'll do well and then
you'll have a bunch of bits on certain

1605
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:31,640
subjects and all of a sudden the next
night he magically has these new bits that

1606
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:34,520
you can tell her new bits.
The cut off short,

1607
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,480
they that expanded on and there are about
the same exact subjects that you taught

1608
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,520
and they're just,

1609
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,380
sometimes it's not even just stepping
on what you're about to talk about.

1610
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:47,170
He's trying to make your act
less effective on purpose.

1611
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,960
Fucking exhausting and it's
happened to me so much.

1612
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,770
It happens to a lot of comics when
they're like third in there in like 32

1613
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,590
they're not making a ton of money in
the making 1200 bucks on the road and

1614
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:59,590
they've got some feature. I could make
it 700 bucks. I was like, fuck this guy.

1615
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:01,030
I've never heard of him.
I'm going to take,

1616
01:27:01,031 --> 01:27:03,970
I'm going to make sure that they flip
flop this at the end of the week and they

1617
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:07,750
sell like five DVDs with two tee
shirts and they'll undercut your sales.

1618
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:10,210
I'm selling the DVD for 20 bucks and
this guys, I'm selling all my shit,

1619
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:13,110
but 25 Bam. It's really
unfortunate. You know,

1620
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,260
the only way you should go
to do shows when someone is,

1621
01:27:17,261 --> 01:27:20,520
if you're friends with someone,
like I don't like dealing like eve.

1622
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,770
I love doing the k rock shows because
I know all those people that do those.

1623
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:28,720
Like they have that big April fool's April
foolishness show on April fool's Day,

1624
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,850
April fool's day, weekend, whatever
it is. And it's always that, uh,

1625
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,300
that huge place and a universal,
what does that theater and universe,

1626
01:27:35,301 --> 01:27:37,690
it's like 6,000 fucking people and
it's all a lot of people that I don't

1627
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:40,330
normally hang out with,
but everybody is really funny.

1628
01:27:40,331 --> 01:27:41,950
You kind of know him
off from the business,

1629
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:46,540
but it's way more fun when you're working
and you work on the road with friends.

1630
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:50,800
It's way more fun. Like it's,
there's not like for whatever reason,

1631
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:55,800
some comics want them to be the only
one that is getting the laughs. Yeah.

1632
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,270
It can't just have a good set
and then you have a good set too.

1633
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,400
It's a company, it's a
competition. It's one on one.

1634
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:03,250
Like I'm the funniest
motherfucker in this club tonight.

1635
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:06,520
I need to be the one that when they exit
they go, you were funnier than that guy.

1636
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,250
They need that

1637
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,230
and then it becomes what we
were talking about earlier,

1638
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:12,470
before we even started rolling
about being addicted to killing,

1639
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,010
being addicted to killing is the worst
thing that can ever happen to a comic.

1640
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:20,810
Because I heard you and brewer talk
about this maybe seven years ago,

1641
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,620
six years ago, and it was
when it was, when Dane was

1642
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:29,220
blown up and you guys were saying that
Dane is the perfect guy that's addicted

1643
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,650
to killing, that he, you know,

1644
01:28:31,651 --> 01:28:35,220
it's like what we exactly what we
were talking about with your friend.

1645
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,940
They don't want to stop doing
the bit because the bit works.

1646
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,060
And even though they know it's
unethical to continue to do the bit,

1647
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:45,180
because it's really your
story that they're repeating,

1648
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,110
they can't help it because
it's so powerful. It's such a,

1649
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,260
it's such a weapon to use. I'll give
you want these people to love you.

1650
01:28:52,261 --> 01:28:54,540
You want these people thinking
of the funniest guy ever. Boom.

1651
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:58,080
How about this brilliant impression with
this perfect story that is so fucking

1652
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:00,840
hilarious. You're going to be
holding your stomach laughing.

1653
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,130
The brilliance of it all.

1654
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,700
But in reality he shouldn't be
saying it and yeah, and yeah,

1655
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:09,570
and there's an addicted to killing it is.
It's hard man,

1656
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:11,310
because bombing sucks and they,

1657
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:15,210
and a lot of times people think that
bombing is the alternative when it's not,

1658
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:19,710
know if the alternative is
just not killing. You know.
And I think a lot of those,

1659
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:23,690
a lot of guys who, uh,
especially like, uh,

1660
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:28,500
like I remember a tell never killed
Amelie. Like he always killed to comics.

1661
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:32,010
Like we always loved them. But like a
lot of times he'd do 50, 50 in the room.

1662
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:34,410
And at the cellar because,
because in all honesty,

1663
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,780
he was working on new shit all the time.

1664
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,610
He was always taking a bit and it was not
about the crowd. It was not about them.

1665
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:44,760
He knew if he wanted to,
he could murder that crowd in a heartbeat.

1666
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,340
For him it was about the
art and find the right way,

1667
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,870
how to kill someone with a hammer.

1668
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,810
Like what's the funniest way to kill
someone with a hammer? How do you kill it?

1669
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:53,820
Like, and he would, I swear to God,

1670
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:58,410
he must've said kill someone with a hammer
150 times as when I lived in New York

1671
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:02,610
and tried to work that out and you'd
watch him and I'm Louis C K was about,

1672
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:06,270
it was about him figuring shit out.
I worked with Louis right after Georgia,

1673
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,690
my old, my oldest was born and,
and Dave, right back to back.

1674
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,050
And Louie and I'm, I'm, I'm
saying this in all fondness.

1675
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:17,780
Louie bombed for an a weekend. He had
a rough weekend. Uh, and he, but he,

1676
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:21,390
but he was doing all the material
that defined him as a comic today.

1677
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,820
That is the murderous,
shameful hour.

1678
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:26,460
What did he did the shameless
or shameful shameless.

1679
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,880
The one that defined the definitive
hour of Louis CK where you went, okay,

1680
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:32,610
he's my new favorite comic. He was
doing all that and he was working on it.

1681
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:33,690
For him it wasn't about killing.

1682
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:38,520
It was about getting this
concept of being a regular guy,

1683
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:39,990
thinking your kids or a Dick,

1684
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,050
wanting to be wanting to eat
whatever the fuck you want.

1685
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:45,090
Being married to someone
who's a little micromanaging,

1686
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,240
like being kind like B being Louis Ck.

1687
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,490
He wanted to get that idea
out so he didn't give a shit.

1688
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,580
I remember going up murdering as a feature
and then Louie would go up and kind

1689
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:54,414
of like

1690
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,790
struggle and figure out who's figuring
shit out and you could definitely see who

1691
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:01,560
was working and I remember my head going,

1692
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:06,060
I was so fucking impressed
that he did not care. I'm,

1693
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm sure he cared about killing.
I'm sure that mattered,

1694
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:12,900
but I was so impressed that he didn't,
he had a bigger goal, you know,

1695
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,220
he wanted to create new material
quickly. Yeah. He wanted to make,

1696
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:21,810
he wanted to make, he wanted to
change his style. His style was goofy,

1697
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:26,360
absurd, you know, kind of.
I always, I don't know why,
but I think of like top, uh,

1698
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:29,340
top 10 fucking humor.
For some reason it was like,

1699
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,890
it was just like goofy's hop tend humor
when, I don't know why I say that.

1700
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,870
I don't know what I mean. But I
always thought of that. I don't know.

1701
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:36,660
I don't know how else to say
it. Oh, do you mean like, um,

1702
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:40,950
like one of those like a poll,
like top 10 funniest things to happen?

1703
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:45,570
Like that kind of humor? No,
no, no. It was like, it was
top tent. Like a tent. Yeah.

1704
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:46,620
Like it was like a tent.
Like,

1705
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,760
I dunno why I think that maybe it's our
special had a tense old stuff was it was

1706
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:54,410
still a silly goofy. Yeah. Like,
yeah, he'd go, uh, his joke was like,

1707
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:58,050
I want to see me order anything. A old
diarrhea or down diner style diner style.

1708
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:00,000
You wanna see a diner
style order, ma'am. She got

1709
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,610
two eggs, Bacon and pancakes. He goes,
want something to drink? She's like,

1710
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:06,250
orange juice. He goes, all right,
I need to monkeys. Right fired car.

1711
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,920
I need to flapjacks them up later on.

1712
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,170
[inaudible] [inaudible] need to do
this whole fucking hilarious rant.

1713
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:15,520
Then he go and I need two eggs over
easy bacon and pancakes with some orange

1714
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:19,930
juice. Like that was the bit, wasn't who
he is now at all. It was more absurdist,

1715
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:23,500
but man, I remember watching
that and going, motherfucker,

1716
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:26,140
I wish I had the balls because
I was a feature at the time.

1717
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,930
I felt like if I didn't kill,
I wouldn't work ever again.

1718
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,280
Yeah.
That's like the fear,

1719
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:34,210
the fear of the hardest part of coming
up with new material or changing gears.

1720
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:34,660
You know,

1721
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:38,770
God forbid when you get a guy who's like
a musical guy and decides to try to put

1722
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:42,780
the guitar down. Oh Shit Man, I've seen
that go horribly wrong. That's east shore.

1723
01:32:42,781 --> 01:32:44,630
He used to yell at them.
She used to yell at,

1724
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,680
and there's a series of guys that were
guitar comics who I'd like some kind of

1725
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:48,311
funny songs,

1726
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:52,600
but they resented the fact that they were
not considered legitimate comedians by

1727
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:55,900
the rest of the comedians. Like they did
something that was like a little extra.

1728
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,850
If you just had to go up there and talk,
you really would. You would eat dicks.

1729
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:01,480
That's a little like not, I
mean, look, here's the thing.

1730
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:04,460
You pull out a guitar and everyone's like,
Ooh,

1731
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,990
it's good. Yeah. Nothing wrong
with it. Not saying anything,

1732
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,360
but what,

1733
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:12,400
what I'm saying is there was a bunch
of guys who've got pretty good with a

1734
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:15,820
guitar and then they tried to put the
guitar down and just go on their own

1735
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:18,490
personality and they would
eat the sticks up their butt.

1736
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,690
Mitzi shore used to yell at them.

1737
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:21,700
I'll never forget the student
was on stage and he was,

1738
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,080
he was just choking it up there. I
just didn't have it and it just, it was

1739
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:28,460
out of rhythm. He didn't
know how to another rhythm.
Yeah. He didn't know how to,

1740
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,560
we couldn't just introduce the next song.

1741
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:34,820
Next Song I wrote when I was thinking
about I dream of Jeannie and bubble bath

1742
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:38,320
with my dog. Hey man, you know
there's no, there's no setup.

1743
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:40,070
It's just you doing stand up and you know,

1744
01:33:40,071 --> 01:33:41,930
you continue to know there's
no guitar to pull out.

1745
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:45,110
There's no pretending you're having a good
time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1746
01:33:45,111 --> 01:33:47,920
You know, soliciting claps. There's
none of that. It's just you talking.

1747
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:52,880
There's no like a tuning the guitar when
you need a, Oh, let me hold on one sec.

1748
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:55,760
And so Mitzi, the kids on stage
doing this man, as he goes,

1749
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:57,350
go get that.

1750
01:33:57,351 --> 01:34:02,351
Get Joe Amber going
stage without the guitar.

1751
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:08,280
I kinda wish I had known missy.
She's one of a costume meter.

1752
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,320
Really? Sure. If you want us to meet
her. She's, she's in poor health though.

1753
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,030
She's had a hard time the one time
he was a dick. Well, you know,

1754
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:21,180
I'm a big fan of his brother. His
brother Scott. He's a good buddy of mine.

1755
01:34:21,181 --> 01:34:25,400
I love that guy.
But I said to Paul in front of Louis,

1756
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:27,820
Louis Anderson introduced us,
always mixed. Louie Anderson Hall,

1757
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:32,070
you should be calling, can be a nice guy.
He's got the potential to be a nice guy.

1758
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:33,930
He just doesn't know
his shoes to be totally.

1759
01:34:33,931 --> 01:34:35,870
And it seems like whatever it is there,

1760
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,360
it's really weird because every time you
meet him and like most of the time it's

1761
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:43,230
like, hey, he's just a nice guy. Very
Fun Times. And then he has like a bad,

1762
01:34:43,231 --> 01:34:44,220
weird side,
I guess.

1763
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:46,240
Yeah, I dunno. You know, whatever.

1764
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,213
Did you ever choke him out?

1765
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,290
Me? No. Nope. Never did.

1766
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:53,780
I never got. Never even
really, I mean I got it more

1767
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:58,040
upset with how ridiculous the whole
situation, the comedy store. Then

1768
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,400
Pauline, Pauline was just a part of
a machine over there. Yeah. You know,

1769
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:04,370
whatever position he plays in it now,
I don't know.

1770
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,750
Speaking of that machine,
cyber,

1771
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:10,250
so Monday I got machine
shirts@burpharbert.com keep
going. Fiber sale Monday,

1772
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,480
cyber sale, Mondale Monday. So what,
what happens? What do they get off?

1773
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,660
They get like a same price as normal,
I think. I don't know how to change it.

1774
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:19,540
They get same prices on a cyber sale.

1775
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:22,090
That's not a fucking cyber sale right now.

1776
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:27,730
Cyber sale at [inaudible] Dot Com oh
and it put in the code word cyber.

1777
01:35:27,731 --> 01:35:30,200
You get 25% off and you don't,
you don't have a real,

1778
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:34,240
I actually think that everyone should
go to Doug dicom instead of going to

1779
01:35:34,241 --> 01:35:35,690
amazon.com that's d

1780
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:40,090
you go to d g g e d.com.
Brian explained to me why that's good

1781
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:44,700
because I go to the, if you're going to
shop on amazon.com uh, Doug got calm,

1782
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:49,701
just forwards you to amazon.com but any
of anytime you spend a dollar I get 6

1783
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,450
cents and it goes towards this studio
that we're not charging them anymore. Huh?

1784
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,010
It doesn't charge them
any more for the product.

1785
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,720
I know that gives you a kickback.

1786
01:35:56,730 --> 01:36:01,530
Just gives it a kickback for promoting
people to amazon.com stealing money for

1787
01:36:01,531 --> 01:36:02,520
themselves.
Yeah.

1788
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,360
Are we making money on this
side of the apocalypse?

1789
01:36:08,361 --> 01:36:11,570
Because how Amazon's gonna fold.
Yeah. I get your shit together.

1790
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:14,290
You're my favorite at all.
The online shopping.

1791
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:17,290
I went to black Friday, by the
way, and that was straight up.

1792
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:20,980
Scary like that was like,
that was like being at, uh,

1793
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:25,840
like Woodstock. But if it was like all
rappers, I guess, what did you get?

1794
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:28,090
What did you get a black Friday?
Uh,

1795
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,410
these projectors that in the background
and stuff like that. But it was a,

1796
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:35,110
these projectors right here?
Yeah. What does this movie?

1797
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:40,310
Uh, I don't remember. You have a
plane, but you don't know this studio.

1798
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,600
This studio is starting to
become really fucking bad ass.

1799
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,950
So wait. So now you guys, do you guys,

1800
01:36:46,951 --> 01:36:50,640
do you do a live show here?
Wednesday nights?

1801
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:54,990
Uh, we do a live show here on
various evenings. We don't,

1802
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:58,620
it's not like every Wednesday night
anyway, here is to do the podcast.

1803
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,990
What we do is we do a
podcast while we're doing,

1804
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:06,030
I just kicked over his camera as, he's
still cool. What we do is we do a podcast,

1805
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,060
like while everyone is going up on stage,

1806
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,850
the other comics would be back
here having a podcast. Oh, come on,

1807
01:37:11,851 --> 01:37:13,620
please do this anytime you want.

1808
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:16,890
What is the next 100% open invocate maybe
this week, maybe let's figure it out.

1809
01:37:16,891 --> 01:37:19,060
We'll figure it out. I'll do it
this week. Do it this week? Yeah,

1810
01:37:19,061 --> 01:37:22,200
if we do it this week it'll
either be Wednesday or Thursday.

1811
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,640
Most likely Wednesday.

1812
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,250
That's what happened is they are talking
about doing is doing something like

1813
01:37:26,251 --> 01:37:30,300
that on the road with Ustream and
like fucking trying to, but I don't,

1814
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,800
I'm not good with that.
She could do it dude.

1815
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:34,800
Just to advertisers to just
Twitter make a little Ustream show.

1816
01:37:34,801 --> 01:37:37,320
It's half runs in charge of everything.
You let them be in charge.

1817
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:40,710
He's good at that. She's smart as
shit. He put together online survey.

1818
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,970
I'll have phones.
Brian,

1819
01:37:41,971 --> 01:37:45,000
he's a great guy too and he's a fun
guy to have a new road. Yeah. Yeah.

1820
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:47,430
He's a real dude. You know.
She real good guy. He'll heal.

1821
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,630
You'll have a good time like me.

1822
01:37:48,631 --> 01:37:51,690
Him and Charlie Murphy went on
a one month toward the country.

1823
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:56,040
It was a good time there. They're cool.
Mother fucker. Tony Murphy, he's so

1824
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,650
interesting. He's a great guy,
man. I really loved Charlie.

1825
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,290
I rented a trolley in Hawaii once.
Man,

1826
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:04,830
it was one of the fucking coolest
things ever. Just random on vacation,

1827
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:07,230
the exact moment he was on vacation.
He's one of those guys,

1828
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:11,730
like I was truly happy to see him. You
know, he's a, he's a real legit dude.

1829
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:12,301
He's like,

1830
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:15,570
so he's the one of the most honest
people I've ever met that's in like show

1831
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:17,370
business, you know, like he,

1832
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:21,870
he came on the show and was telling me
a story about his wife passing away. Oh,

1833
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:24,180
I heard about, you know, raising
his kids and doing the best he can.

1834
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:26,460
But he's still us to travel on the road
and sometimes you have to leave them and

1835
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:29,020
he doesn't want to and how it
breaks his heart, you know,

1836
01:38:29,021 --> 01:38:33,270
it's powerful fucking shit. I love
when he, I love the words he chooses.

1837
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:37,500
He's got this, he's got like a,
like a, a 90 year old man's vocab

1838
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:43,040
look. He says words like, tickling,
you are Kruna Yo Karuna like a crooner.

1839
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:47,690
Who the fuck his feelings on the
matter. So it goes, it goes here.

1840
01:38:47,691 --> 01:38:48,830
That shit that Mike Tyson,

1841
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,520
is that like barbershops stuff
or like Jay guides diamonds?

1842
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:57,090
How do they not have a
black barbershop podcast?

1843
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:01,610
If we got you together with Charlie
in a room, you and Charlie Murphy.

1844
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:04,810
All I want to tell her a
story off. Oh, I want to,

1845
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:09,380

recant our evening to you. Oh yeah.

1848
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:21,770
There's young white boy with his
smile and laugh that fucking laugh.

1849
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:23,683
I'm fucking

1850
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:33,200
black guys not play gay shit. Brian.
That's a good way to get knocked out.

1851
01:39:33,201 --> 01:39:35,240
Silly brothers. White guys. Love it. Look,

1852
01:39:35,241 --> 01:39:37,790
if I can sneak around and put my dick
on your shoulder, you'll be like God me.

1853
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,781
And listen,

1854
01:39:38,781 --> 01:39:41,420
there's a lot of black guys and they're
just looking for an opportunity to punch

1855
01:39:41,421 --> 01:39:42,254
a guy like Yo.

1856
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:47,450
So I hope everyone is joking
back off of that shit.

1857
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:50,540
I want to do the Po, I want to do that
podcast that you do here. Absolutely.

1858
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:52,910
Please do it. So are you in town? This
whole went down bird like two weeks.

1859
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:56,540
Oh my goodness. Ladies and gentlemen, you
are listening to this organically occur.

1860
01:39:56,541 --> 01:40:00,200
We are making an appointment for Bert
Kreischer to be a part of the ice house

1861
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:00,801
chronical.

1862
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:05,390
I'm going to get a fucking car service
out here are the favorite new club here

1863
01:40:05,391 --> 01:40:08,840
in California. Man, we're,
we're doing shows here all
the time as often as we can,

1864
01:40:08,841 --> 01:40:12,450
and we're doing podcasts here all the time
as often as we can. Fucking great man.

1865
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:16,460
It's awesome to be as Joey Matt Flavor
going to be here if he's here. You know,

1866
01:40:16,461 --> 01:40:19,300
you never know, but you can't
call doily dog. Listen, listen,

1867
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:22,250
I've got things to do dog.
I'll see you at the fucking show.

1868
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,700
Like he doesn't like the crown Swartz
and before the show and we'll do it in a

1869
01:40:25,701 --> 01:40:29,290
heartbeat. He'll do it. He'll do it
for sure. That guy so much. Yeah,

1870
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,990
it cracks me up, man. He's so fucking, he
only did the podcast for like 45 minutes.

1871
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,330
We're going to have him back on,
right? There's like a sports game on.

1872
01:40:35,331 --> 01:40:38,090
He's like a big sports
guy. Yeah, he's a UFC fan.

1873
01:40:38,091 --> 01:40:40,960
Huge UFC fan them all the time
with the UFC and he loves it.

1874
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:45,110
He's one of the sweetest
guys in this business.

1875
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,130
One of the coolest things about doing
this podcast and one of the coolest things

1876
01:40:48,131 --> 01:40:51,240
about, you know, just being a comic in La,
it's like you get to meet a lot of God.

1877
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:52,390
Damn interesting people

1878
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:53,980
tell me now I think about

1879
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,320
our lives in that respect.
You know the, all the,

1880
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,650
the wild stories that you told me you're
fucking drinking store with Johnny

1881
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:02,140
Knoxville and like just the nutty
shit that you've told me in the past.

1882
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:06,370
I think about how fortunate you are
in comparison to the average person.

1883
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:08,860
The average person doesn't
have those kind of experiences.

1884
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:12,830
The average person does it live.
So we're insanely fun a, I get it.

1885
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:16,660
I get it when I go on the road because
the documentary guys will attest to this

1886
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,090
and I say this and I
say this and I mean it.

1887
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:24,900
I get the fans of this podcast come
out to my shows in fucking droves,

1888
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,470
like droves.

1889
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:30,220
But here's the most interesting thing is
they know I'm a fan of the podcast also,

1890
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:34,030
so they end up sitting and talking
to me for the entire night.

1891
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:36,100
We sit at a bar and end up talking
about our favorite podcasts.

1892
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,920
So we ended up bullshitting
about this podcast and then,

1893
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:41,350
and then inevitably they're like,
what's Joe's house look like?

1894
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,590
And I just make up some story about
talions and fucking what's Italian? Oh,

1895
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:50,230
fucking some thing I just made Allen.
Yeah,

1896
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:55,690
I was fucking talking about Brian.
Did you really work for NASA? Okay,

1897
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,750
well that's cool man. Yeah, look, we love
doing this fucking podcast. It's a great,

1898
01:41:59,751 --> 01:42:01,780
it's a, we were saying, I was saying
on the phone with you last night,

1899
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:06,150
we had an in depth conversation and
I'm saying this podcast has made it,

1900
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:10,720
it's so fascinating to be a part
of because when I stand on stage,

1901
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:15,130
the second I got on stage, I see droves
of people in machine shirts all sold.

1902
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:19,360
I got two pairs that you got to exhale.
I got the sort of the light one,

1903
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:22,990
which I prefer a very thin
sort of, um, of fabric. Yeah,

1904
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:26,290
I've got one that's like a regular cotton
t shirt. I prefer the super thin one.

1905
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:28,660
It's got a little bit of sexy to it,
a little extra sexy.

1906
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:32,950
You're the reason those things sell.
I swear this documentary,

1907
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:36,760
you're the reason Henderson Sjogren's
shirt on. I'm not the reason dude. All,

1908
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:39,460
I am a, as an antenna that tuned
into the greatness that is Bert.

1909
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,250
That's what it is. We just found
you. You know, like I couldn't,

1910
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:44,710
I couldn't make you funny. I can't
make you interesting, you know,

1911
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:46,630
having you on this podcast,
it's just, we're lucky.

1912
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:50,530
I've never subscribed to the idea that
you know, that someone should be happy.

1913
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:52,540
You know that they come
on someone's show and,

1914
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:57,490
and are entertaining as fuck for
free for hours. We did. We, we,

1915
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,040
we, you know, we have the,
some really hilarious fucking
shows with you, dude. Oh,

1916
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,120
thank you. I thought it was
good. I didn't make you,

1917
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:07,380
you made yourself to your you well it
but we were talking about last night and

1918
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,170
it is a neat thing to be a
part of because when people,

1919
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,420
when you stand on state
people who love you,

1920
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,960
so this is the fucking craziest thing.
So I go to,

1921
01:43:13,961 --> 01:43:17,980
we do this special and Amsterdam for
showtime. I get on stage and Amsterdam,

1922
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:19,810
all Dutch crowd, although it's crowd. Wow.

1923
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,580
Can I stage and I stand on stage machine
fucking 13 people yelling the machine.

1924
01:43:24,581 --> 01:43:28,600
Am I fucking lying right now?
Where's the crew out in fucking Amsterdam.

1925
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:32,180
Dude's are have the machine shirt on and
they're screaming in the machine. Wow.

1926
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,520
In Amsterdam now this is,

1927
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:38,590
everyone's had a rub you that thing
about the podcasts free every week. Yeah.

1928
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:42,610
Fucking whelming but it's free and it's
everywhere and it will always be free.

1929
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,660
Yeah. My ads are annoying, but
it's always going to be free.

1930
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:48,220
Fucking gray pug when you do
with a tail is overwhelming.

1931
01:43:48,221 --> 01:43:51,380
It's one of my favorite interviews I've
heard with the tell because especially

1932
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:54,110
when you told him he could smoke cause
you in all of a sudden Dave start really

1933
01:43:54,111 --> 01:43:54,870
parking relaxed.

1934
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:56,010
Yeah I knew I couldn't,

1935
01:43:56,011 --> 01:43:59,090
I just turned on the machine and I was
like well no big deal. He's, I love him.

1936
01:43:59,091 --> 01:44:01,680
I you let them smoke and he for him,
he a two pack a day guy.

1937
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:06,210
So for him it's super hard to elbow.
Everybody harassed Doug's Dan hope.

1938
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,650
Please get after him. Email him, get him
on Twitter. Tell him to do the podcast.

1939
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:14,160

doing the Irvine Improv as close to Dan

1940
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,030

1942
01:44:22,231 --> 01:44:24,900
What else? Doesn't read his
Twitter. Read his email either.

1943
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:27,400
I'm going to call him later.
It's his Facebook is Facebook.

1944
01:44:27,401 --> 01:44:29,580
Facebook does this cause he a little girl,

1945
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:33,210
14 year old girls book like page
trying to whack ass shit. Is that,

1946
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,940

1947
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:40,590
Did you get another fucking coach
got caught with little kids. Yeah,

1948
01:44:40,591 --> 01:44:45,330
another coach today. Some,
some fucking, uh, I'll, I'll
look it up online because a,

1949
01:44:45,331 --> 01:44:46,164
I took it.

1950
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:49,360
Is this the one is this one
Colin Quinn tweeted about,

1951
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,480
did he, did he tweet about it? Colin
Quinn's Twitter is so fucking funny.

1952
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:58,510
Talk on Twitter has been trolling
everybody with this thing about a will

1953
01:44:58,731 --> 01:44:59,950
Ferrell.
Saintly.

1954
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:05,030
He stole the idea bill Farrell and do it.
A lot of bad drugs.

1955
01:45:05,031 --> 01:45:08,540
He says bad drugs like you can't see.
That's a Colin Quinn joke right there.

1956
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:11,380
He was saying, Hey Josh doing a lot
of bad drugs and they picked up,

1957
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,270
they picked it up on the newswire.
Right. It's so silly. It's social.

1958
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,560
You can't see him saying even the
vernacular he uses the words he chooses.

1959
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:22,790
He had a, he was doing a lot of
bad drugs. That's a God damn joke.

1960
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:26,000
He's Collin Quinn. The fuck is wrong
with you. Bebo Oh, Bobby Kelly,

1961
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:30,980
give me the result. I want my
mind, man. How do you not know?

1962
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:33,830
Brilliant. Bobby Kelly told me
the funniest Collin Quinn story.

1963
01:45:33,831 --> 01:45:38,130
I saw Bobby in New York, we
did his podcast, which is
coming up next Monday. It's,

1964
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,240
well, you know what the name
of his podcasts, it's really,

1965
01:45:41,241 --> 01:45:44,160
it was really fun as podcasts called
know what news? You know what dad,

1966
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:48,170
that's a great name for a podcast.
So, uh, so, so Bobby says,

1967
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:50,030
have you ever met colonics? I'd
never met him, but I love him.

1968
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:52,730
I think he's hilarious. And then he,
I see Bobby later that night. He Goes,

1969
01:45:52,731 --> 01:45:56,390
you know, Collin said Hi. And I said, I
don't think, I don't think we've ever met.

1970
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:57,224
And he goes,
well,

1971
01:45:57,290 --> 01:46:00,680
he was at Gotham the other night and he
sat with a guy for 30 minutes and then

1972
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:02,990
at the end said, see you later Burt.
And the bike guy goes, I'm not Bert.

1973
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:04,360
And he was all right,
take care of.

1974
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,680
He thought he was talking
to me for 30 minutes,

1975
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:10,030
like having a conversation with some
guy and the guy. That's hilarious.

1976
01:46:10,031 --> 01:46:11,780
You Burton, the guy who was, my
name's is Burton. He was like,

1977
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:17,160
oh wow. So you guys just sat down
and talk politics. Maybe ghost man,

1978
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:21,530
that goes, Bert, this is what I was
talking about. This guy from Syracuse,

1979
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:24,410
that's who it is.
Syracuse University fired Bernie fine,

1980
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:27,950
assistant men's basketball
coach for sexually abusing boys.

1981
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:30,580
So that,
that shit happens all the time now.

1982
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,000
I mean he molested half
of our elementary school.

1983
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,860
We talked about this on the podcast.

1984
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:40,090
His name was filled me up Philips and
he would just like walk behind guys and

1985
01:46:40,091 --> 01:46:44,470
smack them in the butt and he had like
this huge bucket of like prizes that were

1986
01:46:44,471 --> 01:46:45,880
like stupid small toys.

1987
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:49,380
And it was like a joke between us
in elementary school like, oh yeah,

1988
01:46:49,381 --> 01:46:54,290
he molested our friend Sean. He molested
her frame, Blah Blah. Yeah, true.

1989
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:57,510
He really did molest them. Well he
didn't just making shit up. No, no.

1990
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:00,060
I mean that's what we all believe.
But we're on the elementary kids,

1991
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:03,630
but then later. But did these kids
tell you that he molested them?

1992
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,140
I don't know how it was one
of the things that got the,

1993
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:10,260
throughout the whole entire school people,
and he has been a rumor,

1994
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:14,010
maybe even at an even as well. Even
as a kid, we all were like, dude,

1995
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:18,230
he totally is so molested and oh wow.
And that's crazy.

1996
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:23,330
Few years later he got thrown out of
school or whatever for a or a or whatever.

1997
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:30,550
I don't know. But he got suspended for
doing that. But you dodged it. Oh yeah.

1998
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:32,220
I wasn't,
his kid was too fat.

1999
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:40,200
That's a defense mechanism.
Joe [inaudible].

2000
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:41,510
Oh,
make your cell phone.

2001
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:46,570
Unpretty you don't feel purely on the
inside to make yourself unpretty on the

2002
01:47:46,571 --> 01:47:49,030
outside. That's how I get out
of most of my relationships.

2003
01:47:49,031 --> 01:47:51,820
And if it goes after five or six years,
I just start eating like crazy.

2004
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:54,760
He's not lying. He's not lying.
There's one point in time,

2005
01:47:54,761 --> 01:47:58,950
he was at the end of this relationship
and he had to weigh almost 300 pounds to

2006
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,860
six to 63 60 pounds. Yeah.
And then told you that.

2007
01:48:02,861 --> 01:48:05,380
I've done that before where I'm like,
I'm just gonna eat a lot and get rid of,

2008
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,033
get rid of them.

2009
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:11,140
That's the most self destruction way to
get out of relationship I've ever heard.

2010
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:12,611
It's hard,
man.

2011
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:16,500
How hard is it to break up with somebody
that can pass a big test though that if

2012
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:20,680
they can last for me being fat then
then all right, they deserve it.

2013
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:25,660
But it is or what your Dick and deserve.
Well me being sad story, thicker,

2014
01:48:25,661 --> 01:48:30,490
thin bitch. So you do it on
purpose is what you're saying.

2015
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:34,660
Here's the thing that there are guys in
unhealthy relationships right now doing

2016
01:48:34,661 --> 01:48:37,870
destructive shit to try to
push the girl away and, and,

2017
01:48:37,871 --> 01:48:40,900
and here's the thing that I
learned one day in a yoga class.

2018
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:43,360
I was in a miserable relationship
right before I met my wife.

2019
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:46,540
I go to a yoga class and the guy just
does that fucking gets in your head.

2020
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,400
You do the whole class
at the very end he goes,

2021
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:50,260
so right now when we lay down on the mat,

2022
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,930
I want you to think what's the
one thing that makes you unhappy?

2023
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:55,300
I remember thinking this fucking chick,
and he's like,

2024
01:48:55,301 --> 01:48:59,110
you have the power to change that
today. Take action. And I went,

2025
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:04,300
I can fucking dump her like I was.
I can make myself happy right fucking now.

2026
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:07,450
So if you're listening and
you are thinking to yourself,

2027
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:10,390
I'm not happy with my chick,
fucking change that shit.

2028
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,060
Absolutely change what a good mood

2029
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:16,610
to do is also is to sit down and give
yourself advice. Nobody ever does that

2030
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,650
self evaluation

2031
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:21,630
actually give yourself advice.
Say if I was in this situation,

2032
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:24,150
what would I say to myself? Because
nobody ever does that. There's no,

2033
01:49:24,151 --> 01:49:26,340
what am I going to do? How am I
going to fucking, you would say,

2034
01:49:26,341 --> 01:49:29,070
what if I was saying this to somebody
else? Let me take myself out of it.

2035
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:31,980
It's very difficult to do obviously,
and you can't be 100% objective.

2036
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:35,430
You should get to know you have a
situation would sit, sit back and say,

2037
01:49:35,431 --> 01:49:40,050
how would I advise myself to handle this
situation and then fucking foul that

2038
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:42,600
man, because that's the person
that's thinking clearly. Not You.

2039
01:49:42,601 --> 01:49:44,460
Now he's looking for a
shovel and some lime.

2040
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:47,900
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You've
totally fucking right.

2041
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:52,730
It's the guy going, that's
funny. It's true. You know I
never fucking listen to me.

2042
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,980
You got to go into the isolation tank.
I want to go into the isolation.

2043
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:58,510
Take really bad.
I want to get in the TM two.

2044
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:00,940
We should get one here on
meditation in the isolation tank.

2045
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:04,630
Fucking that's what I want. Get
one here. We could do one here,

2046
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:08,170
but the only thing is I'm really has to
maintain it. You have to make sure we're,

2047
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:12,710
what space would we do it? But it at
Brian, uh, the isolation tank, uh,

2048
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,190
that room next door is there where you
can rent it out like a sore. But whoa,

2049
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:19,150
we could do that.
Start off float lab

2050
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:24,280
lab is in Venice. If I talked to crash,
we'll say we'll talk to the flow.

2051
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:28,830
I want to do your license. How would it
be? That would be dope. Dope malicious.

2052
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,630
You know what? I got
an idea. I got an idea.

2053
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,190
I think I might have
to open up a business.

2054
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:37,900
We're going to open up a tank
business. Brian Ryko right
next door. Genius. Genius.

2055
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,500
I can't hear out of my left
here. Uh, one of these,

2056
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:45,830
because it's not a good headphone.
We should get new headphones.

2057
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:49,720
Scott Stole Candy. They sent me to them.
I keep forgetting to bring them here.

2058
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,490
They're at my house though,
diligently waiting.

2059
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:57,160
Did you bring a five HTP with you?
Yeah. No, I don't have any with me.

2060
01:50:57,161 --> 01:51:01,360
I have this big thing at Alpha brain,
slow roller myself.

2061
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:06,400
My personal goals, and by the
way, if you take new mood,

2062
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:11,460
this is the five HTP thing and you're
taking antidepressants already,

2063
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:15,250
it could be a problem and yeah.
Yeah. Apparently that's a Dr Site.

2064
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,480
So they say if you are,

2065
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:20,740
cause apparently what I'm Neal Brennan
was doing when he came on the podcast and

2066
01:51:20,741 --> 01:51:24,670
he started taking them out talking about
antidepressants and five HTP and hey,

2067
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:25,750
you know how it helped him.

2068
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:30,280
His doctor told him essentially that
what's happening is when you take five HTP

2069
01:51:30,281 --> 01:51:32,470
and you're already on antidepressants,

2070
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,520
it's like getting to antidepressants but
you'd actually get too much serotonin,

2071
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:40,870
which is really crazy because what
that means is that five HTP essentially

2072
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:45,250
produces much of the same stuff that
these antidepressants produce. It's like,

2073
01:51:45,251 --> 01:51:48,160
it's almost like it's natural
antidepressants saying,

2074
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:53,230
what about new mood and Stella, I
think that works. New Mood and Stella.

2075
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:56,080
Oh is it?
The beer will stele is a good beer.

2076
01:51:56,081 --> 01:51:58,170
If you want to let a chick
know that your European, yeah,

2077
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:02,183
let a bitch know

2078
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,540
Ben the London three or four times.
It's cool.

2079
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:07,920
You just got to go the right restaurant.
I got friends in London.

2080
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:10,920
I got to let them know I got
the Lens in London. Yeah,

2081
01:52:10,921 --> 01:52:12,270
I guess she was made out of kangaroo

2082
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,160
drink that I'll have a Stella. Stella,
I think in the glass is nice. I like it,

2083
01:52:19,161 --> 01:52:23,940
but it's like a light beer. I S in a glass
without skunk light be without Scott.

2084
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:26,880
You know what man? Give me one of
them bitches. I'll try it. Its role,

2085
01:52:26,881 --> 01:52:30,120
its rolling stone burden.
Fuck this one beer.

2086
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:35,390
What are we
to be a man of our stature?

2087
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:41,410
It's how much you weigh. Two 32
25 I'm like one 90 we can. We can.

2088
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,090
Yes. Nice Brian. Thanks Brian.

2089
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,330
You're a fucking gentlemen.

2090
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:50,780
Now I got to go back and
have a conversation with
my wife and my daughters.

2091
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,570
It's not gonna be half as an entertaining.
Oh it's going to be fine.

2092
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:54,510
My daughter's last night.

2093
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:57,440
That's what pop comes in and makes
it even more interesting. Again,

2094
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:00,200
I'm trying to help you
try to help you burn.

2095
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,140
We're going to turn you into a pothead.
It's going to help you. Let's do it.

2096
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,860
Here's my friend. Cheers to
uh, to uh, to a great stem.

2097
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:12,410
The studio to great new students.
How do you say the last name?

2098
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:17,090
Ah, like, like already full quad Artois.

2099
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:18,510
It's okay.

2100
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:24,430
It's got like sediment as a
bottle ban or would good. Um,

2101
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:27,680
you know, what's your favorite
bit for Sam Adams? Heineken.

2102
01:53:27,681 --> 01:53:30,320
I'm a Heineken guy and if I didn't get
a high, if I get sponsored behind again,

2103
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:32,990
I'd do it in a heartbeat. I remember
one time some Budweiser guys asked me,

2104
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:33,680
they were like,
how much time,

2105
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,950
how much would it cost to
get that Budweiser out of
your hand and put a Heineken

2106
01:53:36,951 --> 01:53:40,340
or on stage or get that Heineken in your
hand, put a Budweiser and on stage. Wow.

2107
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:43,730
And I was like, can't do it. So you
would only drink Budweiser on stage.

2108
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,970
Just drink Budweiser on stage. I
did. I did it deal with Jamison.

2109
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:50,420
I didn't deal with Jameson. Jameson
for two years. Much crazy shit though.

2110
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,450
I don't think Budweiser.
No, no, they don't.

2111
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:56,910
You seen the commercials look
at their super bowl commercials.

2112
01:53:56,911 --> 01:54:01,240
It's pretty much what you think of when
you're taking a shit. Maybe. What, what,

2113
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:03,890
what Superbowl commercials are you
talking about that you think of what you'd

2114
01:54:03,891 --> 01:54:07,160
taken a light or Budweiser commercial
commercial. Pretty ridiculous

2115
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:12,110
versus sponsor to the UFC.
So I have nothing but love for Bud light.

2116
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:15,320
There was that Brock Lesnar was, they
got nothing on. Yeah, well he was just,

2117
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:18,890
he kinda like made a joke. He was trying
to be, he's trying to be as character,

2118
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,590
you know, like he's, he's, you know,

2119
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:24,640
the heel from pro wrestling's big fucking
wrestler guy. He's selling himself.

2120
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:27,110
He's doing a smart thing, you
know, so he just fucked up.

2121
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:28,700
He shouldn't have said that,
but he just fucked up.

2122
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:32,690
But Bud light was like the first big
sponsor to step in and support the UFC.

2123
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:37,400
So I'll always be a bud light fan
just for that. It sounds ridiculous,

2124
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:38,840
but that's a big move,
man,

2125
01:54:38,841 --> 01:54:41,120
for a company to take a big
chance like that and step in.

2126
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:45,180
Do you out on sports
for Awhile? Yeah, dude,

2127
01:54:45,181 --> 01:54:47,610
I remember hearing this
shit and being like, God,

2128
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,840
did you guys go through that honey brown
stage where everyone was drinking honey

2129
01:54:51,841 --> 01:54:54,770
brown and killing it?
Brian, you always do this.

2130
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,050
You always change the subject.

2131
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,060
When we start talking about
MMA immediately while we
were talking about beer to

2132
01:54:59,061 --> 01:54:59,950
us,
we were,

2133
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:02,590
but people on line and going to get
angry with you every time you do it.

2134
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:05,470
So when, when I worked for Jamison, I
worked for James from for two years.

2135
01:55:05,471 --> 01:55:10,030
Did the Jamison tour me, Billy
Gardell, Steve Byrne, my goal, Loftus,

2136
01:55:10,031 --> 01:55:12,740
Nick Griffin and Danny Bevins and you,

2137
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:17,130
they sent cases at Jamison to your house
every fucking month they sent cases of

2138
01:55:17,131 --> 01:55:19,760
pace is of Jamison nug Spence chicks.

2139
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,230
But kids drink it all
and know when you got to,

2140
01:55:22,231 --> 01:55:24,300
we show Jamison waiting in the green room.
Oh,

2141
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,920
and the rule was you had
to drink Jamison onstage.

2142
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:30,340
You had to mention how
good your Jamison was,

2143
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:34,780
but put it on the show. Like take a set
like Dan has good fucking Jameson like,

2144
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:38,350
and you had to like, hey everyone
today, like you had to be pro Jamison.

2145
01:55:38,351 --> 01:55:40,720
I got no problem with that.
Cause Jameson is pretty God damn good.

2146
01:55:40,721 --> 01:55:44,200
It's fucking awesome. Good
Shit. We get done the tour.

2147
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,033
Are you ready for this?

2148
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:50,090
They buy us each of them acre of land
in fucking in Ireland on a river.

2149
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:53,580
All of us right next to each other.
We'd get a fucking Acre land,

2150
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:57,440
a deed and a picture. Whoa. Yeah.
Fucking Jamison was one band.

2151
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,220
You got to build a house in Ireland now
you can't build, you can't build on it.

2152
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:02,070
Build on it.
It's fucking pointless.

2153
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:06,010
Can you camp on it? You can camp
on it. Yeah, they can be to him.

2154
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:09,110
Billy Garden be permanent. Can
you have a present tent? Yeah,

2155
01:56:09,111 --> 01:56:12,680
but me and a bunch of psyches be
fucking t w O. Pikeys. Yeah, dude,

2156
01:56:12,681 --> 01:56:17,681
I've been obsessing about watching
these Irish travellers fights to me.

2157
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:22,050
Some of the uncles, oh my God, they
have some of the best fights, dude,

2158
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:24,710
you got to Brian, you've got to look
this up. They're boring as shit.

2159
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:27,770
I mean most of these guys,
but they're tough guys and everything.

2160
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:30,640
But there's a different style of
fighting when you fight bare knuckle and

2161
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,840
literally they stand there for
lunch themselves in the face.

2162
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:36,370
It's not like a street fight like you've
seen in the states have used that one's

2163
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:40,040
they challenge each other
and they challenge. He said,
I'll tell you that Johnny.

2164
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:43,930
Johnny Mac. Yeah. Good for nothing. That's
how you get a good fun happen and yet,

2165
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:46,650
cause I've got bosses Heidi off at all.
I have to tell you right. Don't know.

2166
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,160
Fight. I'll fight cha anytime before
Christmas. Any time a hawker center,

2167
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:55,100
there's a beauty, there's a video of, of
a pikey driving to a street. They said,

2168
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:58,860
well meet what do be a quarter of
the clique to rise it up here is it?

2169
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:03,680
And then whoever knows that one between
me cause I, I tweeted it a while ago.

2170
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:04,700
It's really hilarious.

2171
01:57:04,701 --> 01:57:07,490
But I can't find it in my Twitter
while the show is going on. But I,

2172
01:57:07,491 --> 01:57:09,880
I want to play it because it's so,
it's so ridiculous.

2173
01:57:09,881 --> 01:57:12,190
He something really
disturbing Irish travelers.

2174
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,080
Then there they were talking
shit before a street fight.

2175
01:57:15,081 --> 01:57:16,400
It's even better than the actual fight.

2176
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:21,450
Most disturbing pikey video on
there is most disturbing one.

2177
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:24,000
Every week someone's listening that
knows exactly what I'm talking about it

2178
01:57:24,001 --> 01:57:26,250
please tweet it to Joe and me and Brian,

2179
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:31,430
it is pikey gets what he deserves
and it's a bunch of a British school.

2180
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:37,890
Kids in a park having beers, snorting
coke, smoking weed and a pike.

2181
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:41,710
You will comes up and he won it,
but it's all done post. It's a,

2182
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:43,860
it's a recount of the British kid going,

2183
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:47,490
so a little pikey comes up and he wants
to little drink. He wants a thing.

2184
01:57:47,491 --> 01:57:50,400
I didn't do this and that.
Well we tell them it's cocaine,

2185
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:55,440
but guess who just got a nose full of k,
a special k and they cut in the pike.

2186
01:57:55,441 --> 01:58:00,000
He is fucking seizuring on the
ground. It's bulky, sketchy.

2187
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:02,520
It breaks your heart because you go,
that guy's helpless.

2188
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:06,420
He's in a k hole right now. He's not
coming out anytime soon and it's all,

2189
01:58:06,421 --> 01:58:11,160
it's if you, if you type in Brian of
you typing pikey gets what he deserves,

2190
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:14,940

see it and it fucking, you just go, oh,

2191
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:18,700

happens. It does happen. But man,

2192
01:58:18,701 --> 01:58:22,500
he was pikey fights were greived fucking
was obsessed with those for a while.

2193
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:25,980

2202
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:03,950
Hello Simon.
Wait,

2203
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:11,253
hold on.
Stop.

2204
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,190
Brian. You got two things
playing at the same time.

2205
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:16,460
There's two things playing his him and
then there's something about going on in

2206
01:59:16,461 --> 01:59:18,110
the background.
Did you hear it?

2207
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,020
It was the thing that Burt told me
that, oh, I'm sorry. I was baffled.

2208
01:59:24,021 --> 01:59:26,750
I couldn't hear how horrible. Just
want to hear this guy's blog. Yeah,

2209
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:28,310
he's what it,
this is what's going on here.

2210
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:32,950
There's a guy who was talking
shit about him online any time,

2211
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:33,980
but time Jen.

2212
01:59:33,981 --> 01:59:38,981
Now this guy came back to reply to
them anytime between now and Christmas.

2213
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:40,503
Here he goes,

2214
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,680
how about now? You ready by? We can all
do that. We don't fight with the hands.

2215
01:59:56,980 --> 02:00:01,150
The hands come up over time.
We cannot do that fight. Yeah,

2216
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:02,420
don't be squeaky clean.

2217
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,260
Always take their shirts off.

2218
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:07,420
We get seriously even when
they have terrible chess.

2219
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:08,550
Do you want me to slow it down a little?

2220
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:13,330
No. It was beautiful to keep up.

2221
02:00:13,470 --> 02:00:17,160
Hope Your Fred or with the
stamp of it nigger like Peyton.

2222
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:23,440
They need the rat poison. Hold demand
dinner. You're squeaky innocent. No,

2223
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:29,460
no, no, no.

2224
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:32,960
You look like you're the
shirts off body like that.

2225
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:37,610
Prep on your body like that.
That guy's getting aroused.

2226
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:45,040
Dependent and England. I
would fucking fight. Fight.

2227
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:49,310
Fuck. I know. This

2228
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:56,690
is my first time to you. What

2229
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:02,910
he did keep your brain damage because
of swingers club will lift your head.

2230
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:07,270
Have ever had that
thought he could put that in bath.

2231
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,190
You dirty good for that.

2232
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:17,720
But the company, should I
talk to chuck? He's password.

2233
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:32,190
Your worst nightmare. I'm your worst
nightmare. I was like, Anthony,

2234
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:37,290
we caught you. Shake the
pocket for a whole two weeks.

2235
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:40,310
Give me all, but it was finished. We flew
from Dublin. No delay at the trailer.

2236
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:43,640
You were trying to live off for 12
weeks. What? Simon? I am crystal.

2237
02:01:43,641 --> 02:01:46,630
You now officially shy
him. The Poconos. Well,

2238
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:50,580
I'm calling you to wise.

2239
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,940
I know we're going to be shutting the
fuck up at 12 weeks as well so that you

2240
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:57,660
wear as well. It's shaking the bottle.
What do we call you? Shy in the box.

2241
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:02,400
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, stop. Stop this
real quick. Can we, can we please do this?

2242
02:02:02,401 --> 02:02:05,550
Okay. Listen please. Anyone.

2243
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:11,360
Everyone right now. Uh, do their
response video to this guy. Go.

2244
02:02:11,370 --> 02:02:14,700
I don't know. No Shiny, but I know
you and I will fucking kick your ass.

2245
02:02:14,701 --> 02:02:17,970
Who the fuck do you think you aren't like,
do your American take your shirt off.

2246
02:02:17,971 --> 02:02:20,910
Let's see how good they can get.
Oh fuck. I want to do one tonight.

2247
02:02:21,850 --> 02:02:25,890
Who's second we get done, Brian, get a
camera. I'm doing a reply to that guy.

2248
02:02:25,891 --> 02:02:29,420
What's his name? Big John. And I'm going
to be dead. Fucking serious. So big John.

2249
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,260
And either, you know,
he doesn't get irony.

2250
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,570
He's going to be sitting in
this chair like one Una fuck on.

2251
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:38,400
Is the slow mode him that he's got to use
these. How many ways can you use these?

2252
02:02:38,401 --> 02:02:42,660
John was going to use
these shirts coming off

2253
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:46,530
the shirt coming off as a strange move.
Cause especially it guess it's it.

2254
02:02:46,531 --> 02:02:47,550
I don't give a fuck move.

2255
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:49,740
It's like that white rapper that
I was talking about earlier.

2256
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:52,860
Who is it takes his shirt off. It's like,
oh do Kumu. Fuck the guy with Birdman.

2257
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,360
I don't know.
But he didn't give a fuck.

2258
02:02:54,361 --> 02:02:55,770
His whole thing was that
he didn't give a fuck.

2259
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,830
Well this guy basically is doing the
same thing. He doesn't give a fuck.

2260
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:01,150
It takes his shirt off. He
knows he's fat. I love it.

2261
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:03,120
He knows he's not
pressing shirt comes off.

2262
02:03:03,121 --> 02:03:06,480
That's when the fucking postop Phil Baroni
under there. You know, that's not a,

2263
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,480
that's not a young Randy coture.
Come on son.

2264
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,260
What are you looking at now, Brian?
You're looking at funerals, bagpipes,

2265
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:15,080
and buttholes. It's like
bottles. Put the bag.

2266
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:20,200
It's grown, man. Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm fucking, what's that guy's name?

2267
02:03:20,201 --> 02:03:22,570
Big Junctions only
answers big John McCarthy.

2268
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:24,580
That guy's name was
Brian is that guy's name?

2269
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:31,450
I'm fucking Pau d'arco. Davey
Joyce. Reply to sign. Big,

2270
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:35,930
big Joe. Debbie Joyce. Alright.
To Stymie to Simon. Oh,

2271
02:03:35,931 --> 02:03:40,570
Donald Shaman. He was saying Simon this
whole time. That's what we were saying.

2272
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,240
All right.
We're going to need some cue cards,

2273
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:46,110
so I'm never gonna remember that guy's
fucking, I'll, I'll, I'll send it to you.

2274
02:03:46,111 --> 02:03:48,270
I'm trying to see if I can send it
to you right here from my phone.

2275
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,020
There's gotta be a way.
Me

2276
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,040
Too. Yes. God. That's what's
great about the Internet.

2277
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:55,380
I would ask you what your email is,

2278
02:03:55,381 --> 02:03:58,080
but then the whole world would know it
and you think about changing a bunch of

2279
02:03:58,081 --> 02:04:02,400
black dicks in the mail. I just had
to fucking pay for new, more g space.

2280
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:03,331
Really?
Yeah.

2281
02:04:03,331 --> 02:04:07,260
And that's just disgusting to me that
it's gusting from penis pictures or

2282
02:04:07,261 --> 02:04:10,320
sending out, no, it's, I think it's
from just sitting a lot of movie files,

2283
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,800
video files and stuff like that and I
wish I could like just be like, hey,

2284
02:04:13,801 --> 02:04:18,570
let me download it all immediate like
in one file and then erase everything.

2285
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:22,350
Right, because it's only
five, five bucks a year.

2286
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:26,640
But still it's like if you stop paying
it and then it takes away that space,

2287
02:04:26,641 --> 02:04:30,060
that extra 20 gigs they would pay
for every year. It's kind of a trick.

2288
02:04:30,090 --> 02:04:31,620
And then if that keeps on going,

2289
02:04:31,621 --> 02:04:34,920
that's going to be like a gas price thing
and like in 70 years we're going to be

2290
02:04:34,921 --> 02:04:38,010
paying like $5,000 a
month for g mouse space.

2291
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,160
I think you get out of hand
with the oldest that Google
has everything for free.

2292
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:49,710
They'll control the monetary system
of the world and it is. She made them,

2293
02:04:49,711 --> 02:04:53,230
they will be our overlords. Do you really
truly believe that Brian did? You know,

2294
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:58,490
I think it is a trick that that they
make you pay for a 20 gigs Esther a year.

2295
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,430
And if you don't pay, yeah, but if
they don't, if you stop paying for it,

2296
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:05,910
then they just, what the elite the last
year of your Gmail, it's kind of like,

2297
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:08,760
why should they give you so much storage?

2298
02:05:08,761 --> 02:05:10,830
That seems like the type of stores
that have propelled. Why? You know,

2299
02:05:10,831 --> 02:05:13,770
why they know why they should.
Because I got just make a second gene,

2300
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:17,150
Gmail for free and a third
g mail and a fourth g mail.

2301
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:20,850
Telling them right now he's given
me what does that against the law,

2302
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:24,270
giving away the secrets, man.
You know what I'm saying now?

2303
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,970
What do you think about the
latest and Google phones?

2304
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:31,230
Because I've been having these Google
phone versus iPhone conversations again

2305
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:32,550
lately.
We stopped with this.

2306
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:37,470
It's like the downed that's supposed to
know exactly what you go by your fucking

2307
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,920
phone and you'll know and like an hour
and month you'll be back to the iPhone.

2308
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:44,670
I know 100% you would 100% what
if I like looking at big pictures?

2309
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,100
I want a big pictures.

2310
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:50,310
Big carry your iPad around on a
sling like he used to battery. Fuck.

2311
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,310
Oh Fuck Joe. That's the next
money maker right there. Uh,

2312
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:58,090
I want you to come out with man like
Ma fanny packs mainly fanny pack.

2313
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,100
I got one right here. We have a
um, uh, higher primate fanny pack.

2314
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:06,810
Nevermind.
Most ridiculous.

2315
02:06:06,811 --> 02:06:11,490
One of all time back is more like a
survival camp. It's good for cameras.

2316
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:12,753
It's tough.

2317
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:17,460
You carry too much of a guy on the field
that needs like a belt bag. It's like,

2318
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,950
it's too ridiculous for a fanny pack.
It's a guy at work. I don't know.

2319
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:23,280
It's pretty tough. I like it a lot.
It's still sexy with it on though. Yeah.

2320
02:06:23,281 --> 02:06:25,460
I don't feel bad cause I think it
looks so ridiculous when you're around.

2321
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:28,050
Your girl just looks like Gi Joe Style.

2322
02:06:28,051 --> 02:06:30,870
Like it's not like when you look at
fanny pack you're like, all right,

2323
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:33,750
that's just lame. This to me it's
like more like, oh, he's his guy.

2324
02:06:33,751 --> 02:06:35,520
A good camera and some stuff in there.

2325
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:37,710
You know what it looks like to me
it looks like the big bad wolf.

2326
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:39,360
I'm going to put it on right
now with the big data set.

2327
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:44,180
I started watching that show grim
on Sundays. Grim. We, when we,

2328
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:47,360
are you ever going to talk about your
new show coming out? What? Fairfax? Yeah.

2329
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:51,180
Yeah. I'll talk about it. I'm
fucking, are you, are you excited?

2330
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,620
It's going to be fun.
It's a funny show.

2331
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,350
Everyone I talked to
[inaudible] excited for it.

2332
02:06:58,351 --> 02:07:00,680
I don't know if there's one episode
where I'm not sure if they're going to be

2333
02:07:00,681 --> 02:07:03,630
able to aerate. They haven't decided
yet. Are you serious? It's so crazy.

2334
02:07:03,631 --> 02:07:06,050
It's so ridiculous. Like when I heard
that we were doing it, look, I'm,

2335
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:09,450
let me tell you something. The way
they're filming it, the, the, the stunts,

2336
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,080
everything is like way more
over the top than before.

2337
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:16,950
Let's stuffy a way bigger and it's a,
it's very strange looking at Brian.

2338
02:07:16,951 --> 02:07:19,370
Brian's gotta succeed. That's your
fanny pack Brian. Yeah, look at that.

2339
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:22,380
That's like a survivor gear
sort of a thing that is a whole,

2340
02:07:22,381 --> 02:07:26,790
that is a fucking shooter in the field.
Fanny pack. You could do some serious,

2341
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:31,140
but traveling with that though, you know,
that's a good move for the airport dude.

2342
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,620
So you can film us going through the
airport. A lot of foam that though, right?

2343
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:39,940
I don't know. We're trying, we're going
to fill him in the airport. The Tsa,

2344
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:44,800
they allow you to film
the,

2345
02:07:44,801 --> 02:07:46,210
he was saying they use another camera.

2346
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:49,720
The other camera is the 70
and it's a little more, uh,

2347
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:51,740
it looks like a film like it will
you just walk around with a, your,

2348
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:54,160
you're knocking. It looks like
you're carrying a fucking camera.

2349
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:57,160
This is one of the most shocking things
about traveling in Europe is you realize

2350
02:07:57,161 --> 02:08:00,810
how much more lax they are on security.
They're much more relaxed.

2351
02:08:00,811 --> 02:08:02,620
It's much easier to travel there.
Oh,

2352
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:06,040
I flew in very nice and friendly
and easy going. It's not,

2353
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:10,720
it's not nearly as investigative as
when you land in America. Oh God.

2354
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:11,920
You know,
I fucking,

2355
02:08:11,921 --> 02:08:16,120
when I flew from London to La and coming
down in London was a cakewalk and,

2356
02:08:16,121 --> 02:08:19,960
but man coming in to, here's the
worst part is what was the problem?

2357
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:23,500
They asked you a lot. But the biggest,
the biggest problem really was I don't,

2358
02:08:23,501 --> 02:08:28,501
I wore so many different outfits in
Amsterdam evening wise and I had so many

2359
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:32,500
fucking chaotic nights that I
didn't know what was in what pocket.

2360
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:36,430
And I literally packed and I was like,
I'm pretty sure I'm clean,

2361
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:41,410
but who knows who fun. And did they
know you coming from Amsterdam? Uh,

2362
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:44,610
uh, no. I took a train, I took
a drink and I'm like flying.

2363
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:45,640
I took a train from London,

2364
02:08:45,641 --> 02:08:47,900
Amsterdam and then took a train
back from Amsterdam and London.

2365
02:08:47,901 --> 02:08:50,290
It doesn't show on your, um, no.

2366
02:08:50,291 --> 02:08:53,230
They asked where I was and I told
him Amsterdam and they said, why?

2367
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:55,090
I said vacationing and here's the kicker.

2368
02:08:55,091 --> 02:08:58,900
I had like a $30 Cuban cigar and I was
like, fuck it. I'll just roll with it.

2369
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:01,810
I'll take it home and smoke it at home.
It's a Cuban cigar butt.

2370
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:03,760
Take the wrapper off.
They'll never fucking know.

2371
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:07,870
And I told my dad and my dad goes,
don't fucking do it to $250,000. Fine.

2372
02:09:07,871 --> 02:09:10,900
If they catch you with it, well they
could move it. They cannot prove it.

2373
02:09:10,901 --> 02:09:13,120
If you just stick to your
guns and say it's Dominican,

2374
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:15,460
I'm going to fold like a cheap sheet.
I'll be like the, I'll be like,

2375
02:09:15,461 --> 02:09:16,350
the opposite of Kaiser says

2376
02:09:16,770 --> 02:09:20,320
is your, so they take me away. I didn't
mean to. Oh Man. I don't even know.

2377
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:24,900
That's a good cigar man. Why don't
you want to give it up to the man?

2378
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:28,590
I have to give it up. I don't fucking
ruined even if 10 grand, if they said,

2379
02:09:28,591 --> 02:09:31,650
all right, well let your weight with 10
grand fucking puts a dent in my family.

2380
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:32,580
Yeah,

2381
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:35,580
it is kinda crazy how all the rest of
the world is allowed to buy cigars from

2382
02:09:35,581 --> 02:09:39,750
Cuba but not us. And Man, it tasted
so good. Assholes. We're still mad at,

2383
02:09:39,751 --> 02:09:44,340
you know, they're letting us buy land.
Cuba. Would you buy land in Cuba? Uh, why?

2384
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,360
Why did I do that?
I don't know.

2385
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:50,980
Overwhelming need to go
to Cuba and plant things.

2386
02:09:51,370 --> 02:09:54,610
If you're an n of murderers anywhere
that I wouldn't want to live,

2387
02:09:54,670 --> 02:09:58,290
what would you do you imagine?
What are you milling the way?

2388
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:03,520
Hemingway in the fifties ready to make
your own hotel out there and have the mob

2389
02:10:03,521 --> 02:10:06,210
come down and run everything again.
Good old days is

2390
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:07,390
a lot of people in Cuba.

2391
02:10:07,391 --> 02:10:10,230
I bet long for the good old days
and the mob was running shit. Oh,

2392
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:15,120
that must've been nuts, man. Mom
Brung Cuban, the 1950s you know,

2393
02:10:15,121 --> 02:10:18,150
when you think about like what those
motherfuckers were in to back then,

2394
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:20,190
you know like,
like Kennedy,

2395
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,390
how Kennedy like almost flaunted his,
you know,

2396
02:10:24,391 --> 02:10:28,470
friendships with all these high level
celebrity entertainment figures.

2397
02:10:28,471 --> 02:10:31,410
And you know how all these hot
chicks are on them all the time.

2398
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:34,100
Talk about rule list like lawless,
go to Cuba,

2399
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:38,440
right in the what? Fifties sixties Oh
my God. Okay. Let's try to think. Well,

2400
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:40,040
what point would they prosecute you?

2401
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:42,860
Like you could kill someone totally
in Cuba then. Yeah. Oh, of course.

2402
02:10:42,861 --> 02:10:45,080
And what to you guy has got to,
I don't know,

2403
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:48,620
Cuba's history enough to
know who's the most corrupt.

2404
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:53,270
It was the most corrupt before, before,
before Castro. Even when Castro came in.

2405
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:56,830
Technically. But Eddie Bravo is a
huge Castro fan and so is Joey Diaz.

2406
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:59,920
You sit down with Joey D's helped break
it down for you forever about Castro,

2407
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:04,430
the good and the bad. Really? Yeah. It
says, you know Joey was born in Cuba.

2408
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:08,510
He was born in Cuba. Yeah. He was
born in Cuba and came to Miami,

2409
02:11:08,511 --> 02:11:13,370
came to America when he was really young.
Shut up. Yeah. Joey Diaz is a real deal.

2410
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:17,300
That's why he doesn't really know
how old he is really chilled.

2411
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:21,950
Yeah. Joey Diaz in Bert Kreischer
have a lot in common. You know,

2412
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:25,820
we both deal to be a really,
really funny person.

2413
02:11:25,821 --> 02:11:30,440
There's like a certain level
of unconventionality a certain,

2414
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:34,940
a certain frequency of vitals. Give
a fuck that has to be reached. Yeah.

2415
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:36,320
Not everybody can reach that,
you know?

2416
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:38,840
So when the guy comes along like you
and reaches it like that, you're like,

2417
02:11:38,841 --> 02:11:42,290
oh wow. He just took a fucking
pill from Johnny Knoxville.

2418
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:46,610
12 shots he just did. He's a number
one party animal for rolling what?

2419
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:49,750
You know what I mean? Like,
yeah, they just, you know,

2420
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:52,530
there needs to be an event that
throws you the conventionality.

2421
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:54,920
After that rolling stone article,
there was nothing I could do.

2422
02:11:54,921 --> 02:11:56,150
I wasn't going to get a straight job.

2423
02:11:56,690 --> 02:11:59,000
Who the fuck's gonna hire a guy that
took his shit on a pizza box and won an

2424
02:11:59,001 --> 02:12:02,850
election? Important man. It's important.

2425
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:04,970
It's important for
people to push the issue.

2426
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:07,170
I'd never had a,
I never had a happier day in my life.

2427
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:10,620
Brian and I were driving him to your house
or from your house one night, one day.

2428
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:15,270
And Brian and Joey called Brian and
Brian and they started talking on the

2429
02:12:15,271 --> 02:12:16,104
speaker phone.

2430
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:19,350
Comfortable cause you brought it up while
I was in the car and I just felt like

2431
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:24,210
I'm dropping. So I just said,
I go, Hey, uh, we're talking.
You go, hey Joe. If he goes,

2432
02:12:24,211 --> 02:12:26,810
hey wait guy at Joey Diaz,
I'm just want you to know I'm in the car,

2433
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:29,310
I'm in the car. I just want you to
know I don't like, God forbid they go.

2434
02:12:29,311 --> 02:12:33,750
And you know who's on the podcast
today by mark. I see him, I see it.

2435
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:38,670
But it was I'm, but I've
listened to so much of the
podcast. I go, I'm just saying,

2436
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:42,300
I'm just saying, Joey, I'm in the car. I
just want you to know that. And Joey Diaz,

2437
02:12:42,301 --> 02:12:44,110
just real smooth goes,
I might shit.

2438
02:12:45,670 --> 02:12:47,610
I was like the machine.

2439
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:52,110
Well good. The great
you know, you, you and

2440
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,860
common speaker phone. It's weird
though. Like that right though.

2441
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,540
Do you get calls a lot Joe,
when you're like,

2442
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:58,100
you have to announce it to the Colorado.

2443
02:12:58,270 --> 02:13:01,630
Oh yeah. I don't want it to
anybody so fucked up. Fuck.

2444
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:06,620
I always told my wife not to say
the n word for it. Unfortunately.

2445
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:11,060
You already said that on a
previous video blog. Did I fuck?

2446
02:13:11,061 --> 02:13:15,680
Let's get that fight video wrap up for
Joe for a big Joe Davy. All right. No,

2447
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:19,870
let's shoot mine. Oh, oh, in your video.
I'm ready to fucking challenge him.

2448
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:26,330
Your stance that he's a dead, you know
good Boston. No, I'm going to go to ocs.

2449
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:29,120
Them fighting.
Is this,

2450
02:13:29,121 --> 02:13:32,820
this is the video you told me to search
for it earlier or no, this isn't a thing.

2451
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,880
This isn't it. All right. Well that seems
like a cool fight. Videos. Yeah, it does.

2452
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:41,760
If you just type in Pikey, you'll find
so much great shit. Snatch snatch. Is it?

2453
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:42,900
Yay.
Is it gay?

2454
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:46,830
If you put a picture of shirtless Brad
Pitt in fight club in your man cave,

2455
02:13:46,831 --> 02:13:50,220
so it inspires you to work out. Absolutely
not. That's what I'm talking about.

2456
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,200
That movie is awesome.
Not that I'm doing that,

2457
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:56,510
but I have a friend who's thinking about
doing, I think it's awesome. What do you,

2458
02:13:56,511 --> 02:13:59,680
you love him as the ideal build? Is
that what it is you'd like to look like?

2459
02:13:59,681 --> 02:14:03,400
Look like that? Why can't you do it?
Uh, I'm trying. I'm trying to. Ours,

2460
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:06,150
we've got like a maniac. I'm trying,
I'm working on book like crazy.

2461
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:07,980
I'm not eating this grass fed meat.

2462
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:10,890
Thanksgiving kind of threw a wrench in my
work around like a fucking savage lift.

2463
02:14:10,891 --> 02:14:13,320
A lot of weights to trick your body into
thinking that it has to do this all the

2464
02:14:13,321 --> 02:14:16,580
time. Had a bench press and the fucking
hotel the other day in New York fucking

2465
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:21,590
pounded out high school strong like
one 35 I'll do they shit 10 times,

2466
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:23,490
10 times, 10 times. Now
what are you going to do?

2467
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:24,580
You're going to just touch the bench.

2468
02:14:24,581 --> 02:14:28,410
Commit to like a serious weightlifting
program and weightlifting and running.

2469
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:33,030
I'm running hardest shift for an hour
and I'm lifting weights, push ups, plank.

2470
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:37,290
I just want my body to be, I got to get
my blood pressure low, lower, and I want,

2471
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:40,500
I just want to be healthy. I don't want
to be a fat old man. I want to live.

2472
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:43,050
I want to look. I don't want to look
skinny. I don't want to look perfect,

2473
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,390
but I want to look like I want to
take my shirt off at the beach and go,

2474
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:50,490
I bet he has an active lifestyle. You
know what I mean? Instead of saying like,

2475
02:14:50,491 --> 02:14:55,140
I saw the way your belt, like when you
showed your tattoo, your belt doesn't,

2476
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:59,960
it holds your pants up.
It doesn't define your waistline like,

2477
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:01,650
does that make sense?
I see what you're saying.

2478
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:05,160
Like my belt cuts into my fat.

2479
02:15:05,190 --> 02:15:08,100
You have me to under my pubis and
my stomach. Sometimes it bleeds.

2480
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:11,310
You have to put a little neosporin on
it. There's no bandaid. It cuts into you.

2481
02:15:11,311 --> 02:15:15,870
It's corn syrup.
The government government cards here,

2482
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:21,780
it's cholesterol, trans
fats. That's what it is,

2483
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:24,450
man. It's the government
keep me a fat and stupid.

2484
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:26,340
No and no time in history of
people who've been fatter.

2485
02:15:26,370 --> 02:15:29,880
I don't think there's ever been a time
of history where the numbers of people

2486
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:31,230
who've been fat like in this country,

2487
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,830
the numbers are gigantic by Fatman use
get respect in the 20s when you were

2488
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:36,960
buster Keaton and you were fat.
They're like, how did you do that?

2489
02:15:36,961 --> 02:15:41,490
That's why you were a movie star.
Like, yeah, Babe Ruth. Oh, I'm here.

2490
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:44,560
Everybody was like, he must have
a lot of money. Yup, Babe Ruth,

2491
02:15:44,561 --> 02:15:47,130
who's eating steaks and
hot dogs and drinking beer.

2492
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:50,910
He's living high on the hog and
then now you're just fat. You just,

2493
02:15:50,911 --> 02:15:52,950
it looks like you're poor and don't care.

2494
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:56,040
Let it looks like you just unhealthy
and then you just have a poor diet.

2495
02:15:56,410 --> 02:15:58,160
Had No connection with
your personality anymore.

2496
02:15:58,170 --> 02:16:01,500
Such a direct connection between what
you put into your body and how your body

2497
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:04,350
feels mad and some people just,
I have friends,

2498
02:16:04,351 --> 02:16:08,260
I got a buddy who's on antidepressants
and he eats terrible. He's fucking die.

2499
02:16:08,261 --> 02:16:10,050
It's awful.
I think it's lack of women.

2500
02:16:10,051 --> 02:16:13,560
I think like the old days used to have
a wife and they used to cook for you,

2501
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:16,500
like he's nice meals and stuff. To
me, half the time I'm like, okay,

2502
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:19,490
a Jack in the box is open. A subway
is still open. You know, it's,

2503
02:16:19,491 --> 02:16:23,700
it's more of like I'm more rushing around.
I, if I were to come home like, oh,

2504
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:26,820
you know like family dinners style, you
have to kitchen table and you're in your,

2505
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:28,890
she's like, oh, I made a
casserole. You like, wow, that's,

2506
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:33,220
you've been watching too many patty
Duke movies. That's how I grew up.

2507
02:16:33,221 --> 02:16:35,320
That's how you go. You grew
up. That's how I grew up.

2508
02:16:35,321 --> 02:16:39,000
I had family dinner every day. I hadn't,
you know, we all sat at one table,

2509
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,980
still have family dinners bro, and they
were super unhealthy. I mean a family.

2510
02:16:41,981 --> 02:16:45,400
Then it doesn't necessarily make it
healthy. What, what the real problem is,

2511
02:16:45,401 --> 02:16:47,760
is most people have terrible dot.
A woman in the is,

2512
02:16:47,761 --> 02:16:50,860
what I'm saying at the house certainly
helps men. That definitely helps.

2513
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:53,380
If you live with someone, if
you have kids, even, you know,

2514
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:55,660
you all like have good food in the house,
you know,

2515
02:16:55,661 --> 02:16:57,920
you want to make sure everything's supply.
When I lived alone,

2516
02:16:58,250 --> 02:17:00,880
I ate out every fucking night of
the week. Oh. If I lived alone,

2517
02:17:00,881 --> 02:17:02,560
I'd be in great shape.
Yeah. When I lived alone,

2518
02:17:02,561 --> 02:17:07,090
I was just a comedian and
a TV show in the morning.

2519
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:11,560
Some way in restaurants, restaurants,
everywhere. For breakfast, lunch, dinner.

2520
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:14,530
I would keep some food at home just
to eat when I was starving or if I was

2521
02:17:14,531 --> 02:17:17,170
writing or something like that. For the
most part, I just went somewhere to eat,

2522
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:19,750
you know? Why would I cook? I
don't have time for that shit.

2523
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:21,970
What's the one thing you miss
about being single the most?

2524
02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:26,890
No, no, no ma'am.

2525
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:32,230
I don't miss new pussy at all
because there was always a,

2526
02:17:32,231 --> 02:17:35,500
I had to do a song and dance to explain
why that didn't go the way they thought

2527
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:39,130
it would. Like I would
never, oh that's so sad.

2528
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:44,830
That first new pussy experience you had
where you would go in and you'd get on

2529
02:17:44,831 --> 02:17:46,910
top and you were like, all right,
this is going to happen really fast.

2530
02:17:46,911 --> 02:17:48,220
And you knew that in
your head you're like,

2531
02:17:48,221 --> 02:17:52,000
the whole thing I'm trying to do is make
this not prolonged this moment so that

2532
02:17:52,001 --> 02:17:53,680
she thinks it's somewhat enjoyable.

2533
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:58,470
The only good parts about being single
are that you can have sex with more than

2534
02:17:58,471 --> 02:17:59,250
one person.

2535
02:17:59,250 --> 02:18:03,180
The only bad parts of being single are
that you're lonely and you're single and

2536
02:18:03,181 --> 02:18:05,310
it's way better to have a relationship.
It's way better.

2537
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:09,450
But the problem is we're fucking a wired
to want to have sex with other women.

2538
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:14,510
So it's becomes life becomes a matter
of managing your desires and managing

2539
02:18:16,561 --> 02:18:20,280
which ones manifest themselves into the
real world because they can cause a lot

2540
02:18:20,281 --> 02:18:23,700
of negative energy and they can cause
a lot of arguments and they can cause a

2541
02:18:23,701 --> 02:18:24,840
lot of lonely nights.

2542
02:18:24,841 --> 02:18:29,841
Like you gotta like look at like what is
the most logical plan of attack to have

2543
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:35,490
a happy life. And what is the most
logical attempt to have a wild,

2544
02:18:35,491 --> 02:18:40,491
chaotic roller coaster bride of
those chaotic nights were then,

2545
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:44,170
well, you're standing on top of a corner
of a building in New York and the sun's

2546
02:18:44,171 --> 02:18:46,990
coming up and you've got to fucking girl
from Liverpool next to you who's tongue

2547
02:18:46,991 --> 02:18:48,700
stuck to the bottom of her mouth.
And she's like,

2548
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:52,870
oh well I need a more normal pack of
cigarettes. What turns his door open?

2549
02:18:52,871 --> 02:18:54,170
That fucking shit.
When you

2550
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:57,950
find yourself fucking in a parking lot
in the middle of downtown Manhattan,

2551
02:18:57,951 --> 02:19:02,020
you find yourself just doing
crazy shit. Yeah. But you know,

2552
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:05,860
ultimately it's fun. But the real
problem with single being single,

2553
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:10,040
the real problem is meeting cool
people. It is fucking hard, man.

2554
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:12,890
It is hard to find the real person.

2555
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:16,250
You got to go out with them for awhile
and you got to talk about controversial

2556
02:19:16,251 --> 02:19:18,440
subjects. You have to,
you know, you have to,

2557
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:22,520
to get to know him and know how their
brain is for a lot of fucking fools when

2558
02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:26,360
you're saying, my goodness, you
put a nickel for every night talk.

2559
02:19:26,361 --> 02:19:28,040
And I watched

2560
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,690
this guy on a date once, and I'll
never forget this, I was, I was,

2561
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:37,160
they were to a table next to us and the
guy was talking with this girl and the

2562
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:42,161
girl's talking about her dog and
how her dog is so used to the finest

2563
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:45,950
automobiles and Mercedes
Benz and you know,

2564
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:48,230
and she was like going off about her dog,

2565
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:51,380
that if she ever tried to
bring her dog in a taxi cab,

2566
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:54,170
she doesn't think her dog would go
in. And then she was like, it was,

2567
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:56,660
it was just chaos. God. And
I was just imagining like,

2568
02:19:56,661 --> 02:20:00,380
could you imagine if you get just
stuck sitting down to this next to this

2569
02:20:00,381 --> 02:20:04,010
fucking dummy and you're actually having
this conversation and she's not being a

2570
02:20:04,011 --> 02:20:06,590
joke. She's not being
ironic, not being hilarious.

2571
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:09,860
Like that could be a hilarious statement.
You know, if you were, if you're,

2572
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:13,220
you know, being a silly person, just
joking around, she wasn't joking around,

2573
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:18,350
she was bragging about all the finest
automobiles that her dog rides in God.

2574
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:19,040
And it was just like,

2575
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,980
what kind of nonsense conversation
would you have with this person?

2576
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:25,730
That's the real issue with being single
as people don't want to be single.

2577
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,710
You want to have someone that
you could spend time with.

2578
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:31,010
But what are the odds of finding
someone who's actually fucking cool?

2579
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:35,630
It's, it's, I mean I'm, I
met fucking a hundred uncool
people before I met someone.

2580
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:35,860
Cool.

2581
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:36,490
Of course.

2582
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:39,100
And then it's also a matter of what
you bring out of that person and would,

2583
02:20:39,101 --> 02:20:40,940
that person brings out of you because you,

2584
02:20:40,941 --> 02:20:44,050
you'll behave completely different
in one relationship than another.

2585
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:46,300
And why would they ship you
a totally different guy?

2586
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:50,350
I was bad and all my relationships, but
he cheated. Fucking yelled never was.

2587
02:20:50,351 --> 02:20:54,460
I wasn't a good guy. I wasn't like,
I didn't listen, didn't give a shit.

2588
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:57,160
And then when I met, my wife thinks just
changed for the better and I was like,

2589
02:20:57,161 --> 02:20:58,930
all right.
I remember thinking to myself,

2590
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,640
I stayed single for a long
time and then I was like,

2591
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:03,730
I'm the fucking problem in all
of these failed relationships.

2592
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:05,890
I'm the Charlie Sheen like,

2593
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:10,420
well to be a Bert Kreischer to be
the fucking party animal you, you,

2594
02:21:10,421 --> 02:21:12,580
you know you're going to crack a few eggs.

2595
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:16,450
You got to Piss on a dining
room table every now and then.

2596
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,860
Fucking shit's got to go.

2597
02:21:17,950 --> 02:21:20,810
Sometimes you got to rub off on the trains
and that's the only way you make it.

2598
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,290
The Guy who's is funny,
as you are in this form of the podcast,

2599
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:28,100
you know the stories is brilliant stories.
You have to, I mean they, you know,

2600
02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:32,060
you're funny on stage comes from years
of craft and working on writing and

2601
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:36,650
performing and stuff, but
your, your ability to just
tell these fucking stories,

2602
02:21:36,990 --> 02:21:40,250
you know, on the podcast, that's why
you are created the way you're created.

2603
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:43,670
That's why your life's
been so chaotic and insane.

2604
02:21:43,790 --> 02:21:48,140
It's to create this amazing product
because a diamond doesn't get made unless

2605
02:21:48,141 --> 02:21:51,770
you have a mountain pressing up against
a piece of coal and fucking smashing the

2606
02:21:51,771 --> 02:21:55,070
shit out of me for a million years.
That's how you make a fucking diamond.

2607
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:57,780
You know you don't make a Bert
Kreischer was like a normal

2608
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:02,460
childhood, no alcohol, no
drugs. And when they say,

2609
02:22:02,461 --> 02:22:04,740
do you want a shot? You say, no
thanks. I think I'm to get some sleep.

2610
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:07,650
You know when somebody gives you a pill,
they give you two pillars.

2611
02:22:07,651 --> 02:22:09,060
You like at least gonna swallow.
One.

2612
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:13,410
I cannot fucking bang with the guy I got
to take one. At least swallowing was,

2613
02:22:13,411 --> 02:22:16,050
man, you're not, you're not
completely fucking around here.

2614
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:19,380
The best part about Johnny Knoxville
is I ran into him at California chicken

2615
02:22:19,381 --> 02:22:22,140
cafe one day,
like fucking five years later.

2616
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:23,790
And I'm sitting there and he walks in.
He's obviously,

2617
02:22:23,791 --> 02:22:26,160
he's famous at the time he's been
doing, and he walks in, I go,

2618
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,890
Johnny Knoxville, and he looks at me
Real Cretney real quick. And he goes,

2619
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:33,030
Bert Kreischer, I went, shut the fuck up.
And he goes, the number one party animal,

2620
02:22:33,031 --> 02:22:35,610
the country. Oh, what the fuck are
you doing out here? And I was like,

2621
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:38,580
is the fucking greatest guy?

2622
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:42,990
And his whole fucking posse
was at California chicken
cafe. And I was like, oh,

2623
02:22:42,991 --> 02:22:45,960
I wonder if they'll invite me over
me. Them. I want to meet Steve. Oh,

2624
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:50,750
that's awesome. Does he ever done
stand up? No. He's, he's a, he's, he's,

2625
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:53,820
he could tell stories. Yeah. He
seems like he could do stand up.

2626
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:57,270
He should do the podcast. Oh, it'd be
awesome. Steevo was fucking awesome.

2627
02:22:57,271 --> 02:22:59,950
That was he, why did he go in at
one dude, he was in the Ice House.

2628
02:22:59,951 --> 02:23:04,440
Chronicles number three I need to
subscribe to Tivo was, first of all,

2629
02:23:04,470 --> 02:23:08,160
he's cool as fuck. But second of
all, his fucking experiences, dude,

2630
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:12,550
he was on a tree and I'll lie in,
climbed up the tree and got on time.

2631
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,220
Saw that on TV.

2632
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,610
And that was the craziest thing I've
ever seen in my fucking life. Dude.

2633
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:18,880
I Tamed Lions.
But I saw that

2634
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:26,230
you did what a damn lions for birth
to conquer did. Yeah, I was, no,

2635
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:29,240
we shot it, but it never
aired. The show got canceled.

2636
02:23:29,241 --> 02:23:30,990
Like right after that we shot that,

2637
02:23:30,991 --> 02:23:33,120
the fight in the bear and then tailoring
the lions and then the show got

2638
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:37,500
canceled. The guy tells me he goes,
how long ago was this? And this is

2639
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:41,920
seven years ago,
I guess.

2640
02:23:41,921 --> 02:23:46,890
So 2004 video exist. Uh,
Mark Cronin as it somewhere.

2641
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:49,920
I'm sure dude released that shit on
the Internet with fucking, it was,

2642
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:53,360
it was a bizarre fucking
taming lions was a nicer you,

2643
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:55,680
you have video of you
with a full grown lion,

2644
02:23:55,681 --> 02:23:57,510
like an actual three full grown lion.

2645
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:01,080
Three full grown Lyons and
he brings them out of this.

2646
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:03,630
I'm more crone and let's get
ahold of them. Yeah, I know. Mark,

2647
02:24:04,410 --> 02:24:06,810
do you have his phone number? Do
you ever, I know more gorilla.

2648
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:10,980
He was my boss for like, he did produce
the x show on Fx. Love to see that video,

2649
02:24:10,981 --> 02:24:11,701
put that video.

2650
02:24:11,701 --> 02:24:15,480
He fighting the bear and getting fucking
raped by a bear and then meet him in

2651
02:24:15,481 --> 02:24:18,870
three lines. How much money do you
think, if that got a million hits,

2652
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:21,750
how much money do you think that someone
would make if they had like those

2653
02:24:21,751 --> 02:24:25,290
youtube ads? I don't think I've
got a million hits. I don't know.

2654
02:24:25,291 --> 02:24:28,740
That's a really good question because I
heard that like Rebecca Black check that

2655
02:24:28,741 --> 02:24:31,850
girl that made that Friday, Friday
song that everybody's going to blu ray,

2656
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:34,560
but it had like an
unbelievable number of views.

2657
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:38,340
Like something like 35 million plus.
I mean what's the name?

2658
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:40,990
You know who would know is,
what's his name? John? It's

2659
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:45,470
totally no. Yeah, I don't think he's
going to tell you how much money's making.

2660
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:46,730
Yeah, I wonder man, cause I would,

2661
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:49,590
I would think that if you could
make getting millions of hits,

2662
02:24:49,591 --> 02:24:53,490
boy that's probably,
I mean to that video though,

2663
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:56,670
Fox owns the rights stones
all asked them to do,

2664
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:00,540
I asked him to do a DVD so it's like
them to release it and put an ad on it.

2665
02:25:00,541 --> 02:25:01,890
They can make some money.
Why not go?

2666
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:03,750
Maybe it'd be worth it for
them to do it that way.

2667
02:25:03,751 --> 02:25:06,300
I'm just thinking like
how much for for you know,

2668
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:10,410
how much does it like a million hits
pay in a youtube ad? I don't know.

2669
02:25:10,411 --> 02:25:12,960
I've never, I have no clue. And
it's interesting that that sort of,

2670
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:13,860
you guys would have,
how much,

2671
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:18,150
how many hits did you get on the mindset
of a democratic version of a television

2672
02:25:18,151 --> 02:25:20,260
channel? Really when you
think about it, I mean you,

2673
02:25:20,261 --> 02:25:23,950
you really not want to say democratic,
but an open version of it.

2674
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,843
Cause it's like,

2675
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:29,440
like there's guys like our friend from
the message board that d six Kid that

2676
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:32,350
guys' videos have millions of hits,
right?

2677
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:37,090
Doesn't mean millions, millions of
hits. And he's, he's got ads on those.

2678
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:39,640
So I mean you gotta be making
a few dollars here and there.

2679
02:25:39,641 --> 02:25:40,421
I don't know how much it is,

2680
02:25:40,421 --> 02:25:45,421
but essentially like this is like
one step in a multistep process of,

2681
02:25:45,610 --> 02:25:48,430
you know, like exactly what
we're doing here. The podcast,

2682
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:53,431
being able to make your own shit like
and not need a travel channel or a,

2683
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:58,270
an NBC or anything to produce something
like it's so he could do it all through

2684
02:25:58,271 --> 02:26:02,200
the online and having it online is
actually like reaches more people than the

2685
02:26:02,201 --> 02:26:04,000
networks.
Cause eventually going to happen.

2686
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:07,210
I mean how many times do you watch
something and I'm in full screen on your

2687
02:26:07,211 --> 02:26:08,600
laptop or on your uh,

2688
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:12,650
desktop now, like a view to video and
you see it as like cool definition.

2689
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:15,940
It's the first four episodes of Pan
Am on my computer and I was like,

2690
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:19,630
watch Soto Margarita there.

2691
02:26:19,650 --> 02:26:22,580
There's a fight that's coming
up and they had that 24,

2692
02:26:22,581 --> 02:26:26,630
seven and I watched it on beach.
And you go to Hbo, go on your Ipad,

2693
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:31,280
you can watch anything that's ever
been on HBO, anything for free.

2694
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:34,900
Wow. I'm like, are you fucking kidding
me? I went down to watch the entire life,

2695
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,950
all the fights while the fucking, all
the, what is 24, seven again, Hbo, Hbo Go.

2696
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:42,590
You have to have, obviously you
have to have an HBO subscription,

2697
02:26:42,890 --> 02:26:45,470
but you ha you just log in.
We show it like it.

2698
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:50,660
You can watch anything they ever bored
to death, entourage, fucking boardwalk,

2699
02:26:50,661 --> 02:26:54,380
empire soprano's, Kali specials,
every one's comedy specials,

2700
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:57,080
anything that's on there, you
can watch it. And I'm like,

2701
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,920
how the fuck is showtime not have that?
How does Cinemax not have that?

2702
02:26:59,921 --> 02:27:02,360
That was one of the greatest,
sure. Eventually they will just,

2703
02:27:02,361 --> 02:27:05,930
Hbo got there first and Hbo is on top
of that shit because I'll put that on my

2704
02:27:05,931 --> 02:27:08,060
iPad and go on the elliptical.
I know it sounds Kinda busy,

2705
02:27:08,061 --> 02:27:11,840
but go on the elliptical and which feels
better than running better on my knees.

2706
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:13,400
Smart and he can go hard.

2707
02:27:13,401 --> 02:27:17,270
Man can go hard with the elliptical or
very casual and watch a board to do what

2708
02:27:17,271 --> 02:27:21,860
you do sometimes. So, uh, but men,
it's the best. It just streams live.

2709
02:27:21,861 --> 02:27:25,220
My daughters, this is how crazy this
has happened. My daughters, we have,

2710
02:27:25,430 --> 02:27:27,680
we have fucking more TV's in
our house than we could ever.

2711
02:27:27,681 --> 02:27:30,380
We have two in the man cave,
three in the, in the house.

2712
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:33,200
And my daughter's sit in front of the
computer every morning and my wife's

2713
02:27:33,201 --> 02:27:36,200
little office and watch a Netflix.
They stream this live.

2714
02:27:36,201 --> 02:27:40,010
Next stage we need to set
up a podcast headquarters.

2715
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:44,000
Let inside Bert Kreischer his man
cave. Let's do it. Let's do it.

2716
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:48,380
I'm in for it. Brian. You
said it. I'm going to set it
up. He's too busy. Stop it.

2717
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,510
You're going to have to get your
own guy and eat your own Brian.

2718
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:53,120
But we'll set up just to
hang out at karaoke bars.

2719
02:27:53,121 --> 02:27:56,210
And Karaoke bars are a great place
to start. A lot of good sound guys.

2720
02:27:56,240 --> 02:28:00,560
Go to karaoke bars. Get A, um, a setup.

2721
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:03,950
So you could just podcast anytime
you want. So you're sitting at home,

2722
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,190
you hide in your man cave at one o'clock
in the morning and have a couple of

2723
02:28:07,191 --> 02:28:11,290
beers by yourself. You can
just start talking into a
microphone. Just ranting and,

2724
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:14,870
and can, you can stream it live, right?
Sure. You can use treatment. Absolutely.

2725
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:17,300
It's a beautiful qstream and you can
do it just like we're doing it here.

2726
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:20,900
I'm doing it also goes to MP
three [inaudible] name it.

2727
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:23,710
Let's name it Zune.
Did you say you're buying a Zune?

2728
02:28:27,730 --> 02:28:29,450
Is the MP three recorder Bro.

2729
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,910
That's the one that Ari Irish
years and then I'm getting a,

2730
02:28:31,911 --> 02:28:35,420
and I got a good camera right now,
so I put up one shot.

2731
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:39,320
What do we name it? Well, yeah,
that's exactly, I was going to say,

2732
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:43,610
what do we call this thing? The machine
in the man cave. That's not bad.

2733
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,460
That's not bad. Machine in the
man cave was not fucking bad,

2734
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:49,760
but the only thing I would think of as
you would want people to be able to,

2735
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:53,960
well what the fuck with Mark Marin?
I don't machine the man cave.

2736
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:57,260
I don't know if I want people finding
Bert Kreischer because a lot of travel

2737
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:01,060
channel's going to be fucking super
happy about me making another TV

2738
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:06,860
outcast. You're not getting paid for
it. You're doing it for your fans.

2739
02:29:06,861 --> 02:29:09,440
You're doing it because
you're an entertaining
motherfucker and people want to

2740
02:29:09,441 --> 02:29:12,860
hear you talk all the time and
look what we're doing right now.

2741
02:29:12,890 --> 02:29:15,080
There's a lot of people right
now that are in their cars.

2742
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:16,520
There's a lot of people at the gym.

2743
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:18,470
There's a lot of people
that making some bumpy.

2744
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:21,560
We're taking the train in and commuting
to New York, right back out the jersey.

2745
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:25,070
Exactly.
And Boring as fuck.

2746
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:28,100
It drives him nuts and you can
bring a little chill. I'm doing it.

2747
02:29:28,130 --> 02:29:31,010
I'm doing it like my man cave and I'm,

2748
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:35,120
I am getting on this ship before I go
back on the road to Chicago. There you go.

2749
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:38,810
I'm getting on this shit. I'm making it
happen. So the machine in his man cave,

2750
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:39,673
I dunno,
I dunno.

2751
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:42,440
But the travel channel is only going
to like it because it's only going to

2752
02:29:42,441 --> 02:29:46,520
promote your show more. Yeah.
You know, it's like, why
would it, why would it hurt?

2753
02:29:46,850 --> 02:29:51,470
It's not going to hurt bro.
Play. It's just like it on
Facebook. Yeah, Dude. Just,

2754
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:56,510
yeah. Your online presence right now,
it's just starting to blossom. You know,

2755
02:29:56,770 --> 02:29:59,660
if you have your own podcast,
you'd be straight one and shit.

2756
02:29:59,661 --> 02:30:04,090
Bert Kreischer my right Brian.
Yeah, mother Fucker crusher.

2757
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:06,320
I think you should just do it here though.

2758
02:30:06,321 --> 02:30:09,380
I don't think you should do it in your
man cave. Well, you could do it here,

2759
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:11,330
you know, but yeah, but
Brian's, it's the easiest way.

2760
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:13,910
I like to be a little buzzed
if I'm going to do it.

2761
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,890
Sometimes that's what the
couch is for. Yeah, I know,

2762
02:30:15,891 --> 02:30:19,460
but what am I spend the night here. You
want to cuddle with Brian? Sorry girls.

2763
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:23,750
Daddy's a death squad. I
can't make at home. How cool
that sentence sounds. Do it.

2764
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:25,040
Daddy's a death squad.

2765
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:28,280
That's the name of that watch to tell
everybody because people always ask,

2766
02:30:28,281 --> 02:30:30,950
what are these fucking squat?
Where does death squad name come from?

2767
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:34,970
You guys call yourselves to death
squad. The sucker shoot over. Oop, oop.

2768
02:30:34,971 --> 02:30:35,870
From opie and Anthony,

2769
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:39,950
I came into the studio and it
was with my friend Eddie Bravo.

2770
02:30:40,580 --> 02:30:44,390
No Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. First
man to ever tackled first American ever.

2771
02:30:44,391 --> 02:30:48,460
Topic, Gracie and Tate,
Tate Fletcher, you know,

2772
02:30:48,470 --> 02:30:53,210
205 pound fighter from the ultimate, uh,
from the ultimate fighter. I was there,

2773
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:57,890
Brian was there and he's
obviously a killer, so probably
have not. Yeah. And so,

2774
02:30:57,891 --> 02:31:01,970
you know, oop, looks at it. He goes, it's
Joe Rogan Brian the death squad. You know,

2775
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:03,530
and we just started
joking around y'all bro,

2776
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:06,710
with a dust squad like just as a goof.
And it became,

2777
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:09,880
now it's like one of those words
like, like you hear it, you know,

2778
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:13,430
you hear death squad and he'd go,
that is the douchey exist.

2779
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:16,310
Most grow a dump,

2780
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:19,300
but to us it doesn't even have
that same meaning anymore.

2781
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:22,530
That's why the logo balances it
out. Yeah. The logo with the cat.

2782
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:25,590
It's like when you're, it's like when
you and your friends just a name,

2783
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:28,350
when you and your friends heard a
bunch of douchebags saying like, Bro,

2784
02:31:28,351 --> 02:31:32,370
Ham and spring break and then you started
calling each other bro him as a joke

2785
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:35,160
and then all of a sudden you start
calling you up to other bro him for real.

2786
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:39,000
Yeah. Like pro him. And he's like,
what's up bro? Im like, oh fuck no.

2787
02:31:39,001 --> 02:31:43,200
Are random white guys,
those random white guys I'm doing it.

2788
02:31:43,201 --> 02:31:45,000
Just squat sounds the
douchey best thing ever,

2789
02:31:45,001 --> 02:31:47,280
but it's just a a group of Nice people.

2790
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:51,000
It's a group of Nice people
that want to make you laugh.

2791
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:55,590
I don't know why that's a Douchey, douchey
name. Just sort of balances it out.

2792
02:31:55,950 --> 02:31:58,590
Otherwise we'd be two fe.
We'd be taken advantage of.

2793
02:31:58,620 --> 02:32:00,660
People would stomp all over us.
They wouldn't do it.

2794
02:32:00,661 --> 02:32:03,900
And Fierce Bert Kreischer people.
Firas Bert Kreischer does.

2795
02:32:03,901 --> 02:32:07,620
Any message you want to give to the
young people, the world. What is it?

2796
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:10,290
What have you learned in your
time on this planet? My friend.

2797
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:16,800
Just take half. Just take half. Yeah.
Don't want to Overdo it with drugs.

2798
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:22,210
Just take one. Take half.
Just take one or two.

2799
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:25,380
Take one. That's sound
advice. Sound advice.

2800
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:29,220
My advice would be pretend you're taking
it, spit that bitch and the glass.

2801
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:32,940
Wait a few hours to see if nobody dies.
People die.

2802
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:35,760
But the problem is then when
you do take it, if nobody dies,

2803
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:38,580
then unfortunately you're going to be
like last one to the party. You know,

2804
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:40,140
you last one to the k hole.
Oh Man.

2805
02:32:40,141 --> 02:32:42,120
Everybody will be coming out
and you'll be sliding in.

2806
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:44,140
Uh, one time, uh,

2807
02:32:44,350 --> 02:32:49,100
this is fucking right after college,
we go to a,

2808
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:51,910
we go to a strip club, I'm living in New
York. We go to a strip mine, one boy,

2809
02:32:51,911 --> 02:32:54,400
he's getting married in Atlanta
and everyone gets ecstasy.

2810
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:57,850
So we go to this with this bus,
this big fucking party bus,

2811
02:32:57,851 --> 02:33:01,270
and we're going to the strip clubs
in the hood and the swots. And uh,

2812
02:33:01,271 --> 02:33:03,950
it was just when outkast
came on with that song, uh,

2813
02:33:03,970 --> 02:33:07,180
everybody moved to the back of the bus
and they were playing it on repeat and

2814
02:33:07,181 --> 02:33:10,270
everyone took ecstasy and
everyone was taking it.

2815
02:33:10,271 --> 02:33:13,120
And they gave me one and I was
like, oh, I'm going to take it.

2816
02:33:13,121 --> 02:33:15,310
And then at the last minute I went,
I'm not going to take it.

2817
02:33:15,370 --> 02:33:19,000
I don't want to take, actually tonight,
I'm think I'm cool. And then 35 minutes,

2818
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:22,480
everyone was started fucking going.
Flipper just passing out.

2819
02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:26,680
And I was like an where they were moving
bodies. I remember liber like going

2820
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:32,180
like season, like yeah, having seizures
and they go fucking fall down. Whoa.

2821
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:35,750
Just had an instinct to not take it.
I remember it was in the bathroom.

2822
02:33:35,751 --> 02:33:39,170
I had to be pulled and I was just like,
I don't want to take ACCC, man. I'm fine.

2823
02:33:39,171 --> 02:33:42,170
I'm, I was past that phase
in my life and I was like,

2824
02:33:42,171 --> 02:33:43,220
I'm not going to fucking take it.
I see.

2825
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:44,660
But they've given it to me and I was like,

2826
02:33:44,661 --> 02:33:46,670
I have in my hand to that
kind of changed your life.

2827
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:48,530
You got brain damage from that. Well, the,

2828
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:52,060
all my friends now are fucking
stockbrokers and there I go. Well,

2829
02:33:52,490 --> 02:33:54,170
goddamn psychopaths,
they're always pots.

2830
02:33:54,171 --> 02:33:57,830
Both of the corruption that has led
to the downfall of this great economy.

2831
02:33:58,220 --> 02:34:02,120
Oh God dammit. Bert Kreischer. But
yeah, I did. I dodge that bullet.

2832
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:06,110
Make a contribution to the world.
Bert Kreischer buy American cars.

2833
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:07,820
You Buy American cars.
I have a Ford out there.

2834
02:34:08,510 --> 02:34:11,210
That's what I'm fucking talking
about. Brian Drugs. Shit,

2835
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:15,650
I really would love to go all American.
What are you driving today? Um,

2836
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:18,250
take out my BMW,
but you have a Ford Mustang.

2837
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:21,120
That was my phone was my favorite car.
It's my most silly card,

2838
02:34:21,121 --> 02:34:24,670
but my favorite car. But next boss thing
I'm going to get is a hard top. The uh,

2839
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:26,650
the,
the rag top freaks me out.

2840
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:29,230
The fact that just fucking media
could just hit you in the head.

2841
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:33,890
I went on hard type Dif.
Odds of that happening are very slim.

2842
02:34:33,891 --> 02:34:38,410
I just show it also feels like it's
about that, you know, I have a,

2843
02:34:45,750 --> 02:34:50,210
well, it'll lessen the blow. Perhaps

2844
02:34:51,320 --> 02:34:56,100
cigarette. He's Tom's a girl.
Put them on. All right. Oh,

2845
02:34:56,101 --> 02:35:00,290
took out of my fucking car. Hold on.
Why is your car on? Where's my Koran?

2846
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:02,270
It's not a stretch ones.

2847
02:35:04,470 --> 02:35:07,610
Put It on speakerphone. I'm trying.
You want me to do it for you?

2848
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:10,790
Hey,
you're on the Joe Rogan podcast with Joe.

2849
02:35:10,970 --> 02:35:15,850
Hey Daddy.
Tommy Burns.

2850
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:20,330
When I talk about that guy Burt crushes,
you got a problem with that guy.

2851
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:30,660
What did that, where are you at? Where are
you at? Do you bypass it ina come say hi

2852
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:36,810
it right now. We're live right now.

2853
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:46,670
How was the bird?
Christ and Tommy.

2854
02:35:46,671 --> 02:35:48,950
I'm going to tell him about the
time I shaved your underarms.

2855
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:55,690
All right. I love you Dominique.

2856
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:59,930
He, we were in, we were in Hawaii
doing a cake is under Tom's hair. Tom.

2857
02:35:59,931 --> 02:36:03,550
So fucking Harry. His hair connects
from his underarms to his chest.

2858
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:06,640
And I was like, and I go, I saw, and
I go, Tom, you can't let that happen.

2859
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:11,290
I'm so glad you brought this up because
I want you to tell me what you told me

2860
02:36:11,291 --> 02:36:15,350
last night. Is that cool? Can you tell
me last night what those guys said? Well,

2861
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:19,750
the guy said about like the reason why
you were happy that Russell Peters wasn't

2862
02:36:19,751 --> 02:36:22,270
there when you guys were shooting guns.

2863
02:36:22,390 --> 02:36:25,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Tell that story.

2864
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:28,750
So let's, I'll start to
it for the, so we do me,

2865
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:33,730
Tom and Russell Peters do a Gig for the,
for the USO,

2866
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:38,320
for the military and Pearl Harbor, our
Buddy Charlie books. It flies us all down.

2867
02:36:38,321 --> 02:36:40,510
Russell's brothers' there.
Russell's a great guy.

2868
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:43,060
Love Roslov Russell and I
love his brother even more.

2869
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:45,300
If I could tick a one person to death,
it would be his brother.

2870
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:48,970
His brother Clayton has got the best
giggle in the wine. Just get mad.

2871
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:51,880
So think about it a little bit.

2872
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:56,200
So we get there and Russel now
Russel is definitely a big,

2873
02:36:56,201 --> 02:37:00,130
like he's a big name and he doesn't,
he's not gonna he's there to do the show.

2874
02:37:00,131 --> 02:37:03,130
He's also there for vacation with his
check and his brother and his wife and

2875
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:04,840
they're having a good time and
then when it's all to hang out,

2876
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:07,060
but there's like a list of things
that they kind of wanted us to do.

2877
02:37:07,180 --> 02:37:09,460
One of them is like a sample firearms,

2878
02:37:09,550 --> 02:37:13,300
like go out and shoot firearms and and
like do this like thing where these

2879
02:37:13,420 --> 02:37:14,740
people come up in the,

2880
02:37:14,741 --> 02:37:17,420
in the screen and you've got to shoot him
and Russell don't want to do this shit.

2881
02:37:17,421 --> 02:37:19,550
So we're like, we're
like, all right to me Tom,

2882
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:24,170
Charlie and all are wives
go out to do this. Like
simulation where it's, it's war.

2883
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:25,910
We're all have guns.
We all have fucking,

2884
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:29,240
there's a big thing up and
we get out there and we're
like, man, I wish I hustled.

2885
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:31,760
Come. This is really cool.
And Tom's like, yeah, I know.

2886
02:37:31,761 --> 02:37:34,060
And then the guy comes up and he's like,
alright,

2887
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:38,450
the simulation started in 30 seconds.
If it's brown and it moves,

2888
02:37:38,451 --> 02:37:39,710
you kill it.
And we were like,

2889
02:37:39,711 --> 02:37:43,030
well thank God Russell didn't come because
he would not have enjoyed this case.

2890
02:37:44,830 --> 02:37:48,740
That impression is amazing. Gimme
that impression again. All right,

2891
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:53,480
this starts in 30 seconds.
If it's Brown and it moves you kill it.

2892
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:55,880
God Damn,
that sounds like nick melting.

2893
02:37:56,500 --> 02:38:01,250
It's my old [inaudible] about 10
years ago is still robust. Oh. Oh Man.

2894
02:38:01,251 --> 02:38:02,810
I have a credit is the craziest shit ever.

2895
02:38:02,811 --> 02:38:06,260
So just so we joking around about killing
brown and then Brian and then Scott,

2896
02:38:06,290 --> 02:38:08,300
Tom and I just kind of blow it off.
We're like, oh, that was fucked up.

2897
02:38:08,301 --> 02:38:09,950
I'm glad Russell wasn't
here for that will Clayton,

2898
02:38:09,951 --> 02:38:11,900
cause they're both very brown.
So,

2899
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:16,640
so then we go to do the show and I
go at first and I, and it's like,

2900
02:38:16,641 --> 02:38:19,310
I kind of do okay. Uh, but
I'm hosting a little bit.

2901
02:38:19,311 --> 02:38:20,750
Tom's younger at comedy at the time,

2902
02:38:20,751 --> 02:38:23,600
so he's going to go second because
it's a little easier of a spot.

2903
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:26,430
He goes second, he opens
with a joke, like, uh,

2904
02:38:26,570 --> 02:38:29,840
they say don't make fun of Hawaiians.
Tom's opening joke was, wow,

2905
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:33,140
island living is a really slow down
here. They, that's what they told me.

2906
02:38:33,141 --> 02:38:35,060
I didn't know they were talking
about your metabolism's. Wow,

2907
02:38:35,061 --> 02:38:38,930
these people are fat. Like that's
his opening joke, right? Yes. So, uh,

2908
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:43,960
so then Russell goes on stage and Tom
and I realized for the first time we put

2909
02:38:44,121 --> 02:38:48,290
the dots together that these people had
been trained to kill Brown people and

2910
02:38:48,291 --> 02:38:51,800
they just have a brown person
headlining on stage and they don't see,

2911
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:56,570
they're not seeing the nuances of Indian
versus Iraqi. They're just seeing brown.

2912
02:38:56,660 --> 02:39:00,670
And you can hear the murmur in the crowds.
It's like, why is this guy here? Why,

2913
02:39:00,671 --> 02:39:02,990
why don't we have a white guy
like you know, in their heads yet.

2914
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:05,570
And Tom and I was just like, Ooh.
And then what about black guys?

2915
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:10,030
Black is very different than
brown to, I mean I'm, look, I'm,

2916
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:13,160
I'm also with the black guys having,
what are they saying?

2917
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:14,300
We wish we had a black guy.

2918
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:17,600
There weren't a lot of black
guys to be honest with you.

2919
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:20,180
It was a lot of white guys. Yeah,
it was, I mean it was Pearl Harbor.

2920
02:39:20,181 --> 02:39:22,850
We weren't in like the thick of it.
It was a lot of officers.

2921
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:25,880
It was the navy like,
I mean, and I'm also,

2922
02:39:25,881 --> 02:39:28,670
I'm also putting words in the mouths of
people who aren't allowed to talk right

2923
02:39:28,671 --> 02:39:30,740
now. So I don't want you to
think I'm, I'm from Pearl Harbor.

2924
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:33,350
I don't have a problem with Brown
people. But I'm telling you, we were,

2925
02:39:33,351 --> 02:39:37,430
this was the heat of the war and this
is what me and Tom Experience. Yeah.

2926
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:40,540
Know the truth. And it was,
and we were like, fucking,

2927
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:43,360
then the next day they were like,
yeah, you're never coming back. Well,

2928
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:47,030
and Charlie lost that Gig. It was a
really cool gig. Hawaii for like a week.

2929
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:49,250
But so during this Gig,
so,

2930
02:39:49,530 --> 02:39:52,700
so you would go to Hawaii for a week
and do how many shows? He was one show,

2931
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,560
two shows you used to do two shows,

2932
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:58,010
one in like the mess hall for the guys
and that could be dirty as you want it to

2933
02:39:58,011 --> 02:40:00,110
do. And then one in, um,

2934
02:40:00,830 --> 02:40:04,160
and then one for like that
was on stage and like dog,

2935
02:40:04,161 --> 02:40:06,830
the bounty hunter would come
out and like wave to everybody.

2936
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:10,660
So did they cancel it because
Russell was brown desc I think they,

2937
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:14,010
I think they said they canceled
it because Tom and I were dirty,

2938
02:40:14,011 --> 02:40:16,530
but we weren't really dirty.
You know, like we were just,

2939
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:20,250
we didn't like curse at all. But I
think they just, they just canceled it.

2940
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:24,900
You can't curse. It was also a new,
you couldn't curse at all, but great.

2941
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:26,280
But no one cares.
No one cares.

2942
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:29,200
Could you imagine though,
the idea that you are,

2943
02:40:29,350 --> 02:40:31,360
they can send you to war,

2944
02:40:31,361 --> 02:40:35,800
they can arm you with guns and tell you
you're supposed to kill these people,

2945
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:40,780
but you can't hear anybody
swear at a comedy show.

2946
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:43,960
I mean that was the military. I think
that's pretty much like their thing.

2947
02:40:43,961 --> 02:40:45,810
They don't ever let people
curse on their shows.

2948
02:40:45,811 --> 02:40:49,750
I remember I read a Louis Ck article
that he had on his blog about, um,

2949
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,340
going to,
uh,

2950
02:40:51,550 --> 02:40:55,420
overseas to entertain the troops and
about how one time he kind of got dirty at

2951
02:40:55,421 --> 02:40:58,540
a show and he apologized afterwards,
but he's just like, he couldn't help it.

2952
02:40:58,750 --> 02:41:01,810
They were loving it. They were just going
crazy and you know, he couldn't help it.

2953
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:06,430
He just wanted to entertain them. He
wanted them to be laughing. But yeah,

2954
02:41:06,431 --> 02:41:08,870
I guess they, uh, they do
a lot of censorship, Huh?

2955
02:41:09,470 --> 02:41:11,560
Keep you from really doing your full act.

2956
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:14,470
Right. But the first night there we
got, me and Tom get there and there's,

2957
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:15,321
Russell is not there.

2958
02:41:15,321 --> 02:41:18,560
It's just me and Tom and our wives and
Tom and I did proceed to get fucking piss

2959
02:41:18,561 --> 02:41:22,100
drunk and on the beach. And then
we go up to his room. I don't know,

2960
02:41:22,130 --> 02:41:24,860
my wife falls asleep. It's
me, Tom and Christina push.

2961
02:41:24,890 --> 02:41:29,570
I call her in the in his room and Tom
has his shirt off and he's and his chest

2962
02:41:29,571 --> 02:41:32,210
hair connects from his armpits
to his tits. So you Tommy,

2963
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:35,000
let me shot shape and that shape
that for you. I'll shape it.

2964
02:41:35,001 --> 02:41:37,850
So it looks like you have breasts so
you look more muscular and he goes,

2965
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:42,910
you think that'll work? I'm like, yeah,
we're both really drunk. So I say align,

2966
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:43,801
right?
I shave,

2967
02:41:43,801 --> 02:41:48,801
have a line here and I give him a very
well defined armpit hair that looks like

2968
02:41:49,011 --> 02:41:50,700
a fucking mustache.
And then it,

2969
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:55,380
and then I shave all this and I just give
it what it looks like. It looks, yeah,

2970
02:41:55,410 --> 02:41:58,790
Tom got pictures and it looks like it's
tits wearing tits or wearing a mask

2971
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:01,950
about to commit a robbery. This
looks like fucking two tents. One

2972
02:42:02,210 --> 02:42:04,670
Ooh, no one knows who we
are. I will. Well folks,

2973
02:42:04,671 --> 02:42:08,030
we need you to harass Thompson girl
on Twitter and tell him to put these

2974
02:42:08,031 --> 02:42:11,000
pictures online. We need to see these
pictures. He's got him. He posted on,

2975
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:12,830
I think they're on his
Facebook to be honest with you.

2976
02:42:12,831 --> 02:42:15,680
Going to put down in your mom's house.
This was a great guy. He's really as well.

2977
02:42:15,681 --> 02:42:17,090
I love funniest fucking guys.

2978
02:42:17,150 --> 02:42:21,950
So did you want to talk about that
situation you had or know if five five

2979
02:42:21,951 --> 02:42:24,920
minutes perfect situation had yeah,
no,

2980
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:28,990
I mean I don't, I'm not, I
mean, I don't know what his say.

2981
02:42:28,991 --> 02:42:32,770
I mean it's, you know, I
don't know. It's a weird,

2982
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:36,100
you don't have to talk about it.
What do you, what would you say?

2983
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:38,620
What would I say if I was you?
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2984
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:43,660
I, it's a, I don't know if I
saw Bieber at a grocery store,

2985
02:42:43,661 --> 02:42:44,980
I would also get hard on

2986
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:48,440
that. Was that about, is that what you're
talking about? No, no, no, no. Listen,

2987
02:42:48,441 --> 02:42:50,660
I don't want to force you in anything,
so we'll just end this thing right here.

2988
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:54,190
Uh, seriously. Cause we got to end anyway.

2989
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:57,560
We got five minutes before the power
goes off because this is a three hour

2990
02:42:57,561 --> 02:43:00,740
podcasts already and that three hours you
stream cuts it off and then it becomes

2991
02:43:00,741 --> 02:43:02,130
two separate Hongson it gets annoying.

2992
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:04,150
J Morton,
I've been very incestuous.

2993
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:07,450
I would say with this Tracy Morgan story,

2994
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:11,020
Jay as admittedly on his podcast,
said he,

2995
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:13,510
her about that had
happened to him and he did.

2996
02:43:13,550 --> 02:43:17,530
He distinctly regrets having ever having
told it on opie and Anthony that had

2997
02:43:17,531 --> 02:43:19,990
happened to him. He started
telling it that it happened to me.

2998
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:23,500
And at the time that he told her that it
happened about me, I didn't. I was like,

2999
02:43:23,501 --> 02:43:26,150
Oh fuck, that makes me
feel like whatever. I, it,

3000
02:43:26,151 --> 02:43:29,200
it was a story I never wanted told I
didn't want to told because I don't know

3001
02:43:29,201 --> 02:43:33,530
Tracy. I don't, I, I'm telling it's a
fucking something I never wanted to,

3002
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:36,280
I want it to be behind the scenes. Like
when you have a good Mitch Hedberg story,

3003
02:43:36,281 --> 02:43:39,130
I thought it would be one
of those, you know, and uh,

3004
02:43:39,131 --> 02:43:42,480
and thought it'd be a good story that we
tell at comedy clubs and, right. Yeah.

3005
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:45,490
Everywhere. Where there's a lot
of those a lot I like, yeah,

3006
02:43:45,491 --> 02:43:47,200
I got a great auto on George Story.
There's a,

3007
02:43:47,210 --> 02:43:49,480
there's a bunch of great stories
that we all tell each other.

3008
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:53,550
And so Jay started telling us stage and
then started telling him that that had

3009
02:43:53,551 --> 02:43:58,300
happened to him. I talked to him on his
podcast about it and he distinctly said,

3010
02:43:58,301 --> 02:44:00,550
I'm, I'm done telling it. I'm
never going to tell it again.

3011
02:44:00,551 --> 02:44:01,660
I don't want to tell it anymore.

3012
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:05,380
It's my wife thought it was a bad idea
the first time I told it. And then,

3013
02:44:05,381 --> 02:44:09,030
and then what happened was we went
to Amsterdam and Gary Finkel, Gert,

3014
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:12,070
Gary Garfinkel, the VP of, of showtime,

3015
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,230
said to me in front of a bunch of comics,
uh,

3016
02:44:15,380 --> 02:44:19,780
your Bert from the Tracy Morgan Story,
Jay tells on a special and which fucking,

3017
02:44:19,781 --> 02:44:23,140
it's like throwing a lunch meat in front
of lions. Like Dave. Everyone's like,

3018
02:44:23,141 --> 02:44:25,060
what do you mean, what
do you mean? And then I,

3019
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:29,290
twofold protective of a friend,

3020
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:33,860
I was concerned that he had taped it
for a special, and I was like, that's,

3021
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:37,390
it's going to make, that's fucking
sociopathic. You can't do that.

3022
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,340
But he, I talked to him today and
he said, you know, he did did,

3023
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:44,060
he did tape it for a special, but he
told it that had happened to me, which I,

3024
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:47,090
you know, it's a very, it's still a weird
middle ground because I, you know, I,

3025
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:51,630
it's still your story. It's still your
life still. Your, it's still your story.

3026
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:53,860
You told him the reason why it
was funny in the first place.

3027
02:44:53,861 --> 02:44:57,340
Cause you told him he laughed at it and
then he repeated what you said. Yeah.

3028
02:44:57,360 --> 02:45:01,870
And it's your story to the
events in, I mean, it's, you
know, whether it's, you know,

3029
02:45:01,871 --> 02:45:06,740
look, every story is not exactly
the events in category in,

3030
02:45:06,741 --> 02:45:09,250
you know, in order, in
absolute order. It's,

3031
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:12,430
there's an art to telling a story and
that's what you're really good at.

3032
02:45:12,431 --> 02:45:14,500
You're really good at
not just telling stories,

3033
02:45:14,501 --> 02:45:17,650
but telling them what the economy of
words and setting them up correctly and,

3034
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:21,550
and building it right to a big ending.
And that's what you did in that thing.

3035
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:26,410
It's not just a story. Okay.
Because you didn't tell that
story as if, uh, you know,

3036
02:45:26,411 --> 02:45:30,290
it was, you're connecting the dots. Man
Walks on, land man finds plant management.

3037
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:31,270
You didn't do that.

3038
02:45:31,270 --> 02:45:35,650
What you did is you told it
in a theatrical way and he
just simply repeated that,

3039
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:40,290
okay, that's not telling someone's story.
That's stealing someone's bit. Yeah.

3040
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:43,450
You know it all right Brian?

3041
02:45:43,810 --> 02:45:45,160
I think so.
Absolutely.

3042
02:45:45,161 --> 02:45:48,920
If I told you a story of
something that was really same,

3043
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:51,400
I mean it's like that's a real story.

3044
02:45:51,401 --> 02:45:53,760
That's like I saw I was
going to stop doing,

3045
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:56,290
I saw somebody get hit on the
highway and die. You know,

3046
02:45:56,291 --> 02:45:57,340
like the brain splattered out.

3047
02:45:57,370 --> 02:46:00,160
I talked about a long ass time ago on
a podcast and it was like one of the

3048
02:46:00,161 --> 02:46:02,080
biggest, craziest things
that's ever happened to me.

3049
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:06,430
If I told that story to Joe and then
Joe started doing it originally as it

3050
02:46:06,431 --> 02:46:10,400
happened to him on stage to begin with,
immediately that would piss me off.

3051
02:46:10,401 --> 02:46:13,580
So fucking hard. And then the fact
that you've talked to them already,

3052
02:46:13,581 --> 02:46:16,130
I think that would even make
it even a thousand times worse.

3053
02:46:16,830 --> 02:46:21,770
I think that, I think that in this,
in this worst case scenario that I,

3054
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:24,300
this is, you know, obviously, but

3055
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:25,680
I think he didn't look his best.

3056
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:30,150
He did that it the fact that the
story is structured in a funny way,

3057
02:46:30,630 --> 02:46:33,630
you know, you told him a story
that's structured in a funny way.

3058
02:46:33,780 --> 02:46:37,830
It's not simply a bunch of facts
just put together in a timeline.

3059
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:40,110
You told it to them in a,
in an entertaining way.

3060
02:46:40,310 --> 02:46:43,860
You know, the, the, out of the, all of
this that happened, I think the best,

3061
02:46:44,280 --> 02:46:48,260
best of the worst case scenario is that
he did, he does tell it on a special,

3062
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:52,170
I mean, I, you know, he does tell him on a
special that had happened to me. So in a,

3063
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,130
in a weird way,
I get,

3064
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:57,080
yeah, he gets the last for something
like, well, yeah, that's mean.

3065
02:46:57,081 --> 02:47:01,720
It's pretty important. I mean,
Jay, yeah. Well it's, I'm fucking,

3066
02:47:01,750 --> 02:47:04,670
he doesn't want to not do it because
it's too good. Yeah. He, uh, yeah.

3067
02:47:05,880 --> 02:47:08,380
And it's written out how you set it down.

3068
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:11,380
It's not like he did not
put the words in the story.

3069
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:15,730
You do only the only fair thing to do
is have Jay on the podcast and let him

3070
02:47:15,731 --> 02:47:17,500
tell his side of the story.
I don't know.

3071
02:47:17,501 --> 02:47:22,210
I mean or not or act like like like
exactly how we acted like that before.

3072
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:26,380
We just don't fucking talk to the guys
don't have anything to do with that guy.

3073
02:47:26,410 --> 02:47:27,460
I don't want to be apart of,

3074
02:47:27,550 --> 02:47:30,890
I don't want to be a
part of, of the, of an

3075
02:47:30,970 --> 02:47:32,800
tack on Jay at all because I never,

3076
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:36,940
I mean it's as much as I should
have been a fucking grown man.

3077
02:47:37,450 --> 02:47:38,970
I should been a grown man
at the very beginning.

3078
02:47:38,990 --> 02:47:41,770
If I wasn't comfortable with
what was being happened,

3079
02:47:41,771 --> 02:47:43,930
I should have been a grown man stood
up and said, I don't like this.

3080
02:47:43,931 --> 02:47:47,020
Make it stop right now.
That's what I should've done.
You're right. And in essence,

3081
02:47:47,021 --> 02:47:48,370
I, I didn't. And

3082
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:52,960
so and so what is happening is
exactly you reap what you sow. I,

3083
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:57,760
I allowed this behavior, I loud.
Whatever is happening to happen. It's,

3084
02:47:57,960 --> 02:48:01,950
and it's as much my fault
as it is anyone's guess.
You're in a bad relationship.

3085
02:48:02,910 --> 02:48:07,610
Yeah. You need a break up.
Yeah, I'll, that's what it
sounds like. Maybe it's to you.

3086
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:11,760
Do you need to make up? Is that what's
going on? He kiss you on the belly.

3087
02:48:12,390 --> 02:48:15,390
Does he make you do things you don't
want to? Yeah. What does he do?

3088
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,240
There's a secret here. You're,
you're your who were molested.

3089
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:24,680
We're going to turn down the
lights and we run out of time. You,

3090
02:48:24,681 --> 02:48:27,750
Brian Chesky says yes.
It, we were at a time.

3091
02:48:27,751 --> 02:48:30,960
I don't want it just to
go over a good, uh, well,

3092
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:32,940
we're over on iTunes,

3093
02:48:32,941 --> 02:48:37,710
but we have about seven minutes
on eastern being molested. No,

3094
02:48:37,711 --> 02:48:39,710
he's over on iTunes.
That,

3095
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:43,650
that might work better than they
used terms. The thing that Tom,

3096
02:48:43,770 --> 02:48:45,450
Tom and I had a conversation
about it last night

3097
02:48:46,380 --> 02:48:50,400
and I, you know, it, it,
uh, it is behavior. If, if,

3098
02:48:50,430 --> 02:48:53,790
if in fact I should take a
responsibility for everything.

3099
02:48:54,030 --> 02:48:56,640
My Ego was inflamed the first time he
told it and he said that it happened to me

3100
02:48:56,641 --> 02:48:59,100
and my ego was inflamed and I loved
it because it made me feel good.

3101
02:48:59,101 --> 02:49:02,070
It made me feel like I was a real comic,
that I had a real fucking thing.

3102
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:04,500
And then I thought that was where
it would end. I didn't, you know,

3103
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:08,280
obviously we said this, I've said
this, Morgan feel about this.

3104
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:12,060
I don't want fucking defined out because
here's the worst part is I never want

3105
02:49:12,061 --> 02:49:15,180
to trace it up. The reason I ever told
it, so I didn't want fucking Tracy to go.

3106
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:18,630
Bert Kreischer why'd you tell that story?
Why do you mean,

3107
02:49:18,650 --> 02:49:22,490
why can't you keep that to yourself? Yeah.
You know, I have kids. I'm a, you know,

3108
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:26,720
that's the fucking worst part
of it is. I mean, I think Tracy,

3109
02:49:27,260 --> 02:49:31,420
I doubt he remembers at night in the
slightest, but I don't know how he'd,

3110
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:33,650
I don't know how he act.
It's hopefully, you know,

3111
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:35,060
here's the worst part is I told it,

3112
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:39,080
I told the story to a bunch of
comics in Cincinnati with Tony Woods.

3113
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:42,050
Tony Woods was one of my good friends
who used to party all the time.

3114
02:49:42,051 --> 02:49:43,940
And Tony was there that night.
And Tony,

3115
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:46,490
and I know when you tell the story
so much and then you start going,

3116
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:49,040
how much of this is true?
Like you just end up getting,

3117
02:49:49,130 --> 02:49:52,240
hitting the beats of your story and then
you're like, yeah, you're like, what?

3118
02:49:52,850 --> 02:49:55,860
And so I said to Tony, I go, I'm going
to tell the story again. I go, man,

3119
02:49:55,870 --> 02:49:59,900
step in at any point and tell me where
I'm straying off from the exact truth.

3120
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:03,440
And he was like, okay. Told
all whole story verbatim.

3121
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:06,140
Antonio at the only point,
the correct it is.

3122
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:10,580
He thought Tracy said more
before. He said, no, that's
how you get out of Panacek.

3123
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:14,180
He thought that he was like, no, Tracy
stood up and he was like, check this yet,

3124
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:17,900
and gave a little bit of a monologue,
which I just, I just got to the,

3125
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:20,960
Oh say set a few more things. Like he
stood up and he was like, yeah, yeah.

3126
02:50:20,961 --> 02:50:23,810
And then, and then as we left, you
change that to like somebody else,

3127
02:50:23,811 --> 02:50:27,290
like Alan Thicke or something. It's your
story, Dude. It's your story, you know?

3128
02:50:27,291 --> 02:50:32,000
And that's disturbing, but
it's depressing isn't it? Yeah,

3129
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:34,040
it was a great podcast.
I'm glad we ended on that.

3130
02:50:34,110 --> 02:50:37,800
Yeah, I had a great time
today, man. It was for him.

3131
02:50:37,801 --> 02:50:40,920
As much as it's important for you
to not let people step on you,

3132
02:50:40,921 --> 02:50:42,350
for him to not step on people.
Yeah.

3133
02:50:42,490 --> 02:50:43,690
He,
he knows.

3134
02:50:43,691 --> 02:50:48,691
I think he knows everything that he did
wrong in that trans transparent show

3135
02:50:50,020 --> 02:50:52,370
that you were a little bit weak
and I was weak and the and so,

3136
02:50:52,390 --> 02:50:56,920
so if anyone is at fault,
I'm as much of his fault and a little bit,

3137
02:50:56,950 --> 02:51:00,430
you let him step on you.
Yeah, and so it's completely,

3138
02:51:00,460 --> 02:51:03,910
it is something that if I want to
have a productive life as a comic,

3139
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:06,760
I fucking pass it.
Maybe people hear that story and they go,

3140
02:51:06,761 --> 02:51:09,700
who the fuck's Bert Kreischer and they
researched me on is after a special,

3141
02:51:09,740 --> 02:51:12,650
I think that's going to do more damage
to him, then it's going to benefit him.

3142
02:51:12,651 --> 02:51:14,180
He's a great storyteller.
He's a funny,

3143
02:51:14,470 --> 02:51:17,030
really funny and he's a
great story story like that.

3144
02:51:17,060 --> 02:51:20,360
It makes him seem illegitimate.
It really, I mean he's, he's got,

3145
02:51:20,361 --> 02:51:22,930
he's better than that. It doesn't
need to do that. He does all,

3146
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:25,880
his whole act is good.
He's a solid comic.

3147
02:51:25,881 --> 02:51:28,460
He's a very funny guy and it
doesn't need to do that one bit.

3148
02:51:28,461 --> 02:51:33,220
That one bit discredits him in a way
that's unfortunate and unnecessary and uh,

3149
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,350
unfortunately really,
truly it's going to define it

3150
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:39,550
smart is that big.
Killed then is the rest of his material.

3151
02:51:40,750 --> 02:51:42,550
He does a really fucking bananas.

3152
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:45,580
Tracy Morgan repression is dynamite,
you know,

3153
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:48,710
if you know it's almost excusable just
because of the Morgan impression is so

3154
02:51:48,711 --> 02:51:52,780
fucking good. It was a really fucking
good, when you read the chat threads on,

3155
02:51:52,781 --> 02:51:56,270
on Youtube, it's like he could
do that with anybody though. Man.

3156
02:51:56,271 --> 02:52:00,020
He does a great Colin Quinn and he's a
great impressionist. He's one of the best.

3157
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:01,370
He is in my opinion,

3158
02:52:01,371 --> 02:52:05,560
one of the most underappreciated
impressionists amongst comedians down his

3159
02:52:05,561 --> 02:52:06,430
Collin Quinn

3160
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:09,340
is on the fucking bun
and it's really funny.

3161
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:11,470
He has like funny shit that he says,

3162
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:16,870
no, no, no, no. I'm never going
to fucking man. You can't.

3163
02:52:16,871 --> 02:52:19,000
You can't not be honest.
You got to

3164
02:52:19,250 --> 02:52:22,580
breast the positives, the negatives,
the whole ball of wax. It's not

3165
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:26,020
his, and he'd, he would agree. I would, I
would venture to say you would probably,

3166
02:52:26,021 --> 02:52:29,520
if he was sitting at this table agree
with everything we're saying to,

3167
02:52:29,570 --> 02:52:30,910
to a large point,

3168
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:35,740
and I think his wife is Nikki is a lot
like you in the sense that the first time

3169
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:39,250
he told that on opiate, Anthony has
it. It happened to him. She was like,

3170
02:52:39,251 --> 02:52:42,580
you fucked up. You can't do that. You
can't say that it happened to you.

3171
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:46,490
You don't have to, you don't have
to. It's not necessarily, you know,

3172
02:52:46,550 --> 02:52:47,660
Mark Twain once said,

3173
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:51,500
always tell the truth that way you don't
have to remember anything and it's a

3174
02:52:51,501 --> 02:52:54,670
smart fucking thing. It's a
smart way to be, you know,

3175
02:52:55,070 --> 02:52:56,450
people forgive you for the truth.

3176
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:59,670
They don't forgive is horse shit
because then they the goddammit,

3177
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:02,720
it's tough enough communicating with
people with noises that you make with your

3178
02:53:02,721 --> 02:53:05,360
fucking mouth. You know, that
we, we, you know, we would,

3179
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:08,960
we attached to a bunch of meaning. It's,
it's difficult. It's difficult to do.

3180
02:53:08,961 --> 02:53:11,930
When I find out that you're making
artificial noises, you're faking it,

3181
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:15,770
that you're saying things that aren't
true or you're bullshitting me or you know

3182
02:53:15,771 --> 02:53:16,011
you're,

3183
02:53:16,011 --> 02:53:19,940
you're representing yourself in any way
where I feel like now I can't get an

3184
02:53:19,941 --> 02:53:20,960
honest read from you.

3185
02:53:21,260 --> 02:53:25,010
Now our communication is all horse
shit because you just have this,

3186
02:53:25,070 --> 02:53:27,020
this impression that you want to put out.

3187
02:53:27,020 --> 02:53:29,330
You don't want me to know
the real you want to,

3188
02:53:29,331 --> 02:53:32,690
you want to put out this impression
and you wanted me to respond to it in a

3189
02:53:32,691 --> 02:53:35,510
positive way to fill up your
fucking insecurities. Okay.

3190
02:53:35,511 --> 02:53:37,160
And that's not what it's
supposed to be all about.

3191
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:40,070
That's why when you were talking about
your machine story and you were saying,

3192
02:53:40,071 --> 02:53:43,040
could you imagine if that machines do
have somebody came up to you and goes,

3193
02:53:43,041 --> 02:53:45,920
dude, you go everywhere you go.
People, y'all at the machine.

3194
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:49,070
I mean I have a tee shirt,
I have two of them that say the machine,

3195
02:53:49,071 --> 02:53:52,430
it has your face on it. Could you
imagine if that wasn't a real story

3196
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:56,940
owed it would having a somebody else,
oh, it would fucking crush. Crush me.

3197
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:02,470
If someone found out that that was a fun,
that it was entirely fabricated,

3198
02:54:03,060 --> 02:54:06,010
I would fucking, no one would ever
listen to a word. That's the only reason.

3199
02:54:06,011 --> 02:54:06,844
The only reason I,

3200
02:54:06,980 --> 02:54:11,200
I ever was hesitant about ever telling
the Tracy Morgan story in the first place

3201
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:15,430
because all it took was Tracy Morgan,
one tine salmon that never happened.

3202
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:20,440
And my entire credentials as a comic for
the rest of my life were done with no

3203
02:54:20,441 --> 02:54:23,380
matter if me and Tony Woods stood on
a soapbox and Washington square park,

3204
02:54:23,560 --> 02:54:28,300
like Charlie said, I just
agree and I think everybody
would believe you. Oh yeah,

3205
02:54:28,301 --> 02:54:31,450
maybe. Maybe. I don't know. You
know how people view Tracy Morgan?

3206
02:54:31,451 --> 02:54:32,141
Let's [inaudible] I remember,

3207
02:54:32,141 --> 02:54:35,230
I remember when I was young comic in New
York saying I had a story that was this.

3208
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:36,250
It was,

3209
02:54:36,250 --> 02:54:40,180
it was based off of a bit that I had heard
in the music and I liked the way they

3210
02:54:40,181 --> 02:54:41,230
tag the song.

3211
02:54:41,231 --> 02:54:45,370
And I just wrote this bit with this story
involved and the tag was the song from

3212
02:54:45,371 --> 02:54:48,100
an outcast lyric and it was great.
It was fucking great.

3213
02:54:48,101 --> 02:54:50,110
And this fucking guy came
up to me and he goes,

3214
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:53,680
that is one of the best stories I've
ever heard. It has it. It has ego,

3215
02:54:53,681 --> 02:54:55,540
it has everything that's
beautiful about a story.

3216
02:54:55,690 --> 02:54:57,030
You've got to tell me is it true?

3217
02:54:57,170 --> 02:55:00,160
And I looked at him and I
wanted credit and I went, no,

3218
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:04,130
I fucking made it up and if you at me,
like I told him

3219
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:08,540
I fucked Santa Claus, Santa Claus in
the ass, and I was like, I was like,

3220
02:55:08,541 --> 02:55:11,050
number one,
I will never fucking make up.

3221
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:15,920
I will never make up like a fucking
fabricated. That is you just,

3222
02:55:16,550 --> 02:55:17,181
it just,

3223
02:55:17,181 --> 02:55:19,580
you just don't have anything to fucking
put your head on the end that you put

3224
02:55:19,581 --> 02:55:20,960
your head in the pillow and the
end of the night and you go,

3225
02:55:20,961 --> 02:55:22,580
all I got or whatever happened to me,

3226
02:55:22,700 --> 02:55:25,460
however I fucking tell it however
I craft it and present it.

3227
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:29,150
Unless you tell a story that you
wrote and made up and then go,

3228
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:31,820
I just made that up. That didn't really
happen. Oh yeah, I've done that before.

3229
02:55:31,821 --> 02:55:36,350
Plenty of times. Yeah. They're not doing
something for common book comic relief.

3230
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:38,630
As long as you're not trying
to mislead people. Yeah,

3231
02:55:38,650 --> 02:55:41,780
as long as you're only doing it for
your intention is to fucking entertain.

3232
02:55:41,810 --> 02:55:44,600
That's what my job is. I'm a fucking
comedian. It's a fucking comedian.

3233
02:55:44,601 --> 02:55:47,360

3240
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:10,320
It's very nice. It makes me feel
sexy. I like it. It's a light fit.

3241
02:56:10,321 --> 02:56:11,300
It's like a summary.

3242
02:56:11,370 --> 02:56:12,203
