1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,940
I bet she would take the shoes off,
throw them to the audience.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,300
I love that bag.
And you put the youtube videos,

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:09,930
black and white that day,
or she'd take a gold chain strong.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,240
Rip His shirt off.
I need to see this.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,010
Go Jamie.
Young Jamie.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,270
Bring up law loop.
A loop.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,290
A 19.
I mean she was a fucking crazy bitch.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,440
She came.
My mom was friends with all along,

9
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:27,090
but later on I grew up with his son.
We were young kids up in Spanish Harlem

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,810
and I would go up there and visit them
and she was crazy.

11
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,840
They even did a one woman show watch
large egg.

12
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,020
Why looppay the queen of Latin soul.
This crazy bitch.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,850
Wow.
Can you.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,460
Is it okay to sit?
They'll play.

15
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:48,290
It could inherit.
I don't want to get kicked off of

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,580
Youtube.
So many of us own this,

17
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,414
right?
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,570
Stressful on her shit.
Her shoes,

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,020
she throws it rings.
She just throws whatever is closest to a

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,333
look at it.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,340
It just gets crazy.
It gets crazy.

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,700
What is it about Latinos?
Latinas?

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,310
About Latin people?
What is it about Spanish people that

24
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:15,200
makes them so passionate and crazy and
hot blooded?

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,380
What is it?
Is it genetic?

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,910
Is it culture?
Be Genetic.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,100
It's got to be genetic.
You think so?

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,000
When you get 10 Cubans together or kind
of talents together,

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,010
Greek,
the volume goes up.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,240
We're all from the same.
Something has to be something.

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,230
The volume goes up automatically.
Old Sicilians.

32
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,170
The volume goes up,
man.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,810
What is it?
And then you have the Spanish thing that

34
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:43,210
is just fucking nuts.
Listen man,

35
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,450
right out in the open right now.
Say I'm as Cuban as can be.

36
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,250
Born in Cuba.
I don't mess with Cuban women.

37
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,310
Don't mess with Spanish women.
I just don't.

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,130
I love him to death.
You talked to a lot of Jewish people

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,640
guys.

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,580
They'll say,
I love being a Jew.

41
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,420
The whole thing.
I don't mess with Jewish women.

42
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,950
They just don't.
You grew up with your mom.

43
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:02,470
You know what you're going to get.
You know what you're going to get.

44
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,810
You think about your mom and we'll,
we'll put up with her shit.

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,120
You know your mom is Sicilian whole
school.

46
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,110
You know,
it's different,

47
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:09,040
man.
They yell,

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,860
they scream.
You don't want to put up with that.

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,060
My mom was pretty calm.
Her mom was a yell or scream or yell or

50
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,821
scream.
Uh,

51
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,500
if there's a problem,
sweet.

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,610
The saints get called once to say it's
called,

53
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,770
you got a problem.
What did I do to deserve this?

54
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,881
But,
uh,

55
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,301
no.
I,

56
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,290
I can't.
Uh,

57
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,020
it's too much.
It's just too much,

58
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,160
man.
Too much passion.

59
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,890
The shoes come on.
People getting yelled at.

60
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,230
I don't dig it.
People throwing shit at each other,

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,010
but you get those spicy Latina is,
you know,

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,180
narrow zeroed in and you get them where
they're fucking savages.

63
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,810
If you control that into sex and all
that,

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,000
it's fucking probably savagery.
Like I said,

65
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:54,001
I've been with one Spanish girl and I
moved on enough that that's how good the

66
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,690
pussy was.
I got left back seventh grade back.

67
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,770
I stopped going to karate.
I stopped to church

68
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,340
and that was just dry humping and,
and feeling her tits.

69
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,710
Can you imagine if she gave me that
monkey in the seventh grade?

70
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,540
That would have been fucking walking
dead.

71
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,310
Do you remember how overwhelming it was
the first time you were with a girl?

72
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,220
Overwhelming.
You'd never had any sort of feeling like

73
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,280
that in your life and now it's just
overwhelming,

74
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,370
completely overwhelming,
and then you have two sets of friends.

75
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,210
Do you have the logical friends and then
you have animal friends when you're 13,

76
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,940
so I had friends that would go,
that's nice.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,640
Where are you guys going to go to a
movie and then you have the fucking

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,720
heavy duty.
Adam,

79
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,554
what are you going to do?

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,650
Finger motion?
Yeah.

81
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:36,484
They're like,
what are you going to do?

82
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,090
You got to fucking grab or make out what
the right number.

83
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,140
They just tell you what to do.
You're lost.

84
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,900
You completely fucking lost when you're
13,

85
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,380
but how great is it?
The fall in love and hold hands and go

86
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,200
to the movies and go get a slice of
pizza.

87
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,840
When I was 13,
I lived in this place called Jamaica

88
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,290
plain and it was like a at.
It's becoming more gentrified now,

89
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,900
but at the time was kind of sketchy.
We had some kind of crazy neighbors when

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,510
this one kid,
his name is Paul Hudson,

91
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,000
he lived right next door.
Poly Hudson was my age.

92
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,760
We were both like 13,
but he was like 30.

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,950
He was like a 30 year old,
13.

94
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,680
He knew a lot of shit.
And I remember one time he was talking

95
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,560
about I hadn't,
I hadn't even come close to sex.

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,240
I don't even know if I had kissed a
girl,

97
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,460
like maybe like a little pack or
something like that at 13 Paul yachts

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,190
and probably fucked 100 girls by that.
I'm not kidding.

99
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,310
It was an animal and a and he,
we were talking and he goes,

100
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,880
uh,
somehow or another it got on the subject

101
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,960
of how a penis enters the vagina,
how it gets in there.

102
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,030
And uh,
and he was telling me,

103
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,520
it goes up,
you go up in a and I go,

104
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,320
you go up in there.
And he goes,

105
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,140
you ain't never fucked a girl,
have you?

106
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,180
And I'm like,
no,

107
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
no,
I definitely haven't.

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,820
Like,
I didn't want to admit it,

109
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm sure.
But if it was fucking obvious,

110
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,810
I didn't even know that your Dick went
up.

111
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:54,490
I thought it went straight in.
We all do.

112
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,950
I just found that out now and I'm 53.

113
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,810
I didn't know the up and I literally
thought I could never figure it out in

114
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,280
my head because I was like,
well,

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,700
I kind of know where the vagina is.
Like how could it work?

116
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,740
Going straight through it.
It doesn't make any sense.

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,650
But that's literally what I thought.
I thought you went straight in.

118
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,910
I thought it was like a belly button,
like the thoughts you have about sex or

119
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,630
man or young woman got to be.
You don't know.

120
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,060
Yeah.
You can't figure out why they do that.

121
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

122
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,180
You're so confused because he didn't
have any of those thoughts to three

123
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,390
years ago.
Like you're 10 and you're just thinking

124
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,150
about comic books and you know,
all this stuff.

125
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,360
You think about when you're 10,
you know,

126
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,270
what do you like to do?
You like to go fishing or something,

127
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,830
you know,
just hanging out with your friends and

128
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:43,630
then all of a sudden you're 13 and your
dick is hard all the time and you're so

129
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:47,520
confused and when you're around girls
they hug you and your follow.

130
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Your body's just overwhelmed.
The smell of their hair and just being

131
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,950
around them is so attractive.
You know,

132
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,220
like,
Holy Shit is this

133
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,820
first time you sneak up behind a girl
you're behind and you smell her,

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,280
her harrison,
your mode.

135
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,260
You've got like a fucking anxiety
attack.

136
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:09,680
Like what the fuck is this?
Was that close to you and touch you?

137
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,680
And then you have the.
Did you have somebody who broke sex down

138
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,760
for,
you know,

139
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,590
like,
like we had a dude in my neighborhood

140
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,650
always at war.
Taos name was Puerto Rican Nelson and he

141
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,420
lived in the back of a thing and we go
to him.

142
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,960
It started with him fixing our bicycles
and we evolved with him.

143
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,720
So we want it from playing baseball on
the street.

144
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,730
And he would come out,
he was a bartender at night.

145
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,190
He would come out and throw balls with
us.

146
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,690
And with football,
and that's the guy you go up there and

147
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:34,191
you go,
hey man,

148
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,240
can we talk to you tonight?

149
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,780
Because firstly introduced us to weed,
right?

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,980
He was like,
you guys smoke weed?

151
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:40,641
And we're like,
Nah,

152
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,070
we ain't have no.
He sold us like seven joints for five

153
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:46,400
hours.
So he became a dealer and then the next

154
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,390
level.
Which girls.

155
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,300
So we asked them,
what do you know,

156
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,190
what do we do about girls?
And he would yell at us.

157
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,870
You guys never fucked what kind of
little facts on,

158
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,290
you know,
he would just fucking say a bunch of

159
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,970
shit.
And then,

160
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,290
uh,
it got to the point,

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,890
we have clinics at this house.
We go,

162
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,060
can we come over tonight?
Yeah,

163
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,270
better be quick.
What time?

164
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,770
Seven 30.
We come over and we'd go,

165
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,660
Nelson,
we have to take this girl out.

166
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,640
What do we do?
And he break it down,

167
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,060
take it to the movies you pay,
but then you wanted more,

168
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,010
you know,
what do we do?

169
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,641
And he's like,
all right,

170
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:20,180
I'll teach you about sex.
Come around to my window till about

171
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,680
8:00.
I'm going to fuck my girlfriend,

172
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,950
I'll let you look like shit like that
creepy shit.

173
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Then we actually got went over there and
they listened like shit like that.

174
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,870
And we would ask them about come like,
what's come due?

175
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,490
And he would tell us it pregnants
degree.

176
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:38,180
He was like a in the seventies there
wasn't no sex education in schools.

177
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,860
Doug.
So you had to get it.

178
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:43,400
Where the fuck you got it right.
So you didn't have that in Boston?

179
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,300
Absolutely.

180
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,860
I didn't have any uh,
uncles that are friends like the Hudson.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,330
No,
he didn't make me nervous.

182
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:54,320
I tried to avoid him.
He was real.

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,490
He was too street for me.
That kid,

184
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,150
there was a couple of kids like that.
There were two street for males or oh,

185
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,600
that's when I really realized that I
need to learn how to fight when I moved

186
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:08,010
to Jamaica plain because I was super
nervous skies or pick on me and I had no

187
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,870
idea what to do.
Like if anything went down,

188
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:13,050
I had no idea.
Like my Stepdad was never into violence.

189
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Nobody ever explained to me how to even
punch or hold your hands up correctly.

190
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,590
So cool.
I got to learn something,

191
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,780
so that's when I started getting into
karate and I was into movies before that

192
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,740
I'd taken like a Kung Fu class or
something like that once when I was like

193
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,460
maybe eight years old and I lived in San
Francisco,

194
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,760
but it really know martial arts to speak
of and this neighborhood.

195
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,481
I was like,
fuck,

196
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,100
I got these kids are scaring the shit
out.

197
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,830
When was this to make a plane in New
York?

198
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,590
Now it said Boston.
Well this is a suburb of Boston.

199
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,910
Not a.
not a suburb really.

200
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:45,120
It was like a.
it's an inner city area,

201
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:48,900
but it's just at the time it was at
least just kind of a poor neighborhood,

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,620
but apparently now they have some nice
bars and restaurants and you know,

203
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,370
housing prices so expensive.
Someone a chance on the outskirts and

204
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,200
they start pushing those bad
neighborhoods away.

205
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,590
They start building up and own and they
become gentrified and you'd get a nice

206
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,950
house in a nice neighborhood for a good
deal.

207
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,120
So a lot of people,
you know,

208
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,490
that's a giant problem with New York
right now.

209
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,400
People just keep talking about it in
Brooklyn.

210
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,900
Brooklyn's just being bought.
Really.

211
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,850
It's,
it's so expensive to live in Manhattan.

212
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,830
Have you ever tried to look at real
estate?

213
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:19,750
If you ever fantasize,
maybe I'll move to New York for a couple

214
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:20,440
of years.
Like Arusha,

215
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,130
fear your thought about doing something
like that.

216
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,910
I have.
I thought about it.

217
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,020
I looked at housing prices.
You're like,

218
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,500
what are you talking about?
That's not $5,000,000.

219
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,500
That's an apartment.
How was that?

220
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,030
$5 million.
Do you ever yard?

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,860
Is there a.
is there something I'm missing?

222
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,500
Like what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?

223
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,420
It's apartment.
It's an apartment,

224
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,830
but they're stupid expensive,
like regular rent.

225
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,110
People were talking to him about their
regular rent.

226
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,660
They were talking like $3,500.
I was like,

227
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,580
what?
Like a regular comic.

228
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,460
Like not someone who is doing great now.
Like at Jim Norton or something like

229
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,440
that.
Just a.

230
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,850
A regular comic has got a one bedroom
apartment.

231
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,170
I was like,
Holy Shit,

232
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160
how the fuck do you pay that
every time heavy to live in that city.

233
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,570
For me to afford to live in New York,
had to live down the shore.

234
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,600
What'd you do that do you think you'd go
down the shore?

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,420
Long Island.
I would go down the shore because I'm

236
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,450
familiar with it.
Right.

237
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,510
I would go like route 17,
Marlboro around there and they got

238
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,210
Chinese restaurants to the old school,
Italian places.

239
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm saying it doesn't.
I'm already land.

240
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,220
Keep a place down there because we have
like a.

241
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,550
I think he's got like hoboken,
hoboken.

242
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,070
He has a house.
He has a condo or an apartment in

243
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,920
hoboken.
I think he's got a place down in the

244
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,400
shoulder.
He has a place down in this show.

245
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,840
Yeah.
I still deal with a lot of gut.

246
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,480
Bob Gunzel gigs down their apps and this
feels right.

247
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,070
This is a little away from where
everybody goes.

248
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,030
This is up from Toms River and seaside
and Belmont one.

249
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,390
This is Marlboro.
It still takes you off the 34,

250
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,750
35.
You still got to drive a little bit to

251
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,960
see the ocean and shit like that.
I just had a friend that lived there and

252
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,750
I liked the neighborhood.
I liked how the neighborhood was.

253
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,170
They had an old school Italian Delis.
You walk in stinky cheese,

254
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,133
blood,
saliva,

255
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,600
all that stuff.
A fucking tongue hanging upside down.

256
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:18,090
Wet books with water,
you know.

257
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,350
Let me ask you this,
Frankie.

258
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,050
Edgar's got to be the king of Toms
River.

259
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,430
Fuck yeah.
He's the king,

260
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,210
right?
King.

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,290
That's his place.
I haven't been.

262
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,640
He made me say Tom's river on a paper
view once.

263
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,773
Really?
Yeah.

264
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,650
Yeah.
It's like after you once say Tom's river

265
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,120
was like Toms River Shit.
Toms river is next to seaside.

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,141
Is it?
Yeah,

267
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,120
like close to seaside lava.
Let,

268
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,110
if I remember correctly,
because every time I'd be in seaside I

269
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:46,944
was in Tom's river.

270
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,611
Right,
right,

271
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,960
right.
I used to go to Tom's river.

272
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,150
What you do as you go down and you put
on some nets,

273
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,560
put those nets.
Like the kids.

274
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,660
I used to go down and we stopped by Toms
River.

275
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,661
There was a spot and you drop nuts off
and then you go eat and you come back

276
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,920
and you fucking pull out those clients,
those crabs,

277
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,680
Woo.
And they would go home and make a sauce

278
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,340
with the fucking crap.
Oh,

279
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,790
Katrina water.
That's the thing,

280
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,231
right?
The,

281
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,730
the sauce with crabs.
You don't really get that out and you

282
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,990
know,
it's very tough to make.

283
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,180
Like I don't know how to make it.
I just saw them do it.

284
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:19,520
I would never fucking dry because I
wouldn't trust her,

285
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,110
but they would just take the crabs and
put them in a fucking hall boil the

286
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,730
crabs and the tomato sauce sauce and
they like,

287
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,030
it has to shell breaks.

288
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,880
I don't fucking know.
I,

289
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,220
they get the flavor,
the meat.

290
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,930
I'm trying to remember if they pull the
meat out or if they left the clause in.

291
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,920
Sometimes it seems like sometimes they
just left the clause and everything in.

292
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,140
Right.
And you would have to get it out

293
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:42,870
afterwards.
You just have to suck it out after we

294
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,240
break the.
But you don't see that.

295
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,310
So it's pretty rare with like a red
sauce.

296
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,400
You'll see it a little bit in a nice
fancy Italian restaurant as a special.

297
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,300
Somebody comes in with those crabs.
You,

298
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,370
we have some nice grabbed for you.
There was a place that was a real good

299
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:00,340
place that was in west La.
It was a real good,

300
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,570
especially when it opened up.
It's called Il Grano and uh,

301
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,110
I think it just went under
unfortunately.

302
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,440
But this guy,
the chef as an artist man,

303
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:13,441
and he made this squid ink pasta with a,
with a crab sauce,

304
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:17,380
like a light tomato,
eat crab sauce where it was,

305
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,020
um,
I don't know which kind of car crab it

306
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:20,530
was.

307
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,670
Anyway,
dungeness.

308
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,770
That's what it was.
Jesus Christ.

309
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:27,460
It was spectacular.
It was like this black ink pasta that

310
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,460
was cooked perfect.
So you chew into it.

311
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
It's not mushy.
Doesn't just dissolve you like it's got

312
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:38,641
a little pop to it as you bite into it.
And the crab with the sauce.

313
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,600
It was fun.
One of my favorite dishes.

314
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,830
And what's the crab we get in Jersey?
Excited.

315
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,860
What's the dungeness?
Isn't it?

316
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,410
Is it dungeness?
Blue Crabs and Maryland,

317
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,244
right?
Isn't that?

318
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,270
I don't know shit about crabs and you
shut the fuck up because whenever I go

319
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:56,050
to Texas I get dungeness crab with the
salad and his Florida,

320
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,550
the place where they have those,
uh,

321
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,750
king king crabs or Alaska.
But then there's another big one.

322
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:06,310
Is that a rock crab rock?
Grab the ones with the big ass fat

323
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,020
clause.
What are those?

324
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,910
Stone crabs.
Stone Crab.

325
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,020
That's right.
Yeah.

326
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:12,431
Yeah,
yeah.

327
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:13,570
All in Texas.
I think.

328
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,110
I'm not sure that's a get drunk sort of
move.

329
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,940
Be As.
Yeah,

330
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,420
he eat those things and you drink a
shitload of peers and your uncle gets

331
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:25,660
drunk and stupid shit and wound up
getting out of there.

332
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,420
But it's crazy because as a child I
could eat lobster.

333
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,460
I could eat any fish.
Fucking squid ink.

334
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,100
The one I could not eat was crap growing
up.

335
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
Why not sick?
Right off the bat.

336
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,680
I don't know why.
And somebody said it had something that

337
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,690
crab has something that make you sick.
I didn't start eating crab or maybe 15

338
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:49,150
years ago I couldn't eat a crap.
I liked the sauce.

339
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,600
I could take the sauce but.
But it had a skit.

340
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:51,980
I

341
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,960
had died,
I had done,

342
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,940
I had done.
Somebody said that's what it is.

343
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,430
It's heavy and I had died.
I don't know if it's true.

344
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,760
I don't fucking know what's in food.
And I put for years I couldn't eat it.

345
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,330
I started eating crab again Tuesday
nights at Meogie when we used to do

346
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:11,450
comedy there and they used to lip sync
in there and shit when they had one

347
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,400
little stone crab rolls and I didn't get
sick.

348
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,380
So I started eating it again.
Wow.

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
For years I get sick off grab every
time.

350
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,750
Anything else could go down,
crabs,

351
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,550
clams,
whatever.

352
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:27,230
I just went to Boston and I went to
legal seafoods and I got those big

353
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,950
fucking clams every dead and 12 and
Jesus,

354
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,390
little horseradish,
a little.

355
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,490
Oh my God.
Those things are fucking delicious

356
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,280
because you get the steamers with the
tails and shit.

357
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,390
You don't like those.
I love those.

358
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,820
You're making a face like it in like
steam is rough when you're eating that

359
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,970
butter,
dip those and butter.

360
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,500
It was the first day and I said whether
I'm going to switch a big fucking clams

361
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,930
cherry,
Cherry net.

362
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,410
Those are good.
Those are very good.

363
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,380
I think I prefer them over oysters.
Really.

364
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,580
The A to the oysters don't work for me.
The the clams have more snap when

365
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,840
you're.
When you're eating them raw.

366
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,380
It's interesting because we never
thought about it is that being Sashimi,

367
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,380
you know,
you're just getting clams or oysters,

368
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,790
but it's raw fish.
It's raw seafood,

369
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,850
seafood,
you know what I mean?

370
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,860
It really is.
How is that any different than,

371
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,410
you know,
getting raw scallops at a Sushi place.

372
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,610
It's kind of the same.
That is a weird thing that we just cook.

373
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,290
We cook almost everything.

374
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,810
We cook fish,
but there's spots we can go where they

375
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,120
don't cook it.
It's delicious.

376
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,070
Very good.
They just give it to you raw.

377
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,770
You go to Alaska.
I've been Alaska and get the halibut up

378
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:38,870
there.
Like when you get the.

379
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,620
I haven't gotten.
I haven't done that where it's fresh and

380
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,720
really raw.
Two different worlds,

381
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,740
man.
Halibut.

382
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,050
Sushi is really good.
I would imagine if you got it like right

383
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,370
off the fish,
it would be amazing.

384
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,840
Amazing.
Yeah.

385
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,860
It's weird that we have these sort of
rules like as far as like food

386
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,850
preparation and it just changed with
Sushi,

387
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,280
like think of this country up until
Sushi.

388
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,800
Like nobody.
There were no one's serving raw fish

389
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,960
anywhere until what?
I mean.

390
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:07,550
What year did she come out?
The eighties or something.

391
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,850
Seventies.
I remember Japanese restaurants in New

392
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,070
York said,
I don't remember Sushi.

393
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,250
Sushi.

394
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,120
She blew up.
I didn't try Sushi to Seattle like 95.

395
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:20,600
I still away from it yet,
but once I was in I was fucking all.

396
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:24,830
But I definitely remember Sushi when I
was a kid.

397
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,710
I remember it from when I was like 18,
19 years old.

398
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,270
I remember that.
So it had to be before then.

399
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,310
So man,
maybe it was like the seventies.

400
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,920
We think about it.
Culinarily speaking.

401
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,770
If you could do that,
that's a long ass time

402
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,620
with no Sushi.
A long ass time in this country all

403
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:48,580
those years with no Sushi.
And then all of a sudden Sushi now

404
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,890
you've been to.
Yeah.

405
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,340
And as the Sushi different in Japan,
I don't really know.

406
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,760
I couldn't say that honestly because I
went to a couple places,

407
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,350
I didn't go to a lot of places,
you know,

408
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,630
we were only there for the UFC so it was
pretty in and out.

409
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,770
But the Sushi that we found there was
like,

410
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,833
you know,
it,

411
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,110
it was,
you're in a Japanese restaurant,

412
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,090
has a totally different feel because
you're in Japan.

413
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,780
I mean you're in Japan,
the people can barely speak English if

414
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:20,430
they speak English at all.
The menus are all in both Japanese and

415
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,160
English was pretty cool.
And so one of the cool things about

416
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,740
traveling,
a lot of people speak English,

417
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,620
so there's a lot,
a lot of places you can go where you can

418
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,920
at least sort of get by.
They speak enough English so you can get

419
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,520
by.
And uh,

420
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,800
that's uh,
that,

421
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,733
that's the case

422
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,300
since it's a weird thing,
man.

423
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,550
When Japan,
it's like,

424
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,580
if it's a totally different world,
like when you go to Japan,

425
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:51,690
like their culture is so interesting the
way they choose to behave like

426
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:53,220
collectively.
So interesting.

427
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,760
They're super polite.
They have giant crowds of people in the

428
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,910
streets and there's no issues.
Everybody walks by each other with no

429
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,730
problems.
It's like it's.

430
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,770
It seems like even though it's an
accelerated culture and obviously they'd

431
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,590
get a lot of shit done.
They make a lot of things.

432
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,640
It's they've giant businesses and it's a
small place.

433
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,100
If you look at how tiny it is now,
many people are stacked in there,

434
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,020
but they're super polite really.
I mean,

435
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,180
it's amazing how little crime,
how much order you have and then every

436
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:26,160
now and then you have these dudes have
come from other countries and decided

437
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:26,881
like,
oh,

438
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,800
this is an easy pickins place.

439
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,620
We were there.
We ran a two while we're walking into a

440
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,850
restaurant and we ran into these African
dudes trying to get you to go into these

441
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:42,840
massage places now.
Like super aggressive about it and

442
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,830
you're like,
Whoa,

443
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,950
this is interesting.
So you have all these polite Japanese

444
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:51,951
guys and then these really slick,
streetwise dudes have moved into spots

445
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,570
and you could see them sort of work in
these places,

446
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,750
but they're in Tokyo,
which is,

447
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,150
you know,
overall.

448
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,570
It just really,
really polite.

449
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,970
It's interesting.
It's really interesting.

450
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,600
Apparently I didn't experience it,
but apparently they have a rate that

451
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,240
really,
especially the older folks do not like

452
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,880
white people.
They just are not really into Americans

453
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,440
being around.
We bombed them.

454
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh yeah,
I know.

455
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,500
I mean,
you think they gonna forgive us that

456
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:20,220
quick.
We don't think about that in our

457
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,540
generation.
We don't think about that.

458
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,150
That's why they don't need Vietnam food
for a long time.

459
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,590
I'm like,
we just fought them.

460
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,410
They want to poison this.
You want to go to that and a Vietnamese

461
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,360
fucking that rolls.
They just fucking poisonous.

462
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,190
I would poison you.
You know?

463
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,550
Yeah.
It's funny how the menus,

464
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,120
like what we think Chinese.
That's why I asked you,

465
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,810
because when we think Chinese food is
here is completely different over there

466
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,420
because it gets an Americanized and the
same thing goes for the Sushi.

467
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,010
Bob Sapp told me that when we're
shooting the longest yard,

468
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,040
he said the Sushi was more a little
primitive over there.

469
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,800
They'll come up with a fucking octopus,
you know,

470
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,650
like shit like that where there's a lot
of places that'll do that.

471
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,580
Jimmy,
I need a cup.

472
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,230
But when,
uh,

473
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,190
when uh,
you know,

474
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,150
I was watching something on food and
they were talking about a place in Japan

475
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:11,050
where you go get some type.
It's a place where they only serve food

476
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,910
that has an,
it's an aphrodisiac.

477
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,600
Oni,
like it's both balls and somethings I

478
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:21,310
balls or something.
So you go in there to get tuned up for a

479
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,400
date.
Like when you go to El Paso,

480
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,240
Texas,
okay.

481
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,080
If you go towards the end of a Paso,
Texas and get Mexican soup,

482
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,200
like you could hand fish soup.
There's a couple of heads in there with

483
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:36,100
the eyeballs looking right at you that
you wouldn't find that here in

484
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,780
California and have a fucking heart
attack.

485
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,410
But once you get more towards the
country itself,

486
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,130
they start showing that culture like we
don't know anything about both balls.

487
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,260
It's something to do with bolts and
what,

488
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,520
how they put it in a soup or something.
It's a special of the day and the women

489
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:54,880
can eat it also,
but it just becomes something different.

490
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,010
That's what I was.
That's what I was asking you about the

491
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:57,844
food.
Well,

492
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,230
the one place that we went to,
we went to at least two Sushi places,

493
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:05,470
but one place we went to,
it was supposedly a great place.

494
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,850
I think bordain might have recommended
it to me name drop,

495
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,010
but when we went in there it was just a,
you know,

496
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,480
same stuff that you get here really
fresh.

497
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,510
Really.
You know,

498
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,690
it was,
it was right out of the ocean I'm sure.

499
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,010
But that's the same thing here.
We share the ocean a lot of the same

500
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,440
fish,
but the Japanese fish people,

501
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,950
Japanese who she plays,
there's only buy from Japanese fish

502
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,030
fishing guys.

503
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,500
They keep it like my buddy sold fish
back east and I used to say them.

504
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,740
You don't feel that the Japanese people
know it's well known that that market

505
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:42,050
with the mafia ran a really.
When you go there in the morning,

506
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,880
you see the town and just see the white,
the Irish and the Japanese people

507
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,040
because they have different types of
fish and what they do with it.

508
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,850
I think.
I'm sure they have that poisoned

509
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,110
blowfish.
What they tell you not to eat Sushi went

510
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:56,380
on Mondays and some other debt because
the fishers old.

511
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,990
Oh really?
They always say the fish that comes

512
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,820
Tuesday and Thursday.
That's when you get sushis.

513
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,190
Don't eat Sushi.
I'm.

514
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,750
I don't know.
I don't like someone day.

515
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,930
How long can you keep Sushi before it's
terrible.

516
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,110
If you had to guess,
if you buy a big piece of tuna,

517
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,850
how long before you have to serve that?

518
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,670
I can't imagine.
It would be very long.

519
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,190
Very long now.
Like a few days at the most.

520
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,460
I don't trust fishing on trust pork.
A lot of times you got to be careful

521
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:22,600
with those two.
Those two.

522
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,340
Just a little slight McCook and you're
fucking in the hospital.

523
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,040
Not domestic pork isn't so much anymore,
but it used to be for sure freezing fish

524
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,490
for 24 hours,
allowing it to thaw on the refrigerator.

525
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,050
Reduce harmful bacteria.
Making the fish safer.

526
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,973
Oh,
I see.

527
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,310
That's interesting.
So they free.

528
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,121
Oh,
this is interesting.

529
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,900
Fish for a made for a fish,
for making homemade Sushi.

530
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,800
Should be purchased from a cmo longer,

531
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,710
not a local grocery store.
That's interesting.

532
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,670
What's the seeming?
See Maga is a dude who goes and buys it

533
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,250
straight off of the boats and he only
has like,

534
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:58,040
he has it that day.
There's a guy used to train with in

535
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:03,041
revere who is a younger who would come
and take taekwondo in my class and this

536
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:07,650
dude had a truck and he would drive his
truck to the boats and you know,

537
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:11,330
negotiate a price and buy fish and then
deliver that fish to restaurants.

538
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,470
Like that was his thing.
It's really interesting because we

539
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,390
talked about it and you know,
he was telling me how,

540
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,440
what a grind it was like,
Whoa,

541
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,370
how much work is involved and what it
does.

542
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:25,720
I mean he just works.
He was getting up early.

543
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,090
Early.
Yeah.

544
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,570
In the morning,
the morning you put an App,

545
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,020
would you tell them you go to like 20
restaurants and you'll listen?

546
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,570
I have salmon.
I got my Ma and I got the yellow tail.

547
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,710
That's my fucking shit.
Yeah,

548
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,230
you pull it out,
but let's say you're a column my

549
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,310
restaurant and you sell 25 pounds a day
of,

550
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,801
you know,
for.

551
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,140
I liked my.
Where I grew up.

552
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,110
Rudy's Rudy's is basically a columbine
restaurant.

553
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,350
People go in,
that's the appetizer they buy 50 pounds

554
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,050
a day.
They probably got three different guys.

555
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,490
They go through.
Wow.

556
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,810
And Chris was one of them,
you know,

557
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,840
he was Italian and they,
you know how to cook it.

558
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,800
So he would go over to.
He had a great job for years.

559
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,180
Man,
you know what happened?

560
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,440
He got smart and that's what happened.
He got smart when he kept it simple,

561
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,940
his was very easy.

562
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,060
He went to restaurants.
He said this is what I have really good.

563
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,400
And he gave him a car with a phone
number.

564
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,650
He got up at three in the morning.
He pressed the machine and this is joe

565
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:25,450
from Rogan's,
let me get 25 pounds of column on 10

566
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,550
pounds,
the yellow tail.

567
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,400
So all he had to do now is add up.
So he would get your 10 pounds squared

568
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:35,330
is 20 pounds is 30 and Sarah,
I need 100 pounds of squid.

569
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,540
He would go down there and there's
people that actually cut a deal for

570
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,710
that.
You know what?

571
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:43,250
I want this a pound to 100 pounds.
I'll give it to you for this.

572
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,660
His money changed every day.
It's money changes every day.

573
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,470
So once he go to the boat by it and then
they delivered it and that was it.

574
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,920
No overhead,
no real insurance,

575
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,360
no freezers,
no nothing.

576
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,390
Anything he had left over.
That's what he went to come to his

577
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,130
family to cook.
What happened was he went partners with

578
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:06,050
a guy got a freezer.
They stocked up on the fucking food.

579
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,780
They stocked up on the fish and New York
had a power outage.

580
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,660
He lost 60 grand.
That was the end of everything.

581
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,950
He lost 60 department,
lost like 80 [inaudible].

582
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,680
They went on,
got got bones and spent all this money

583
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:21,050
on wholesale.
You and I both know it's a daily thing.

584
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,210
Yeah.
That's a daily thing.

585
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,550
You been making a living for 10 years on
a daily.

586
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,000
Now you want to think about the future
and buy a bunch of fish and that's the

587
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,860
night that like a week later the power
went out.

588
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:33,800
When he moves into his warehouse,
he had to go there in the middle of the

589
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,530
night and fish ice things.
You got to take stuff out and ice.

590
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,720
Him and Jesus.
Yeah,

591
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,220
they didn't have such good insulation
back then either.

592
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,560
How long has the power for like 12 hours
that time in New York.

593
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,150
This school I'm telling you 10 years
ago,

594
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,250
you know they have coolers now that to
keep things like they keep ice for seven

595
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:56,370
days outside.
We've seen these coolers.

596
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,990
No,
they're crazy.

597
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,070
They're like,
there's a bunch of different really high

598
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,880
end coolers and most of it was started,
at least to my knowledge by this company

599
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:09,360
called Yeti and Yeti coolers.
They make these outdoor cores that

600
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,850
people use when they go camping or
something like that.

601
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,570
They're real thick and you put ice in
those fucking things.

602
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,270
You close the lid,
open that lid and seven days there's

603
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,060
going to be ice in there.
It's crazy.

604
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,030
The insulation properties of these
things are nuts.

605
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,770
I just,
I don't.

606
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,990
They have a seal like your pull down
these rubber straps to seal it in.

607
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,590
They're not cheap.
They're fucking heavy shit to.

608
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,790
They're really heavy.
You know?

609
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,030
Most coolers are really light.
These things are not like you want your

610
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,700
eyes to fucking safest days.
They're crazy though.

611
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,910
It's crazy what they can do.
Like they somehow or another figure it

612
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,370
out,
some insulation method that retains cold

613
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:49,020
for a long time,
but they didn't have that shit in the

614
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,853
seventies.

615
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,550
Imagine the Ice House in Pasadena used
to be an ice house.

616
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,300
Used to be a place where they would
deliver ice and you would go and get a

617
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,440
chunk of that shit for your icebox and
you wouldn't have an icebox and

618
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,480
refrigerator and that's where you keep
your milk and whatever you're going to

619
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,400
eat that day.
But you went to the market every day.

620
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,090
Feiss yeah,
we went to the market for ice when maybe

621
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,030
I use every few days,
but you went to the market everyday for

622
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:14,440
food.
Like you don't,

623
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,440
you just,
you didn't just have like a

624
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,730
refrigerator.
You open up,

625
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,310
pull out packages of meat packages,
chicken like that.

626
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,150
Nobody did that.
This is really rare.

627
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,780
Like when there was no refrigeration.
Think about that.

628
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,470
That's not that long ago.
For most of human history.

629
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,620
There's been no refrigeration.
That's why people used to go to war for

630
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:36,610
salt.
Joey,

631
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,950
they used to go to war for salt because
salt was how you could keep your food

632
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,710
fresh.
You'd have to take a piece of meat and

633
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:47,710
cover it with salt,
cover it completely,

634
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,900
and that would keep bacteria from
growing on it.

635
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,340
That's how they took care of their meat.
That's like they would salt their fish

636
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,120
when they would go to see they,
they,

637
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,160
the salt would be so valuable.
So like there was salt wars in the world

638
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,540
for fucking salt,
which is worth nothing now.

639
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
Just crazy.
Like if you went all in on salt back

640
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:09,380
then and was like,
dude,

641
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,840
people are going to war for this shit.
And then today you went to a diner and

642
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,560
there they have little packets.
You can just take them like you could

643
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,850
take them,
go to in and out Burger.

644
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
There's a whole box,
how can I take you?

645
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:21,140
Take as many as you want.
You can take as much salt as you want.

646
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,200
What are you fucking crazy.
You'd call your Viking friends.

647
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,840
They're given salt away at the Burger
place.

648
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,180
It would just come in there and steal
all the salt.

649
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,450
Salt back then would you kill people for
salt?

650
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,490
Because that's how people like it would
allow you to keep food longer,

651
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,710
which is insane.
Like that was like imagine to war for

652
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,550
refrigerators.

653
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,200
You know Japan had the refrigerators and
we didn't know there was a war to try to

654
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:49,000
get refrigerators is the only way you
keep.

655
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,990
Keep your food longer.
That's literally what people were doing.

656
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,260
They were going to war for salt.
When you watched the honeymooners,

657
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,550
they drained the refrigerator.
Now I figured out why it was an ice

658
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,470
cube.
She would pick the thing up and drain

659
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,000
in.
The honeymoon is and that's why they

660
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,890
probably put an ice cube and now they
close it.

661
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,310
That's how they do what the honeymooners
though was electrical,

662
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:12,520
so they probably did have refrigerators,
but a lot of those things would freeze

663
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:15,010
up.
The ice box is you'd have to defrost

664
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,120
them.
Do you remember that?

665
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,770
Yes,
they would.

666
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,820
They would.
Fucking freezer would literally be like

667
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,780
the inside of it would be like,
like a an ice cave?

668
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,700
Yeah,
like a Yeti's ice cave and a monster

669
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,534
movie.

670
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,000
Now you have freezes.
Freezes.

671
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,400
Well they call them something that you
freezers don't.

672
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,670
Isis freezers.
They don't.

673
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,910
You don't have to defrost them.
Right,

674
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,420
but we used to chip out them with a
screwdriver and fucking hit.

675
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,920
When I was a kid,
I used to use my air conditioner a year

676
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:47,470
round,
like my mom used to call you fucking

677
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,650
crazy.
I'd put the air conditioning in my room

678
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,130
year round and it would get a brick of
ice on it.

679
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,450
I'd have to.
Wow.

680
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,880
That's what happens when you put it on
the window.

681
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,870
I guess the inside refreeze freeze,
I'd have to turn it off and let it come

682
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,220
down a little bit.
The inside,

683
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:07,090
we're fucking freeze them.
Those old school heaters.

684
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:11,200
That would make noise when they were
starting up like clank clank,

685
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,210
clank pills,
radiator heaters,

686
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,220
really tap,
tap,

687
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,083
tap,
tap,

688
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,871
tap,
tap,

689
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,704
tap,
tap.

690
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,590
It was this hot fucking chunk of metal
in your house and if you leaned on it

691
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,190
would sear your skin like a George
foreman grill and that's how you keep

692
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,570
your house warm.

693
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,950
Remember those goddamn things.
Those are ridiculous metal things.

694
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,050
Those heavy.
You would pick one of those

695
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:38,830
motherfuckers up.
Fuck those radiators,

696
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,870
man.
Does water heaters.

697
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,490
Hot Water would go through them and they
would heat up and that's what you use to

698
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:48,880
keep your house warm.
Those things were ridiculous and you put

699
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,700
a box over them and even if you sat on
the box by mistake,

700
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,380
you'd fucking burn.
Yeah.

701
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:57,220
And the only thing in your fucking house
at all would be like within 15 feet of

702
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,200
that thing.
And they always put them under the

703
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:01,030
window.
Exactly.

704
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,340
They would put the heat under the
fucking window.

705
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,990
Like I never figured that.
So you'd stand there and get burned.

706
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,790
But there was like a draft or some shit.
Yeah.

707
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,240
They didn't have anywhere else to put
it.

708
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:11,830
You couldn't put them in the middle of
the roundabout,

709
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
those metal fucking thing.

710
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,830
You know,
you get like a house,

711
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,070
like the last house I had it and the
studio said he had no fucking heat.

712
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,330
Why when they built that no fucking heat
because they didn't think people in

713
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,910
California,
and you know those burbank houses,

714
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:28,230
those old houses that didn't have heat
or they put a little box like you're

715
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:29,830
only gonna to use it.
Let me tell you something.

716
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,300
When you come out of the shower,
you need to eat.

717
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,430
I don't give a fuck who you are.
When you come out of that shower and you

718
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,150
turn that water off,
you need to heat.

719
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,980
That's a trick they do in Topanga.
There's a lot of

720
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,020
houses,
independent candidate,

721
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,250
don't have air conditioning like you
don't need it.

722
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,130
Maybe you need one or two days.
Fuck you.

723
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,460
I don't live walk.
That breeds people invite you over.

724
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,580
Meanwhile you're fucking melting that.
What's coming out of yet and like we

725
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:57,470
don't have the air.
We leave the windows open.

726
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,740
It's sort of fuck you put.
You should have told me this on the

727
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:03,380
invite.
I wouldn't have came and we have

728
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,940
nowhere.
We lived by the fucking,

729
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,620
but I wouldn't have came.
I want to add,

730
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,450
I got to have something.
You got to hit me with some.

731
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:12,140
Some people like to have like a thin
sheen of perspiration on them all the

732
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,010
time.
No,

733
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,740
Shane,
you got to have a little bit of add

734
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,780
something to something.
I don't want my hands to freezing.

735
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,060
I know what you mean man.
I agree with you.

736
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,460
One hundred percent.
You know that shit works from Colorado.

737
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,860
Like when I lived in Colorado.
You Do,

738
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:28,490
you leave your window open one inch and
your house will fucking freeze to death

739
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:30,170
in the winter.
Just one inch.

740
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,290
That shit don't happen to hear.
That never happened here.

741
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm always fucking warm in that.
These people say,

742
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,230
well the breeze dries.
You don't fucking do nothing for me.

743
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,850
Well,

744
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:45,850
it's nice sometimes,
but if it's 98 degrees and Dick and that

745
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:48,380
happens,
that happens.

746
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,940
I mean it only happens a couple of days
a year,

747
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,600
but it happens,
but it happens that day.

748
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,130
You invite me over to the house and
watch the fight to something and that's

749
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:57,980
the dad go fucking ape shit.
It just seems like why would you have

750
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:00,620
such a big nice house and not have air
conditioning?

751
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,260
Like I've seen people's houses.
They're like,

752
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,560
this is a nice house,
man.

753
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,840
You got a great house but you don't have
air conditioning.

754
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,110
Is This A.
is it a money thing?

755
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,480
Is going environment be different and
break my balls,

756
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,340
but

757
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,660
that's what they want to do.
They want to be different.

758
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,010
I'm like,
we don't live off of.

759
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,080
And then they start making excuses for
her while the something factor in their

760
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:23,490
raises your cat can't.
What the fuck you talk on them.

761
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:25,010
I just want to be comfortable a little
bit.

762
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,610
Is a air conditioning bad for you?
I've never heard of air conditioning is

763
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,580
bad for these people will find something
bad for it.

764
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,800
There's certain people that find
something,

765
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,390
but
I can't get a tattoo joe because I can't

766
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:41,120
see needles,
but I'll tell you that off the bat.

767
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,310
There's people that'll say they hate
that.

768
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,680
Those why do you hate?
I just hate that.

769
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,230
You don't hate that [inaudible].
You can see fucking blood so you can't

770
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:49,760
get it that though.
That's why.

771
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,740
Yay Them.
I just hate needles.

772
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,110
When I went to the doctor yesterday,
she goes to me.

773
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,550
Uh,
all right,

774
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,770
so I'm going to give you the steroid.
I'm gonna give you this for you.

775
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:58,940
He is.
She goes,

776
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm going to give you the shot.
And she goes,

777
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,723
no,
I'm not.

778
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,430
And she goes,
I remember the surgery.

779
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:08,030
You're a fucking nightmare with needles
and shit when it comes to all that.

780
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,710
So they couldn't find the vein.
This surgery.

781
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,710
That's a fucking nightmare.
Three plugs.

782
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,090
That drove me.
I was ready to go home.

783
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,170
Listen,
if you don't find the vein this time we

784
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:17,240
go home.
Really?

785
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,781
Yeah.
I'm,

786
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:18,410
I'm,
I'm done.

787
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,840
You poke me three fucking times.
Every time I faint.

788
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,330
Let's do the risk.
Look at these fucking veins in here.

789
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,050
Finally she found the vein in my hand.
Look at that.

790
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,180
There's veins right there.
I hate all that shit.

791
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,830
Needles.
Blood.

792
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,130
Soon as I walked into the doctor,
checked my blood pressure before I walk

793
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:37,160
into a doc.
That could be 1:30 over 80.

794
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,040
I walk into

795
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,940
a doctor's office.
It shoots up the one 90 over fucking

796
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
1:30.
Yeah.

797
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,920
We always look at people who do drugs
intravenously,

798
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:49,650
like that's next level.
That's next level.

799
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:54,120
You're shooting it up like you're.
You're opening your vein with a piece of

800
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,970
metal and you're injecting some liquid
in there.

801
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,940
Ooh,
that's deep.

802
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,300
Like you just threw all protocol out the
window.

803
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,980
That's why you.
If you ever hear about someone who's

804
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,350
like,
hey,

805
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,940
does coke?
When someone says,

806
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,540
this guy does a lot of coke,
I put them in this category kink.

807
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,620
Someone goes,
I got smokes a lot of weed and put them

808
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:14,850
in that quarter.
Paint.

809
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,650
Someone goes,
he shoots heroin.

810
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,670
I go,
oh,

811
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:21,040
this motherfucker goes over here.
This is a different role.

812
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,170
I something that you know how much pain
I had in my heart the first time I had

813
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:26,370
to put something in my nose.

814
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,630
I'm just not a good feeling.
It's not a good feeling.

815
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,240
I don't give a fuck with that.
I think about it now.

816
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,590
It's horrible.
You just made a big leap to being a guy

817
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:40,400
who does coke the first time I put some
in my nose or wasn't covered.

818
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,220
What was it?
It was angel toss.

819
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,180
It was the crystal.
It was,

820
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,650
you know,
they,

821
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,000
they called the TAC crystal,
the crystal.

822
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:50,520
That's what they call it,
but they didn't call thc like pot.

823
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,000
That's what you did in those days was
there was a thing that you took a bunch

824
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:55,730
of stems.
You got,

825
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,790
you took a pound of the stamps,
you got to pound the weed.

826
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
You took those stems,
you put them in a little bit of water

827
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:05,370
and you boil it.
The powder that goes to the end of the

828
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,420
thing that would scrape that up,
mix it with some color and then you can

829
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:10,254
snort that.

830
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,450
That was the beginning.
So I was okay.

831
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,110
Okay.
Some tea.

832
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,030
See Crystal.
So what does that do for you?

833
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:18,050
What does it feel like?
Because I feel like you had a smoke.

834
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,160
Yeah,
it feels like an adult,

835
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,380
but they got hip and they started
putting angel dust and gorilla

836
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,840
tranquilizers.
Fucking donkey.

837
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,270
Fuck.
And next thing you know you,

838
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,400
I mean I had a great time doing that
shit.

839
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,830
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I love doing that crystal shit.

840
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,330
Yeah,
loved it to.

841
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,680
So this is the snorting,
snorting or smoking slump.

842
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,850
Essentially a edible cannabis,
but it wasn't.

843
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,720
No edible cannabis.
It's totally there.

844
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,040
It was gorilla biscuits,
right?

845
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,930
So you have two choices.
You can either go down to like a place

846
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:56,931
and buy for $10.
You got three lines when you're 16 and

847
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,430
15 each line,
the street hours make it.

848
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,890
Each line were high for 12 hours.

849
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,140
I'm how fucking 12 hours or eight hours
of heavy duty like the last.

850
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,050
If you had a.
well it's hard to tell now because your

851
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,630
tolerance is so high.
But if you had to compare it to like an

852
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,670
edible was,
is like a 200 milligram,

853
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,930
God,
God,

854
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:18,850
compared to an edible 500 million gone.
God.

855
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,220
No,
no,

856
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,900
no.
It's just a different area.

857
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,650
It's like taking something that you
actually go to a different fucking

858
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,690
around.
It's not like doing an adult,

859
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:30,360
but I've done some edibles and I've gone
to different rums.

860
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:33,910
Don't get me wrong,
but first couple times you do the like,

861
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,440
one time I went,
I was working.

862
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,040
I graduated

863
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,340
high school.
This is the tail end of my tea.

864
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,710
Have my crystal Korea.
I wasn't even because I did crystal tea

865
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,820
from.
I was probably 15,

866
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,720
maybe 14 and a half up to the point my
mother died.

867
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,470
Then cocaine took over and cocaine just
said,

868
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,810
fuck all that shit.
And there was no more acid.

869
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Cocaine came in that heavy in 1980.
So before 1980 you would snort.

870
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,550
You were doing the pills and you were
doing the fucking,

871
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,660
the thc crystals and all that shit.
But after the cocaine,

872
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,660
just want it.
So in 82 I graduated,

873
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:15,661
I was working in the city for this book
and I went over one day and they go,

874
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,230
listen,
we're not going to do the horses today.

875
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,050
My Dad can't come if you want to hang
out for the afternoon.

876
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,131
So I said,
fuck it.

877
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,740
I'll just take the day off.
I'll never forget this.

878
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:26,710
I went walking,
I saw some girl and I was walking into

879
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,310
one of those spots to get reefer.
I was going to get weed,

880
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,710
my day was over and let me get weeded
out and I don't have to come back

881
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:35,890
tonight from Jersey and some black girl
came up to me,

882
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,260
that'd be 10 in the morning and she
goes,

883
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,780
you want to split a tray?
I said,

884
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,520
sure.
A tray was at $3,

885
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:43,970
bag of angel dust.

886
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,480
So you opened it up and it was just a
little wine and you took it and sprinkle

887
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:52,440
that on your joint.
They sold the right there at the refit

888
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:53,520
spot.
Wow.

889
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:59,130
And you would roll it and smoking.
I smoked every 10 at 8:00 at night.

890
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:02,280
I remember taking a bus over from being
with her and going,

891
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,370
I'm still fucked up.
Like now I can talk like,

892
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,620
you know,
at the end of the day when we,

893
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,350
because we smoked it and then we just
sat there and talked to all of that and

894
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:15,030
three hours.
Then she told me she was pregnant.

895
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,890
Wow.
And that's what she.

896
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,650
I got pregnant and she opened up a
jacket and I could see her belly.

897
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,420
Oh,
I didn't know before that.

898
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,060
I never forgot that.
I never forgot that,

899
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:28,860
but I remember going over the fucking
bridge and going to a bar and going,

900
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,220
if I'm still fucked up at 9:00 at night,
whatever,

901
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,560
and that baby like,
man,

902
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,710
that's fucking crazy.
That is fucking crazy.

903
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,290
Wow.
We just went to a park and sat there and

904
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:50,160
talked and read the Daily News and the
fucked up whether,

905
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,830
I don't know if we went to eat.
I don't remember what we did with Sachs.

906
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,770
Nothing like that happened.
We just hung out all day.

907
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:56,700
We were that fucked up.

908
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,310
That's the crazy thing about being born.
You can't pick your parents.

909
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,030
That kid just got a shit roll the dice
is mom's doing angel dust.

910
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,660
Damn.
Anybody that gets

911
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,020
like loses their perspective.
That's a real perspective enhancer right

912
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:19,010
there.
That idea,

913
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,410
that poor kid and that poor girl that
she's so fucked up,

914
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,150
whatever happened to her,
led her to become that kind of person

915
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,460
takes angel dust while she's pregnant.
Fuck man.

916
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,760
Oh,
oh my God.

917
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,720
So weird.
Like we know things are bad for us,

918
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:43,430
but the feeling it gives you feel so
good.

919
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,430
You want to do bad things to yourself.
It's a little trick.

920
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,350
It's like this bad thing to you.
That's piggybacked on a good time.

921
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,200
It's like it gives you a good time.
It's like,

922
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,940
I'll give you a good time.
He let me poison you.

923
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,430
How much have a good time?
Oh,

924
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:02,060
you got to remember a lot of fun times.
I'm going to poison you though.

925
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,410
Okay.
Like,

926
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,101
okay.
Okay.

927
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:04,890
Okay.
Now let me.

928
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,350
I'll get off it.
Eventually you'll get off of it.

929
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:11,420
You're for sure.
Going to give you a good time and it

930
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,990
just latches a hold of you and to you
and your lovely poisons out there.

931
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,340
Joe From Mcdonald's to steroids.
I mean,

932
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,270
emily,
do you want me to say what the is the

933
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:23,720
worst?

934
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,190
The worst right now.
Cigarettes.

935
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,530
Really?
When I shot that special,

936
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,260
I was smoking reefer outside.
I didn't want to smell like refund.

937
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,810
When I went in and there was a cop and I
took a cigarette from somebody.

938
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:36,700
I'm like,
I light and I just took to it.

939
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:39,860
Some of it [inaudible].
I felt it the next day.

940
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,330
Really like,
I'm like,

941
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,870
this is hard.
When you don't smoke for a long time and

942
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:46,070
then you smoke,
you're like,

943
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,080
oh shit.
Because I tell you what,

944
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:48,914
Joe.
Hi.

945
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,770
I live on the deep end.
From time to time I'll have a duis and

946
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,360
ginger ale or on a flight somewhere,
you know,

947
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,320
an alcoholic drink belts and fucking run
with me for 12 hours.

948
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,660
Bro.
Don't drink alcohol like everybody.

949
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,600
A big drinker.
No,

950
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,060
but I like it.
I liked the taste.

951
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:08,990
The doors and Ginger Ale.
I like Irish cream on the rocks.

952
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,580
Whatever the fuck it is.
You know,

953
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:14,240
I came in before I was early and I was
looking through your whiskey thing that

954
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:17,720
Jack Daniels is Sinatra at.
Smells fucking tremendous.

955
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,210
Want to do a drink?
Not in a million fucking years.

956
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,110
I'll drink.
Affects me completely different than it

957
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,830
affects anybody.
I drink one of those.

958
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:26,720
I can't drive home.
I got to sleep in here.

959
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,800
Really?
I can't.

960
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,160
I can not drink and drive.
It's against always.

961
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,170
I always fucked me up like that.
Watching.

962
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:36,230
Maybe that's why you don't like booze.
It's like it has a stronger effect on

963
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:36,881
you.
Maybe do.

964
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:39,200
I don't like boosters.
I grew up in a bar and saw the

965
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:39,891
different,
you know,

966
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:44,180
you and I have a common knowledge that I
talked about the ad that I'm going to

967
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,010
point my life.
I can't take drunk people,

968
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,180
but I'm going to be honest with you.

969
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,830
I couldn't take drunk people and I was
20.

970
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,620
I was just drunk and doing drugs,
so I understood them.

971
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,640
Now when somebody comes up to me drunk,
I don't know what the fuck you talking

972
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:56,474
about.
It's a,

973
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,410
it's a hard time when you're sober and
they're drunk and they're insistent on

974
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:04,160
talking because you're in two different
frequencies and their frequency is very

975
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,370
awkward to you and you don't.
They don't realize that they're being

976
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:09,110
awkward because they're drunk.
You know,

977
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:12,260
it's part of the problem.
So some people are great drugs,

978
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,670
some people,
you know,

979
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:15,560
they'll have a few drinks and you never
noticed a thing.

980
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,080
They're just happy having fun.
Like Brian Collins.

981
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,270
Good example that he ever see Brian
Count drunk.

982
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,830
No,
even when he's drunk,

983
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,990
he's just Brian Cowen drunk,
you know,

984
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,820
he's just having fun.
Just being silly,

985
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,100
you know,
he uh,

986
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,830
he maintains his character,
you know,

987
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,693
some people don't

988
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,420
and there's a certain people that they
get drunk and you have to talk to if

989
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,040
you're sober and they were drunk.
It's like,

990
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:38,840
wow,
this is,

991
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,890
this was getting nowhere.
You can't.

992
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,710
Yeah.
They just don't get it.

993
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,220
They don't understand that that's the
big problem with being drunk because

994
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,570
you'd almost,
you know,

995
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:51,120
you're drunk,
but you don't really know how.

996
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,770
You sound so terrible.

997
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,780
There's just no way.
No Way.

998
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,690
Totally know how goofy.
Look

999
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,060
everybody's drunk.
You're fine with one person,

1000
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:04,930
so like,
oh,

1001
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,790
this is so stupid.
Yeah.

1002
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:11,500
But I realized how fucking Shitty I felt
the next day or half a cigarette,

1003
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,330
like three pops.
I threw it away.

1004
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,180
Like the next day I could feel in my
body,

1005
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:19,780
I could still taste it.
And you'll ball while you're doing it.

1006
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,780
You have no fucking idea.
You know why you're doing all that shit.

1007
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,960
You know how bad his coke.
We used your central nervous system.

1008
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,390
It's why you're doing it.
You don't give a fuck.

1009
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,390
Jesus Christ.
It gets to your bones.

1010
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,030
Yeah.
I remember you saying that that was a

1011
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,730
great way that you described it like Joe
Rogan.

1012
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,090
It's in your bones.
When you talk to an addict and say to

1013
00:45:40,091 --> 00:45:41,620
him,
how come you can't get off?

1014
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,030
They'll say to you,
man,

1015
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,080
this is a pain.

1016
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,380
The withdrawal from heroin and even the
Oxycontin,

1017
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,460
those bills,
that's a heroin.

1018
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,600
You get to your bones,
your bones start to hurt.

1019
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,490
You know?
I've spoken with different people.

1020
00:45:54,491 --> 00:45:58,030
I never had.
I never went through that with with any

1021
00:45:58,031 --> 00:46:00,440
drug,
but I've spoken to people off of heroin

1022
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,590
when they kick heroin.
It's a horror show.

1023
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,090
It's a fucking week long.
Iris show a puke and then that other

1024
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,140
convulsions.
That's what you eat

1025
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,730
and that I can't.
I,

1026
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,590
I didn't do.
I did heroin,

1027
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:19,200
but I snorted it the first time.
I fucking put that pattern,

1028
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,160
my nose.
It fucked with me for awhile,

1029
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,800
but I just put it in the back.
It,

1030
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,680
you just put it in the back file and
then doing coke with something,

1031
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,520
another complete harvest show for me
because I didn't mind doing drugs.

1032
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,970
I just never wanted to do color.
What I did coke,

1033
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:34,750
that was it.

1034
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,000
I just like the first time I missed the
fucking credit,

1035
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:39,190
but like the first time I could make a
credit card payment.

1036
00:46:39,191 --> 00:46:43,390
When I got divorced it ruined me because
it was against my principal who I was

1037
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,390
like,
you always pay your fucking,

1038
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,840
you know?
Uh,

1039
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,140
so if you're doing,
you feel like in yourself,

1040
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:50,650
like,
wow,

1041
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,810
I'm letting myself down.
Yeah.

1042
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,850
Once you put something up your fucking
nose,

1043
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,130
you smack yourself in the face at that
point.

1044
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,920
Nevermind shooting something and your
vein.

1045
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,830
That is a complete.
Yeah.

1046
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:04,360
That's the next level.
That's,

1047
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,490
you know,
I had a friend for years that was hooked

1048
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,860
on it.
I come into his house on Monday mornings

1049
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:15,090
there'd be blood splatters on the walls
from him missing the vein she uses.

1050
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,390
He would buy a $100 worth of heroin and
they bought coke.

1051
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,010
He was doing the Belushi all weekend.

1052
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,980
Oh my God.
He would Belushi it all weekend.

1053
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,640
That speedball right.
That's like the coke and the heroin

1054
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:32,560
together and it creates sort of a weird
effect.

1055
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,490
It creates fuck getting a tornado in
your brain.

1056
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:38,920
You just passed the fuck out,
you know,

1057
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,750
this guy would be clean from Monday.
He was brilliant from Monday to Friday.

1058
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,650
He could keep it together.
I think Thursday night he would break

1059
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:51,100
down and do a little,
like a little sniff just to keep them

1060
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,130
together during the week,
but once Friday came,

1061
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,660
you wouldn't see him till Monday
morning.

1062
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,910
During the week you would massage his
veins.

1063
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,830
I got a massage.
We got to get them to go home for the

1064
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:06,880
weekend and shit.
Oh my God.

1065
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,060
And then he would switch like,
how can you go from your arm to your

1066
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,640
toe?
I guess you half like I can't find a

1067
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:12,940
vein.

1068
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,391
Joe.
Hold on.

1069
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:18,391
Let me take my shoe off and fucking
shoot my toe is just the first guy I

1070
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:22,780
ever had friends that did steroids.
That was one of the most interesting

1071
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,020
nights of my life.
We were doing coke in the middle of

1072
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,030
everything.
He just took off his shirt and started

1073
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,670
doing pushups.
He got up and he goes,

1074
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:32,580
look at me.
What's different for you lifting?

1075
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,101
He goes,
no.

1076
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,890
I started doing steroids and he started
breaking it down to me.

1077
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:41,290
He was getting an addiction to steroids
because he was going to every week and

1078
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,570
just shooting and they just went off a
cycle.

1079
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:48,310
Then they just stopped breaking it up.
He was on a cycle year round,

1080
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,870
but he was addicted to the needle going
in his ass and then he would shoot it

1081
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:57,760
with vitamin B and he would tell me he
can taste the vitamin B in his mouth and

1082
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:58,060
shit.

1083
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,210
I didn't fucking shoot coke.
You can taste it in your mouth.

1084
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,680
How you really?
Yeah.

1085
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,443
So you.
Oh,

1086
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,100
you shoot it now shooting coke.
How much different is that supposed to

1087
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:11,440
be than snorting it?
I have no idea,

1088
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,470
but what about the people that.
I mean most pick something crazy.

1089
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,500
Birds of a feather flock together.
I snorted.

1090
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,600
I hung out with snow artists once they
talked to them about needles.

1091
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,300
That's when I go home.
Once I see a needle,

1092
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:23,020
I go,
I don't want to sit in a room where

1093
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,760
there's a fucking needle because I can't
sit still.

1094
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,330
Once I see that syringe.
You don't want me around.

1095
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,680
I don't want to be that.
I went to cvs a month ago and they had

1096
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,080
syringes that they give you a free
syringes.

1097
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:37,060
I almost fucking died.
I don't like.

1098
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:37,990
I'm empty.
I don't like.

1099
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,210
I'm full.
I don't like to see them.

1100
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,160
Those people that carry the fixes with
them,

1101
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,730
they call them a fix kit.
Spoon and a syringe and a lighter and

1102
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:50,700
the needles here.
Right.

1103
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:53,080
And that when they call it the gears,
I would ask him like,

1104
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:55,360
so when you go over there,
how do you shoot it?

1105
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:58,080
And he goes,
we all stand around who and we.

1106
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,020
Then we all pass the needle.
This is 82 when you could pass a veto

1107
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:06,600
from one guy to the other and shoot the
ball and fucking that guy,

1108
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:11,650
these kinds of
one needle to another.

1109
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,610
Then filling it with vitamin B.
They would go,

1110
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,510
why are we gonna?
You know,

1111
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,280
because if,
I guess I don't know how the needle

1112
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,270
works.
If you keep shooting,

1113
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:21,060
it gets dull.
Yeah.

1114
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,270
Just take one neat on.
But the nine guys knew each other

1115
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,980
through each other.
Firstly you hepatitis

1116
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,620
C,
that's the first thing he got from that

1117
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:31,880
shit.
That's just that.

1118
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,440
Now you get hepatitis C if you jam a
needle into you that's been jammed into

1119
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:37,820
someone with Hepatitis C,
right?

1120
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,640
I think so.
But you on sexual transmission also?

1121
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,503
Correct.
Right.

1122
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,960
He ever thought about that?
Like I've thought about that before.

1123
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:50,110
Like herpes or anything
warts.

1124
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,590
There had to be an original case like
that had to be one person that developed

1125
00:50:57,561 --> 00:50:59,720
this.
Like how does that develop?

1126
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:03,370
I've always been curious like how the
fuck does something like a herpes,

1127
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,800
so on point in time,
but no one has her syphilis and you blog

1128
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:11,920
guy with Spanish syphilis.
It becomes the harp they can together

1129
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:13,100
glide.
That's what happens.

1130
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:14,520
It becomes more powerful,
worse,

1131
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,500
you know,
like right now supposedly all these

1132
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,450
diseases,
they disappeared for a while.

1133
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,300
Then they make a comeback.
Something was popular last year.

1134
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,200
We get measles.
Was it?

1135
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,220
No,
no sexual.

1136
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,060
Oh,
something came back last year that was

1137
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:33,390
popular 10 years ago we came back.
I don't know which one it was real or

1138
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:36,110
something like that.
Like I got something like I've always

1139
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:37,550
had something.
You've got something right now.

1140
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,370
I've had it for years because at night I
get itchy.

1141
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,920
I don't know what the fuck is this.
I lay down in bed,

1142
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:47,050
I get itchy as a motherfucker and when I
asked you if you have a long run and

1143
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:49,440
colony of crabs just camped out and do
something.

1144
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,500
When I took a blood test years ago,
they were like,

1145
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:55,220
did you have something?
I had something and I go,

1146
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:56,054
I don't know.

1147
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,840
And they go,
you must add something because to get

1148
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:06,480
the tail end I had something like when I
first moved to La,

1149
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,110
I had something all those years on the
road,

1150
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,750
you're going to get something now if you
don't take antibiotics,

1151
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:14,510
if you get something like syphilis is
what killed Al Capone.

1152
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,940
Right?
I'm like,

1153
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:18,980
what?
What happens if like other ones like

1154
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:19,970
gonorrhea,
gonorrhea,

1155
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,780
kill you?
I don't know.

1156
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,850
You just get better.
I don't know.

1157
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,550
I know I had to guess.
I think eventually something's got to

1158
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:28,580
happen through you.
Can Gonorrhea be faithful,

1159
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,370
fatal and Kenny recover with no
medication.

1160
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:34,760
Jamie,
if you just do the Wim Hof method,

1161
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,130
which went hoff breathing,
just

1162
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,420
just try,
try to power through the gonorrhea.

1163
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,780
Syphilis killed you.
I'm pretty sure syphilis kills.

1164
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,350
Like everybody that gets feed the
venereal disease,

1165
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,070
but that's covers everything.
Couple of.

1166
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,610
It's weird because venereal doesn't
sound like sex,

1167
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,100
but that's what vd is.
You know,

1168
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,560
[inaudible] a sexual transmitted
disease.

1169
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,330
When you talking about someone having
vd.

1170
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,540
When I was about 17,
my friend fucked his sister's best

1171
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,490
friend and he's got something.
He got VD,

1172
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,960
got vd and we went the next day and it
was a chick with like fucking like the

1173
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,680
Phantom of the opera mark on her face.
Dog.

1174
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:22,370
It was fucking crazy.
What was the mark on her face?

1175
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:24,960
Like she.
She had like syphilis or something

1176
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,050
started.
She

1177
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,830
had a cut in her lip and she sucked the
fucked up

1178
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,320
and it ran.
I never forget this.

1179
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,840
It's not even funny.
It was really sad because I didn't know

1180
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:36,940
what she had.
I just went there with my friend.

1181
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:38,260
My friend goes,
you got to go in there with me,

1182
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,590
dog.
I'm scared to walk in there.

1183
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,860
Let's go.
What's the big deal?

1184
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:42,820
They're going to give you?
Pills,

1185
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:43,541
whatever.
I didn't know.

1186
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:47,950
I wasn't sexually active at that age.
He was and we went in there while I was

1187
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:50,920
waiting for him to go to.
This chick came into the paperwork and

1188
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:54,550
she turned around and she had gotten
something that started here,

1189
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,340
like she had like a cut or.
What's that?

1190
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:01,840
When you have chapped lips or something
and all this was like half purple and

1191
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:02,730
red.
She sucks.

1192
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:06,130
Something bad and after that I was like,
Ooh,

1193
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,110
I got to be careful out there.
It's a jungle.

1194
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,800
That was the thing when we were kids,
like someone has vd.

1195
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,360
Ah,
she's got VD.

1196
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,530
Be careful.
He's got VD VD.

1197
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,501
It was like,
Whoa,

1198
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:19,630
you're here to here.
Betty got bed.

1199
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:24,780
Oh that fucking girl got feet d,
facebook friends with me from high

1200
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:31,380
school and the Pussy wouldn't get wet.
They used to call the dry Hump Affairs

1201
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,710
Jersey.
They used to call a fairview.

1202
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,603
The church either.

1203
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,240
Oh,
oh

1204
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,113
fuck.

1205
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,680
People are so fucked up.
Girl was banging.

1206
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,120
This girl was fucking banging though.
So you'd have to like bring vaseline or

1207
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:01,290
something.
And she was from Wayne,

1208
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:02,910
New Jersey,
and she was banging.

1209
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,240
She moved to North Bergen,
like she was a sophomore and she was

1210
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:08,550
dating a few guys.
Shouldn't things happen like I was

1211
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:09,900
friends with.
I know she didn't like me.

1212
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,150
She,
she just didn't like me for some reason.

1213
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:15,810
I don't think the world to her either.
And one nine,

1214
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:18,150
84,
I'm at a bar and this bitch comes in.

1215
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,760
I mean banging,
banging,

1216
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,940
banging.
They also said she had some type of Vd.

1217
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:27,450
So they called the lorry Jack,
you know she's got the Jack

1218
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,790
CDC sang a song,
she's got the Jack Jack.

1219
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,570
Jack said he used to call her name and
Jack like,

1220
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,860
that was like,
they just taught math at this girl and

1221
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,370
she did like a rocky,
like a rock guy and had like long hair

1222
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,740
and whatnot.

1223
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:48,740
I saw rocky and she was banging Joe
Rogan banging and I go,

1224
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:50,820
you live in North Bergen?
I,

1225
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:51,361
she's like,
yeah,

1226
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:52,470
I didn't go to college.
I,

1227
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,150
I'm a,
I'm a nanny.

1228
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,940
I'm a nanny.
And she told me the guy's name and I

1229
00:55:56,941 --> 00:55:59,580
knew that guy.
That guy had a massage parlor years

1230
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,590
earlier,
the guy that she was being a nanny for

1231
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,730
and I go,
she says,

1232
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,440
nanny,
he's just fucking.

1233
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:08,020
Or something's gotta be wrong.
She looked so good in that mini skirt.

1234
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,240
She disappeared like 1:30
and finally like three.

1235
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:12,961
I'm sitting there,
I'm like,

1236
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,720
what am I going to do tonight?
And I had like a bag of coke or go fuck

1237
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:16,650
it.
I'm going to go get him.

1238
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,430
So I went crazy.
I was.

1239
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,010
I went to the dude's house who she's
told me I knocked on door was 3:15 in

1240
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,910
the morning and he said,
Coco,

1241
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,490
what are you doing?

1242
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,430
I go,
I got to talk to Lori.

1243
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,240
There's something missing.
He goes,

1244
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,170
hold on,
Lori.

1245
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,730
And she came down and she comes outside,
he's got a robe and she's got a robot.

1246
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,620
And I looked her straight in the face.
I go,

1247
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:41,740
listen,
I got like to eight balls in my pocket,

1248
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:43,120
get dresses,
get the fuck out.

1249
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,140
And she's like,
I can't.

1250
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,100
I go,
you have to.

1251
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,790
And we argued that for like 10 minutes.
I'm like,

1252
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,910
I want to suck your pussy.
I want to do 30 things to you.

1253
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,460
I don't give a fuck about the VD or the
Jack or the dry hump.

1254
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,560
I'm on fire.
And she's like,

1255
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:58,390
well,
give me 10 minutes and I know how am I

1256
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,650
going to sneak out of there?
I Dunno.

1257
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,080
So I waited outside for.
She's like,

1258
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:03,710
I'll put Lou embed,
not run up.

1259
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,260
About 15 minutes later I see her running
that with a purse with like a bank

1260
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,660
deposit bag was like,
fuck him.

1261
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,820
I can't take care of anymore.
Fuck him.

1262
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:14,830
We were on foot.
It's 4:30 in the morning.

1263
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,400
Totally Avenue.
North Bergen is a bunch of those dirty

1264
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,310
hotels.
So on my car I got a score here.

1265
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,990
I got co,
she's got money.

1266
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,360
I'm going to fuck her.
I'm excited.

1267
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:29,410
We go back to a hotel.
We finally registered like $30.

1268
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,440
They asked us through one of the Jacuzzi
in the room and shit.

1269
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:35,680
It was one of those dirty hotels on
tonally as you go in New York City.

1270
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,260
We went in there,
we walk in and she goes,

1271
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:40,600
rule number one,
you are not going to find me.

1272
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,230
It's five in the morning that goes my
fucking.

1273
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,700
That goes this night and all of a sudden
she looks at me.

1274
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,534
She goes,
well,

1275
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,880
if you could guess the color of my
panties,

1276
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,370
I fuck you.
I'm like,

1277
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:52,750
okay,
read.

1278
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,280
And she goes,
they're green,

1279
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:55,114
but good enough.

1280
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,630
Started snorting coke,
eat mass.

1281
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,060
I mean there was
five in the afternoon and Doug Flutie

1282
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,410
was drawn.
That quarterback that

1283
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,190
I was waking up,
she was naked,

1284
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,380
rip apart.
I'm waking up and Doug flutie strong the

1285
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:17,230
touchdown.
I got dressed and got the fuck out and

1286
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,260
never saw her again.
Never been robbed the money.

1287
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:24,190
I took everything.
She pops up on facebook about two years

1288
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:25,350
ago and I'm like,
Laurie,

1289
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,460
she's like,
fuck you,

1290
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:30,100
you fat faggot and all this shit.
She's like,

1291
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,140
you left me there that night,
but we had a good time.

1292
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,590
Fuck yeah,
we had a good thought and I will hit her

1293
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:37,240
back and go,
what color are your panties?

1294
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,230
She goes,
what?

1295
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,650
That's supposed to me.
That instrument in the areas I knew,

1296
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:45,430
she gave me some.
She had something but I didn't give a

1297
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:47,560
fuck.
It was 84 rock Hudson was died.

1298
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,080
I didn't use a condom.
I knew the consequences.

1299
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,700
I'm like,
fuck it.

1300
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,910
So I knew I was going to get something
and I probably did.

1301
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,090
I got crabs after that.
Over the holidays

1302
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,000
I got crabs.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,770
Eighty four,
85 season.

1304
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:05,950
I got crabs.
I found that in the bathroom and port

1305
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:08,500
authority,
the port authority to take a shit and I

1306
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:12,820
pulled my pants down and I'm sitting
there reading the paper and I see a

1307
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:15,160
crap.
Like I sort of sat and jump and I'm

1308
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:16,450
like,
what the fuck?

1309
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,630
And I had never heard it.
I had never heard nothing.

1310
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,010
I went home and took my underwear off
and got

1311
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,900
like a magnifying glass.
It was over.

1312
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:26,840
It was all over me.
They were all over the couch.

1313
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,880
I had to bring a bomb into the room,
like one of those bombs and leave for 12

1314
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:33,340
hours since you really.
Oh,

1315
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:38,341
I grabbed the bucket.
It was cramped up like,

1316
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,180
oh my God,
lady next door knocked out.

1317
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:43,460
Mike that I was living in.
Tenafly,

1318
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,360
New Jersey Lady.
Next door knock.

1319
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,790
So you have a bug problem?
I'm like,

1320
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,770
no,
no,

1321
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,110
since you moved in here,
there's been crabs and

1322
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:57,080
like y'all got fleas when I was in high
school and you ever have a dog with

1323
00:59:57,081 --> 01:00:00,090
fleas?
Fleas get into the carpet and they had

1324
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,550
the ag act like a flea collar that you'd
put on your dog with apparently worked

1325
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,430
and then they had these flea drops that
you put on dogs.

1326
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,020
Fucking hated.
He would score it on there for like at

1327
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:14,990
various spots like right behind the neck
and then like in the middle of the back

1328
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:18,980
and the lower back and the dog would go
fucking crazy and roll around on the

1329
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:19,460
ground.

1330
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,740
Try to get that shit off them.
But if you didn't do it you,

1331
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,030
your dog's going to get fleas.
And we had carpet does that means you

1332
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:28,640
have fleas.
So when you were walking I'd like in my

1333
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,370
bedroom,
I'd be walking in my carpet and I'd see

1334
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:34,700
a flea jump onto my leg.
I'd be like fuck.

1335
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,670
And once you have it you just have it,
you know,

1336
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:41,840
like I mean there was some,
some carpet stuff that I used to have to

1337
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,320
shake down.
So I shake down all this poison shit all

1338
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:47,750
over my carpet and then you have to
vacuum it up,

1339
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,740
but there's always one or two that
survived one or two gangster fleas.

1340
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:55,160
It figured out how to fucking stay away
from the powder and then figure their

1341
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:57,950
way right back onto your leg.
And it was hard to get get it off the

1342
01:00:57,951 --> 01:01:00,890
dogs too because then they would just go
hang out with other dogs.

1343
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,190
They'd get it again.
Even if you cleaned him up and kill all

1344
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:07,070
the fleas that got them again.
You could see the eggs,

1345
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:11,450
like he would click be cleaning them.
Like your wash your dog at the base of

1346
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:16,030
their hair.
You'd find the every fucking gross it

1347
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,260
was gone.
It would just drop it and she'll over

1348
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:20,120
your carpet.
Yup,

1349
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,960
Yup.
Yeah,

1350
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:24,650
that's a giant issue if you have dogs
that I had a dog once that had

1351
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:27,050
distemper,
caught distemper from analog.

1352
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,200
It was so sad.
He uh,

1353
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,360
was a puppy and he would go into
convulsions,

1354
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,320
who'd have seizures.
He was just a little puppy,

1355
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,220
was so sad.
We had a wind up putting them down and

1356
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:42,380
um,
put them down,

1357
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:43,820
man.
My veterinarian.

1358
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,261
So good.
A guy.

1359
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:46,670
This guy was,
he was crying.

1360
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,880
He cried afterwards about how hard it
is.

1361
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,390
I mean,
the guy just love dogs.

1362
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:55,070
I love cats.
He was just so upset,

1363
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,230
so upset.

1364
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,590
It was really crazy,
man.

1365
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,780
It was a weird moment that I'll never
forget.

1366
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,460
He ended up dying in a car accident.
Drunk driver,

1367
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,360
a drunk driver hit him,
but I never forget that.

1368
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,051
I was like,
wow,

1369
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:14,600
that guy got killed by a drunk driver.
That guy,

1370
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,620
he didn't make any sense.
It was such a nice guy.

1371
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,730
Boy,
did he hate marriage?

1372
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,070
You know,
I was young.

1373
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:29,400
I was 26 when I first met him,
you know,

1374
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,360
they'd be like,
you married?

1375
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:30,961
I go,
no.

1376
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:31,980
He goes,
don't get married.

1377
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,043
I'm like,
okay.

1378
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:38,160
Explain to me marriage guys who have
been to hardcore divorces,

1379
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,560
man,
they have a fucking way.

1380
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,520
They have a way of grabbing you and
putting that urgency and you listen to

1381
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:45,354
me.
Listen to me.

1382
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,300
Don't fucking do it.
Okay?

1383
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,503
Okay.
I won't do it.

1384
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,653
I won't do it.

1385
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:56,590
There's nothing as bad as the divorce.
I would say death is probably worse.

1386
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,320
Some people.
Divorce is great.

1387
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,690
You know what the problem with a lot of
fucking people is,

1388
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,750
especially a lot of dudes with money is
when you get married.

1389
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,550
Your wife has my two now,
like before you got married,

1390
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,240
you were the guy with money,
so you had a bunch of money and she's

1391
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:14,641
like,
wow,

1392
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:18,600
like this guy got money and then when
you get married,

1393
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,630
guess what?
Now she's got money to now she gets her,

1394
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:26,310
recognize you for you and so it's not.
You're not as cool anymore because

1395
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:29,640
you're not just a guy with money.
She's got money to bitch to her fucking

1396
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:31,490
money now and she's like,
God damn,

1397
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,390
I'm going to take my share and get the
fuck outta here.

1398
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:34,950
Like all of a sudden she's got your
money.

1399
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,970
Like what happened?
What happened is like there's a bunch of

1400
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:40,320
things that happen when people get
married,

1401
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,250
right?
There's love,

1402
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,990
there's devotion,
there's commitment,

1403
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:45,990
there's a beautiful bond,
the ego you guys share,

1404
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:51,650
but let's not get confused under the
exact same rules with the exact same

1405
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,800
words.
I do,

1406
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,040
I do.
There's a lot of scamming going on.

1407
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:01,070
There's a lot of people getting robbed.
There's a lot of legal extortion.

1408
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,730
There's a lot of legal stealing.
There's a lot of really hot women who

1409
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,370
have no business.
Fucking some old dude.

1410
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,940
There's a lot of really hot women that
are like fucking some guy who's 70 years

1411
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:16,830
old and they talked this dummy it
marrying them with no prenuptial they

1412
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:20,650
suck his dick for a couple of years and
dropped a cup them

1413
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,260
and take a chunk.
Just take a giant chunk of millions and

1414
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,950
millions of dollars.
That happens to.

1415
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,930
I'm not saying it shouldn't happen and
I'm not saying it's,

1416
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,340
it's not an interesting deal.
You know,

1417
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,590
that some people make,
you know,

1418
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,460
like the Guy Married Anna Nicole Smith.
Remember I used to have that bit about

1419
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:40,290
that guy that was the same kind of
thing.

1420
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:41,850
It was like,
nothing wrong with it.

1421
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,980
Everybody knows what it is,
but

1422
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,400
you can't.
That's not the same.

1423
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,970
Like all marriages is not the same.
So people that were upset about like gay

1424
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,270
marriage,
gay people that legitimately love each

1425
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,820
other and they want to get married,
she'd be upset at this other shit.

1426
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,330
She'd be upset that you could go to
vegas high on coke,

1427
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,460
go through a drive through and get
married.

1428
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,490
You can do that.
They're not drug testing you.

1429
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,990
They take you to those drive through
Elvis fucking wedding chapels and Vegas.

1430
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,110
You think they see if you're dry,
they don't give a fuck if you're drunk.

1431
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,710
You mean maybe you can get it a note
tomorrow if you are.

1432
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:17,860
I mean maybe.
I don't know.

1433
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:20,840
They don't give a shit that's marriage
to.

1434
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,860
So it's a bunch of different things to
God damn contract.

1435
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,790
No marriage is bad for somebody when
they lose something.

1436
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,550
That's what a basic list.
They lose a house,

1437
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,220
they lose money if you marry somebody.
You know what I'm saying?

1438
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:33,840
You go ahead.
I don't want to be married no more.

1439
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:36,120
Me Either.
See the mom who's keeping the house.

1440
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:38,100
It's your fucking house by.
Okay.

1441
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,510
That's great.
Nobody.

1442
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,440
Nobody would get angry.
Nobody would get it.

1443
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,020
It's when you lose something,
right?

1444
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,570
You know,
or somebody cheated on you or whatever.

1445
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:49,230
I had no money when I got divorced.
It wasn't even that alone.

1446
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:50,170
So you're like,
Yay.

1447
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,320
Yay.
Oh fuck you.

1448
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:52,920
When I get to do comedy now the whole
thing.

1449
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,110
But there was a kitten bowl.
Right.

1450
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,110
And there's always fucking something.
See,

1451
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,530
that's when marriage sucks.
I also told myself that for years and it

1452
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:05,280
wasn't the marriage that sucked.
Sometimes we don't put enough into the

1453
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:06,060
marriage.
You know?

1454
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,250
I didn't know what marriage was when I
first got married.

1455
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,620
I tell you what,
I know my marriage is now,

1456
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,470
motherfucker.
I know what marriage is now and that's

1457
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:16,260
why it works.
I know you have to put time into when I

1458
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:17,850
first got married,
you do the laundry,

1459
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,850
you cook and I give you a check and we
fuck

1460
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,060
I fuck you when I want.
That's not mad.

1461
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,400
When you're 25,
you think that's marriage,

1462
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,230
you know,
you think that's marriage.

1463
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,410
That's where I thought,
yeah,

1464
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,440
I'll go out and work.
I didn't think you had to pay attention

1465
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:34,710
or go to a date night or fucking I have
to put time into them.

1466
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:35,700
Or,
you know,

1467
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:38,610
I can't do a spot tonight because I'm
going to the movies with my wife.

1468
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,140
You know,
you have to put that time and if you

1469
01:06:40,141 --> 01:06:41,070
want it to fucking work,

1470
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,660
yeah,
you got to have an actual relationship.

1471
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,600
That's where it gets tricky.
It's hard.

1472
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,380
It's hard to find someone that you enjoy
talking to,

1473
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,230
you know,
they enjoy being with not just doing

1474
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:55,780
stuff with,
but just sitting alone and talking.

1475
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,550
It's hard.
It's hard.

1476
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,160
It's hard to find people that are on the
same wavelength as you.

1477
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,100
It's hard to find people that want to
talk about the things you want to talk

1478
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:05,200
about or want to,
you know,

1479
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,680
want to see things from your perspective
and that you want to see things through

1480
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:12,730
their perspective that you want to have
these open kind of honest conversations.

1481
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,530
It's not easy to find someone like that.
These poor people that we all know that

1482
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:19,840
are unlike dating apps,
like a,

1483
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:23,020
especially smart women.
I know a lot of smart women that cannot

1484
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:26,050
find a fucking man to save their life.
And you look at it,

1485
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:26,980
you're like,
I don't get it.

1486
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,860
SMART,
ambitious,

1487
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:32,020
powerful woman,
hot.

1488
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:37,170
Can't find a man too hard out there.
It's hard to find somebody that you sync

1489
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:43,351
with that you could talk to.
I think it's way easier for a dude to

1490
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:47,920
find a cool chick that is for a girl to
find a guy who's got his shit together.

1491
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:54,060
Maybe I'm just guessing,
but I think it's probably harder.

1492
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:58,880
I felt a lot of single women out there
to fucking good looking at jobs and

1493
01:07:58,881 --> 01:08:00,500
shit,
but we don't.

1494
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,560
We also know him like that too.
It runs two ways.

1495
01:08:03,561 --> 01:08:06,620
Joe.
We didn't get that close to them that we

1496
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:11,000
didn't see what the
idiosyncrasies works.

1497
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,670
Even with us,
there's a bunch of women that look at

1498
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:16,040
you and God love to be with them.
Then they get with this

1499
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,870
guy flies out of town every fucking
weekend.

1500
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,870
I can't be.
You know what I'm saying?

1501
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:20,510
Like little things that they don't
understand.

1502
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,920
Am I coming?
No.

1503
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:25,970
He ever had guys that you're friends
with who like back up off the comedy

1504
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:28,040
because they got a new girlfriend and
the new girlfriend's like,

1505
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,390
I don't want you going out.
You know,

1506
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,060
I don't want you doing sets every night.
You don't have to do them every night

1507
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:32,811
like,
but I do,

1508
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:35,360
if I want to get better,
like that's like,

1509
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,350
you know how like baseball players to go
to the field and practice?

1510
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,490
Yeah.
I have to go on stage.

1511
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,770
It's the same thing.
You don't think about it that way

1512
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:44,900
because you don't do it,
but you got to understand it's the same

1513
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:45,980
thing.
Well,

1514
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:47,150
when I did it,
the stripper,

1515
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,970
the crazy bitch,
she doesn't understand that.

1516
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,710
She was awesome by the way.

1517
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,593
No,
she was,

1518
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,680
she was you and her together with one of
my favorite couples of all time.

1519
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,060
She still retarded.
I loved a boyfriend,

1520
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:01,190
a picture of her boyfriend.
Now he's got cockeyed.

1521
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,230
I mean she's a fucking nut.
She's a fucking knows.

1522
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,810
One of the reasons why I fell in love
with.

1523
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:07,240
She's a millionaire,
you know,

1524
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,310
she's a fucking gazillionaire.
He,

1525
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,050
these fucking dudes get all the money
again.

1526
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:16,580
Sheet or at first when we broke up,
she went to Florida and she ended up

1527
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:19,280
marrying this old Hindu guy.
There you go.

1528
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,700
Like he was 76.
They lasted three months.

1529
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:25,330
He died when I was at.
What was I saying?

1530
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,960
Left her.
His money.

1531
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,900
There you go.
She took the money and invested in Jim's

1532
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,110
curves.
Bought one,

1533
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,310
bought two or three,
but four became like a fucking a mogul

1534
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,500
and then sold them all when they were
still hot.

1535
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,350
Wow.
They went out of business.

1536
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,850
Curves.
Went out of business.

1537
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,170
I think something,
something.

1538
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:46,940
I don't know.
They're not as popular as they were

1539
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:48,650
anymore here.
The whole idea was like,

1540
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,590
don't work out that hard.
I can keep it curves.

1541
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,760
Just come on in.
Well,

1542
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:55,700
I thought it was a place just for
everyone's willing to ambitious just for

1543
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:57,320
women.
I didn't know it was just kidding.

1544
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,173
Oh,
okay.

1545
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,720
But yeah,
it is just a place for women,

1546
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,100
but you know,
you hear like curves,

1547
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:04,880
you think of it as,
you know when you say embrace your

1548
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:05,391
curves.
Yeah,

1549
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:06,890
definitely.
For sure.

1550
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,740
What are you trying to know?
What are you really saying?

1551
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,810
Are you saying embrace your curves?
You saying you know,

1552
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,700
don't work out that hard.
What are you saying?

1553
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,950
Don't bother getting fit.
What are you saying?

1554
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,963
I don't know.
What you're saying,

1555
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,650
you can't go there.

1556
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,210
You can't work out there.
No,

1557
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,340
but you can.
You can never have a men.

1558
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:27,341
Only Jim know if you had a men only gym,
it will be empty.

1559
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,640
Well,
wouldn't.

1560
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,430
It wouldn't even matter.
Like women would protest appellee's

1561
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,640
fucking humps go to the gym to see girls
anyway.

1562
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,260
Most of them,
most of them do,

1563
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:38,720
so that's why it would be empty.
There's a lot of guys go to the gym and

1564
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:40,860
they don't even get motivated unless
girls working out there,

1565
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,720
don't look at them.
Look at them.

1566
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:45,950
Monday,
workout yoga pants.

1567
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,470
Very primal.
You know you're like naked,

1568
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:50,360
but covered up with like cloth,
like paint,

1569
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,250
paint cloths,
that little monkey sweating like yoga

1570
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,250
pants.
You're feeling like trump grabbed that

1571
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:02,990
fucking monster.
I was with my friend Cameron Hanes in

1572
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,360
Boston.
We're working out at this gym and there

1573
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,600
was this girl that was,
you know those hardcore gym girls.

1574
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,980
His hardcore gym girls who just go,
I follow a couple of them on instagram

1575
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:18,050
and they do squats and fucking they're
doing like what a perfect example is

1576
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,580
that guy carrying who is here carrying
fitsgibbons.

1577
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:25,820
His wife's name is Jack Jessica.
She's a crossfit champion and she's just

1578
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,850
ridiculously fit.
Just ridiculously fit,

1579
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:33,200
but those kinds of like gym girls,
don't.

1580
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,860
They scare the fuck out of you?
A little bit.

1581
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,220
Little crazy.
I don't say nothing to him.

1582
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,880
I just walked right past them.
There's a girl,

1583
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,380
but why that doesn't?
That lists the whole fucking thing.

1584
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,070
She's crazy.
She's fucking brutal.

1585
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,660
Mean campaigns.
We're looking at her and Kim's like,

1586
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:52,650
I want to be built like her.
I wish I had her build.

1587
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,950
She was jacked.
This lady was just doing squats and

1588
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:58,110
shit.
Fucking powder on her hands and shit.

1589
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,580
Big Ass
dead lifts,

1590
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,050
so women just embraced that.
They love it.

1591
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:10,640
Now if they were told they can't go to a
gym because it's an all male power

1592
01:12:10,641 --> 01:12:11,474
lifting gym,

1593
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:16,760
but the problem is like a girl goes to a
gym and hits on guys.

1594
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:20,030
It's really not that big of a deal,
but if a guy goes to an all girl,

1595
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:22,400
gems starts hitting on the girls,
that becomes a.

1596
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,280
That becomes gross.
That's becomes harassment.

1597
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:28,040
Like he can't.
You can't work out just a different

1598
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,950
feeling.
It's a different feeling for them to hit

1599
01:12:30,951 --> 01:12:35,930
on us than it is for us to hit on.
That just know is not the same kind of

1600
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:37,130
danger.
You know,

1601
01:12:37,131 --> 01:12:40,070
a guy hitting on a girl.
There's a certain element of danger

1602
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:41,630
involved in that.
Right?

1603
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,520
The girl,
like if some crazy girl comes to the

1604
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:44,271
gym,
she's like,

1605
01:12:44,271 --> 01:12:47,000
Hey,
I found a fucking give you a dead lift.

1606
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,430
You know what I mean?
You wouldn't,

1607
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,950
you wouldn't feel threatened.
Like,

1608
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:52,820
get Outta here.
Crazy

1609
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,470
to lose you.
But,

1610
01:12:55,471 --> 01:13:00,471
but like if you go to crunch those
Hollywood gyms and all those,

1611
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,950
you see that the girls get ready an hour
before they go to the gym,

1612
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,160
make up the hat with the tail coming
out.

1613
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,650
They're color coordinated.
I mean,

1614
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:13,920
they go to those gyms to get picked up
and the guys that go there,

1615
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,650
they go for action to when you go to the
y,

1616
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:20,050
it's slows down a little bit.
Let's do a couple of women that go in

1617
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:21,510
there.
They gotta stab and I see him all the

1618
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,640
time.
They go in there with the little towels

1619
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:27,150
and the yoga pants and then mingling
with the trainers and shit,

1620
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,940
but then you go to other gyms.
That's not even happening.

1621
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,970
It's just certain gyms called for that.
You also recognize what a person's got

1622
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:40,710
going on physically.
You see some girls in one of them,

1623
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,970
those things,
she got that,

1624
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:46,860
but bob machine,
you know that one,

1625
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,920
like they're sending out pheromones and
shit and they're showing you their

1626
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:56,280
shape.
You know they got yoga pants on or

1627
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:58,170
shorts.
Shorts are risky,

1628
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,510
especially when you're doing them kinda
kicking maneuvers.

1629
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:05,540
There was any sort of opening there and
some things get pushed aside or come

1630
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,270
flying out of the bottom of there yet.
Be careful.

1631
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,890
It's a move,

1632
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,840
but you're.
You're seeing them exert.

1633
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,620
You've seen them work hard.
Seeing them show their vitality.

1634
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:23,030
You know on the lift in that
there's always like some dude helping

1635
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:24,580
them come up.
One more,

1636
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,600
one more,
one more,

1637
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,000
but she's not just doing that for him.
She's doing that for other guys too.

1638
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,200
She's like putting out that sent.
Accelerating the game.

1639
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,850
The whole competition just ramps up a
couple of notches while she's doing

1640
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,670
squats.
Ass Out,

1641
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:46,050
ridiculous squats,
deep

1642
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,410
clink,
high five.

1643
01:14:50,411 --> 01:14:53,770
The guys walks around,
makes eye contact with the audience.

1644
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:00,180
See who's checking around hard.
There was a girl at the y when I first

1645
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:03,640
started going on one in Hollywood,
Spanish girl,

1646
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,770
torture,
torture.

1647
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:10,800
She wouldn't shave her armpits flow and
the sweat would drip from her armpit.

1648
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,260
And here's where it gets better.
She would always wait gray sweatpants

1649
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:18,310
and she wouldn't wear underwear.
So you can see the sweat from a monkey

1650
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,890
come right through the fucking.

1651
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,340
So she walked up to see the fucking wet
thing.

1652
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,400
Egg right toes.
She didn't give a fuck.

1653
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,550
She was hot as fuck.
You know,

1654
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,880
I'm an old man.
I've been talked to a black car and that

1655
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:37,240
talking to the different guys,
but she'd be benching and she opened up

1656
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:42,241
her thighs and that little swamp just be
fucking drenched with sweat.

1657
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:46,710
It was tremendous.
I would look at it and shake my fuck.

1658
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,810
This girl's,
you know,

1659
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:49,150
Hollywood man.
That's what happened.

1660
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,910
Let's start with the Hollywood.
Yesterday morning I had to be that

1661
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:56,410
lunchtime and I'm driving and I see a
black dude that wade,

1662
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:01,680
he was six feet with 120 pounds,
that skinny with Clint Eastwood hat on

1663
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:07,420
from a fistful of dollars and the Poncho
from clothing and he was standing next

1664
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:10,090
to a big,
fat white dude with a beard like Jesus

1665
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:11,650
with sandals and the Jesus thing.

1666
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,380
And I said to myself,
dog,

1667
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,510
I'm in Hollywood.
This is it.

1668
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,790
This is it.
It's fucking.

1669
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,160
This is what I'm going to say.
You know,

1670
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,050
you see that at the comedy store almost
Sunday night,

1671
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,880
Sunday night.
You see that one dude dresses like

1672
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:22,611
Jesus.
Yeah,

1673
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,360
he no explanation.
One time he came by and he wasn't

1674
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,950
dressed like Jesus.
I was disappointed.

1675
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:30,700
I seen that guy 100 times at least
dressed like Jesus,

1676
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,140
and then one time I saw him,
he wasn't dressed like Jesus.

1677
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:34,630
So I was like,
what the fuck are you doing here,

1678
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,270
man?
Like once you commit to that outfit.

1679
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,160
Right.
Have you ever seen him without the Jesus

1680
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,160
outfit once?
Yeah.

1681
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:47,650
He said he walks in Jesus to his head
down like that folder from the back.

1682
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:48,730
And He.
It's interesting.

1683
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,000
I mean he found something.
He found his niche.

1684
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,690
I guess they used to be at duty.

1685
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,190
You remember the guy who used to walk up
and down the street with a cross on his

1686
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:59,830
back?
A bunch of people behind them.

1687
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1688
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:05,560
There was a dude who used to walk down
the street with a cross and sometimes

1689
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:08,380
people would carry the cross and
sometimes he would strap it on his back,

1690
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,100
but he would walk down with a bunch of
disciples.

1691
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:16,130
They all had bibles and they would start
like yelling out different,

1692
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,040
uh,
different quotes from the Bible and they

1693
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:19,610
would,
uh,

1694
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,730
tell them to people in the front patio.
This is back before the front patio had

1695
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:24,950
a bar.
Remember the front patio was basically

1696
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:28,790
wasted space until the new
administration came along and when did

1697
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:32,630
they open up the bar at the front patio?
I don't know how many years ago before I

1698
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:36,130
came back,
but now it's a vibrant little foggy.

1699
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,610
It was always something,
man,

1700
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,593
he had it.

1701
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:41,720
Princess Corey had it,
but she opened the just so she could

1702
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:43,730
drink.
That's it.

1703
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:46,280
I mean she used to open.
She was walking away.

1704
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:47,920
People be like,
what is the bartender?

1705
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:49,740
You know,
it was never really.

1706
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,420
They,
it would sell like nine beers or

1707
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:55,060
something.
Now it's a fucking bar.

1708
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:57,050
Like you said.
Do you know they used to do shows.

1709
01:17:57,051 --> 01:18:01,010
There were on the back patio.
They had a standup show there.

1710
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,270
They would set up a mic out there when
they did it a couple of years ago

1711
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:08,270
apparently.
But the neighbors complained before we

1712
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:09,200
came back.
They,

1713
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,630
they were,
they would have like an open mic night.

1714
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:14,840
They would have a spill out show where
they would have an open mic night out

1715
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:17,090
there on the patio,
but apparently someone,

1716
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,000
people just yelling at God or something.
You know what I mean?

1717
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:21,250
The yelling,
the microphone.

1718
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,170
That's such a fucking,
you know,

1719
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,390
I was watching almost famous the other
day.

1720
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:29,260
You ever watch that movie?
Almost famous.

1721
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:32,240
I was whatever.
I was watching it and they got to the

1722
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,300
part when they were at the hotel next
door and they actually,

1723
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:38,690
you see them crossing the street in the
store.

1724
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,510
The lights are blinking at the store.
It's supposed to be 19,

1725
01:18:41,511 --> 01:18:43,640
69.
What are you gonna do with the store?

1726
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,150
Fucking put a board over it.
But that was the hotel like that was a

1727
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:50,270
hot hotel.
When the store went from Ciro's to the

1728
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:52,190
store,
was it closed down for awhile?

1729
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,850
I'm not sure
because the store is,

1730
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,800
was opening the seventies,
right?

1731
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:02,690
I want to say 74 or something.
Is that right?

1732
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,200
Seventy two.
Seventy four.

1733
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,760
Seventy two.
Seventy two.

1734
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,250
Seventy two.
So that.

1735
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:11,040
But what,
but Ciro's was in like the Bugsy Siegel

1736
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,990
days,
which was what wasn't that like the 19

1737
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,880
thirties or something?
No,

1738
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,520
twenties.
When was the Bugsy Siegel?

1739
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,440
Maybe the fifties.
Yeah,

1740
01:19:19,441 --> 01:19:21,030
it must be right.
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.

1741
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,540
Right.
It was sears as closed in 1957.

1742
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:29,220
And then it was a rock club,
rock and roll club in the 19 sixties.

1743
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,210
Wow.
What was that called?

1744
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:33,160
Uh,
just added another page.

1745
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,740
It's the best spot in Hollywood.
It doesn't say what it was called,

1746
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,920
but it was.
You were just saying that you were

1747
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:44,090
talking one day and you said that that
must be like a beam that shoots down to

1748
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:46,670
put all those people together at the
comedy store.

1749
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,160
Where if we look at that fucking almost
famous.

1750
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:51,080
I mean everybody stayed at that hotel
next door.

1751
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,110
That was a spot where you just checked
in when you weren't on tour.

1752
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,970
We're not on tour this year.
What do you want to do?

1753
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,760
Let's go to the riot house and get
fucked up for a week and a half.

1754
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,090
Yeah.
It's amazing how those two spots and

1755
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:04,310
next to each other like this.
So legendary.

1756
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,290
And then next to each other.
I'd like to get some sort of fucking

1757
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,100
native

1758
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,470
American medicine man to walk around
that place.

1759
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:15,530
Tell me what kind of spirits he senses.
Just 200 years.

1760
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,350
Two Hundred Years of comedy,
of uh,

1761
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,530
the of murders,
the Bugsy Siegel days,

1762
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:24,420
like how many people were whacked in
that spot?

1763
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,760
The rock days.
How many people?

1764
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:31,761
Probably odd of a rock club and the 19
sixties and seventies before it became

1765
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:34,800
the store.
How much craziness went on there and you

1766
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:38,610
believe February 19th.
On my birthday I'll be at the store 20

1767
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:40,350
fucking years.
Wow.

1768
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,810
That's crazy.
Twenty years.

1769
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:45,600
That place was in my life.
Like usually you hang out at the bar,

1770
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,000
your neighborhood go for like four
years.

1771
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:49,320
Then you graduate,
you're done.

1772
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:51,620
You know those bars that you all trickle
down a bug visa,

1773
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:54,960
whatever the fuck.
I've been going to the store for 20

1774
01:20:54,961 --> 01:20:57,880
years.
Second time I got on state,

1775
01:20:57,881 --> 01:21:00,570
somebody came up to me and said,
there's Mitzi shore seeing you yet.

1776
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,630
Like I was always destined for the
school.

1777
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,430
Like I knew it.
I knew it.

1778
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,700
Like I just know it.
And then the more I got into comedy,

1779
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:11,080
over the years people would say to me,
there's Mitzi scene he had.

1780
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,820
She likes characters or whatever.
But it's so weird.

1781
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:17,890
I had been there for 20 fucking years.
I.

1782
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,370
We were talking the other day about how
she used to call you fat baby.

1783
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,160
That was your name on the line.
I'm a fat baby.

1784
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,470
Oh,
it's my navy and she would stick a

1785
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:31,830
finger in my stomach and go,
still let the era.

1786
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:37,210
That's how cool.
Mr Joe always my fat babysit over here

1787
01:21:37,211 --> 01:21:38,170
next to me.
Fat Baby.

1788
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,500
Let me see your stomach.
Let me rub it.

1789
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,970
And then she would put the pin in it.
Twenty fucking years.

1790
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:47,610
I went home the other night.
I had scratched my head a few times,

1791
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,810
like 20 years.

1792
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,290
I've been doing this kind of a shift.
The 25 fucking years.

1793
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:57,650
First Time I got on stage that I fucking
think I'd be here 25 years later I think

1794
01:21:57,901 --> 01:21:59,550
I started don't,
I didn't think anything.

1795
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,790
I just thought a finally I'm going to be
able to do something with my life.

1796
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,250
Like that's all I wanted to do.
Just something with my life,

1797
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,970
you know,
talking to my buddy because ever since I

1798
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,620
shot the special,
been thinking about 90,

1799
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,110
19,
93 a lot.

1800
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:16,950
Like how well I was 1993.
It was living in New York City.

1801
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,800
Why 90?
Three specific.

1802
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,800
That's when I made my transition.
That's when I did comedy for two years.

1803
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:26,280
The way I went to Jujitsu for two years,
it was very erratic.

1804
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,370
I would go twice one week,
one week I wouldn't go.

1805
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:32,160
Then I go three times one week and then
I would go for two weeks.

1806
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:36,270
It was very erratic.
I didn't know how to really get my hands

1807
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:39,600
on it,
but in 1993 I went to the city.

1808
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:42,960
I was just.
I was broken from the divorce at nothing

1809
01:22:42,961 --> 01:22:43,980
going on.
I was broke.

1810
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:47,790
I went home and lived with a friend of
mine and just went around the city and

1811
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:52,080
did calm me and I had no,
I had no comprehension and what I was

1812
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:54,200
doing.
And then one night I walked into your

1813
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:58,320
old triple in.
Used to be like an open mic that started

1814
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:03,321
at 11 and went till two or 3:00 and I
went in there one night about.

1815
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:08,980
I just finished driving a limo and I
dropped the guy off in Manhattan and I

1816
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:10,600
go,
let me go get a spot over that,

1817
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,680
and I went over there and they said,
there's no spots tonight because

1818
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,620
Leguizamo is on stage and he was
working.

1819
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,210
One of those one man shows this place
was a fucking dive.

1820
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,660
Like every time I'd walk in there I
think about my comedy career.

1821
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,150
I got to figure something out because
I'm not going to keep doing this

1822
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,280
display.
Smelled like cigarette smoke.

1823
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,800
There were seven people in New Orleans.
You know what I'm saying?

1824
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,830
When you first started do Konami you're
waiting for the lights and

1825
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,360
the CBS to be there and shit.
CBS Ain't going to be here.

1826
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:42,490
Why do I keep coming back here?
And finally one night I went there,

1827
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:44,290
I saw like it was dominant one.
Then I go,

1828
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,980
I get it,
I get it.

1829
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,780
I thought it was too special.
I'd have to do that,

1830
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:50,614
you know?

1831
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,650
Sorry,
I officially.

1832
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:58,300
I'm one of those fucking things.
We got a piece of bone.

1833
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,470
Something you gotta you gotTa make me
cough.

1834
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,633
Sorry.
Okay.

1835
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,121
Yeah,
yeah,

1836
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,540
yeah.
A leg was almost onstage.

1837
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:10,330
It was a dive and it really.
I didn't know.

1838
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:13,420
I didn't know anything about comedy.
I had read the Judy Carter Book.

1839
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,860
I had read a couple books by that
fucking writer that when that real

1840
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,840
solutia ball,
three Belzer's book,

1841
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,440
who Richard Belzer know wrote a book on
stand up comedy.

1842
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,910
I read the book by Lenny Bruce.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1843
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:31,480
We live at the Chelsea hotel and he
fucking did heroin at night with jazz

1844
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:32,460
musicians.
Oh yeah.

1845
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,000
That's a great.
Put me over the top,

1846
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,790
but I taught standing up or something
that you became.

1847
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,430
I didn't know you had to work on it.
That's what I'm trying to say to you.

1848
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:43,180
I thought that when people went up on
stage shoot a special like Joe Rogan

1849
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:43,640
Shit.

1850
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,000
Tell Him we got cameras really?
Alright,

1851
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,220
cool.
Tell him to go on state.

1852
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,630
I thought when you shot a special,
you just went up and talked for 30

1853
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:52,150
minutes.
I didn't know there was any preparation.

1854
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:55,750
I didn't really have
anything to go by.

1855
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,540
I went in there and I understand the
process now.

1856
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,480
I think three,
not even like a month later I was back

1857
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:05,140
in Colorado and I was determined to get
onstage every night.

1858
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,080
This was what I was going to do.
This is what I'm going for,

1859
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:09,670
this is how I'm going to do it,
you know,

1860
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,090
these are the clubs I'm going to work.
I had no,

1861
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,780
no idea what the fuck was.
I would just go on stage loosely.

1862
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,520
I would write whatever I could and just
go on stage loosely.

1863
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:24,130
I never knew that you build from that.
I didn't know these things,

1864
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,010
so I keep thinking about 93.

1865
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:29,890
I lived in a fucking room with my buddy
who did heroin.

1866
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,980
I had one white shirt.
I would sell cars on 11th avenue down

1867
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:35,410
there,
you know,

1868
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,740
New York City.
I had one white shirt and I would wear

1869
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:41,410
the same shirt everyday.
I would have to come home,

1870
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,680
jump in the shower,
and I would wash my shirt in the shower

1871
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,070
and I would hang it up and then I would
iron it every fucking day.

1872
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,860
You know?
I was just a struggling open Miker,

1873
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,750
you know,
I was driving a limo some days,

1874
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:56,800
some days I would sell cars,
some days I would pass out packages for

1875
01:25:56,801 --> 01:26:01,150
att and t and get $400 a week.
I was just putting it together,

1876
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:01,990
man,
you know,

1877
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,040
and it was,
it just seemed

1878
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,630
so interesting.
Like I just,

1879
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,800
I didn't,
I had no illusions of grandeur bro.

1880
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,510
I just wanted to do something with my
life.

1881
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,760
There was no,
I wasn't going to be Kevin Hart or

1882
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:17,180
fucking bill cosby and nothing.
I just want to do something,

1883
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,180
you know.
So this is why I keep thinking about how

1884
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:23,390
fucking Tony,
three years later I shot a special and

1885
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,120
just,
it just goes back to what you did.

1886
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,110
You know,
I had one,

1887
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:29,570
I would have to,
I wouldn't have to be at work till 10

1888
01:26:29,571 --> 01:26:32,810
some days,
but I would take the 6:00 AM bus because

1889
01:26:32,811 --> 01:26:35,450
if I take the 6:00 AM bus,
my friend with the steroids,

1890
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,510
his father was a bus driver.
He let me right to the city for free.

1891
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:42,950
So I would take the 6:00 AM bus so I
could save those $3.

1892
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:47,540
That's how fucking poor I was.
And then to get home I would fucking go

1893
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:52,250
into service when I would sell cars and
we go into the service at 9:00 and I

1894
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:54,690
would still change when people's cards
until I got home.

1895
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:58,820
I would bring just enough money for
lunch between rent,

1896
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:03,560
child support,
close reefer cocaine and fucking.

1897
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:07,190
I wasn't even doing a lot of coke then
if my buddies and I will have to do it

1898
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:09,740
because I was just trying to do comedy,
you know?

1899
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:12,350
And you think about the beginning,
what you really went through,

1900
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,900
how you were,
you delivered papers,

1901
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,340
write papers or whatever and to see you
now.

1902
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:21,410
It's such a big difference.
But I never saw this.

1903
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:25,160
I never saw the tail end of this.
I just wanted to do something.

1904
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,090
You know?
Yeah.

1905
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,680
When you see someone that's already
doing comedy clubs and headlining places

1906
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,650
and you're just starting now,
it doesn't seem that far away.

1907
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:34,701
It's like,
oh,

1908
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:37,040
I need to do is just get an act together
and I can do what he's doing.

1909
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:41,930
How come I can't do it and you think you
can and then it takes years.

1910
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:44,870
Like somebody tried to tell me once that
it took 10 years for you to become a

1911
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:48,590
real headline or my dad's crazy
headliner in two years,

1912
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:50,300
get out of here,
but it really does.

1913
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,280
It really does because there's
something.

1914
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,900
Something happens 10 years in or maybe
you're smarter than me.

1915
01:27:56,901 --> 01:28:00,170
Maybe it'll only take you a couple.
But for me it was like 10 years and I

1916
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:02,220
get a better understanding what the fuck
I'm doing.

1917
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:02,631
I'm like,
Oh,

1918
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:05,120
I kinda get it now.
I kind of get it now,

1919
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:08,360
but you still don't see it the way you
would see it if it wasn't you.

1920
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:13,590
If you know as much as you know about
standup and you could watch yourself not

1921
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:16,370
be you,
you would be able to fix a lot of things

1922
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:19,310
with your act.
But a lot of the things with your act

1923
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:23,870
like you kind of shield yourself because
you're just trying to get it to work.

1924
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,700
Just trying to put it together,
you know,

1925
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,910
and a lot of times you're not even aware
of,

1926
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:30,680
uh,
how the joke is coming off to other

1927
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:34,340
people because you're doing it yourself.
You're too caught up in the idea of

1928
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:37,400
delivering it to understand what it's
like to receive it.

1929
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,880
And that takes a long fucking time to
figure it out.

1930
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,070
And still to this day,
I fuck it up to those day,

1931
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:47,480
especially when I'm working on new bits
because you got to take these weird

1932
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:51,550
chances with new bits.
You got to like start premises maybe

1933
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,210
that you don't know where they're going
and let,

1934
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,570
let it,
let it under pressure of stage sometimes

1935
01:28:56,571 --> 01:28:57,570
come out.
You know,

1936
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:00,080
especially when you're working out at
the store trying to come up with new

1937
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:03,180
stuff under the pressure of being
onstage.

1938
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,620
You can sort of like every now and then
pop an idea through every now and then a

1939
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:11,070
new tagline comes through that makes you
laugh and a new moment comes through.

1940
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:14,040
And if you don't invest in those moments
of doing those,

1941
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:16,530
those bits on stage,
you never fucking know.

1942
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:20,010
And if you don't take those chances,
if you just keep doing the same shit

1943
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:21,660
over and over again,
you don't take those chances,

1944
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:23,490
you don't.
You don't know whether or not you could

1945
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,670
go down those roads,
go ahead and become a headline until 18

1946
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:28,860
years.
That's when I felt comfortable.

1947
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:29,910
Headline.
That's crazy.

1948
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,390
I had 40 minutes to six years,
45 minutes.

1949
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,840
I love when guys look at you and go,
well,

1950
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,530
I got a bowel.
The big difference in being a fucking

1951
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:38,910
headline in my friend.
Okay.

1952
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,190
This weekend there's a great fight on
the card.

1953
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:46,840
It's surgery.
It's Pedis Pedis against Anthony Pettis

1954
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:47,550
Holloway.
Right?

1955
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,800
So you look at Max Holloway's in his
nine,

1956
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:52,110
zero fucking hits hard.
Heart of a lion,

1957
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:56,040
crazy pet has had something called
experience.

1958
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:59,640
He's been in there with Benson and he's
been in there with some big fucking

1959
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:00,360
names.

1960
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,810
He's been then championship fights when
the lights matter and shit like that.

1961
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,940
That's called experience.
That experience is so fucking crucial.

1962
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,870
That experience is so crucial at the
store.

1963
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:16,590
I am very proud to be a store comic
because of all those years of doing

1964
01:30:16,591 --> 01:30:18,620
those weights bites.
So you,

1965
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:22,980
I get myself out of any situation,
I get myself out of it and he situation.

1966
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,780
When you're a plumber,
when you're,

1967
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:26,520
uh,
when you're a Roofer,

1968
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,680
okay day,
your job is the same.

1969
01:30:28,681 --> 01:30:33,630
You're gonna fucking roof.
Why you're paying me 25 instead of 15 is

1970
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:35,840
because I know how to get around the
problems.

1971
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,360
When you come to me and go boss the
fucking pipe there.

1972
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:42,030
I got a flashlight and stop.
There's a piece of cake.

1973
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:45,560
I just build a box around you follow me.
It's the same thing with comedy.

1974
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:49,050
Like it.
I knew I could do an hour,

1975
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,420
but I always felt like that pennzoil
commercial.

1976
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,420
You could either pay me now or you can
pay me later.

1977
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:56,400
I love those motherfuckers to come out
here and go,

1978
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,653
bitch,
I been,

1979
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:01,200
I was a headline at four years.
I'm a regular at the store.

1980
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:03,570
You know what?
They're going to get it at the store one

1981
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,670
night.
They're going to get it,

1982
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,370
they're going to get it.
They're going to have to follow somebody

1983
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,360
who they're not ready for.
And it's not because they've only been

1984
01:31:12,361 --> 01:31:15,180
doing comedy six years.
It's going to hurt them a little more

1985
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:16,750
than it would hurt me.
And you talk.

1986
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,840
I know there's a 50 slash 50 shot
everyday.

1987
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,290
I write jokes.
I prepare them.

1988
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:24,030
I know I'm going to go up there and do
the best I can,

1989
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:28,950
but sometimes that don't pay that and
sometimes there's a girl in there before

1990
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:31,380
you attended a great night every other
night.

1991
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:36,150
She's bombed tonight.
She blows up that place and you got to

1992
01:31:36,151 --> 01:31:39,210
go up there and figure a way around it.
That's an experience.

1993
01:31:39,211 --> 01:31:41,760
Fucks you up.
That's when I could.

1994
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,710
You could blow up that room and I'll
tell you what,

1995
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:46,730
I may not be able to follow you,
but I'll get a few labs with.

1996
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:51,480
Ten years ago I wasn't getting anything
because I was caught up in the lights

1997
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:53,280
and let's keep it going for joe or more
time.

1998
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:58,320
It's really funny and not use that word,
but if you go up there and just run with

1999
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:00,850
that energy,
it's experience in my world.

2000
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,880
You know,
I didn't make any big decisions so I got

2001
01:32:03,881 --> 01:32:06,280
fucking.
I could feel the difference on state

2002
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,080
now.
Twenty five years.

2003
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:09,760
You could do anything.
You John Jacques Machado.

2004
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,800
You Ever See John Jack Rowe?
He talks to you.

2005
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,610
He talks to Joe and rolls with me,
Eh,

2006
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,643
not silly phone.

2007
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,673
God,
whatever.

2008
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:21,430
He doesn't even know because he's been
doing it for 20 years and I just saw a

2009
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,730
guy,
a guy did that.

2010
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:28,300
Marcello Garcia died,
then a seminar and he was for years.

2011
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:30,700
I just put myself in the half guard.
He goes,

2012
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:32,650
I could feel anything you got to do.
He goes,

2013
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:35,140
even when you're going to pop that leg
over to get away.

2014
01:32:35,141 --> 01:32:37,540
He goes,
I'll just catch you with this leg and

2015
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,650
put you now.
I got your neck.

2016
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:39,820
It's amazing.
I go,

2017
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:40,661
how'd you get that?
Good.

2018
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:43,810
He goes,
I put myself in half guard every fucking

2019
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:46,900
day for 10 years.
I know exactly what reaction you're

2020
01:32:46,901 --> 01:32:49,750
going to do.
It's called experience when you got.

2021
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:52,780
I never had the hard times.
I have had at the comedy store,

2022
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:59,140
when you're dying at a club and it's a
feature headliner Mc club,

2023
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,230
you have momentum to pick yourself back
up.

2024
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,950
So if I go over there and pick up die
for 10 minutes,

2025
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:10,120
I could get onto something and gradually
work them back at the store.

2026
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:13,630
You don't have that grace.
You have 15 fucking minutes and once you

2027
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:16,840
die at the store for seven minutes,
it's like the fucking Roman colosseum.

2028
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:19,930
You run them with.
That ain't no getting back into the

2029
01:33:19,931 --> 01:33:22,540
store to store.
I've never had a medium set up the

2030
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,270
store.
I either do great or I fucking die.

2031
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:29,900
I die most of the time.
But if you know what I'm saying here,

2032
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:31,840
I'm in the store.
There's no coming back.

2033
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:34,540
You don't have 20 minutes of work itself
out of the situation.

2034
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,340
They also know there's a bunch of people
coming.

2035
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:38,170
Next comes next.
Who's next?

2036
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,520
Who's next?
What else?

2037
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:40,580
We got to see,
you know,

2038
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,310
and sometimes you'll see someone that's
just there just on a normal night.

2039
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,820
Maybe their ideas would work,
but tonight it's not going to work

2040
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:51,850
because it's just been too many
different people on before them.

2041
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,430
And then it's just I've seen too much,
you know?

2042
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:57,910
Then that's one of those things where
those late night spots are so important.

2043
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:01,330
I wonder if that exists in music too.
I wonder if in music it helps the

2044
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:04,420
performers,
if they get occasionally a real small

2045
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:07,000
crowd,
they have to sing for a crowd of 15,

2046
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:08,410
20 people,
you know.

2047
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:11,620
I wonder if that lets you get in your
own head better,

2048
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:14,590
you know,
but we can point on lives,

2049
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,920
especially those first six years of the
comedy store,

2050
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,680
1245,
you've got to assume there's going to be

2051
01:34:20,681 --> 01:34:23,200
17 people in the audience if you're
lucky,

2052
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:27,010
if you're lucky and you have to say
something that they haven't heard.

2053
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:29,140
If they sat there all fucking night,
they've heard everything.

2054
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:33,730
They've heard everything topical and it
would force you to go out of your realm.

2055
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:35,530
I love it.
You know when we shot,

2056
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,720
we were telling them about specials,
shooting specials.

2057
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:42,430
When I shot the first show,
I died because I was too worried about

2058
01:34:42,431 --> 01:34:45,040
my material.
I really bought into Jerry Seinfeld.

2059
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:48,610
Then I remembered what the fuck I am the
second show,

2060
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,310
and you just now you get it back.
Yeah.

2061
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:54,040
There's so many different focuses is 25
years.

2062
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:56,490
You shoot a special and you still
fucking up come.

2063
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,010
Yeah,
a dog.

2064
01:34:58,011 --> 01:35:00,530
This is why I love this because I
learned something new every fucking day.

2065
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:02,150
It's definitely.
Well,

2066
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,390
as long as you have new subjects to talk
about,

2067
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:08,690
you're going to have new ideas,
so you're going to have new bits.

2068
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,900
So you're going to have work to do.
They're not going to be done.

2069
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,610
They're not done right away.

2070
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,950
You got to go over them.
You got to listen to recordings.

2071
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,530
So there's a lot lot going on.
It's,

2072
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:20,900
it's,
it's weird in that like if you go to see

2073
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:23,150
the rolling stones,
you want to hear it brown sugar,

2074
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,190
you know you,
you want to hear a sympathy for the

2075
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:26,840
devil.
If I go to see you,

2076
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:28,580
I want to hear some new shit.
Now.

2077
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,470
It's just the way it is for our
business,

2078
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:35,150
but it's also so exciting.
You know?

2079
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,460
I mean,
it's such a fun fucking thing to do.

2080
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:38,973
Well,
there's two.

2081
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:43,670
There's two trains of thought to this
that are really interesting because I

2082
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:47,120
did something this year that I knew I
couldn't pull off like there's no way,

2083
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,090
but for me,
I could only shoot a special every 18

2084
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,030
months.
My next special is no.

2085
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,010
Once I looked at the product and the
special,

2086
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,840
I knew that those jokes could have still
had six more months of work and you

2087
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:00,380
follow me.

2088
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,790
That's the problem.
We have to.

2089
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,650
There's a joke.
I closed it,

2090
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,980
but I've been doing it now for two years
just because people say,

2091
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:10,970
I came to seeing you and do that fucking
job and I've noticed how good that joke

2092
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:14,210
is become,
and every two weeks I had a tag for that

2093
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:16,760
joke even though it's still fucking old
when I do it.

2094
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:19,370
This is exactly what Tom Papa said on
Monday.

2095
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,220
Exact same thing.
It bothers me to no end.

2096
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:25,340
You know,
I put a CD out a couple years ago and I

2097
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:28,220
liked the bit I did,
but that bit was not finished.

2098
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:29,820
I didn't know at the time.
Right.

2099
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,460
I didn't know at the time.
Right.

2100
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,960
It's ready,
fuck no.

2101
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:35,600
I've added 10 minutes for that bit in
the last fucking year,

2102
01:36:35,601 --> 01:36:38,390
just because I liked it so much.
There's something in there.

2103
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,860
Yeah.
What the fuck did I do?

2104
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:40,790
I just let it go.

2105
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,190
So as a trainer thought that,
and I didn't know this.

2106
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,230
Listen me,
when I come to see you every year,

2107
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,390
I want you to have 30 minutes of
material.

2108
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:49,890
Something had to happen in your life.
Yeah.

2109
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:52,040
What you're telling me is you can make
that joke better.

2110
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,930
Run it by me.
Let's see what else you added.

2111
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,540
Let's see what else you added to it.
So.

2112
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,940
And that's what I'm going to continue to
do now.

2113
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,490
Those jokes that I had from the special
guests,

2114
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:04,760
what I'll put them away now,
but I'll bring them back in a year and

2115
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:08,060
how at different tags and even if every
time you do a long set,

2116
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:11,270
just bring one bit back down to six and
do it.

2117
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:12,920
They don't.
They're going to strengthen.

2118
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,080
Mm.
And one day you're going to be able to

2119
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:16,550
do three hours.
I don't,

2120
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:20,330
I don't fucking know,
but I'm just saying it's nice those bits

2121
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:21,164
and never done.

2122
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:23,740
That's a mistake I made on the first two
albums,

2123
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,700
those bits and never done,
but they're done sometimes.

2124
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:27,230
Right?
Sometimes you get to them when you're

2125
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:28,490
like,
I don't even want to do this anymore.

2126
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:29,413
Oh No,
you're.

2127
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,620
When you're done,
you're done.

2128
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:33,110
That's why I didn't call for responses.
We know that I'm building.

2129
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,680
I went to Portland last week.
I'm done.

2130
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,350
He just started to take some time off.
You need to recharge.

2131
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:39,760
Recharge.
Yeah.

2132
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,690
Right.
You need to do come on thing.

2133
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:46,070
You need to get a.
sometimes when you do too much county in

2134
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:48,410
a row,
you go to stuff.

2135
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,340
I want to deprogram myself,
you know,

2136
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,340
special.
I didn't want to keep saying I'm coming

2137
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,530
on the feet.
I didn't want to keep.

2138
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,480
I didn't want to keep doing the jute
that.

2139
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,350
So I stopped deprogram yourself.
You've got to break those bad habits to

2140
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:02,070
break that habit.

2141
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:04,350
The only way to break that habit,
just to forget about it.

2142
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,180
Right.
At least when it comes to comedy,

2143
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:08,490
you know,
I want to forget about it and I won't do

2144
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:11,640
it no more.
I had a lot of promotion that shit.

2145
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:14,160
This week I podcast you,
I had a ton of shit.

2146
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,770
It's Christmas.
I got to take it to the zoo at night for

2147
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:20,730
the fucking lights,
so I said this is a great week to do it,

2148
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,290
but I've learned a lot man from shooting
this that no specials ever done.

2149
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:28,470
That's why we want to hear if you go see
the stones,

2150
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:32,040
you might be disappointed sometimes
because sometimes the stones to play a

2151
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:34,950
song,
it doesn't sound like what you're used

2152
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:38,160
to listening to it because over the
years they added this fucking whole

2153
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:42,570
thing on the road to it,
which you'll never hear because you

2154
01:38:42,571 --> 01:38:43,520
didn't go,
you know?

2155
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,670
Yeah.
You definitely get hear that.

2156
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:46,670
Sometimes when people do live versions
or something,

2157
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:49,500
they put a whole new twist to it.
Like that band,

2158
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:50,334
honey,
honey,

2159
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,250
they do that all the time.
They'll do a song and it's like it's a

2160
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:55,830
different version of a song that I've
heard on their CD.

2161
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:01,470
I think going to see live bands is good
for us to excellent for us.

2162
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,330
First of all,
let's be honest.

2163
01:39:03,331 --> 01:39:05,670
You know when your dad was.
I was watching something.

2164
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:06,504
What was that?
Oh,

2165
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,110
I was watching a video of Johnny Cash.
It's A.

2166
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,300
Okay.
And I had to ask myself this question.

2167
01:39:12,301 --> 01:39:14,580
I go,
Joe does as a comedian.

2168
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:19,590
You're going to fucking tell me that a
little bit of Johnny cash isn't me.

2169
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,580
That's how I wanted it.
I wanted Johnny cash.

2170
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,060
I want a little bit of the allman
brothers that guarantee.

2171
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,730
I want you to know that this could get
dirty quick.

2172
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:30,790
Yeah,
we.

2173
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:33,450
This could be quick.
This can be zero to 100 quick and this

2174
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:36,840
motherfucker I want a little lennon skin
and in my comedy,

2175
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,810
that singer,
the way he looks at you and shit,

2176
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:44,340
it's just the sad.
A Spanish all my copy.

2177
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:49,420
Know my comedy has Julia serving in it.
My comedy has Richard Pryor.

2178
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:52,290
You've got lenny bruce in it.
Any bad.

2179
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:56,280
I liked the fucking thunder.
Have led Zepplin that done.

2180
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:58,980
There were lab you watch led Zepplin
from the garden.

2181
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:03,060
There's no fucking lights or explosions.
Were midgets running around?

2182
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:08,390
It's just for dirty white motherfuckers
and I liked the fucking lead sapling

2183
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:11,640
effect in my standup.
It all mixes in there,

2184
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,790
but Johnny cash is definitely my standup
for sure.

2185
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,570
Definitely that shit.
Definitely everything you've ever seen

2186
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:22,680
that's made you feel good.
Gets in absolutely absolute fucking.

2187
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,120
Everything.
Movies,

2188
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:27,600
everything.
How much do you know about Rodney

2189
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,433
Dangerfield?

2190
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:32,220
Half and half.
We're trying to figure out when what

2191
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,870
the.
There's a bunch of different stories of

2192
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:36,480
the no respect,
like when it changed it to no respect.

2193
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:40,230
Someone was telling me it was from a
fucking movie at a movie came out and

2194
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:41,910
then after that movie he just started
saying,

2195
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:44,850
no respect,
no respect,

2196
01:40:44,851 --> 01:40:47,460
no respect at all.
That guy was awesome.

2197
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,840
I'm so glad I got to meet him.
I got to meet him.

2198
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,140
Apparently he was still doing coke,
who's like seven years old,

2199
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:58,690
who's hanging out with this 40 year old
hot,

2200
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:03,160
broad,
having a great time,

2201
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:07,500
which I got a call to go to a fucking
audition one day and I go,

2202
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:09,940
what am I reading for Lego?
You're reading from the new Rodney

2203
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:14,380
movie.
I go down to the sunset right by the

2204
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,230
Tequila hut down before we hit the
comedy store.

2205
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,630
There's that little tequila at that
light there.

2206
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:23,860
[inaudible] 50 feet and I went in there
and I walked in the room and who's in

2207
01:41:23,861 --> 01:41:27,190
the room have Rodney dangerfield though?
This is the motherfuck.

2208
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:31,240
I weighed the ear for the see easy money
because in my world,

2209
01:41:31,241 --> 01:41:34,780
easy money is fucking tremendous.
I went to the.

2210
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,190
I went live.
I don't drink.

2211
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,530
You just said it yourself.
Joey,

2212
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:40,710
don't drink.
I took an eight pack of Budweiser neps

2213
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,630
to see fucking easy money.
Okay.

2214
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:48,220
Budweiser nip the smaller ones,
cracking the things and flicking it.

2215
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,380
I was having a good time,
but Rodney.

2216
01:41:50,381 --> 01:41:53,650
Okay.
I walked into this room and his Rodney

2217
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,390
Dangerfield,
I'm going to read for Rodney

2218
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:57,010
Dangerfield.
I get the things.

2219
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,990
I want you to sit here.
You know,

2220
01:41:58,991 --> 01:42:02,210
whatever.
I didn't overly au Jus the reason why he

2221
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:04,860
hasn't seen all that shit.
I just read Bro.

2222
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:05,703
And he goes,
listen,

2223
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:07,600
I really like your read the road.

2224
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:10,030
You're the role you read for is already
cast,

2225
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,100
but do me a favor.
Just show up.

2226
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,640
You didn't know that Joe.
So he goes,

2227
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:17,830
just show up.
He called the house.

2228
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,080
My wife answered.
She was dating me.

2229
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,730
She goes,
you know Rodney call day before,

2230
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:22,631
like,
what do you say?

2231
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:26,980
She goes to go to Hollywood studios
tomorrow at eight in the morning.

2232
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,920
I go to that.
I get the road.

2233
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,790
He didn't say,
I called my agent.

2234
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:33,490
My leg goes,
now he's going to find something for

2235
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,140
you.
Just show up.

2236
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,770
That's how much he dug me.
Seven days.

2237
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:42,820
I worked on this movie though.
It's the worst movie of all time.

2238
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:46,570
Only comedy central as it once a year.
Like at four in the morning.

2239
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:49,090
It's called back by midnight.
I play Joe.

2240
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:54,091
Joe backed by them were all in prison,
were all in prison.

2241
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:57,100
And uh,
we,

2242
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,300
we,
we,

2243
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:02,290
we figured out that we break out at
night and go steal the hardware store

2244
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:05,260
supplies and we fucking got lounges.

2245
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:10,560
Jacuzzis at the prison now everyday I
wouldn't have to go in and they sign up.

2246
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:11,051
They go,
no,

2247
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:14,500
you got to go see Rodney.
So I have to walk into Rodney's trailer.

2248
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:17,680
Knock on the door.
He danced with fucking the robot naked

2249
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:21,950
commodity sign and he got,
I see you tomorrow night.

2250
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,930
And that was my job seven fucking days,
Bro.

2251
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,900
He was old.
He couldn't remember his lines.

2252
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:32,800
They had to read them the lines off
camera and then he would say the lines

2253
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:36,270
over again.
But for me it meant the world man.

2254
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:38,140
That's Rodney Dangerfield,
man.

2255
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:40,540
That's huge.
Yeah.

2256
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:41,590
He's.
I mean,

2257
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:46,420
when you think about all time
influential figures with his Rodney

2258
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,370
dangerfield specials,
he introduced the world to some of the

2259
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:49,800
greatest of all time.
Great.

2260
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,100
Greatest.
And not a lot

2261
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,840
of people will ever do something like
that.

2262
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,150
Yeah.
A lot of comedians would never do.

2263
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,730
Have you ever heard some of the
backstories to the.

2264
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:00,780
To the HBO specials?
Yeah.

2265
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:01,371
No,
no.

2266
01:44:01,371 --> 01:44:03,990
To the Rodney.
Things like how he got into it with.

2267
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:07,370
He got into it with the.
What's his name?

2268
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:09,230
[inaudible] at dice wears leather
jackets.

2269
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:11,220
Barry Sobel.
You know,

2270
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,220
he stuck up for comics,
right?

2271
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,670
I could be.
I hate working at clubs where it's a

2272
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:18,440
comedy,
a comic on club,

2273
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,800
and they treat you like a dick.
You ain't some fucking do from Missouri.

2274
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:23,840
You're a comic.
How can you treat me like this?

2275
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,600
Like he really fought for comics.
You know,

2276
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:30,050
and there was one story where barry
sober wanting to wear a leather jacket,

2277
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,910
I kept arguing with him and he goes,
dog,

2278
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:33,440
you know,
dice West Eleventh,

2279
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,840
knock it the fuck off.
Go get a sweater.

2280
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,130
That would suck though if your battery.
So when you wear a leather jacket all

2281
01:44:43,131 --> 01:44:45,290
the time,
I think he ended up wearing the leather

2282
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:47,330
and the special.
I don't know if he did.

2283
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,710
Didn't he have like a members only
jacket made out of leather?

2284
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,700
Something something.

2285
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:54,560
Uh,
just just amazing when you're around

2286
01:44:54,561 --> 01:44:55,480
those people.
You know,

2287
01:44:55,481 --> 01:44:58,220
when that was around Rodney that week,
it was just fucking great though.

2288
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:01,100
Paul Rodriguez kept on doing an
impersonation of him.

2289
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,380
He goes,
go ahead and do another impersonation of

2290
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,390
the fight.
And you replaced it with George Lopez.

2291
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,000
Say Shit the rest of the week.

2292
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:13,480
Rodney wasn't fucking around.
He was still smoking dope.

2293
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:18,490
He was still smoking dope all day.
Walk around the set with a joint in his

2294
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:19,600
hand.
You gotTa love it.

2295
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:22,780
Wow.
Did you ever see when he was going on

2296
01:45:22,781 --> 01:45:25,330
stage with a bathrobe on?
No.

2297
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:31,400
He did a lot of shows where he was naked
with a bathrobe on and go on stage with

2298
01:45:32,731 --> 01:45:36,210
fucking slippers.
He would slide up to this stage,

2299
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:40,860
just fucking walk up to the microphone
and do his entire hour with a fucking

2300
01:45:40,861 --> 01:45:45,270
bathrobe on with nothing underneath.
I was working as a security guard at

2301
01:45:45,271 --> 01:45:47,640
great woods in Mansfield,
Massachusetts.

2302
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:50,280
Great Woods.
Like the concert place is an outside

2303
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:55,170
amphitheater and you know,
a covering of some part of the areas

2304
01:45:55,171 --> 01:45:57,300
covered in the back area is exposed as
the lawn.

2305
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,200
And Rodney played there,
you know,

2306
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,980
it's a big fucking place.
Like Bon Jovi played there.

2307
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:05,040
I saw bill cosby there.
I saw Kennison there.

2308
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:07,530
And uh,
Rodney,

2309
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,600
I didn't say a fucking man.
Bill cosby's.

2310
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:13,950
I wasn't paying attention to him.
He was there and I didn't watch like I

2311
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,300
saw him there.
He was there.

2312
01:46:15,301 --> 01:46:16,800
I barely paid attention.

2313
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,800
I just,
I wasn't into what he was like.

2314
01:46:19,801 --> 01:46:21,540
I thought of him as like a clean
comedian.

2315
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:24,150
That was 19,
you know,

2316
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:26,610
I was too crazy,
but I'm.

2317
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,820
Rodney was in the back and one of the
guys who works for us,

2318
01:46:29,821 --> 01:46:31,170
because dude,
he goes,

2319
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:33,500
Rodney's back there as dick and his
balls are hanging out,

2320
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:35,480
I guess fucking bag.
He doesn't give a shit.

2321
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:36,990
I don't give a fuck.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2322
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:40,710
I always got no pants on.
He's got nothing on and I saw him

2323
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:44,010
walking around with a bathrobe.
I've remember seen it like remember,

2324
01:46:44,011 --> 01:46:48,120
like looking down this hall towards the
back area where the backstages and I'm

2325
01:46:48,121 --> 01:46:50,070
seeing Rodney greenroom and he's

2326
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,130
walking around was bathrobe.
I'm like,

2327
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:56,430
that is fucking amazing.
He would go on stage.

2328
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,290
I remember him going onstage.
I remember him killing too.

2329
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:02,400
Yeah,
we loved him.

2330
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,590
He was an old man.
I didn't give a fuck.

2331
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,770
I'm not to interrupt you.
The other day I saw a thing on.

2332
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:11,820
Somebody posted this.
It was Frank Sinatra on the tonight show

2333
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,510
and Don rickles Kaimana.
Oh yeah,

2334
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:15,510
I did.
You torture him.

2335
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,920
Todd ruckle's is amazing.
You see,

2336
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,690
if you find johnny years from John,
first off,

2337
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:25,780
so not just so bad as tremendous.
Listen,

2338
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:27,690
man,
that dude.

2339
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:32,160
I watched those two things.
The Hbo bottom and I fell in love with

2340
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:33,720
them.
I don't care about all those behavior

2341
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:38,370
problems I watched that meant as a bad
mother fucker dog.

2342
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:42,120
What behavior problems did he have?
I don't know.

2343
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:45,510
Like he just fucking put up with this
gentle shit.

2344
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,380
Look at.
Watch this.

2345
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:47,910
Watch this show.
Really crank this up.

2346
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,970
Make this look good with his boots out
and shit.

2347
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,890
You got boots?
Look at him.

2348
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,840
Pull the audio from Youtube.

2349
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,580
Can they hear the audio?
No.

2350
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,780
The people can't.
Oh,

2351
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:05,580
give them a little audio.
The audio recording can do youtube

2352
01:48:05,581 --> 01:48:06,660
can't.
Why can't they?

2353
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,940
Johnny Carson.
This would definitely get pulled from

2354
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:10,740
youtube.
Alright folks.

2355
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:14,010
Unfortunately you're going to have to.
If you watch this on youtube,

2356
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:16,760
you'll have to listen to the audio
version of.

2357
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,870
It's called a.
what's the name of it?

2358
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,170
Johnny Carson show

2359
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:26,360
was this.
How old do you think Johnny was here?

2360
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:30,870
What's this chart?
Both of them got to be 60

2361
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:38,760
this face.
This is the animal

2362
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:47,360
he will ask
when he takes his hand,

2363
01:48:47,361 --> 01:48:51,000
the way it drops down on his knees,
he's kissing the king's hall.

2364
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:54,650
The Sinatra this know.
Maybe say he's got the wig.

2365
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:59,000
It's a light wig.
He never went to crazy with the wig.

2366
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:02,270
He never went full.
Burt Reynolds.

2367
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,310
There's no one here in this.
Unfortunately.

2368
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,890
They can't hear this on youtube right
now.

2369
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,970
What's that?
The audio recording here.

2370
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:17,340
Yeah,
but the people on Youtube that are

2371
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:19,380
watching and we'll watch in the future
can hear it.

2372
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:20,670
Right.
Let's not do that.

2373
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:23,670
It makes her.
Makes her goofy thing,

2374
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:27,000
but no one is watching these guys.
He's touring still,

2375
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:27,960
you know?
Yeah.

2376
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:28,910
He's 90.
He's young.

2377
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:32,480
Don rickles is down at the Canyon club
when it was soon.

2378
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:35,760
He's called the Canyon Club with a.
what's his face?

2379
01:49:35,761 --> 01:49:37,470
Regis.
Let's go.

2380
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:40,320
Yeah,
find out what the club?

2381
01:49:40,321 --> 01:49:42,920
Yes.
Regis and Don rickles a touring

2382
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:44,190
together.
They have a little act.

2383
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,590
Fuck yeah.
I'm going to that shit.

2384
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,183
Fuck.

2385
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,260
That is Kinda hope it doesn't pass
already.

2386
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:53,100
Goddammit.
Did it pass already?

2387
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:57,040
They have a billboard on the one on one.
If you're coming back from thousand

2388
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:59,140
oaks,
he could see it on the one on one that

2389
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:01,780
shows all the different people that had
ted nugent's there once a year.

2390
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,370
Every year around July.
Dance around stage.

2391
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:06,460
Yeah,
all the time.

2392
01:50:06,710 --> 01:50:09,010
But he's good.
He's good friends with him so he's not

2393
01:50:09,011 --> 01:50:12,370
the best place to do stand up because
they make people stand in the back.

2394
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,290
You know that people get seated in the
front,

2395
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:17,220
they stay in the back,
will show up tall people that have for

2396
01:50:17,221 --> 01:50:18,054
you last time.

2397
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,440
But that was the problem was it already
happened November 18th.

2398
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:25,110
Oh Shit.
But it was a.

2399
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,160
There was a lot of people there,
but I had a deal with them.

2400
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,770
I said,
I only want to sell tickets to the

2401
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:31,240
people that get to sit down.
I go,

2402
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:33,580
as soon as you run out of seed to
tickets,

2403
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,330
I go stop selling tickets.
And the guy kept filling the place like,

2404
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:37,781
oh,
what are you doing?

2405
01:50:37,781 --> 01:50:38,051
He goes,
well,

2406
01:50:38,051 --> 01:50:39,190
people are still buying tickets.
I go,

2407
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:41,110
well,
they'll stop selling them like you have

2408
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:43,210
a deal.
If the contract is you're not supposed

2409
01:50:43,211 --> 01:50:47,140
to have people standing up like I was
going to get less money so that people

2410
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:49,840
could have a seat like because it'd be
better and better.

2411
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:51,220
It's a lot better and he's like,
yeah,

2412
01:50:51,221 --> 01:50:52,600
but we're still selling tickets.
Like alright,

2413
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,820
we're done.
Jesus fucking Christ.

2414
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:58,300
Like you know what the contract is dude.
Like they just decided to smoosh

2415
01:50:58,301 --> 01:51:01,270
everybody in there.
It's just not as fun to stand around and

2416
01:51:01,271 --> 01:51:02,620
watch comedy.
I really didn't.

2417
01:51:02,621 --> 01:51:05,710
When I went to see doug once doug was
doing a lot of those bar shows,

2418
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:10,270
standing room shows and then went there
as much as I love Doug and it was like

2419
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:13,840
concrete someplace in Hollywood.
We were standing there in my fucking

2420
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:16,600
your legs start hurting like this is not
fun.

2421
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,420
I don't want to just stay in here.
I want to sit down.

2422
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,780
Like you don't enjoy it as much if
you're not sitting down when you start

2423
01:51:22,781 --> 01:51:24,100
talking.
Yes,

2424
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:27,550
and the conscious just goes away from
the standing by the 40 minute mark.

2425
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:29,410
It's like a light talk.
Yup.

2426
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:32,770
In the room and you can't blame them.
You could be throwing heat,

2427
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,390
but a couple of weeks ago at this thing
I got there and they had 200 people

2428
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:39,670
standing up to argue with the fucking
guy.

2429
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:42,430
Now I was nothing you can do.
I didn't even think about it and I could

2430
01:51:42,431 --> 01:51:45,820
feel him onstage and you can work
through a little bit,

2431
01:51:45,821 --> 01:51:49,450
but you feel at this stabbing man.
I remember when we used to do the House

2432
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,283
of Blues in Vegas.
Yeah.

2433
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:54,670
That whole back area was still with
people standing and talking and the two

2434
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:56,830
bars bars to the left and a bar to the
right.

2435
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,140
Chaos,
chaos.

2436
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,300
Just not a good place to do.
Stand up.

2437
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:06,250
It's not the environment,
but whatever.

2438
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:07,660
Businesses,
business,

2439
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:10,300
selling tickets.
I'll put them in the bathroom they want

2440
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:12,130
to listen to.
Yeah,

2441
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,070
I wouldn't do that either.
I don't like a lot of those music shows

2442
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:15,910
too.
You got to stand.

2443
01:52:15,911 --> 01:52:17,020
I'm going to be used later.
I'm like,

2444
01:52:17,021 --> 01:52:21,780
no wonder I got people throwing punches
and aerosmith one time because the

2445
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,290
fucking stand that man.
Yeah.

2446
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:26,740
You get tired of it after awhile.
Now I always dance around.

2447
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:29,950
You'll be okay now.
At music shows you sit down and then you

2448
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:31,880
stand up to you on your feet the whole
time.

2449
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,750
I don't know.
I've never been to those things,

2450
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:39,160
those music shows or just an excuse for
people to get fucking hammered.

2451
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:42,550
Go see a bunch of bands.
Wander around the desert or wherever the

2452
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:43,960
fuck they talking about.
Oh,

2453
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:44,430
go,
go,

2454
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:45,230
go.
Yeah,

2455
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:45,581
no,
no,

2456
01:52:45,581 --> 01:52:45,980
no.

2457
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,120
Just dust bowls and pick and fucking
dust out of your teeth and eyes and

2458
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:51,870
you've got to camp at three.
Then

2459
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:55,940
I think Ari camped didn't already do
that.

2460
01:52:55,941 --> 01:52:59,110
He went to Coachella and camp now.
Which one was coachella?

2461
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,980
This is the ones in California.
Okay.

2462
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:02,980
Yeah,
and then the south by southwest was,

2463
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:05,750
which is an Austin.
There's a bunch of these little music

2464
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:09,620
festivals now.
I guess it's fun if you go to them.

2465
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:10,750
I mean it's gotta be fun.
No,

2466
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,800
it's gotta be fun.
You get to see a bunch of different

2467
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:14,630
people.
You're outside of the few days.

2468
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:16,620
You also have to be into it,
you know,

2469
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:20,090
but like when people want to invite you
to those standup ones,

2470
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:22,070
do you ever go to stand up festivals?
Do you do those?

2471
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:24,170
I just did what you did with the Houston
one.

2472
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,630
How was that?
Great.

2473
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,980
Wasn't as is a fairly new one,
right?

2474
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:31,040
How long have they been doing this one?
I think two or three years.

2475
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:33,500
Man.
Houston used to be a hub.

2476
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:37,610
He used to be a hub.
Somebody could figure out how to open up

2477
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:40,370
that old laptop and river oaks and it's
still there.

2478
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:43,540
It's still there.
That's insane at this.

2479
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,200
Somebody said,
God damn it,

2480
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,280
I want to look.
They filled that.

2481
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:48,080
There's so much to tell.
That helium guy,

2482
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:51,440
that motherfucker would go down there
and scoop it up.

2483
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:55,490
That was the one of the best rooms ever
and nothing's there now?

2484
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,370
I don't think so.
I think that the one club had it for

2485
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:01,730
awhile.
One club was renting it out and then.

2486
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:04,730
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

2487
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:07,700
Yeah.
Didn't John Wesley and have something to

2488
01:54:07,701 --> 01:54:10,070
do with it for awhile?
One of those guys.

2489
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:13,490
All those guys,
but those guys aren't even around no

2490
01:54:13,491 --> 01:54:13,740
more.

2491
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,470
I'm like,
it's a whole new regime.

2492
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,240
Wow.
Those young guys have.

2493
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,220
They're running.
That festival was a great festival.

2494
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:21,240
Had some great names,
uh,

2495
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,790
that Tony Hinchcliffe at red.
I mean,

2496
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:26,050
we had a great time.
They have a scene was like their uh,

2497
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,290
uh,
Houston scene now.

2498
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:28,820
Yeah,
but they're all younger,

2499
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,670
younger,
like you see the new.

2500
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:36,740
I tell you where I went.
That's the Houston of 99.

2501
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:39,110
Want me to where it is now?
Portland,

2502
01:54:39,111 --> 01:54:40,430
Oregon.
Really?

2503
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,500
Portland,
Oregon is the new big.

2504
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:45,290
I mean comedy,
is that the whole.

2505
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:48,860
It's huge right now.
Comedy is huge right now.

2506
01:54:48,861 --> 01:54:51,800
You know,
these all these cities have one marquis

2507
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:55,940
room to little underground room and
those to 100 grand rooms are selling out

2508
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:59,600
to laugh factory.
Chicago sells out Brian Morton every

2509
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:04,160
Saturday it will feature x are at an all
time high,

2510
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:08,060
but Portland is at an all time fucking.

2511
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:09,650
Hi,
this is the fourth year in a row.

2512
01:55:09,651 --> 01:55:12,830
I've been there one or two with you
before that.

2513
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:17,480
It just keeps getting better and better.
And you hear who's collect that.

2514
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:19,910
I was there Thursday,
Friday,

2515
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:21,200
Saturday.
Amy was there.

2516
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:24,320
She sold that somewhere.
I'm fucking 12,000 seats.

2517
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:26,030
I don't know what you did on Thursday
night.

2518
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:29,720
That just proves it's out.
It's out in the back when you were in

2519
01:55:29,721 --> 01:55:33,260
Columbus a few months ago,
animal burris and the lead were in town.

2520
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:36,950
I mean this is every week and all three
shows were selling,

2521
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:38,390
you know,
2000 seats.

2522
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:42,940
Comedy is at an all time high,
but Portland is the Houston have to.

2523
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:46,860
You could see it.
You could see when people talk to you

2524
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:49,200
afterward who they,
they come and they talked to you about

2525
01:55:49,201 --> 01:55:50,490
commonly.
Like,

2526
01:55:50,491 --> 01:55:53,580
I'm coming here to see Segora.
I'm coming here to see this guy.

2527
01:55:53,581 --> 01:55:56,820
I'm coming here to see that guy coming
for fucking comedy,

2528
01:55:56,821 --> 01:55:57,654
man.

2529
01:55:58,050 --> 01:55:59,970
Yeah.
They're smart place.

2530
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,070
Portland's a smart place and that they
appreciate art St.

2531
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:06,300
same with Seattle.
Seattle's a very smart place.

2532
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:11,400
Saddles a notch above La and a lot of
ways like when it comes to like,

2533
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:13,650
um,
smaller community,

2534
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:18,630
it's the people a little slicker.
They're just not show Biz effected,

2535
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:20,130
you know,
the more themselves.

2536
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:21,750
I shouldn't say slicker,
I should say,

2537
01:56:21,751 --> 01:56:23,100
just smoother.
You know what I mean?

2538
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:27,660
They're like more themselves,
like they're not as affected overall.

2539
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:30,480
There'll be a great place if they
developed a big scene.

2540
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:33,510
I know they got the comedy underground
there and that other places.

2541
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:34,800
Fantastic.
Paula,

2542
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,450
that's amazing.
That same pool halls,

2543
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:41,760
they'll pull all connected to it.
Really got some other room satellites

2544
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:44,340
around,
but I mean that's everywhere now from

2545
01:56:44,341 --> 01:56:48,520
Indianapolis to everywhere.
It got some satellite rooms going on

2546
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:49,650
comedies.
Big Man.

2547
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,270
Yeah.
Comedy is getting big.

2548
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:53,700
I mean,
helium does a secret show.

2549
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,690
What's the secret show?
They don't know who the headliners.

2550
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:59,040
Rarely and they sell out.
No Shit.

2551
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:00,093
No,
no.

2552
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:02,580
Philadelphia in Portland,
Oregon.

2553
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,310
Wednesday night you want to do is just
call the guy and go,

2554
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:07,440
I want the secret show.
I want to work out in front of a real.

2555
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:08,610
Well,
I don't know.

2556
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:11,350
She's going to get Joe Rogan people and
yet people not job.

2557
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:13,320
Wow.
Sell out.

2558
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,520
We don't even know who the headliner is
and they know me to do a club.

2559
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:20,450
We just know it's going to be one of the
guys who's here during the week.

2560
01:57:20,451 --> 01:57:22,310
I already did it.
He sold that.

2561
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:24,360
Didn't know what was interesting.
Very.

2562
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:27,270
That's a great concept.
That's a minor risk.

2563
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,820
That's great.
It's going to be one of these 20 cats.

2564
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:34,290
You don't know who it's going to be.
Strap a pair on just for the show.

2565
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:38,370
Yeah.
Instead of red band secret show,

2566
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,430
here's the secret Chelan and put 30
people on the poster.

2567
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:45,090
Like what's the secret pitch?
I'm looking at all the fucking people

2568
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,950
plus surprise guest.
Uh,

2569
01:57:46,951 --> 01:57:48,810
okay.
That's your secret.

2570
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:52,210
The secret with him is you don't know.
You don't know who the MC is.

2571
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:55,530
That's a real feature or the headline.
Nobody knows.

2572
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:57,930
He just comes up on stage Wednesday
night.

2573
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,160
Wow.
Good,

2574
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,450
good.
I did well when you asked,

2575
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,300
when you have a real reputation,
that's when you're telling me that

2576
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,430
you're just a fan of comedy.
You know what?

2577
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:07,440
I just want to fucking laugh at you.
You're telling me,

2578
01:58:07,441 --> 01:58:08,880
you know,
and I don't really like him.

2579
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:10,470
I like him.
I didn't really like him.

2580
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:15,420
It's also like a real good example of
the reputation of the club.

2581
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:19,020
Like they trust the club so much.
The club as so many headlines connected

2582
01:58:19,021 --> 01:58:21,780
to it,
like real top level headliners that they

2583
01:58:21,781 --> 01:58:24,240
know that you're in touch with these
people all the time and you'll put the

2584
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:26,430
right kind of person in that and they do
it every week,

2585
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:28,470
once a month,
once a month.

2586
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:31,320
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

2587
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:32,880
Portland,
Seattle,

2588
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,520
all those Pacific northwest people.
It's like,

2589
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:37,620
it's a,
it's a different vibe up there,

2590
01:58:37,621 --> 01:58:39,300
you know,
that whole,

2591
01:58:39,301 --> 01:58:41,540
uh,
Pacific vibe.

2592
01:58:41,541 --> 01:58:45,040
It's just a different vibe.
I only seeing the sun for two hours.

2593
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,300
Yeah,
three days.

2594
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:47,980
The summertime though,
they're out.

2595
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,910
They're out.
They're out.

2596
01:58:48,911 --> 01:58:49,820
Know that.
See the summer,

2597
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,200
it's tough to sell a ticket up there
because those motherfuckers got to go

2598
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:53,961
camping.
Yeah,

2599
01:58:53,961 --> 01:58:54,570
I got it.
They got,

2600
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:55,880
they're out there.
I'll do a music.

2601
01:58:55,881 --> 01:58:59,890
They had been,
they had been living in like fucking a

2602
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:01,510
Jack Nicholson in the shining fucking
six months.

2603
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:04,970
It rains every goddamn day.
I remember Joe saying,

2604
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,050
Hey,
what'd you think about Seattle?

2605
01:59:06,051 --> 01:59:06,884
So yeah,
that was great.

2606
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:10,630
She was great.
Like Colorado's great until you see

2607
01:59:10,631 --> 01:59:13,560
waiting for three weeks in a row.
Colorado doesn't have that problem

2608
01:59:13,561 --> 01:59:14,350
though.
Whites,

2609
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:19,020
one time it did really in 83 fucking
Paul Harvey was in the middle of

2610
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:19,900
November,
yelling,

2611
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,540
we don't know what's going to happen in
Colorado this year.

2612
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:24,030
A Paul Harvey,
the weather guy,

2613
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:27,700
radio guy.
He was just talking about the apps in

2614
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:30,200
Colorado on all these mountains in
Colorado.

2615
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:32,500
Empty.
We'll let be a snow season bitch.

2616
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:38,320
It started snowing on the 20th and it
went straight to the December 23rd.

2617
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,480
Well,
you know what?

2618
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,090
Twenty days in a row and snow is bro.
No,

2619
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,550
you have no idea.
Think of leaving for work on a bus.

2620
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:47,170
It's snowing.
Getting out.

2621
01:59:47,171 --> 01:59:48,370
It's six.
It's snowing.

2622
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,110
Going home.
It's snowing.

2623
01:59:50,111 --> 01:59:51,250
Going to bed.
You wake up.

2624
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:53,830
It's still snowing.
Two days is cool.

2625
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:57,620
Twenty days,
20 days.

2626
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,190
Snowing,
shovelling every.

2627
01:59:59,210 --> 02:00:02,190
I was shoveling the snow too for awhile,
so I'd have to get up and down.

2628
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:04,140
I was getting 10,
12 bucks an hour to shower.

2629
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:07,240
I didn't give a fuck how deep it again.
Eight inches.

2630
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:09,820
12 inches a day.
You know how fast the snow comes down in

2631
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:11,440
Colorado doors or eight feet?

2632
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:13,443
They probably.
Yeah,

2633
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:16,110
they had.
It's like you either pay me now pay me

2634
02:00:16,111 --> 02:00:19,780
that I don't know what the basis for the
fucking bottom of the hill,

2635
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:23,740
but they got the snow they needed that
year because they man make the hill.

2636
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:26,980
The snow on the bottom right there.
That helps out.

2637
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:29,920
They man make the snow on the bottom I
think.

2638
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,500
Okay,
whatever.

2639
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:34,810
Whatever that fake snow but snow,
they just make it with the machine.

2640
02:00:34,811 --> 02:00:37,930
They just make it with the machine.
Then on top fills in those gaps,

2641
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:40,760
but the bottom gives it more of a base.
That's what it's called.

2642
02:00:40,761 --> 02:00:44,170
The base that's so they'll tell you we
got a 63 inch base.

2643
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:47,260
We have a $200 base.
That means you could jump off a fucking

2644
02:00:47,261 --> 02:00:50,020
helicopter and nothing's going to happen
to you in that base.

2645
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,450
Two of them,
it just used to going to land in powder

2646
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,150
puff.

2647
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:56,470
You imagine doing that,
going to my arm and get in the

2648
02:00:56,471 --> 02:00:59,860
helicopter and just jumping off the
helicopter with skis and just landing on

2649
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:04,060
that fucking thing
without your knee blowing the fuck up.

2650
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:06,550
Yeah.
I saw a guy who did that video.

2651
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:11,551
He jumped like 250 feet and went up,
fucking landed in the powder and nothing

2652
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:12,730
happened.
No nothing.

2653
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,730
It's fine.
Fresh Virgin fucking powder.

2654
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:19,870
You couldn't take a big chance though.
You got to know exactly what's under

2655
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:21,300
that spot.
Can you imagine landing?

2656
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:23,210
That's a fucking Ayesha.
When they call.

2657
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,530
Oh my God.
My big icicle goes up.

2658
02:01:26,531 --> 02:01:31,531
Your asshole
or hit a rock on the way down.

2659
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:33,150
Ink.
Yeah.

2660
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:33,993
No,
I like,

2661
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:37,410
I like bad weather but not three weeks
and I fucking in Seattle.

2662
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:39,140
I.
So I lived there in [inaudible] 95,

2663
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:41,030
96.
They get parts.

2664
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,700
November dog.
It just rains for three weeks.

2665
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:45,620
Are you worried about global warming in
la?

2666
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:47,570
Oh yeah.
I can't sleep at night.

2667
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:52,790
Fuck global warming.
It's fucking 44 degrees this morning.

2668
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:54,250
I can't.
I'm magical.

2669
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:56,120
Yeah,
it's called in La this morning.

2670
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:57,260
Forty four.
But then it goes up.

2671
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:58,910
Uh,
you know,

2672
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,910
if they talked a lot about global
warming.

2673
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:05,210
Let me get that half a joint dog over
there because this shit fucking turned

2674
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:06,500
that on me.
Give me one of those fucking.

2675
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,500
You're a freshman now.

2676
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,400
Do
all your buddies got?

2677
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:17,990
Yeah,
he gave these fucking strong.

2678
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:21,520
He's an animal.
He's a fucking animal play games.

2679
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:24,170
What were you struggling with when you
were talking about yesterday?

2680
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,550
So it's legal now.
$100.

2681
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:27,910
I could call him up right now.
It's legal.

2682
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,750
Yeah.
I don't know where he's allowed to

2683
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:32,360
deliver it to.
I think he has to deliver it to somebody

2684
02:02:32,361 --> 02:02:35,630
that's nowhere near a church or a school
or something like that.

2685
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:39,940
He's got the stars or two stars at that
height.

2686
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:42,230
Times.
Picking the number three fucking edible.

2687
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,870
Dude.
I never even need a full point for the

2688
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,910
star of death.
I don't even have full point.

2689
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:49,550
I leave a little bit.
They take a little bit.

2690
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:51,710
I take a bite,
but I make sure I leave a little bit of

2691
02:02:51,711 --> 02:02:52,700
the point.
Listen to me.

2692
02:02:52,701 --> 02:02:56,090
There's these new things called cushy
200 milligrams.

2693
02:02:56,570 --> 02:03:00,380
You open it up.
It smells like transmission fluid when

2694
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:02,210
you.
It's like when you fucking finger

2695
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:04,250
somebody but you smelled deepened the
monkey.

2696
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:06,530
It smells like gunpowder and the pussy
St.

2697
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:13,010
it smells like transmission fluid in
this fucking motherfucker go.

2698
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:16,670
You get so fucked up.
I love that.

2699
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:18,050
Shit.
I just pass out now,

2700
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:21,410
when I was in Colorado I got some gum,
drops,

2701
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:24,260
some,
a pot gumdrops God,

2702
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:26,420
they were so good.
Holy Shit.

2703
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:27,680
I don't know how many milligrams.
Yeah,

2704
02:03:27,681 --> 02:03:31,100
but each one felt like somewhere around
20.

2705
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:34,520
You know,
he had a couple of those and they give

2706
02:03:34,521 --> 02:03:38,660
you a bag that's supposed to be 100
milligrams for how many is in there?

2707
02:03:38,661 --> 02:03:40,400
Five and their attending or whatever it
is.

2708
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:45,320
But it's got a kick.
It's hard to tell if they're right

2709
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:47,150
because I had one and I was like,
yeah,

2710
02:03:47,151 --> 02:03:50,060
this feels like about 10 milligrams now.
Another one that was like,

2711
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:52,970
Whoa,
what the fuck?

2712
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,490
Like I don't buy that.
Have that consistent.

2713
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:57,680
I don't think they're doing such a good
job at stirring,

2714
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:59,420
you know the stars.

2715
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:03,950
Last week I was fucking drooling.
I called the guy and go and see what the

2716
02:04:03,951 --> 02:04:07,430
fuck bro.
What was in these stores this week?

2717
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:08,160
And he goes,
well I'm.

2718
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:10,070
Sometimes you got a batch is stronger
than the other.

2719
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:10,850
It's like,
wait luge,

2720
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:12,950
when I was a kid with Qualia,
because people make them in that

2721
02:04:12,951 --> 02:04:15,770
basement.
So something like we talked about

2722
02:04:15,771 --> 02:04:19,370
sometimes to the table is like this,
you know what I'm saying?

2723
02:04:19,371 --> 02:04:21,380
All this shit goes to the bottom and
your fuck.

2724
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:24,400
Yeah.
And if you get a bag of gummies,

2725
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:27,890
you're not necessarily getting them from
the same plant.

2726
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:29,270
You know what I mean?
One,

2727
02:04:29,271 --> 02:04:32,960
one gummy might be from one batch and
another gummy might be for another

2728
02:04:32,961 --> 02:04:35,660
batch.
Like it might not mean they're all

2729
02:04:35,661 --> 02:04:38,430
getting piled up together.
Scooped and put into a bag.

2730
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,960
You easily could have one live one in
their dog.

2731
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:44,410
Had an old article about a month ago I
found the back of my drawer that they

2732
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:45,353
fucked me up.

2733
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:49,030
Well that's like an expired vicodin.
You ever taken an expired?

2734
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:51,700
You won't have paid for a weekend of
mouth.

2735
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:54,040
I don't care how many root canals they
give you.

2736
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:57,150
Time expired biking my pants,
my wife's,

2737
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,420
my wife.
And watch that tell you about that.

2738
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:02,050
A lot of the surgery,
surgery,

2739
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:05,690
I pop that motherfucking after it was
washing detergent.

2740
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:11,070
Stronger than ever.
I just found it.

2741
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:16,810
I found it took one hour with me in case
I had tooth pain or no pain.

2742
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:20,010
And I never wore those pants again.
I go to Portland,

2743
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:23,410
I go on the pants and that her,
she watched it right before I went

2744
02:05:23,411 --> 02:05:25,360
onstage.
I pop that motherfucking

2745
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:29,600
who gives a fuck?
I don't need to know anymore.

2746
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:33,480
I've been through everything.
I do nothing.

2747
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:37,310
How strong was it?
Oh my God.

2748
02:05:37,311 --> 02:05:39,470
I picked a half on stage and I blacked
out

2749
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,890
like the first 30 minutes.
I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel

2750
02:05:42,891 --> 02:05:43,730
room seat.
The other

2751
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:47,110
radio next day.

2752
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,080
Oh my God.
Black the fuck.

2753
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:52,540
I didn't know what came out of my mouth.
When you on radio,

2754
02:05:52,541 --> 02:05:53,850
you just start swearing.
No,

2755
02:05:53,851 --> 02:05:54,130
no,
no,

2756
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:56,400
no.
I'm headed to Portland Thursday night.

2757
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:58,950
I'm in Portland.
I'm getting dressed.

2758
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,940
When I was pulling pants,
these pants are darker than my usual

2759
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:04,410
jeans.
I never wore.

2760
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:08,100
I didn't want.
Well last time I wore them was probably

2761
02:06:08,101 --> 02:06:11,490
when I had the surgery and that's why I
found the pill in that it would clean.

2762
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:15,690
I went into the detergent,
had won the numbers down.

2763
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,730
She could have been anything.
So I just,

2764
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:20,190
I slept me not be an answer.
I'll eat the whole thing.

2765
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:23,340
People give me crazy shit all the time.
Let me break this.

2766
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,710
Maybe somebody gave it to me and I
watched over it.

2767
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:28,070
I knew it was like a viking cousin for
the Vicodin,

2768
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:28,913
you know what I'm saying?

2769
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:31,250
They had to be a cousin or a brother in
law,

2770
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:33,930
something if I could.
If I popped in.

2771
02:06:33,931 --> 02:06:37,860
I took a half and went to Portland.
I walked up those stairs and when I sat

2772
02:06:37,861 --> 02:06:39,840
down on top of it then I was like,
I'm fucked up.

2773
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,060
I smoked dogs,
but I tell you,

2774
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:44,760
I set the fire alarm off and put the
glove on.

2775
02:06:44,761 --> 02:06:47,820
Friday night,
the fight in the dressing room and the

2776
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:50,640
fire department had to come because the
whole club blacks out,

2777
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:56,180
all the lights go out and the.
I had to go onstage and fucking Felicia

2778
02:06:57,241 --> 02:06:58,520
what up with me?
He's just like,

2779
02:06:58,590 --> 02:06:59,860
do you want me to call up there and
check it out?

2780
02:06:59,861 --> 02:07:00,694
Like,
Oh yeah,

2781
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,940
that's how much of a comedy store chick
she is.

2782
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:05,080
Like somebody else has said,
well,

2783
02:07:05,081 --> 02:07:06,570
well let's wait till they put the mic
on.

2784
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:07,590
She's comedy store.

2785
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,020
She looked at me and said,
do you want me to still go up?

2786
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:10,681
And I go,
fuck.

2787
02:07:10,681 --> 02:07:13,030
Yeah,
and when she got up to the mic turned

2788
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,040
on.
Oh,

2789
02:07:14,041 --> 02:07:15,720
that's perfect.
Perfect.

2790
02:07:15,721 --> 02:07:18,720
But that just goes to show you the
confidence of the comedy store.

2791
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,570
Did you tell them that you did that?
Did you set it off?

2792
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:22,470
No,
the Co,

2793
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:24,150
the MC was onstage.
And what I'm saying,

2794
02:07:24,151 --> 02:07:26,220
he hit bad pain,
pain,

2795
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:27,510
pain,
pain,

2796
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,750
and the lights are blinking.
And when you went up there,

2797
02:07:30,751 --> 02:07:34,420
he didn't say that was me smoking.
Once I got took two hits,

2798
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:35,980
I tell them the truth.
I just took two

2799
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,810
fucking heads.
Wow.

2800
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:41,650
That's a pretty fucking sensitive.
Fire alarm was right over me.

2801
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,230
It was right there.
I looked at it afterwards.

2802
02:07:44,231 --> 02:07:45,820
So the next night they put a little
helmet on it.

2803
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:49,270
Did they discover oh fuck yeah.
They put a little heart without that

2804
02:07:49,271 --> 02:07:50,710
motherfucker.
Hilarious.

2805
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:53,620
So it's drastic.
It's just a drastic,

2806
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,530
drastic system.
Right.

2807
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:59,140
Shut the power off and everything.
How about I keep the lights on?

2808
02:07:59,141 --> 02:08:03,010
What do you think when stampede the fire
department came?

2809
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:05,560
Looks at the manager and he goes,
somebody smoking in the green room.

2810
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:06,071
He goes,
yeah,

2811
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:07,880
he goes out it,
we'll set it up and that was it.

2812
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,580
They didn't give me a ticket or not.
And thank God.

2813
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:10,900
That's nice.
Yeah.

2814
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,270
A lot of people probably think they can,
you know,

2815
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:17,080
like especially if you're at a,
uh,

2816
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:20,950
like any sort of a rock venue like those
rock theaters and stuff like that.

2817
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:23,800
How many people have probably been
smoking in those things forever?

2818
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:25,020
Forever.
Forever.

2819
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:26,320
Fuck.
It's probably standard.

2820
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:32,950
Portland is an interesting place and the
people who live there say it's getting

2821
02:08:32,951 --> 02:08:35,620
kind of weird because then you're
getting a bunch of people that want to

2822
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:38,020
live in Portland moving there instead of
Portland people.

2823
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:39,010
People are like,
yeah,

2824
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:42,320
I think Portland's kind of my kind of
see cameron lives in Eugene Moreau.

2825
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:43,990
Yeah.
Somewhere in Oregon,

2826
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:44,600
right?
Yeah.

2827
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,090
Because one of his neighbors came to the
show.

2828
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:47,090
Oh really?
Yeah,

2829
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:48,880
they came to the show.
He lives in Eugene,

2830
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:52,240
which is like a smaller college town.
Have you been there to visit?

2831
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,710
You like it?
Eugene's great.

2832
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:56,230
I like it.
I like that with good Chinese restaurant

2833
02:08:56,231 --> 02:08:57,100
there.
Quaaludes.

2834
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:02,340
I really kind of loons is in Eugene and
Roseburg at Roseburg is the one where

2835
02:09:03,190 --> 02:09:05,190
that's the fucked up one.
That's the one where the.

2836
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:07,750
They have a strip club,
but the waitresses,

2837
02:09:07,751 --> 02:09:10,240
everything.
She used to strip with the DJ.

2838
02:09:10,241 --> 02:09:11,074
That grown.
Man,

2839
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:16,950
you got to see this fucking beauty,
but are we getting this fucking fun man?

2840
02:09:16,990 --> 02:09:18,580
Oh,
that's a great drive to.

2841
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,130
I wonder what cow means.
I don't know.

2842
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:23,380
What it means is a challenge.
There's a bunch of different

2843
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:24,740
restaurants.
There was a balloon.

2844
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,990
Saugus,
Massachusetts.

2845
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:27,400
Remember that?
Chinese restaurant club?

2846
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:28,303
Yeah.
Yeah.

2847
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:33,190
Was Nick's comedy stop at the Calhoun?
I wonder what that means.

2848
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:37,360
It goes to city.
A city.

2849
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:38,530
Oh,
okay.

2850
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:41,080
Like New York,
like it's like saying Hollywood.

2851
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:44,140
Is it like saying like the Hollywood
restaurant,

2852
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:46,420
the Hollywood grill,
the Hollywood diner.

2853
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:48,070
That's a funny thing,
right?

2854
02:09:48,071 --> 02:09:50,320
That word Hollywood.
Like people like to use that word.

2855
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:52,960
It's the northern part of Hong Kong.
Oh,

2856
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:53,794
no,
shit.

2857
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:56,480
They ain't go
to.

2858
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,510
Maybe it's like a style of cooking or
something,

2859
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,420
but yeah,
that was the cow loon and Sagas.

2860
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,450
Great Place.
Great Comedy Club.

2861
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:09,520
How Far Sagas from the city?
I don't remember whether it couldn't

2862
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:12,190
have been too long.
Were there a couple and it was run by

2863
02:10:12,191 --> 02:10:14,290
Lenny's brother.
There was.

2864
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,380
No,
that was giggles lady brother,

2865
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:21,520
brother Mike Clark ran a place called
giggles and uh,

2866
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:26,200
that Guy Mike Clark gave me more
headline and gigs,

2867
02:10:26,201 --> 02:10:28,270
like when I was struggling than probably
anybody.

2868
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:33,770
He had always had great rooms.
Always had a restaurant here or dive

2869
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:37,070
there,
a bar there and always got you good

2870
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:38,480
money.
It was cool.

2871
02:10:38,481 --> 02:10:41,810
It was fun too because you,
you travel around all these weird spots.

2872
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:45,440
Do Comedy and sometimes people would
hire comedians and it wouldn't work out.

2873
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:49,250
They would try it for one show and you'd
be on that one show and then they never

2874
02:10:49,251 --> 02:10:52,010
had comedy again.
It was such a dirty comedians from

2875
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:56,330
Boston come up in some weird fish
restaurant in New Hampshire and they

2876
02:10:56,331 --> 02:11:00,860
just don't want to just don't like it.
How many of those did we do?

2877
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,450
Thousands.
Thousands.

2878
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,553
Had to.

2879
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:06,620
I used to do comedy in a place where it
was alive.

2880
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:09,210
Parrot behind John Stayed Two,
three feet.

2881
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:13,650
He would eat the seeds and fucking flick
them up.

2882
02:11:13,651 --> 02:11:16,560
In the end.
There's so many things that you've done

2883
02:11:16,561 --> 02:11:20,400
that you were talking about comedy.
You have this grand illusion of comedy

2884
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:24,210
when you get into it and you get to this
place and it's not a stage.

2885
02:11:24,211 --> 02:11:28,050
There's no green room guy talks to you
like you're shit.

2886
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:29,550
You're like,
why do I do this?

2887
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:33,540
You know,
my 12 and I got to go to work at six.

2888
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:37,780
So fucking tough.
But it's not a,

2889
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:39,750
it's not really a,
you know,

2890
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:44,910
it also doesn't seem that hard when you
look at it from the outside the first

2891
02:11:44,911 --> 02:11:46,590
time you look at it,
like that's not that hard.

2892
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:49,410
It's just people talking like,
I'll figure that out.

2893
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:51,483
Yeah,

2894
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:58,910
until you bomb 800 fucking times.
But that's part of it.

2895
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:01,940
Like now sometimes I get happy when I
bombed because I get it out of the what?

2896
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:04,370
Yeah.
At least it's not a fucking surprise

2897
02:12:04,371 --> 02:12:05,204
anymore.

2898
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:11,750
Yeah.
That's the best motivator to like

2899
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:15,160
tighten up your game.
The best motivators are shitty.

2900
02:12:15,161 --> 02:12:19,360
Said.
It's nothing like one offset just feels.

2901
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,710
Just wanting to get back and tighten
things down.

2902
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:26,290
It's interesting to people that go to
the store on a regular basis too,

2903
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:29,170
because they get to see all the
development.

2904
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:33,040
They'll see a bit one time and then
they'll come back and see you maybe six

2905
02:12:33,041 --> 02:12:37,150
months later and they'll see it again.
But now it's got all these extra things

2906
02:12:37,151 --> 02:12:38,470
going on.
It's alive.

2907
02:12:38,471 --> 02:12:40,750
It's connected to other.
To get into it better.

2908
02:12:40,751 --> 02:12:45,010
You're smoother in your delivery.
So much fucking fun.

2909
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,440
The CSO thing,
you shot in Chicago?

2910
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:48,580
Uh,
in Rosemont,

2911
02:12:48,610 --> 02:12:49,630
Illinois,
right?

2912
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,660
You shot it pretty recently.
October 15th.

2913
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:55,330
That's real recent and it comes out
tomorrow.

2914
02:12:57,850 --> 02:12:58,690
How fired up you?

2915
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:03,210
I'm happy it's old.
There's a lot of fucking work.

2916
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:04,290
It wasn't.
Yeah,

2917
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,050
it was fun though.
It was really fun.

2918
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:08,370
You know,
it was the first time I have a tape,

2919
02:13:08,371 --> 02:13:09,750
my spouse,
myself,

2920
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:14,310
I can't stand looking at myself and I
can't stand listening to myself and I

2921
02:13:14,311 --> 02:13:15,840
don't know which one is worse,
you know?

2922
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:20,300
I never said nothing to nobody,
but I saw Johnny Depp on Letterman and

2923
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:21,900
let him and was like,
so all the dailies.

2924
02:13:21,901 --> 02:13:22,860
Luckily he's like,
bitch,

2925
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,480
I don't look at them and let them.
It's like,

2926
02:13:24,481 --> 02:13:25,740
what the fuck are you talking about?
He goes,

2927
02:13:25,741 --> 02:13:29,070
I don't look at Shit.
I don't go to the premiere of my movies.

2928
02:13:29,071 --> 02:13:30,450
I don't look at myself.
And he goes,

2929
02:13:30,451 --> 02:13:32,880
why not?
I lunch and I felt a lot better,

2930
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:35,710
but this was the first time he said he
hated looking at themselves.

2931
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:37,140
This I don't like it.

2932
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,760
You don't want me to say is um,
when I first got here January 29th and

2933
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:44,930
like two weeks later it was super bowl
and I got talked into going on with

2934
02:13:44,931 --> 02:13:48,810
these goofy active parties.
I didn't know I was at the store.

2935
02:13:48,811 --> 02:13:51,030
I was at the store and some goofy guy
came up and he goes,

2936
02:13:51,031 --> 02:13:54,540
you want to go to the superbowl party?
And I went there and I'll never forget

2937
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:59,160
this as long as I fucking live in the
middle of the fucking super bowl.

2938
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:01,620
Like,
you know when it ends the first quarter,

2939
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:04,140
then you have the show in the middle and
Michael Jackson,

2940
02:14:04,141 --> 02:14:07,200
which saying or whatever.
Right in front of 60 people,

2941
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:14,360
a person put a demo reel.
I will never forget that my whole life.

2942
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:19,830
Like it was not supposed to be in that.
Like some guy came in and go,

2943
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:21,980
it's time yet.
Hold on.

2944
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:26,130
I don't know for my demo reel when Shit,
you found anything and they popped that

2945
02:14:26,131 --> 02:14:28,650
demo reel in for 15 minutes.

2946
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:33,650
You Watch student films and fucking
college films and I think he had like

2947
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:38,100
one spot that was tv and I'll never
forget how embarrassing.

2948
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:42,150
Like I felt embarrassed for the guy.
Like let's watch my demo reel.

2949
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:45,480
Are you fucking kidding me?
To a room full of other actors?

2950
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,540
60.
Oh my comedian.

2951
02:14:47,541 --> 02:14:49,370
Stand up comics,
you know,

2952
02:14:49,371 --> 02:14:50,580
so called man.
I Dunno,

2953
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:55,200
I would just been here for two weeks.
So I don't like looking at none of this

2954
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:57,870
shit.
This was the first time I actually went

2955
02:14:57,871 --> 02:15:02,670
home and fucking tape sets.
Like I didn't know how to do nothing on

2956
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:06,060
this fucking phone.
And I went home and tape fucking sets

2957
02:15:06,061 --> 02:15:11,061
and had to listen to them and write
notes and I realized the process there

2958
02:15:12,111 --> 02:15:14,400
was shit.
I was letting go at night like you come

2959
02:15:14,401 --> 02:15:15,630
up to and go,
that's a good bit.

2960
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,150
But you didn't tell me about the two
things before that.

2961
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:22,910
I said that comes after a set.
It's really hard to remember what it

2962
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,401
was.
Funny.

2963
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:25,800
I don't know why that is,
but you remember one or two lines,

2964
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:29,550
but you didn't remember those two
fluctuations you set in your voice.

2965
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:32,490
Those are the things I never worked on
before.

2966
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:36,300
That line that you threw away,
that was the setup to that joke and you

2967
02:15:36,301 --> 02:15:39,690
don't even know you set it up with that.
That's what this taught me.

2968
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:41,790
This special taught me that type of
shit.

2969
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,120
I had to listen to every fucking set
man.

2970
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:49,470
And you know what?
It's funny how you prepare jokes and you

2971
02:15:49,471 --> 02:15:51,930
think what's going to work.
And then when you listen,

2972
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,070
the ship that you thought was gonna work
doesn't really work as well.

2973
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:59,190
It's little things that you didn't think
was going to work.

2974
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:01,170
That really worked.
It's so weird when you listen to your

2975
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:04,170
material and it was a whole complete
different education.

2976
02:16:04,171 --> 02:16:06,270
For me.
It was rough for me to do.

2977
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:09,510
It was really tough for me to do because
I didn't like listening to myself at

2978
02:16:09,511 --> 02:16:13,170
night.
I would do it on planes when you can't

2979
02:16:13,171 --> 02:16:15,930
go anywhere.
When I'm trapped I get really fucking

2980
02:16:15,931 --> 02:16:18,720
high.
I pull one of these pads out and just go

2981
02:16:18,721 --> 02:16:20,640
on a train on the plane.
I'm sorry.

2982
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:22,290
In fact,
you know what happened to me.

2983
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:24,060
I pulled out my third seat.
Deanna.

2984
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:27,740
Plane out of Chicago is the worst thing
I ever heard in my fucking life,

2985
02:16:27,741 --> 02:16:29,980
but my cd is

2986
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,960
probably the worst thing I've ever heard
in all my life.

2987
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:33,400
I can't believe I haven't really used
it,

2988
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:37,960
but that's when I learned that there's a
lot of jokes in times that even if you

2989
02:16:37,961 --> 02:16:39,760
think even [inaudible] there's seven
minutes,

2990
02:16:39,761 --> 02:16:42,370
you're like enough with the shit.
There's still three more,

2991
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:45,940
four more minutes in that thing.
When I beat and you taught me that you

2992
02:16:45,941 --> 02:16:48,010
will.
The one that said you liked to keep

2993
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:50,650
finding tags and stuff.
You know,

2994
02:16:50,651 --> 02:16:52,630
sometimes you just get tired,
you just go,

2995
02:16:52,631 --> 02:16:54,370
fuck it.
I got four of them on there,

2996
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:59,080
I'm going to move on.
So that's what I found that out.

2997
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:03,400
That's what shocked me about this.
It was the first time I had really done

2998
02:17:03,401 --> 02:17:06,070
this type of exclusive work,
Bro.

2999
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:09,790
CSOS putting out some good shit.
You Doug,

3000
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:11,400
who else are they doing?
Brian?

3001
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:12,870
Bryan County.
In fact,

3002
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:13,690
I'm doing radio.

3003
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:17,710
I'm calling radio tomorrow and Brian
zombies in Florida.

3004
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:20,650
This is Brian's last one.
Did they buy his last one on one with

3005
02:17:20,651 --> 02:17:21,880
them?
I'm not sure.

3006
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:26,230
I know either got released last week and
I'm not sure either I or reissue or

3007
02:17:26,231 --> 02:17:27,450
something.
See.

3008
02:17:27,451 --> 02:17:29,590
So uh,
so cecil was owned by NBC,

3009
02:17:29,591 --> 02:17:30,550
is that what it is?
Yes.

3010
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:31,930
That's interesting.
They're doing that.

3011
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:33,550
Look,
it's great when someone's doing any.

3012
02:17:33,630 --> 02:17:35,680
I mean the more people doing something
like that,

3013
02:17:35,681 --> 02:17:38,170
the better.
Like I said,

3014
02:17:38,171 --> 02:17:42,910
man right now commonly used to be eight
to 12 or eight to two.

3015
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:47,610
Now it's nine to five because people are
on their desks with ear buds on.

3016
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:50,230
Yeah.
They could dream your fucking special at

3017
02:17:50,231 --> 02:17:53,490
work.
There's so much going on with streaming

3018
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:54,910
and the whole fucking deal.
Well,

3019
02:17:54,911 --> 02:17:57,520
most of the people that listen to this
are working right now.

3020
02:17:57,521 --> 02:17:58,360
I'm working on right now.

3021
02:17:58,450 --> 02:18:00,280
Probably.
I would imagine if you're doing

3022
02:18:00,281 --> 02:18:02,830
something that you don't have to be
listening to somebody.

3023
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:04,630
You could listen to this while you're
doing your work.

3024
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:09,100
Nine to five,
nine has shown any Goddamn I got to stop

3025
02:18:09,101 --> 02:18:10,330
coughing.
The fuck's going on.

3026
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:15,340
I ended up five has so many amazing.
You know from TV.

3027
02:18:15,341 --> 02:18:18,910
Used to be from eight to 11.
Yeah.

3028
02:18:18,911 --> 02:18:22,390
Pretty much working people only watch
television from eight to 11.

3029
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:23,290
That's changed.
Now.

3030
02:18:24,190 --> 02:18:29,190
I go to work now at nine and put it buds
on and I can't get into game of thrones

3031
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:32,730
or Westworld,
but I can listen to a here.

3032
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:37,670
How many people do you think get to
listen to stuff while they work?

3033
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:39,010
A lot.
A lot.

3034
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:41,860
What percentage?
I T I don't know about it.

3035
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:43,310
A lot of tech people.
Yeah.

3036
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:46,330
A lot of tech people.
When I talk to my knees sometimes in

3037
02:18:46,331 --> 02:18:48,640
Jersey,
she tells me I was to you in the office

3038
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,110
and she's in marketing.

3039
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:53,410
You know,
it puts these in and make notes and type

3040
02:18:53,411 --> 02:18:56,860
of proposals and listening to podcasts.
It's a whole game out.

3041
02:18:56,861 --> 02:19:00,600
That's not eight to 11 no more.
That thing is that now?

3042
02:19:01,170 --> 02:19:02,260
Yeah,
eight till 11.

3043
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:06,700
Netflix is a whole new realm now.
You know.

3044
02:19:06,701 --> 02:19:10,410
Now I could go to work and listening
from nine to 12 and from one to five and

3045
02:19:10,411 --> 02:19:14,620
I could watch from 12 to one at my desk.
I could watch game of thrones on

3046
02:19:14,621 --> 02:19:16,000
Netflix.
I can watch.

3047
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:18,160
It's a different fucking world out
there.

3048
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:21,160
Do you use a use Netflix and use apple
TV?

3049
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:22,450
Do you ever use that?
No.

3050
02:19:22,451 --> 02:19:24,380
That's what we're getting because the
speakers on my.

3051
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:26,470
I was fantastic.
I didn't know what my wife is saying.

3052
02:19:26,471 --> 02:19:28,130
I don't understand of that stuff.
She does

3053
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,920
all the it stuff at the house.
It's just crazy that you can see.

3054
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:33,890
You know what I mean?
Ninety nine or whatever the hell it is.

3055
02:19:33,891 --> 02:19:36,680
Percentage of the movies just by the
right.

3056
02:19:36,681 --> 02:19:38,450
They're like,
I don't know what percentage.

3057
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:40,970
I shouldn't say 99.
Let's take a guess.

3058
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:45,350
It's probably not even 10 percent.
What percent of all movies are on itunes

3059
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,020
because independent movies probably
aren't.

3060
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:52,400
Maybe some independent movies,
all movies on itunes a lot.

3061
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:55,730
I don't think all of them because the
other day I noticed that they just

3062
02:19:55,731 --> 02:20:00,380
recently added an American Werewolf in
London and I was like,

3063
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,270
oh wow.
How weird was it?

3064
02:20:02,271 --> 02:20:03,740
The wolf man,
one of those.

3065
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:09,980
Now when we told them on Netflix,
this is apple TV.

3066
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:14,030
Then they recently added some other
movies that were like pretty old movies,

3067
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:16,370
like they just.
They just added them,

3068
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:19,850
so I think they're still buying movies
and putting them on me.

3069
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:21,710
I don't know how they're doing licensing
them,

3070
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:24,020
whatever they're doing,
making some sort of a deal,

3071
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:26,120
but they got a lot of fucking movies is
my point.

3072
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:29,750
The crazy thing is you could just press
it and it starts playing.

3073
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:32,630
Like when we were kids.
It's just the idea of going to the

3074
02:20:32,631 --> 02:20:34,550
store.
You got make member have blockbuster

3075
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:37,910
would have those giant shelves filled
with one kind of movie.

3076
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:43,480
One movie would come out and that movie
would just feel a shelf and like say if

3077
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:48,080
it was like a transformers or alien or
something like that,

3078
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,910
there would be,
you know,

3079
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:52,560
three,
four levels of them and you would,

3080
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:55,790
you would get there and they don't want
to be a couple left and you get lucky.

3081
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:57,150
Oh God,
we got the last,

3082
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:59,270
last alien.
Yeah,

3083
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,040
bring it back.
That's what I,

3084
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:02,390
that's the first time I went in.

3085
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:04,280
There was a night I was running from the
cops.

3086
02:21:04,281 --> 02:21:07,530
After I kidnap Vela,
I want the blockbuster and I,

3087
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:09,290
and above the law,
these people kept telling me,

3088
02:21:09,291 --> 02:21:11,170
you gotTa Watch,
watch this Guy Steven Seagal.

3089
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:12,020
I'm like,
I don't want to do it.

3090
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:15,200
I watched above the law and lethal
weapon.

3091
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:21,310
I'd never seen lethal weapon before.
That's a good movie for the time.

3092
02:21:21,470 --> 02:21:23,060
If I watched it too,
that probably get angry.

3093
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:27,570
I watched the triangle scene at the end.
Like a mad catch.

3094
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:31,820
Mel Gibson used a triangle.
Doesn't even close it on the Chinese.

3095
02:21:31,821 --> 02:21:34,270
A guy with them two sponges.
No,

3096
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,140
it wasn't in.
Um,

3097
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,093
yeah.
Lethal weapon.

3098
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:39,730
Do the check.
Was it the gas guy?

3099
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,220
He's hanging in.
The guy's hitting them with the sponges

3100
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:44,960
and the guy.
That's right.

3101
02:21:44,961 --> 02:21:46,580
That's right.
He triangles and.

3102
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:49,550
No,
and then he triangles.

3103
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:54,630
Guy On grass guy we fuck with the guy
who got into a motorcycle accident.

3104
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,570
PUC
Puc.

3105
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,630
Yeah.
It was Gary Busey,

3106
02:21:59,631 --> 02:22:00,390
right?
Yeah,

3107
02:22:00,390 --> 02:22:02,510
yeah,
yeah,

3108
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:04,250
yeah.
It's a shitty triangle.

3109
02:22:04,251 --> 02:22:05,900
Choke to.
He doesn't cinch it up.

3110
02:22:08,450 --> 02:22:10,790
And this is like when the cops were
there,

3111
02:22:10,791 --> 02:22:12,830
they kind of let them go after it.
Right.

3112
02:22:12,831 --> 02:22:14,660
Because this was like these guys so
crazy.

3113
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:17,360
The cops let them fight.
Let them go with sticks.

3114
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:22,250
Mel Gibson was shredded son.
That's her motherfucking caboodle.

3115
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:23,630
Time for this shit.
Look at him.

3116
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:27,290
Yeah.
Mel Gibson,

3117
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:29,360
if people will forget,
was a fucking accident star.

3118
02:22:29,361 --> 02:22:30,530
He was a bad motherfucker.

3119
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:34,000
Boom.
We get slammed on a cop car.

3120
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:38,770
This is so ridiculous like that this
could ever happen or cops would let some

3121
02:22:38,771 --> 02:22:43,210
bad guy duke it out with the cop because
they knew that the cop was such a bad

3122
02:22:43,211 --> 02:22:45,120
ass.
He's eventually gonna kick this de

3123
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:48,130
Gaulle's today.
Thirty years ago this shit was

3124
02:22:48,131 --> 02:22:50,320
happening.
Do you think so they let dudes do like

3125
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:54,850
as a friend who called out a compliment
and fought in front of three other cops.

3126
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:57,130
Well,
he just said you wouldn't do this shit

3127
02:22:57,131 --> 02:22:59,620
without your tough friends.
Take off the fucking badge and the gun.

3128
02:22:59,621 --> 02:23:01,000
Bitch.
Why are we doing this?

3129
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:02,590
Take it off.
You're not going to do it.

3130
02:23:02,591 --> 02:23:03,221
And then he goes,
yes,

3131
02:23:03,221 --> 02:23:05,350
I am.
Guy Looked like Phil Sims.

3132
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:10,390
We were like in high school,
we were maybe a year in high school when

3133
02:23:10,391 --> 02:23:15,391
Phil Sims a beat cop for one of my
friends on the street to other cops.

3134
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:17,350
They're like six of us there.
Who One?

3135
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,390
My friend.
Fuck them up.

3136
02:23:19,630 --> 02:23:21,640
Really my friend.
Fuck them up.

3137
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:24,310
That's how crazy it was.
Why are we doing this?

3138
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:25,900
You don't like me,
I don't like you.

3139
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:28,690
Forget the arrest and let's drill down
right here.

3140
02:23:28,691 --> 02:23:29,360
You will.
Tough guy.

3141
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:32,530
Motherfucker put off the gun.
So after he beat his ass with a cop,

3142
02:23:32,531 --> 02:23:36,430
do they fucking shook hands and then it
will fuck with each other again.

3143
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:37,570
Wow.
I mean,

3144
02:23:37,571 --> 02:23:39,910
he didn't throw him around,
but he punched him in the fucking mouth

3145
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:41,440
a few times in front of his buddies.

3146
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:46,570
Oh,
that's weird.

3147
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,480
And one time when I got,
when I got out of the fucking jail in

3148
02:23:49,481 --> 02:23:53,620
Boulder,
I got out of the halfway house and I got

3149
02:23:53,621 --> 02:23:57,040
into a fight with a guy that cut me off
and they ended up splitting up the car

3150
02:23:57,910 --> 02:23:59,080
and something happened,
Bro.

3151
02:23:59,081 --> 02:24:01,570
I slipped and that guy had me.
He was beating the fuck out of me,

3152
02:24:01,571 --> 02:24:05,080
but then he slipped in the snow.
So when the cops got there,

3153
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,420
I was on.
They pulled this up.

3154
02:24:07,421 --> 02:24:09,640
I was going back to prison.
I thought they were going to violate me.

3155
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:13,060
I told the cop what happened.
He told the cop what happened,

3156
02:24:13,150 --> 02:24:16,990
but he was giving the cop a bad attitude
I want right there.

3157
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:19,500
He was telling me,
what the fuck do you care?

3158
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:20,343
And the guy goes,
hey,

3159
02:24:20,830 --> 02:24:22,330
awesome.
They talked and they pull us back.

3160
02:24:22,331 --> 02:24:23,590
I just told the cop the truth.

3161
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:26,380
I just got to the halfway house.
I can't get violated for this.

3162
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:29,680
Go talk to this guy.
And they came back and I go,

3163
02:24:29,681 --> 02:24:32,290
we're not going to press charges but
shake hands.

3164
02:24:32,291 --> 02:24:34,450
And the guy goes,
I'm not going to shake his hand.

3165
02:24:34,990 --> 02:24:36,400
And the cop looks at me,
looks at them.

3166
02:24:36,401 --> 02:24:37,170
He goes,
you know what?

3167
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:39,310
When we got here,
you weren't doing too fucking good.

3168
02:24:40,030 --> 02:24:41,080
Okay.
Don't make me.

3169
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:45,220
Don't make me put him on fucking top.
You'll get you weren't doing too fucking

3170
02:24:45,221 --> 02:24:46,480
good.
Shake his hand.

3171
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,170
The guy shook my hand.
That was the end of that.

3172
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:50,950
We got it.
You weren't doing it through good

3173
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:55,690
cops letting people fight.
It's strange.

3174
02:24:55,870 --> 02:24:58,230
You remember there was that thing that
was going on in the California prisons

3175
02:24:58,231 --> 02:25:00,400
where they haven't liked these,
these crazy fights,

3176
02:25:00,401 --> 02:25:05,401
these underground fights and the guards
were like setting things up.

3177
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:07,390
The gladiator fights.
Remember that?

3178
02:25:07,391 --> 02:25:09,200
There was like a big article about it.
We should.

3179
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:12,580
I don't know if we let at days.
Next time you see Mike Dyson,

3180
02:25:12,581 --> 02:25:14,150
you should have asked them before like
shoes.

3181
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:17,230
True.
See what he says to you that they based

3182
02:25:17,231 --> 02:25:20,770
that movie with fuck.
Go on him.

3183
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:24,330
That was the story that somebody,
they let the board

3184
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:28,770
and leave town for Christmas and one of
the guys got in touch with to promote

3185
02:25:28,771 --> 02:25:32,890
and they brought somebody from boxing
and to see Mike Tyson.

3186
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,860
Come on.
That's what I got the fucking idea for

3187
02:25:35,861 --> 02:25:36,671
that movie.
Let me go.

3188
02:25:36,671 --> 02:25:37,810
Come on.
Undisputed.

3189
02:25:37,811 --> 02:25:38,451
Let me.
Excuse me.

3190
02:25:38,451 --> 02:25:42,310
Let me go ahead and pick that kid.
Undisputed is based on a real story.

3191
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:47,500
They brought a guy in the prison.
Come on.

3192
02:25:47,501 --> 02:25:49,750
Do you know how,
how much that would be worth

3193
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:53,470
when prison guards force inmates to
fight?

3194
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:55,000
That was the wide.
You.

3195
02:25:55,001 --> 02:25:56,630
Uh,
what are you googling?

3196
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:01,870
Undisputed movie real?
Is it based on a real story?

3197
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:05,290
Wow.
Movie similarities to real life.

3198
02:26:05,291 --> 02:26:07,630
Tyson's saga.
Undisputed.

3199
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:11,920
But where is the fight that he didn't
have a fight in jail?

3200
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,030
If Mike Tyson had a fight in jail,
they would have,

3201
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:21,320
they would have filmed that
and Mike Tyson would be talking about

3202
02:26:21,321 --> 02:26:22,090
it.

3203
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:25,270
Mike Tyson has that whole story.
You know,

3204
02:26:25,271 --> 02:26:27,280
where your,
his whole live show where he talks about

3205
02:26:27,281 --> 02:26:29,020
his entire life.
I mean,

3206
02:26:29,021 --> 02:26:33,610
if Mike Tyson had that in his life,
he will be telling people about it.

3207
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:35,820
Don't you think?
I mean,

3208
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:40,510
I can imagine that he would ever have a
fight in jail and not tell anybody about

3209
02:26:40,511 --> 02:26:42,160
it.
I think the.

3210
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:43,600
Well,
what was it about it?

3211
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:45,670
What are you looking up?
Jamie Center for?

3212
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,490
Um,
someone was asking the same question as

3213
02:26:47,491 --> 02:26:49,060
a boxing for them.
So yeah,

3214
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:51,670
maybe someone's got a link somewhere.
People are silly.

3215
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:54,220
There's no links.
You would have heard of it.

3216
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:57,370
We've known there was a video of Tyson
fighting in jail.

3217
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:00,340
Come on.
And she for sure you're going to tape.

3218
02:27:00,341 --> 02:27:03,130
It was just going to let it happen.
Trust your memory.

3219
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:05,920
You're going to bring in riddick bow or
someone like that.

3220
02:27:05,921 --> 02:27:07,480
And you're gonna.
Have Tyson fight him in jail.

3221
02:27:07,690 --> 02:27:10,060
The Fuck Outta here.
That's ridiculous.

3222
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:11,800
Early nineties.
Mid Nineties.

3223
02:27:11,890 --> 02:27:13,840
I don't remember the exact day.
When.

3224
02:27:13,890 --> 02:27:15,730
What year do you think Tyson was in
jail?

3225
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:21,200
Tyson went to jail.
A 2000.

3226
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:23,270
Two thousand 11 around there.
No,

3227
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:25,870
that was,
that was the more recent one,

3228
02:27:25,871 --> 02:27:29,500
right?
Wasn't the real Chicago and Illinois.

3229
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:32,470
I think it was the late nineties because
he was out.

3230
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:38,040
He was out and fighting holy field while
I was living in Encino,

3231
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:40,360
which I think was 96.

3232
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,580
Yeah,
I think.

3233
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:49,130
When did he go in?
He got arrested in [inaudible] 92 that

3234
02:27:49,131 --> 02:27:51,230
says you got a six year prison term.
Yeah,

3235
02:27:51,231 --> 02:27:52,380
that was the one.
It was awesome.

3236
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,420
It was.
That's what it was.

3237
02:27:53,421 --> 02:27:58,421
How long was Tyson in jail for?
He still maintains that of all the shit

3238
02:28:00,811 --> 02:28:02,370
he says that,
that that's,

3239
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:03,710
that doesn't happen.
Yeah.

3240
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,260
That was set up,
which is really crazy.

3241
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:09,410
Then you find out that that same woman
had set somebody else up.

3242
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:12,860
She had lied about a,
another one.

3243
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:13,723
Another.
Uh,

3244
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:17,720
alleged rape allegedly lied.
I don't know the specifics,

3245
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:19,670
but that was in her past,
like,

3246
02:28:19,671 --> 02:28:22,050
whoa.
You just

3247
02:28:22,090 --> 02:28:25,000
released a winter in March.
March 26.

3248
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:26,020
Ninety two.
He was sentenced.

3249
02:28:26,021 --> 02:28:27,610
He was released march.
[inaudible] 95.

3250
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:30,070
Three years?
Yeah,

3251
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:33,580
three years.
How long has he been retired?

3252
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:36,850
He retired right after.
Well,

3253
02:28:36,851 --> 02:28:39,820
he had a couple of fights,
but I think it was the Kevin Ferguson

3254
02:28:39,821 --> 02:28:41,410
fight.
Was that the one where you retired?

3255
02:28:42,490 --> 02:28:47,490
Was his last fight.
Tyson's done the boxing world by

3256
02:28:49,091 --> 02:28:52,570
quitting before the start of the seventh
round against Kevin Mcbride.

3257
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:54,460
Kevin Mcbride.
Okay.

3258
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,360
That's what it was.
And uh,

3259
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:00,380
you know,
the Lennox Lewis fight was a bad beating

3260
02:29:00,381 --> 02:29:02,780
two.
That was before that.

3261
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:04,710
That was one where you look,
you knew like,

3262
02:29:04,830 --> 02:29:07,160
oh,
he's just not the same guy anymore.

3263
02:29:07,710 --> 02:29:09,620
You know,
you go back and watch the guy that

3264
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:12,890
destroyed Larry Holmes.
It was a scary guy.

3265
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:16,820
Then you know,
he knew as much as anybody knew,

3266
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:19,900
can only go so long in that business.
It's just,

3267
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:22,880
is a shelf life.
Nobody gets out.

3268
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:27,260
You know,
it's a fun time for boxing right now.

3269
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:28,460
Been paying attention to boxing

3270
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:32,350
belly up time for what I got on my
plate.

3271
02:29:32,370 --> 02:29:35,790
Now I got to open up boxing.
You Know Bernard Hopkins is fighting?

3272
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:37,320
No.
Yup.

3273
02:29:37,980 --> 02:29:39,090
Yup.
Fifty,

3274
02:29:39,390 --> 02:29:44,130
50 1:51.
He's fighting December 17th.

3275
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:46,980
Where in La?
It's fight at the forum.

3276
02:29:48,590 --> 02:29:51,260
Yeah.
Who's he fighting?

3277
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:53,420
Some.
A young,

3278
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:55,160
tough light.
Heavyweight white dude.

3279
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:59,870
Knockout power will say barnard is so
hard to hit.

3280
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:02,930
He's so clever.
I don't think he'd be fighting if he

3281
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:06,440
wasn't still capable to.
He looked at him like right here,

3282
02:30:06,441 --> 02:30:07,160
come on,
man.

3283
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:10,610
Fifty one years old and he looks fucking
great.

3284
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:11,753
Like,
look at this.

3285
02:30:12,140 --> 02:30:13,190
Who's combinations?
Right?

3286
02:30:15,990 --> 02:30:16,823
I mean,

3287
02:30:20,430 --> 02:30:22,920
I mean everything looks smooth as fuck,
man.

3288
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:25,950
That's,
that's the real Bernard Hopkins.

3289
02:30:25,951 --> 02:30:27,870
When you're looking at him boxing here,
you're not saying,

3290
02:30:27,871 --> 02:30:30,120
oh,
this is a 51 year old Bernard Hopkins.

3291
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:32,220
You're saying that's Bernard Hopkins.

3292
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:36,960
Oh Joe,
51.

3293
02:30:36,961 --> 02:30:39,540
Your reactions,
your vision.

3294
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,130
There's a lot of other factors.
Oh,

3295
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:43,950
for sure.
There's a lot of the factors,

3296
02:30:43,951 --> 02:30:45,930
but this is amazing.
Oh,

3297
02:30:45,931 --> 02:30:48,150
it's amazing.
It's amazing that you could even

3298
02:30:48,151 --> 02:30:53,040
consider that this guy at 51 years old
should be allowed to fight

3299
02:30:53,041 --> 02:30:55,140
professionally.
There's also very smart.

3300
02:30:55,141 --> 02:30:56,880
He was.
You've pointed out a lot of stuff.

3301
02:30:56,881 --> 02:30:58,950
To me,
he was always very smart.

3302
02:30:58,951 --> 02:31:01,920
He never really got hit a lot.
He didn't get in any big,

3303
02:31:01,921 --> 02:31:02,521
big,
big,

3304
02:31:02,521 --> 02:31:05,250
big people,
you know.

3305
02:31:05,251 --> 02:31:07,410
I mean,
this guy always stayed pretty clean.

3306
02:31:07,411 --> 02:31:11,050
It's not like he's a Jeffrey Jeff,
you know?

3307
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:11,551
Yeah.
I know.

3308
02:31:11,551 --> 02:31:14,100
He would make fights ugly.
He would clench a lot,

3309
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:17,010
frustrated a lot of guys,
but he also could crack,

3310
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:19,800
you know,
and he just was a really boxer.

3311
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:25,260
The the big coming out party for him was
Felix Trinidad when he fought Felix

3312
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:26,850
Trinidad and just boxes face off.

3313
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:31,260
Everybody just saw like wow.
Like we thought Felix Trinidad was this

3314
02:31:31,261 --> 02:31:35,610
young hungry lion.
He was taken on the older veteran who is

3315
02:31:35,611 --> 02:31:37,770
probably on his way down to Bernard
Hopkins,

3316
02:31:37,771 --> 02:31:41,910
wasn't on his way down like he's just,
he was just like coming into his own

3317
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:45,240
stride then,
but he's always been so disciplined,

3318
02:31:45,241 --> 02:31:49,050
man so smart with his diet.
So smart with how he takes care of his

3319
02:31:49,051 --> 02:31:51,120
body.
Never allows himself to get out of

3320
02:31:51,121 --> 02:31:53,010
shape.
So he's never like working back into

3321
02:31:53,011 --> 02:31:57,870
shape and always fights intelligent and
defensively he's always in the right

3322
02:31:57,871 --> 02:32:01,080
position to work for him.
That's why I 51,

3323
02:32:01,081 --> 02:32:04,770
it might work for very well could.
He's working out with John David

3324
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:07,890
Jackson,
who was a two division world champ,

3325
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:10,410
I believe.
I think he was at least one division

3326
02:32:10,411 --> 02:32:11,880
champ,
but John,

3327
02:32:11,881 --> 02:32:15,240
David Jackson and a lot of people forgot
about it was a really high level voxer

3328
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:16,630
and like,
uh,

3329
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:17,760
like the nineties.

3330
02:32:18,090 --> 02:32:19,040
This guy here.
Yep.

3331
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:19,831
Yeah.
John.

3332
02:32:19,831 --> 02:32:21,330
David Jackson.
He looks familiar.

3333
02:32:21,331 --> 02:32:26,331
He works with Sergei Cova love him and
Sergey Kovalev work together.

3334
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:30,210
So that was a,
that was another guy that he trains.

3335
02:32:30,211 --> 02:32:32,820
He trains.
He's like one of the most respected up

3336
02:32:32,821 --> 02:32:37,020
and coming trainers particularly because
he achieved a world championship level,

3337
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:38,250
you know,
when he was boxing,

3338
02:32:38,251 --> 02:32:40,650
he was really high level guy.
He uh,

3339
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:45,660
used to work out with Terry Clay Bond,
you know Terry Cleveland as to what's

3340
02:32:45,811 --> 02:32:47,130
really going on.
That guy.

3341
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:51,090
I love that dude.
He said it's some gym in Hollywood,

3342
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:55,230
I guess to stop by say hi to.
I saw justin fortune.

3343
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:00,000
How's that guy doing?
Cancer could suck his dick though.

3344
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:02,840
What happened?
He had cancer for a while,

3345
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:04,080
but I touched them.
Yes.

3346
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:08,430
I think he beat the fuck out it though,
Pete.

3347
02:33:08,510 --> 02:33:12,870
The last night when I drove around,
but I was really in shock when I hugged

3348
02:33:12,871 --> 02:33:13,704
him.

3349
02:33:14,310 --> 02:33:19,310
He Salad Bowl.
I mean,

3350
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:22,800
you could tell he lost 20 pounds.
He was doing chemo.

3351
02:33:22,810 --> 02:33:24,930
He said,
I know I didn't ask him,

3352
02:33:24,931 --> 02:33:28,950
but pro kind of cancer.
Was it like something Roy?

3353
02:33:28,951 --> 02:33:31,220
The sunlight,
some thyroid or something,

3354
02:33:31,230 --> 02:33:33,120
something like that.
But man,

3355
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:36,690
when I hugged them yesterday I was like,
this guy got cancer.

3356
02:33:36,691 --> 02:33:41,691
God Damn God damn well you know,
they're way better at taking care of

3357
02:33:42,361 --> 02:33:45,120
cancer now than I've ever been.
Like hitting a wall.

3358
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:49,590
I hadn't seen him in a year.
I could never count them go to Hollywood

3359
02:33:49,591 --> 02:33:51,150
that much.
So yes,

3360
02:33:51,151 --> 02:33:53,280
I was driving and he's always training
packy out.

3361
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,710
He's in the Philippines when I call it
six,

3362
02:33:55,711 --> 02:33:57,470
I'm up.
I'll try to call.

3363
02:33:57,471 --> 02:33:58,860
I even set them.
I call.

3364
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:02,130
So when he's training,
package out how to him and Freddie Roach

3365
02:34:02,131 --> 02:34:04,680
work stuff out that go down there.
So.

3366
02:34:04,681 --> 02:34:06,600
But what is,
what is the difference between like what

3367
02:34:06,601 --> 02:34:09,980
he does and what Freddy does?
I think he just does strengthen fitness.

3368
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,830
Oh,
okay.

3369
02:34:10,830 --> 02:34:13,320
Okay.
And Freddy does the myths and everything

3370
02:34:13,321 --> 02:34:15,240
else.
But Justin was one of the first guys

3371
02:34:15,241 --> 02:34:18,400
were his gym I ever saw.
He had like an altitude box.

3372
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:19,780
Yes.
I was like,

3373
02:34:19,781 --> 02:34:22,810
what?
You go in the box and it simulates high

3374
02:34:22,811 --> 02:34:25,300
altitude and you fucking go crazy and
workout in there.

3375
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:27,930
Yes.
Like that's,

3376
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:30,420
that's high level.
I mean he had like a,

3377
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:33,210
it was a vacuum attached to it or
something like that that was sucking the

3378
02:34:33,211 --> 02:34:36,380
air out of there.
So it was like a very low oxygen state.

3379
02:34:36,980 --> 02:34:38,940
Simulators used to be in the corner.
They moved.

3380
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:41,830
I didn't see it yesterday,
but man,

3381
02:34:41,831 --> 02:34:42,880
when I hugged them,
mess that,

3382
02:34:42,881 --> 02:34:45,850
I was like,
oh fuck this guy still solid.

3383
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:50,710
Oh Shit.
I'm really interested in seeing Bernard

3384
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:52,450
Hopkins fight this weekend.
I'm really interested in.

3385
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:53,110
No.
Next week.

3386
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:55,030
Next weekend.
Really interest you in town.

3387
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:56,380
No,
no.

3388
02:34:56,410 --> 02:34:57,520
I'm going to have to watch it on the
road,

3389
02:34:58,330 --> 02:35:01,870
but a 17th going somewhere.
Joe Diaz.

3390
02:35:02,110 --> 02:35:04,710
Are you doing comedy?
No job.

3391
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:08,980
I ain't going to bother.
I ain't got a creepy question.

3392
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,320
This sucker.
I just thought you were doing comedy.

3393
02:35:11,321 --> 02:35:13,840
Somebody didn't know you wanted to set
their next gig.

3394
02:35:14,140 --> 02:35:18,010
Booked a past our gig on New Year's
December 31st.

3395
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:21,370
Then I don't have anything booked until
Portland that was working on new shit.

3396
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,980
Um,
what about uh,

3397
02:35:23,410 --> 02:35:25,870
in Toronto Friday you have no show.
Oh yeah,

3398
02:35:25,871 --> 02:35:26,560
yeah,
we do it.

3399
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:27,393
Yeah.
It's me,

3400
02:35:27,430 --> 02:35:29,200
Russell Peters and big Jay Oakerson.

3401
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:35,170
That's fucking,
that's like one of those festivals.

3402
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:36,760
Yeah.
We sold out Massey Hall and like an

3403
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:40,030
hour.
It was pretty quick.

3404
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:42,970
It was pretty quick.
What's Massey whole feet?

3405
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:45,370
3,000,
2,800,

3406
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:46,980
something like that?
No,

3407
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,010
just one.
Just one.

3408
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:49,840
Just one to have some fun.
It was,

3409
02:35:49,841 --> 02:35:51,250
you know,
Russell did the podcast.

3410
02:35:51,251 --> 02:35:54,010
We were just joking around or like we
should do a show together.

3411
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:55,750
I'm like,
let's book something man.

3412
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:57,190
And then I'm like,
I'm going to do Massey Hall.

3413
02:35:57,191 --> 02:35:58,030
You want to do it with me?
He's like,

3414
02:35:58,031 --> 02:35:58,864
fuck it,
I'll do it.

3415
02:35:58,990 --> 02:36:00,160
And then boom,
it was in.

3416
02:36:00,161 --> 02:36:02,290
And then I've talked to big j.
You know,

3417
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:05,140
actually maybe I talked to big j first.
Asked big j first.

3418
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:07,090
Yeah.
I asked big j first because he told me

3419
02:36:07,091 --> 02:36:09,560
was going to be in town for the fights.
He wanted to get tickets to the fight.

3420
02:36:09,561 --> 02:36:10,200
So I go,
fuck yeah.

3421
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:11,470
I'm like,
what are you doing Friday night?

3422
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:13,450
And he wasn't doing anything.
I'm like,

3423
02:36:13,451 --> 02:36:14,470
C'mon man,
let's work.

3424
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:17,240
It tells for fun.
That place is awesome.

3425
02:36:17,730 --> 02:36:19,870
Oh yeah.
The Beatles played there.

3426
02:36:19,871 --> 02:36:22,690
Man.
That place has an energy.

3427
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:25,200
3,000 seats,
the fucking Beatles.

3428
02:36:25,370 --> 02:36:27,940
But Hey man,
they did whatever the fuck they wanted.

3429
02:36:28,570 --> 02:36:30,190
The Beatles could do whatever they
wanted.

3430
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:33,820
They could play 3000 seeds.
They it a paid arenas.

3431
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:38,410
I think they probably did everything.
And I got to Boogie three please.

3432
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:40,120
I gotta tell you this,
wrap this shit up.

3433
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:41,770
No,
we tell to wrap this up.

3434
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:45,250
When I heard this story,
I was like,

3435
02:36:45,251 --> 02:36:47,170
I don't want to hear this and I'm not
gonna Watch it.

3436
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:51,220
Listen,
he would call me a bunch of names and

3437
02:36:51,221 --> 02:36:53,020
shit and I probably won't say nothing to
you.

3438
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:57,230
Don't fuck with me.
When it comes to music and the argument

3439
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:59,740
by restaurants,
that's what gets under my fucking core.

3440
02:36:59,741 --> 02:37:02,860
Okay.
I hate it.

3441
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:05,020
I hate the band.
I don't like a fucking band.

3442
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:07,090
Okay.
When I was growing up in Jersey,

3443
02:37:07,091 --> 02:37:08,260
I got a call.
When did it go see?

3444
02:37:08,261 --> 02:37:11,170
Twisted sister
and I'm like,

3445
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:12,440
that's the bad.
With the makeup,

3446
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:16,060
like makeup.
I went with this Italian dude that

3447
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:17,540
had no fucking.
He had.

3448
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:22,340
He had no tolerance for bad music.
Me and him a perfect because we walked

3449
02:37:22,341 --> 02:37:24,710
out of movies together with perfect for
each other.

3450
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:27,500
We walked in,
I'll never forget this guy came in and

3451
02:37:27,501 --> 02:37:27,861
goes,
what?

3452
02:37:27,861 --> 02:37:31,460
Twisted fucking sister man,
and we looked at each other and we ran

3453
02:37:31,461 --> 02:37:33,430
out.
Never again will,

3454
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:38,440
I think it was the sister dog watched a
documentary on twisted sister the more

3455
02:37:38,951 --> 02:37:43,951
than most.
I knew there was selling 9,000 tickets,

3456
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:48,650
no 14,000 tickets a week and nobody
would sign them as a band.

3457
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:52,010
I mean that God awful.
God awful.

3458
02:37:52,011 --> 02:37:57,011
That music local,
but they became huge and

3459
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:02,150
nobody would sign them to fucking
assistance would come up to the

3460
02:38:02,151 --> 02:38:05,240
president of the label and go dog
twisted system and he goes,

3461
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:07,670
the next person will talk to me about
twisted assistant.

3462
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:13,060
I will fucking fight.
I do not like these guys sold so many,

3463
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:16,700
but it was like for you to understand
this,

3464
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:18,140
you have to understand.

3465
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:21,440
I think I was talking about all this
shit you did when you did comedy.

3466
02:38:21,770 --> 02:38:25,220
Do you know that Dee Snider Guy is
jacked Jack,

3467
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:26,510
Jack,
Jack,

3468
02:38:26,690 --> 02:38:30,530
and somebody picked a fight with him
somewhere or something like that.

3469
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:33,980
Either someone picked a fight with him
or there was a guy who looked exactly

3470
02:38:33,981 --> 02:38:36,170
like dee snider will beat the fuck out
of some dude.

3471
02:38:36,350 --> 02:38:39,410
I forget which one.
It's one of those.

3472
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:44,210
It's either it's either I got fooled and
they revealed they were revealed that it

3473
02:38:44,211 --> 02:38:45,670
was a guy that looked just like I'm
gonna.

3474
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,020
Kick some dude's ass,
but there was A.

3475
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,120
is this him?
Is this him or not?

3476
02:38:50,210 --> 02:38:55,210
See this guy sucker punches him
and he beats the fuck out of this dude.

3477
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:59,030
Look at him.
He slams down on the ground.

3478
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:02,480
He body slammed him.
Beats the shit out of them.

3479
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:04,060
Is that Dee Snider?
10?

3480
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:08,000
But it comes up when you google them,
like when you Google Dee Snider fight.

3481
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:13,070
Dude,
if it is dee snider has specked respect.

3482
02:39:13,071 --> 02:39:15,860
He beat the fuck out of that dude.
That dude sucker punched him.

3483
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:18,270
He body slammed him.
Kick the shit out of him.

3484
02:39:18,271 --> 02:39:20,720
The guy was still talking shit,
so he walked up on him again.

3485
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:27,170
I mean this guy sucker punched him.
He beat the shit out of him if that is

3486
02:39:27,171 --> 02:39:28,890
him.
It's not that unlike these slides.

3487
02:39:28,891 --> 02:39:31,070
I don't like that.
I mean I just didn't like the music,

3488
02:39:31,730 --> 02:39:33,650
but after I watched his documentary,
Joe,

3489
02:39:33,651 --> 02:39:36,950
I fucking like,
I still don't like the music that I

3490
02:39:36,951 --> 02:39:37,940
like.
I'm going to rock.

3491
02:39:37,970 --> 02:39:39,700
What does it will go?
They'll rock.

3492
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:43,340
Even that right there is great.
That right there.

3493
02:39:43,341 --> 02:39:44,890
That's tremendous.
That's,

3494
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:49,040
that's the opening line of data.
But it was pretty fucking interesting.

3495
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:52,280
They were doing like Long Island,
Wednesday,

3496
02:39:52,310 --> 02:39:55,370
Jersey,
3000 seats on Thursday,

3497
02:39:55,730 --> 02:40:00,730
another 3000 seats on Friday in the
metropolitan area and then 5,000 on

3498
02:40:02,810 --> 02:40:06,560
Saturday and no one would sign them.
Nobody.

3499
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:08,870
That's incredible.
And every time they were going to get

3500
02:40:08,871 --> 02:40:10,220
signed,
something else happened.

3501
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:12,770
Like one guy came,
it was an asylum.

3502
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:14,460
He got on the plane,
died of a heart attack.

3503
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:17,550
The other time they were going to play
the garden or something.

3504
02:40:17,551 --> 02:40:20,400
They sold that something.
Don't quote me on this.

3505
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:23,390
They sold that something big and
Manhattan,

3506
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:28,400
5,000 seats every a and R guy was going
to come and the drummer got a fucking

3507
02:40:28,531 --> 02:40:31,140
infection.
He couldn't play the drums for four

3508
02:40:31,141 --> 02:40:32,640
days.
I mean it was just like they kept

3509
02:40:32,641 --> 02:40:35,220
getting kicked in the fucking ass.
Boom,

3510
02:40:35,221 --> 02:40:37,200
boom.
And finally one day signed them and the

3511
02:40:37,201 --> 02:40:39,150
rest happened.
But it's pretty fucking interesting,

3512
02:40:39,151 --> 02:40:41,220
man.
Even though you may not like him,

3513
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:44,070
I didn't think much of me that I liked
them when I was a kid.

3514
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:46,890
I liked a bunch of their songs.
I'm sure about one of the records.

3515
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,960
That guy's a radio hosts now,
isn't he?

3516
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:51,360
I'm not sure.
I know he was.

3517
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:53,100
I know I called them to his radio
station.

3518
02:40:53,101 --> 02:40:55,470
Wants these.
Snyder was a long ass time ago.

3519
02:40:55,471 --> 02:40:56,400
Yeah,
it was really cool.

3520
02:40:56,430 --> 02:40:59,790
It was crazy.
It was crazy just to talk to dee snider.

3521
02:40:59,791 --> 02:41:00,900
I'm like,
I'm talking to him.

3522
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:02,940
I don't remember.
I called him,

3523
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:05,810
I call magic radio show.
One time I called them.

3524
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:09,000
I'm talking to this guy and after 10
minutes I realized this is the guy

3525
02:41:09,001 --> 02:41:11,790
that's saying a lot.
I was in jeopardy.

3526
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:14,850
Oh baby.
And he had something else too.

3527
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:16,980
What the fuck was his name?
Do you remember?

3528
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:17,814
Alto.
Nova.

3529
02:41:19,350 --> 02:41:22,640
It's just a fantasy.
Put the video on with the video.

3530
02:41:22,641 --> 02:41:24,010
Can we end with the video please?

3531
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:30,640
Do you remember the video?
Yes,

3532
02:41:30,641 --> 02:41:33,790
I do remember the beginning of it.
What to play a little bit of it,

3533
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:35,760
but we can't play any of the music for
the people at home.

3534
02:41:35,761 --> 02:41:37,140
We'll just watch it for us.
Yeah.

3535
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:40,990
After the beginning of that,
life is just a fantasy.

3536
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:44,470
I still remember what I see though in
this video permit.

3537
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:48,970
New Year's eve of 1982 or three volume
young Jamie.

3538
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:53,320
Look at this.
Wow.

3539
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:56,290
This is 83.
Whoa.

3540
02:41:57,400 --> 02:42:00,670
That's one of the crazy things about
really good video.

3541
02:42:00,671 --> 02:42:01,830
Like this is,
you know,

3542
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,270
you see these people.
This is a time capsule.

3543
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:07,270
This is people from the eighties.
You know,

3544
02:42:07,271 --> 02:42:10,600
they talk about how music isn't selling
anymore.

3545
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:13,270
Maybe you guys don't.
They don't do these goofy things.

3546
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,040
Look at this.
Well,

3547
02:42:15,041 --> 02:42:19,060
it's because the only way to get music
back then was you got to buy it.

3548
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:20,890
That's not the case anymore.

3549
02:42:20,920 --> 02:42:24,490
It's pretty easy to get music now.
Now it's about making it convenient to

3550
02:42:24,491 --> 02:42:27,220
people.
There's Aldo motherfucking Nova with a

3551
02:42:27,221 --> 02:42:30,550
leopard leisure suit on bitch.
What?

3552
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:33,160
Look at him.
Handsome motherfucker.

3553
02:42:34,030 --> 02:42:36,640
He hopped out demons.
Say Hi to anybody where there's leopard.

3554
02:42:36,641 --> 02:42:38,410
Didn't even acknowledge the fact.
Yeah,

3555
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:40,870
I got a leopard skin leotard.
What?

3556
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:43,270
You know?
He's still around Alto Novis.

3557
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:46,540
Just a songwriter now.
Oh Man.

3558
02:42:46,541 --> 02:42:48,450
Well you can't take this away from my
watch.

3559
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:50,320
This shit.
This is a.

3560
02:42:50,390 --> 02:42:53,850
they're breaking down this door to get
into this warehouse and I'll don't know

3561
02:42:53,860 --> 02:42:55,780
if it takes his guitar out.
It gets better,

3562
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:59,050
Dude.
Everybody stand back.

3563
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:01,330
He's going to shoot the wall with his
guitar.

3564
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:06,310
Look at the laser cuts through the door
with his guitar laser.

3565
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:09,510
Here it comes,
baby.

3566
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:12,240
Don't

3567
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:13,680
fast forward to that part.
Either.

3568
02:43:13,710 --> 02:43:17,520
Suffer,
suffer to get to this suffering to get

3569
02:43:17,521 --> 02:43:19,570
to the song.
No,

3570
02:43:20,730 --> 02:43:24,090
you don't remember this dude Jamie,
because you spend too much time on black

3571
02:43:24,091 --> 02:43:25,800
twitter.
Okay?

3572
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:30,460
Wearing yeezys.
Look at them.

3573
02:43:30,461 --> 02:43:33,540
Did
look at him.

3574
02:43:33,541 --> 02:43:35,850
Go up there.
Here it goes.

3575
02:43:35,851 --> 02:43:38,070
You don't even know this song to you.
Here we go,

3576
02:43:38,071 --> 02:43:43,071
baby.
Jamie's looks the look at Jamie's face.

3577
02:43:43,171 --> 02:43:45,180
Put the camera on you.
Can you put the camera on you?

3578
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:49,440
Look at your face.
That's a legitimate reaction to hearing

3579
02:43:49,441 --> 02:43:53,880
Aldo Nova in 2016 for the first time.
Come on Bro.

3580
02:43:53,881 --> 02:43:55,410
Look at that.
He's got a scarf on.

3581
02:43:55,890 --> 02:43:57,680
So leather scarf,
like a snake.

3582
02:43:57,681 --> 02:44:00,490
Skin leather is really.
Have a scarf.

3583
02:44:00,491 --> 02:44:01,324
Does he?

3584
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:02,823
No.

3585
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:09,920
Look at that outfit.
The leopard print.

3586
02:44:11,490 --> 02:44:14,580
It's beautiful.
This song is hypnotic.

3587
02:44:14,650 --> 02:44:17,400
Tell me it's not bringing you in.
Bringing you back.

3588
02:44:17,550 --> 02:44:19,170
What were you like five when this came
out?

3589
02:44:19,610 --> 02:44:21,820
You even born.
You were you 83.

3590
02:44:23,010 --> 02:44:25,290
Beginning 83.
You're born in 83.

3591
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:27,420
So this is your baby.
Your baby.

3592
02:44:27,421 --> 02:44:31,800
Then when Jamie was born,
this is probably playing

3593
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:40,110
a joke and tell them if they go to Cecil
Csun,

3594
02:44:40,111 --> 02:44:42,090
they're pressing joey.
They get two months for free.

3595
02:44:42,270 --> 02:44:42,840
Oh,
okay.

3596
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:47,100
I get this special for free.
Free free tomorrow.

3597
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:51,450
So Joey and you'd done for Free Foot
Julian.

3598
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:54,180
That's the Code Joey for two months for
free.

3599
02:44:54,330 --> 02:44:56,370
Get on at folks.
Let's blow the shit up.

3600
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:59,580
I'll put it up on twitter and instagram
and all that.

3601
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:02,370
Getting a picture with you right now and
uh,

3602
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:03,680
uh,
Jelly,

3603
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:05,370
motherfucking Diaz,
ladies and gentlemen,

3604
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:06,970
Hala,
Bam,

3605
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:12,690
all de Nova in the background.
That's motherfuckers we'd love.

3606
02:45:12,691 --> 02:45:14,730
You see a body memory that's happy new
year.

3607
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:16,100
Happy Hanukkah.
