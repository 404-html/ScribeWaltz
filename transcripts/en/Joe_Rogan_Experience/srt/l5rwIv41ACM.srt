1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Four,
oh,

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,730
five,
three,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,860
two,
uno.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,370
Ya Live.
Ladies and gentleman,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,630
Eddie Bravo,
Joey,

6
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:13,260
motherfucker,
Diaz and Brandon Shah.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,543
I

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,020
love you guys too.
Happy New Year.

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,863
Motherfuckers.
Everybody who came to the show last 

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,771
night.
Thanks for coming out.

11
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,330
Sorry we couldn't stick around.
I have.

12
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,164
I've had a stomach bug since Thursday.
I was severely worried that I was going 

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:30,800
to shit myself during the show.
I was worried I was going to shit myself

14
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:31,634
during the UFC and the UFC.
I didn't eat all day and then right 

15
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,230
before I'm like,
God damn it,

16
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,260
I got to eat something.
Yeah,

17
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:39,950
my stomach's been fucked.
My kids had some sort of a bug,

18
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,930
so some sort of a flu.
The whole house had it.

19
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,764
My wife had it,
my daughters had it and I didn't get it 

20
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:45,334
until I got to Vegas and on Vegas I've 
worked out with delegate a Thursday and 

21
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,660
I was burping and farting.
I was like,

22
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,494
what is going on?
And then the middle of the night I woke 

23
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:53,750
up,
I was like,

24
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,790
oh,
this ain't good,

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,753
this is not good.
And then the next day I couldn't eat 

26
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,800
anything.
I couldn't.

27
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,260
Hold anything down and right before the 
UFC I said,

28
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,071
oh,
I gotta eat something.

29
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,920
So I had some case at Diaz.
I just took a chance and I was like,

30
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,200
I might very well have to sprint to the 
shitter.

31
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,010
So I got through that.
Yeah,

32
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,150
it was in the UFC.
I was really worried I was gonna have to

33
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:14,780
shoot myself,
but I pulled it out and then a wrecked a

34
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:15,770
bathroom afterwards.

35
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,180
Was that time where you can smell it 
coming out of your body and you're like,

36
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,014
what in the fuck is in there?
And then the same thing yesterday I 

37
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,493
couldn't eat all day before the show.
Couldn't eat a goddamn thing and then 

38
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,100
right before we were in the dressing 
room I go,

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,560
I got to eat something.
I'm tired or I feel kind of weak.

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,633
So I had some cheese and some meat.
So that's why I didn't stick around 

41
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,620
after the show ladies and gentlemen.
But if you came,

42
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,470
we had a good God damn time.
I figured yet sick because you made like

43
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:47,471
a beer meet fucking omelet or some shit 
to your family that.

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,200
No,
everybody got sick from school,

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,250
little kids,
man,

46
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,084
they just get sick.
There's a bunch of them together and 

47
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,990
they just somehow or another.
You ever think about that?

48
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,150
Like who?
Who's the first person who got VD?

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,220
That'd be one dirty motherfucker.
That was number of.

50
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,280
That has to be a sanction because he 
knows kid.

51
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,550
There's one person like VD,
right?

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,370
Like that had to come from an individual
first,

53
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,170
right?
I mean it's some.

54
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,093
Every coal has to come from somewhere.
Apparently a lot of the calls we get 

55
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,414
come from agriculture.
That's why it's all like swine flu and 

56
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:20,804
shit like that.
The white man brought it here to the 

57
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,130
Indians will be like,
hey,

58
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,964
how you doing?
And then they're just sick as fuck and 

59
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,451
die.
Dude.

60
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,100
We went over that the other day and a 
podcast.

61
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,963
Ninety percent of all native Americans 
were wiped out by diseases that they 

62
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:36,340
didn't have an immune system for.
When the Europeans came to the 1500.

63
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,350
So I can wipe any more weight.
Didn't actually killed in battle.

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,593
No,
no,

65
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,650
no more of them died by disease.
Believe it or not.

66
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,693
Fucking 90 percent of the population.
It's really crazy where she get that 

67
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:53,330
from the library.
We're not doing that today.

68
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:56,660
Eddie Bravo.
We're not doing that today.

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,583
What figure

70
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,020
library.com.
Yo.

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,400
So a UFC 207.
That was one of the.

72
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,013
One of the craziest events of all time 
and watching that main event was it was 

73
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,940
like there was.
It was surreal.

74
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,230
First of all,
it's surreal because I was.

75
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,100
My body was all weirded out because I 
was a little out of it.

76
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,220
What about the shit all over my chair,
but it was also,

77
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:29,221
it was just bizarre.
That was the least competitive like main

78
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,444
event other than although in Mcgregor,
but that was one dynamic shot to the 

79
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,170
chin that knocked him out.
Like everything about that was off.

80
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,680
Can you knit?
Can you think about another main event,

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,420
championship level where it was that 
kind of big of a discrepancy?

82
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,254
You know what I'm saying?
Like it wasn't even a fight and I think 

83
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,553
leading up to it,
there was some kind of red flags that 

84
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,100
you saw leading up to it.

85
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,420
If you think back now that we should 
throw,

86
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,550
everybody said right physically,
physically,

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,670
physically.
She looked great,

88
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,000
but like what's,
what kind of sparring was she doing?

89
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,834
You know,
one of the things I was thinking when 

90
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,944
she was hitting pads,
she's sitting there hitting pads with 

91
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,460
Edmond.
I was like,

92
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,030
they're standing right in front of each 
other.

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,430
Like she's not moving.
She's just hitting pads,

94
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,761
pop,
pop,

95
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,061
pop,
pop,

96
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:13,890
pop,
pop up of.

97
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,880
Tough to tell though,
right?

98
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,360
Because sometimes they do it for the 
camera.

99
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,520
If the countdown crews there,
you don't want to show your new shit.

100
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,220
But also what did people think was gonna
Happen?

101
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,950
Like did you think this whole time when 
she's shooting these movies,

102
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:28,951
doing southern admin her come up with a 
plan for her to stick on the outside jab

103
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,920
and move.
That's not,

104
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,300
that's not in her DNA anyway.

105
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,360
She had to close the distance and 
clench,

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,300
you know,
shouldn't be the only plant.

107
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,130
The idea of standing with Amanda Nunez 
is just ridiculous.

108
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,680
The difference in punching power is like
literally doubled,

109
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,753
but we've seen her fight take punches 
before who a batch could hit pretty 

110
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,190
hard.
I'm not saying similar,

111
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,020
but no,
I'm saying what bench did.

112
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,860
She has decent power and she's a very 
aggressive.

113
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,350
She throws volume strikes,
but she throws her arms.

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,800
She doesn't hit nearly as hard as Amanda
and Amanda.

115
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,160
Torques or whole body in his shit.
I agree Jo.

116
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,010
I mean it's,
it's,

117
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,843
it's and batches arm for this long and 
Dan got damn telephone poles and that's 

118
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,600
all fine,
but don't you think the game plan should

119
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:16,000
have been get her to the ground and she 
tried that a little bit.

120
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,410
She didn't.
She was already lit up.

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,020
She wasn't there though mentally that 
that's why I'm saying there's,

122
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:23,350
there's things leading up to it and I 
think the biggest red red flag for me,

123
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,543
and you know Dana better than anyone,
he's a promoter through and through one 

124
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,410
of the,
if not the best of all time.

125
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,090
I can't think of another one.
Don King I guess,

126
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,580
but still for him to say,
yeah,

127
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,580
you can skip all the media shit and just
focus on the fight.

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,451
I was like,
God,

129
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:38,284
that just doesn't seem right.
You know why she's managed by or she's 

130
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,200
handled by William Morris Endeavor.
Wme.

131
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,230
Wme owns UFC.
Now I'm aware of the shore.

132
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,093
That's what.
That's the only thing that was his 

133
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,800
decision was his decision.
He goes,

134
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:54,220
I'm going to let we agreed to this.
It was in our contracts.

135
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,510
One time thing.
I'll never do it again.

136
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:56,470
I thought,
God damn,

137
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:58,220
that is so.
She must've put it in the contract.

138
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,050
She must've said,
this is what I want to do.

139
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,270
I don't want to talk to any media.
I just want to go to red flag.

140
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,560
Do you not have connor did it?
I mean,

141
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,000
connor doesn't have the choice coming 
into connor said it,

142
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,490
but if connor did it,
have connor said,

143
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,530
fuck all this fucking media.

144
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm going to.
I'm going to train.

145
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,910
He would never do that.
If he did,

146
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
I'd have no problem.
Red flagged out to anyone involved at 

147
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,730
all.
Dana this say it's all good.

148
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,350
Don't do anything.
Here's the thing.

149
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,670
She goes out,
she goes out,

150
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,070
grabs hold of Man Nunez,
flips her on her head.

151
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,320
Semi unconscious,
catches her in an arm bar.

152
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,290
She's the new champ and 35 seconds.
You're not saying this.

153
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,080
I disagree.
Oh,

154
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,933
you wouldn't say there's a red flag.
If she went out and dominated it and 

155
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,860
then got an arm bar in the first round,
you would definitely not say that.

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,913
Skipping the media is a red flag,
so then she'll only saying it because 

157
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,470
this is like armchair quarterbacking.
It's not though,

158
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,190
because that says a red flag before this
because if she.

159
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,053
So she did interviews afterwards.
Let's say she went out the dominator in 

160
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,640
a minute submitted and then she did 
interviews afterwards.

161
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,800
That's a little different.
You know what I'm saying?

162
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,170
Because she just said I'm not doing any 
meat at all.

163
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,303
Even post post.
Well she doesn't want to talk after 

164
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,514
that.
I mean why would you want the other 

165
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,870
thing in the whole cell on this?
Was she serious?

166
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,730
Now she.
Oh my God.

167
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,180
She's focused knowing that you serious 
now the whole thing.

168
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,060
The whole thing was like this big 
obvious marketing perspective,

169
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,380
like a promotional Hollywood 
perspective.

170
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,240
Like they had the movie,
which is a really good guy.

171
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,074
He pumped up like that whole thing about
her coming back and they lift up the 

172
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,050
garage doors,
see are working out really hard and it's

173
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,110
what they did is they created a great 
hype piece.

174
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,080
You know,
if you're in the Ronda Rousey business.

175
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,460
Exactly.
Amanda Nunez going,

176
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
what exactly did you get?
My best was the best.

177
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:41,714
Was there a picture of promoting this 
UFC and there's a picture of Ronda and 

178
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:44,590
her fight.

179
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,570
Karen Ronda and the street clothes goes.
She's back to oh seven.

180
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,980
It's like,
fuck man.

181
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,600
What about Amanda?
When I say in this crazy mixture,

182
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,650
who did that picture that he was an 
official UFC,

183
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,630
UFC kind of a social media post.
Wow.

184
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,890
It's crazy man,
because now what do you do?

185
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,160
It's also crazy because it's crazy for a
marketing perspective.

186
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,280
I mean a lot of people thought that 
Rhonda was going to win a lot of people.

187
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,930
I was 100 percent.
Who the fuck knows me too?

188
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,090
That's exactly how I felt when I was 
watching that fight play out.

189
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,710
I was like,
who the fuck knows?

190
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,390
I mean,
you could see.

191
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,283
Look,
Rhonda looked like she was in amazing 

192
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,174
shape.
You think about the things that Ron has 

193
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,870
been able to do in the past to like 
Sarah Mcmahon,

194
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,210
you would think,
well maybe she ties her up in a clench.

195
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,050
Blasts or the need of the body flips her
on her back and arm bars or who the fuck

196
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,040
knows if she gets you on the ground?
Her arm bar technique is outstanding.

197
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,570
It's just some of the best,
if not the best I've ever seen that that

198
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,250
could have happened,
but it was so.

199
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,470
Who the fuck knows?
But the moment she got hit,

200
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,693
she's not moving her head at all.
She's standing straight up in the air 

201
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,023
and then I see her legs get close 
together and that's when you know 

202
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:53,150
someone's really hurt when someone gets 
lit up and then they start moving,

203
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:56,850
but their legs are too close together.
She's not working right.

204
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,610
It's not like they kind of know what to 
do,

205
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:02,860
but it's just not.
They're not their balances and good.

206
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:03,694
There was no head movement.
She was probably hurt with like the 

207
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,490
second or third punch that Amanda hit 
her with.

208
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,160
She was probably on Queer Street,
woke her up.

209
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,350
She didn't know where she was until she 
got it.

210
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,300
Joe,
look at that when she got hit.

211
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,081
When you go,
Ooh,

212
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,100
she's hurt.
She's hurt.

213
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,880
Look at her face and you even said it 
yourself.

214
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:21,714
She threw up and kick.
She threw some kicks to try to keep 

215
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,950
Amanda off.
I think she didn't realize.

216
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,870
I think when Amanda Hits Girls,
they just go,

217
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,700
Holy Shit.
Yup.

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,100
But what else would you.
What else would you expect in that?

219
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,080
You know what I'm saying,
like you don't realize to get hit,

220
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:34,914
but you hear all the criticism.
Now have a Edmond who's obviously a 

221
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,710
terrible coach,
but take that out of it.

222
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,170
If if you bring a horse to water,
you can't drink,

223
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,930
there's nothing else you can do.
So if mentally she doesn't want to be in

224
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,764
there,
do you think we didn't want to be in 

225
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,393
there?

226
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,010
It didn't look like the same tenacity 
that were used to seeing challenged.

227
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,863
Super tenacious until she got cracked.
Joe Is 44 seconds when more than that 

228
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,140
First Jab.
She got hurt with a right hand.

229
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:04,900
Maybe 10:50.
We didn't watch the whole fight fight.

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
It's 47 seconds.
Go.

231
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,693
You good?
Uh,

232
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,280
it's on youtube.
It's everywhere.

233
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,840
Doesn't matter.
Fighters before,

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,950
like,
what do you think it is?

235
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,840
I don't understand why.
Why are you even saying this?

236
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,883
You see that she got hit and she,
she got hurt and you've been hitting 

237
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,940
hurt before.
Know what happens.

238
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,410
You just don't know what the fuck's 
going on.

239
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,723
Correct.
I think however that jab put her lights 

240
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,330
out.
It wasn't just a Jap.

241
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,170
Did she hit her with a Jap that landed 
the first one?

242
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,600
She went into Cape closed desk.
First Jab landed,

243
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,280
but then she got hit with many punches.

244
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't understand why you're confused 
as to the result.

245
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,260
I mean she got hit by the biggest power 
puncher in 135 pound division by far.

246
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,050
There's not a single girl in that 
division that punches like Amanda does.

247
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,273
I agree with that,
but not that it wasn't a right hand 

248
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,770
right away.
Yes it was.

249
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,280
It was a jab right away,
but a right hand right after that,

250
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,283
once,
once run to try to close the distance 

251
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,513
was 40 seconds of Amanda Punching Rhonda
in the face until Rhonda would out like 

252
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:00,804
the idea that some.
Something's confusing that she didn't 

253
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,654
look like she wanted to be there.
She was hurt multiple times in those 

254
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,130
exchanges.
I just don't.

255
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,290
I think we're doing a lot of armchair 
quarterbacking,

256
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,940
right?
Who the fuck knows what was going on?

257
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,200
Know what you're speculating whether or 
not she wanted to be there after she got

258
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:16,890
hit.

259
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,760
The problem is she might've been just 
rocked and there's also the reality that

260
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,594
she was knocked out fucking cold a year 
ago and it was a bad beating and then a 

261
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,144
vicious head kick and there was 
something about those Goddamn neck 

262
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,284
kicks.
Man.

263
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,590
There's something about when when 
someone shins you in the neck,

264
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,470
like she got shin and your whole body 
just goes limp.

265
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,330
You're doing so much damage in there,
but she had a 411 days off.

266
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,700
That's nice.
I think it was just bad strategy.

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,633
It's really simple.
It's just the strategy was not good as 

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,870
possible to all those things.
Look,

269
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,830
I was the one who said like way early 
on,

270
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,350
I think Amanda is our most dangerous 
challenge because Amanda hits so fucking

271
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,470
heart after she starts Sara Mcmahon and 
when she,

272
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,970
when she was beaten up,
Michelle was like,

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Jesus said she punches harder than 
anybody in that division.

274
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,030
She's got like dangerous weapons with 
her hands,

275
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,193
but I think I really think there's a lot
of people that get killed like that and 

276
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,320
they are never the same again.
They can't absorb a shot anymore.

277
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,453
And then also in your brain.
According to chocolate Delhi he was 

278
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,580
telling me about it like,
because chuck was so tough that he would

279
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,850
like just fucking use his chin,
sort of like Linacre does.

280
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:25,684
Like it's part of his defense,
like knowing that he can absorb shots 

281
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,670
and after a while his brain was like,
hey man,

282
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,430
fuck you.
Like his brain was just like,

283
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,410
we're not going to do this,
and yeah,

284
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,420
just shuts off early.
I also think tech to you,

285
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,800
there's a certain level where they're,
where they're that great and you look at

286
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,634
it like a tiger woods or Mike Tyson.
When that foundation get the little 

287
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,510
shaky,
there's just never the same.

288
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,290
Yeah,
that's true.

289
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,123
It's just never.
They're like,

290
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm not God's gift to the use.
Exactly.

291
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,870
MMA gods don't give a shit.
Exactly,

292
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:53,704
and then like we said,
even if she was undefeated and she 

293
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,243
fought,
Nunez Nunez going to give her a problem 

294
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,140
because if you watched like the Misha 
tate fight me should take.

295
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,660
Like,
even though she beat me,

296
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,520
she would take twice me,
she'd take,

297
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,354
gave her a hard time.
There was some good scrambles and be 

298
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,753
state hitter with some punches.
If Amanda Hits You with punches like 

299
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,414
that,
you're fuck.

300
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,520
You can't make mistakes.
You're in trouble.

301
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,260
Yeah.
She's like a lot of ways.

302
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,980
It's like a female rumble and that she 
might not be able to close the show with

303
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:21,490
one shot like rumble can,
but if you make mistakes,

304
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,620
you get stung so bad and you see it with
Sara mcmann fights.

305
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,500
A perfect example,
she cracked Sarah with a right hand.

306
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,190
You see her.
Her whole face is like,

307
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,830
what the f?
Like nobody hits them like that.

308
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,693
Nobody and she's long.
Amanda catches you on the end of those 

309
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,223
punches too.
She.

310
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,153
She's great at distance.
I also think that the game is evolving 

311
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,680
so fast.
Where Amanda,

312
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,130
all she cares about is being champ.
All she does is trained.

313
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:49,640
That's the only thing she gives a fuck 
about.

314
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,060
I think we saw the same thing in the 
dominant coups,

315
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,300
cody garbrandt fight.
All cody wants to do is be champ.

316
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,200
Dominic's doing analyst work for.
So I think there's,

317
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,920
there's this kind of change of hands 
right now where you're seeing these guys

318
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:03,754
who are,
they're all in and that's what you have 

319
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,730
to do to be in this game this day and 
age.

320
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,530
Guys are too good there too.
Good.

321
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,870
And I think you're dead right?
I think you're dead right about that.

322
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,530
Oh,
here we go.

323
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,000
We'll watch the whole thing live.
Now.

324
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,490
Give us some volume.
Young Jamie.

325
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,770
So here it is.
So that jab landed with five second.

326
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,340
This jab right there.
Watch this.

327
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,130
She stopped her right there.
Yeah.

328
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,540
See,
so she's stunning.

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,120
Ten seconds in,
we're at four.

330
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,340
Forty three were 15 seconds in and she's
already.

331
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,530
She's fucked right there.
She's fuck.

332
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,180
That was a super hard and this is bad to
watch.

333
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,500
It's real hard to boom to the body to.
She ripped that shot to the body.

334
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,700
So like the idea that she didn't want to
be there 10 seconds into the fight,

335
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,560
she didn't know what the fuck was going.
Oh,

336
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,020
they're left right hand,
right hand behind it.

337
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,250
This is horrific,
man.

338
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,090
It's tough.
Boom,

339
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,933
boom.

340
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,310
God Damn.

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,820
Great stoppage.
But God damn Amanda Nunez as good.

342
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,000
She put a finger up to her mouth,
walked right up to Edmond,

343
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,270
looked at show gangster.
You know,

344
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,030
she's in another dimension.
Got No doubt about it.

345
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,420
You just know about.
She's tough.

346
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,373
And also she's got that thick old neck 
that helps the got long Amanda's arms 

347
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,480
and she's great at keeping distance,
not crowding herself.

348
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Amanda has a wide shoulders and that 
helps too.

349
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:31,340
And then long arms as well and she's got
awesome distance man.

350
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,174
Her,
her ability to catch you at the very 

351
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,604
back of the punches for all the power is
because if you're punching someone and 

352
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,660
you want to eat them here,
but they just move forward a foot,

353
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,020
you lose.
You lose like 90 percent of your power.

354
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,893
Different game.
Do you think Amanda can fight guys that 

355
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:48,590
went 35?
Well,

356
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,540
bad guys,
good guys.

357
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,453
No trains with super high level guys 
like she's not going to be Tj dillashaw 

358
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,700
on top 10 now it's changed now man.
People,

359
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,563
I think if you asked them that same 
question three or four years ago would 

360
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:02,654
have a different answer,
but like that division is so stacked 

361
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,430
now.
It's like one.

362
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,090
One 35 first opened up.
It was in the UFC was.

363
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,490
There wasn't as many guys that would 
that elite.

364
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,653
He know there's like even watch the guys
who were really good improve like you 

365
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,124
saw the cody fight where he was fucking 
fantastic against dominick goddamn good 

366
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,440
to Tj.
Look against Linacre.

367
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,980
Completely known five linacre nullify 
them when a girl.

368
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,963
He's like one of the best examples of a 
guy with absolutely freakish physical 

369
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:36,770
attributes of fucking iron jaw,
iron.

370
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,470
John never even seen the guy get hurt.
He gets hit by everybody,

371
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,150
gets head kicked,
he gets punched.

372
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,163
Rob said he hit him with the hardest 
punch he ever hit anybody with his life 

373
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,343
and he goes,
he didn't even knowledge that he hit 

374
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,350
him.
He just walked right forward.

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,150
He's and he hit him with a body shot.
Felt like you get hit by a car.

376
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,463
He didn't look like that Linacre.
I don't think that same linacre showed 

377
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,000
up on Saturday or Friday and teaching 
all of them.

378
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,940
He didn't have a chance,
but Lynika was very hesitant and I think

379
00:16:58,941 --> 00:16:59,774
it's because of PJ's,
the way he was fighting them with the 

380
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,310
faith that take downs,
the kicks and thrown that,

381
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,310
that head kick to the body kick,
but he was very tentative.

382
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,230
He got,
he got out beat.

383
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,210
You throw them in the truck.
Almost had them in a capsule.

384
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,550
I thought he was gonna.
Go for the twister.

385
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,990
I was like,
oh my God,

386
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,080
if he goes to the twister,
but he got went to the capsize it,

387
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,260
but I'm like,
I looked it up.

388
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,360
Like he's not going to tap to that.
It's just pay a stomp.

389
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,080
He needed to stomp down.
Tj looked amazing.

390
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,100
Amazing.
Yeah.

391
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:28,430
And the timing and those takedowns like 
lightning bolts,

392
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,640
like it looks like he's throwing a punch
and he's underneath Ya.

393
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,950
Just so nasty.
So fast,

394
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,270
man.
But God damn cody Garbrandt the fuck God

395
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,620
damn.
I'll admit I.

396
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,830
I said I think cody's going to be champ.
Just not just not yet.

397
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,320
He's going to be your champ,
but he's not ready for dom yet.

398
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,660
No opening round was like,
what the fuck?

399
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,400
He's so busy mimic.
He's doing break dancing.

400
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,323
He's doing push ups and shit.
He fucked with Dominic's head and that 

401
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,340
was one of the things that I was 
thinking was like,

402
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,970
this kid's been in a lot of street 
fights,

403
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,630
like I don't know if this trash talk is 
going to work on him the way it works on

404
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:01,440
other guys.

405
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,140
Like he said,
he was fine in there like I asked them,

406
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,520
but it's like I liked that.
He goes,

407
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,780
I feel calm.
He goes,

408
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,490
I know I can stay calm when that's going
on.

409
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,620
And I think he's just like this young 
hungry dude who,

410
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,933
he took it personal and a lot of guys 
get real emotional and I was worried 

411
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,790
that cody come out super emotional,
just get like taken down.

412
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,100
Just real emotional,
like A.

413
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,933
Although David against me Gregor,
we're just forgets about his technique 

414
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,870
and rushes and gets marked.
But dude,

415
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,170
he just took all that and the best 
performance.

416
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,153
I mean,
can you name another performance like 

417
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,300
that where a guy he remembered he was 
even number one contenders,

418
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,310
five or six in the world that he was 
eight.

419
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,320
Was He a.
I thought I moved to six maybe,

420
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,910
but that might have been some 
shenanigans.

421
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,093
Just who knows that the cheeto finger 
rankings but still motherfucker went 

422
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,900
from five,
six rank number one.

423
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,510
I'm like,
that's a big strategy.

424
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,620
Handily.
It wasn't a Thompson one round.

425
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,573
Yeah.
And,

426
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,240
and cody dropped him,
heard him.

427
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:56,701
We,
we don't,

428
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,160
we still don't exactly know where the 
cut came from.

429
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,690
Some people were saying it came from a 
punch.

430
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,730
I heard people say online say came from 
a Kyc,

431
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,190
definitely not drop,
but the guys in the trucks that it was a

432
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,970
headbutt truck boys were off because I 
heard when they said that,

433
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,270
I'm like,
what the fuck are they watch?

434
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:09,871
Yeah,
they,

435
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,530
they,
uh,

436
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,170
pulled it up for me,
but it's hard.

437
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,250
See,
while the fights going on,

438
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,173
they'll do that and I'll tell me it's a 
headbutt and see I have two monitors in 

439
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,804
front of me.
I've one right here and then I've won 

440
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,530
over the side and they'll say like,
look on monitor be,

441
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,330
and then they'll show it to me,
but I can't really.

442
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,360
It's hard for me to do that while I'm 
watching the actual fight,

443
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,700
you know?
So they'll show it to me and I usually,

444
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,534
I just take their word for it,
but occasionally I think in the replay 

445
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,374
that they showed and maybe they saw 
different and it show the correct one 

446
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,670
three play that they showed it was 
definitely wasn't a headbutt well,

447
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,340
they definitely did collide heads for 
sure for sure.

448
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,230
And so who knows?
It was hard to tell,

449
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,840
but who gives a fuck either.
It was a big ass cut,

450
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,830
big ass cut on Dom's eyebrow and he got 
drunk.

451
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,380
How good is dominick?
Cruz took a punch to but he gets in,

452
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,570
he gets cracked,
his legs go stiff.

453
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:55,404
He goes down and a couple of times cody 
like acted almost like you wasn't going 

454
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,014
to follow him to the ground and and beat
on them on the ground and almost acted 

455
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,840
like he was done.

456
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,773
He was like calling them up or like a 
Mark Hunt kind of walk off caleb better 

457
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,120
get on them.
Didn't even,

458
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,954
didn't even make an attempt to it.
Well maybe he doesn't want to have 

459
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:15,060
anything to do with the ground.
Maybe he feels like that's where dominic

460
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,890
might have a chance to shut down their 
son.

461
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,910
I don't know what dominick Cruz wanting 
to punish them to.

462
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,100
Maybe just how many crews have any 
submissions?

463
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,350
Dominick Cruz is really good on the 
ground.

464
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,253
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

465
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,230
Record.
Does he have any submission?

466
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,064
Yeah,
he has some missions for usually from 

467
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:30,744
guillotines though.
Back in the day was his Jujitsu is 

468
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,450
really good.
Trust me.

469
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,010
No,
no,

470
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,090
no.
He's a black belt for sure.

471
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,620
I've seen him compete in tournaments and
uh,

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,630
any wrestled as well.
He's a wrestler for a guy not to go down

473
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:47,380
in his guard.
That's some shit.

474
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,180
That's like some conor Mcgregor Diaz 
Shit were like,

475
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,150
I just don't want.
I can lose two easily down there.

476
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,043
Well,
I mean it might not have been that at 

477
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,630
all.
It might have been even more simple.

478
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,980
That's a lost jamie naked.
Yeah.

479
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,200
So he's got a rear naked there.
He's got.

480
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:05,330
So he lost to a.
he's got one room naked guard.

481
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,980
You're right.
Well who knows,

482
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,960
so you don't,
you still,

483
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,910
you don't know what he could do.
But the bottom line was,

484
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:10,744
cody wanted to keep the fight standing.
Can you just want to punish him and hit 

485
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,234
him so hard?
That might've thought the fight was 

486
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:17,710
over.
He,

487
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,100
he seemed to have the answer for 
Dominic.

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,890
I mean at least it worked for cody 
wasn't or wasn't not.

489
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:27,850
I'm no stryker that he made dominant 
come to him and it's different when.

490
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,260
Correct.
Is that what it was?

491
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,011
Well,
sort of,

492
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,080
but it's also you got to give credit to 
his teams.

493
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:32,914
He,
Justin Buchholz and those guys had been 

494
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:36,040
imitating.
They fought dom so many times,

495
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,520
six times and imitate his movements so 
they can mimic his shit.

496
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,160
So when they're sparring,
they do that,

497
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,073
that fake stuff that like false start 
because dom does this thing where false 

498
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,120
starts and then he'd start and you never
know which one's going to be a kick,

499
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,780
which I could see a lot of like,
like patterns at dom throws up.

500
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,913
So they figured out how to do that and 
they mimicked and they watched him so 

501
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,274
many times that they can get it down to 
a t and cody didn't bind into the 

502
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,580
faints.
You'll just like,

503
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,590
come on,
if you're going to come on,

504
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,453
come in within this range,
and he kept baiting him and they'd make 

505
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,410
it count.

506
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,243
Yeah.
The bottom line is if his brain's not 

507
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,780
confused and he just knows that in these
exchanges,

508
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,120
dom's going to be there and he's going 
to do some,

509
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,383
you know,
he's got some really unpredictable 

510
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,570
movement.
Dom does,

511
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,880
but he does like a bunch of things a 
lot.

512
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,840
And then commits.
Yeah.

513
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:24,250
And so he timed those things and caught 
them with some fucking vicious punches,

514
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:24,971
man.
Yeah.

515
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:25,481
And uh,
yeah,

516
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,970
he wasn't like dom fights a lot of guys 
and they're like,

517
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,760
what the fuck did that?
Chris Tucker movie gets hit in the face.

518
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,594
That guy,
which one y'all kicked me and you don't 

519
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,470
know where it's coming from,
but he just,

520
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,423
uh,
he just garbage and just never bought 

521
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,500
it.
I'm thinking,

522
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,423
wait for you to commit.
You can do all that jazz and I'm just 

523
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:43,160
going to wait right here.
It's also a guy's been boxed.

524
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,640
And when he was real young talking about
last night.

525
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,880
Yeah,
it was 32 and two amateur record.

526
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:49,714
You look at that,
but in the UFC compared to other 

527
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:56,800
fighters that boxing comes in,
this huge.

528
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,330
He was coaching.
He was.

529
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,570
Cody was catching dominick Cruz on the 
way out.

530
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,690
[inaudible],
which that's a lot of people don't catch

531
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,270
them on the way and never see it.
No,

532
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,233
he was catching them on the way up and 
the speed and precision of punching 

533
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,020
power.
Glorious for five rounds and then people

534
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:15,880
forget.
Cody in high school,

535
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:16,714
he,
I think he was first team all state out 

536
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,330
of Ohio,
which is a big deal out there.

537
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,160
He had scholarships,
played division one or I'm sorry,

538
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,980
compete in Division One.
Wrestling was like,

539
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:24,814
Nah,
I'm just going to fight professionally 

540
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,203
full time.
That's what kind of stud you're dealing 

541
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:28,924
with.
His uncle was an alternate for the 

542
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,414
Olympic boxing team,
so I mean he comes from a long line of 

543
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,160
just savages to pretty crazy.
Yeah.

544
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,290
This his countdown piece was pretty 
amazing.

545
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,251
I,
I didn't see it.

546
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,251
I wish that a fighter's appreciate the 
science of boxing more.

547
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,730
When GSP

548
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,580
one of those fights he trained with 
Freddie Roach and it came back with that

549
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,070
Fucking Jab.
It made waves,

550
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:55,370
but a lot of people didn't copy that.
Arloski did.

551
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,450
First it was like,
Nah,

552
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,820
let's just go boom.
You know,

553
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,673
he's like,
Holy Amanda Nunez boxing trainer is 

554
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,630
Howard Davis,
his son.

555
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,130
Okay.
And American top team.

556
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:04,964
So she's,
I don't know why people don't 

557
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:09,510
incorporate it that much.
More so much to learn.

558
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:13,640
You said there's three levels of 
striking pretty much in the UFC.

559
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:16,250
You know,
we had a discussion last night when,

560
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,900
when,
uh,

561
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,860
the Jujitsu Guy,
when 70 came in,

562
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,233
you know,
he came in and he was a great Jujitsu 

563
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:22,480
guy.
He wanted a,

564
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,850
what's his name,
the guy that triangle jail from the top.

565
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,320
Damien.
Damien Maia.

566
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,213
That guy came in.
He went the first couple of matches 

567
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,960
Jujitsu.
Then somebody told him he was a boxer.

568
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,410
He started getting lit up and it 
happened.

569
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,450
He's fucking back to just grab your leg 
and it's all under Rhonda.

570
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,050
100 percent.
Rhonda just said,

571
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:45,411
okay,
I'm gonna.

572
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:46,760
Take a year off.
I'm gonna.

573
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,530
Go to the Olympic wrestling a facility 
wherever.

574
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,470
Just focus on wrestling.
Still work on your striking.

575
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,210
Go with Duane Ludwig.
That would be awesome.

576
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:58,430
Or,
or Rafael Cordeiro mix it up,

577
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,443
you know what I mean?
You've got to change shit up now 

578
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,420
obviously.
Um,

579
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,450
but wrestling should be the focus.
When you see a Rhonda Rousey Promo,

580
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,220
you shouldn't see her getting mets.
You should see her shooting,

581
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,880
getting the clench.
Double leg,

582
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,300
take down singles.
It should be wrestling every day.

583
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,700
Twice a day for.
But think about her camp,

584
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:20,000
her whole camp.
It's just a boxing gym.

585
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,340
Those are head coaches,
a boxing coach.

586
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,510
So they want her to be this boxer.
People sold her as the next Mike Tyson.

587
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,740
So you have all that come in.

588
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,573
And she was Merkin girls.
Remember I was on board till I'm like 

589
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,281
damn,
are striking.

590
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,620
She's not going to bitches out.
Then you start to the level.

591
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:36,370
It's like the devil she's knocking them 
out at.

592
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,010
Yeah.
But,

593
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,571
but,
but I,

594
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:39,260
I think the media and a lot of people 
are like,

595
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,000
Dang she,
she's a knockout artists.

596
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,300
So you hear those in her canceling your 
knockout artists.

597
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,400
You can strike with anyone.
Right.

598
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,670
And her coach like,
look,

599
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,533
that was always the case.
You remember when Gerald fought in the 

600
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:52,760
UFC?
It was always the case when Gerald is a.

601
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,370
was he a black male back then or brown 
belt?

602
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,660
It was a brown belt.
Really Good Jujitsu guy though,

603
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,640
but his fucking striking coach had him 
convinced that he was a boxer.

604
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,713
He's like,
you're going to go out there and get a 

605
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:03,854
kick,
and I remember Eddie and I would train 

606
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:07,760
them and watch them hit the bag and hit 
the meds and stuff,

607
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:08,594
and I was like,
man,

608
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,670
there are some scary guys in the UFC.

609
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,890
And he got a real scary one.
And Josh Thompson,

610
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,990
Josh Thompson was like,
Yep,

611
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,930
none of that deck I take.
No,

612
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:18,560
no,
it wasn't.

613
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,410
Didn't go down like that and ain't got 
nothing happening.

614
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,303
No.
What ended up happening as Gerald's 

615
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:26,090
Jujitsu jokes treatment as we're talking
about his.

616
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,300
He was my first student,
my first before 10th planet.

617
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,373
I was teaching Jujitsu to a guy named 
Gerald Street and he was a blue belt at 

618
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,220
the time and I brought them up,
shut him up.

619
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,570
He got really good at the twister,
really good at rubber guard,

620
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,310
rubber.
He first meet Hook,

621
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,440
rubber guard,
triangle and MMA history.

622
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,610
Uh,
in a gladiator challenge show,

623
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,420
he was kicking ass and then he fired 
John Silva in England,

624
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,570
in London and it was a spectacular 
match.

625
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,360
A Joe showed that fight to,
uh,

626
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,390
Dana White.
Dana white game was shot game.

627
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:58,380
Josh Thompson.
Boom,

628
00:26:58,381 --> 00:26:59,214
right off the bat he started,
he started working more with pie with 

629
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,840
this,
this Muay Thai coach,

630
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,890
and it was six months.

631
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,870
He was trying to six months with them.
Right.

632
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,970
And you'd been doing any.
He wrestled in high school as well.

633
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:12,500
So He'd been grappling a total at that 
point.

634
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Joey breeding into the mic.
I'm hearing some for sure Joe.

635
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,940
I'm was confused in my head too worried.
Right.

636
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,380
But anyways,
so anyway,

637
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,610
so he and,
and it's an interesting point.

638
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:32,490
I was just thinking about this.
It's the exact same thing.

639
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,510
It's when I'm,
when I'm striking like let's say I got,

640
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,453
I'm a striker,
Muy Thai came in and he'd been doing 

641
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:43,200
more type for 10 years and he wanted to 
learn the ground and he was doing mma.

642
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,940
He's already fighting MMA.
It comes up a lot.

643
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,820
I'm going to show them Jujitsu.
I'm going to be in this corner,

644
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,260
I'm not going to be telling him to take 
his ass down and work up into Jitsu,

645
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,190
pull guard.

646
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,023
I'm like,
you just.

647
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,680
It has been six months this relaxed,
but what I was getting involved,

648
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:03,681
but I want to see is that dude when with
his tie and it gives me another fight to

649
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,940
get his Jujitsu and again,
the longer that you.

650
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:09,200
The jujitsu in my eyes,
the batter we,

651
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,830
whew.
We got away with another one.

652
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,813
Now we have another four or five months 
to work on the Jujitsu pointed way of 

653
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,280
looking at it,
but there's a lot of stars out.

654
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,114
There's a lot of strikers striking 
coaches out there that will take some 

655
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,174
grappler in,
teach them striking for six months and 

656
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:24,504
then a corner him in an mma fight and 
like instruct him to stand with this 

657
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,680
amount of.
Pull the guy to the side say,

658
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,240
dude,
don't listen to this guy.

659
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,370
You're not standing.
Do you remember what he said?

660
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
You know how many times I had to say 
that up?

661
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,810
Like my guys,
I go,

662
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,300
tell him,
listen to this motherfucker.

663
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
He's taking this motherfucker even came 
out.

664
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,270
Remember what he said.
Do you remember what he said to them?

665
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,860
Was Ready?
Yes.

666
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,260
In six months instead was Bangkok.
Greg is going to go out there,

667
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,880
so this is what ends up happening 
luckily,

668
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,650
but you know what?
It it.

669
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,370
It was a.
It was a good thing.

670
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,650
It's a good thing because this is what 
happened.

671
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,723
Is He Adam,
so believing that he was Bangkok ready 

672
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:05,250
after six months of Moitai that when he 
did the walkout in the UFC,

673
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,280
he came out with a more time to have a,
a,

674
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,820
a bicep bracelets or whatever,
the tigard dancing and doing the time.

675
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,760
He was in the octagon and did you know 
he went around the octagon and blessed.

676
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,313
Yes.
Doing that through and then Josh 

677
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,050
Thompson sitting there and I talked to 
Josh Thompson since then.

678
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,040
Josh Thompson wrestled in high school 
and he's a really good striker.

679
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,650
He was fucking up people off his back.
He was triangling people.

680
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,350
We knew all about Josh Thompson.
Gerald was not.

681
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,620
He was not in the best frame of mind for
that fight,

682
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,241
you know?
I mean,

683
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:44,400
because Josh Thompson was a fucking 
killer back then.

684
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,111
He was a kid.
Well,

685
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,680
he was in his prime back then.
That was josh when he was.

686
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,590
He was one of the top,
like five or six guys in the division.

687
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,280
UFC got rid of the 155 pound division.
It was him and Eve Edwards.

688
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,900
Yeah.
Eve Edwards knocked him out.

689
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,690
I was like,
Eve Edwards became the uncrowned king.

690
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,330
So this is what happened.
So luckily,

691
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,440
and this is according to Josh Thompson 
told me,

692
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,413
Josh goes,
dude,

693
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,660
I was so worried about a standing stop 
that when we saw the fight,

694
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,160
my whole thing was how do we know the 
whole.

695
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,033
The whole thing was for sure Josh 
Thompson is not going to want to go to 

696
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,530
the ground with Gerald.
That's where all this good shit is.

697
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,364
He's fucking people up and NMA.
All his fights up until the USC was 

698
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:27,814
fucking people up with the Jujitsu.
So how are we going to get the fight to 

699
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,210
the ground?
We were thinking about pulling.

700
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,410
How elaborate a unorthodox Cardpool,
how are we going to do it?

701
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,300
That's what I was thinking like six 
months.

702
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,800
I go,
I know he thinks he's Bangkok.

703
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:39,670
Right?
That's six months,

704
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,300
man.
Thank you.

705
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,650
So,
so,

706
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,740
so.
So Josh takes him down and I was sitting

707
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:49,700
there thinking,
what the fuck thing?

708
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,063
He takes a general dental because he's 
so worried about his tie and Gerald d 

709
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,280
right away throws up a hell fire with 
this guard.

710
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,310
He threw a lot of heat.
It was pretty bad ass to see,

711
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,880
but at the end of the day,
first he almost had him in an arm bar.

712
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,660
Josh pulls out and then there's like a 
scramble on the ground.

713
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,700
Gerald ghost for a leg lock because he 
finally pulls out of his garden.

714
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:14,534
Then general who was really good at like
locks and he went for a leg lock and 

715
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,630
then Josh Thompson hit him like in the 
back of the head and knocked him out.

716
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,400
Killer.
That was one of those.

717
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,380
Yeah.
That was one of those going,

718
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,610
you know,
going into a box is risky.

719
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,970
What started this all off?
Bolded.

720
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,963
Those coaches,
coaches get these fucking people 

721
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,680
convinced that there's try killer in one
particular every camp though,

722
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,514
because in every campus,
especially if you have like a superstar 

723
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,650
camp and it does come from my own 
personal experience,

724
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,650
you have a superstar wrestling coach,
boxing coach,

725
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:45,484
Jujitsu coach,
you know you're spending your time with 

726
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,980
them.
They want to see you win with,

727
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,100
with their shit.

728
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Yes.
Even coaches get tossed them off.

729
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,063
The W should be number fucking war.
It's nice when they win with some shit 

730
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,230
of course,
like fucked up.

731
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,490
Like you showed me that shit.
That's always good,

732
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:06,440
but it's all about the Goddamn w.
that's number one.

733
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,373
You gotTa have like a head coach.
You got to have a head coach that's not 

734
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,000
a striking coast.
How'd you like a head coach?

735
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,170
Matt Hume as a head coach.
You know like when he works with Dj,

736
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,580
they do everything,
you know,

737
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,740
they work on submissions together,
spar together.

738
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,574
He worked,
they work on all these different 

739
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,044
techniques and it's total technique and 
tactics oriented conversations in how 

740
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,120
many other though in the world?
Like five one.

741
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,790
His hat is honestly this like in my 
mind,

742
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,770
it's like he,
if he's not number one,

743
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,980
it's him and for us a hobby,
but I count two that can do it all,

744
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,200
that really

745
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,033
know the game in and out.
Can do a game plan from standing to 

746
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,540
restroom to grapple.
Yeah,

747
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,660
I mean I think the one guy might be 
better for you.

748
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,750
One guy might be better for the other,
but those are the.

749
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,623
Those are the top dogs too because 
there's such wizards on the ground are 

750
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,700
wizards to it and they.
They could physically do it too.

751
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,640
That's like a big part of it and plus 
they know that transition.

752
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,740
Like sometimes if you go to a pure 
Jujitsu guy,

753
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,490
he's like,
dude,

754
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,130
this isn't gonna work.
If I commit both hands this,

755
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:04,964
I'm going to blast in the face.
Do you remember what George Greer Gel 

756
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,900
like?
He was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu

757
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,400
back when there was very few black 
belts,

758
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,234
but then he became.
He wanted to stand and bang with 

759
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,260
everybody and that was his thing.
Yeah.

760
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,290
Became this thing standing in banging 
and that's.

761
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,870
That happens so often.
It's,

762
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,090
it's so crazy and it's so rare that a 
guy comes back and figures it out.

763
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:23,924
Like Damien Maia House.
Damien Maia tried it that way for 

764
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:26,300
awhile.
Yup.

765
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,670
You got sucked into it and they figured 
they ended up with Rhonda.

766
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,760
Should they took it to what says 
expression.

767
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
You go to the dance or what took you to 
the express?

768
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,523
I know what happens is a lot of early,
I show a lot of high level Jujitsu guys 

769
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:46,290
come into the UFC that the hands a Mensa
mense yeah.

770
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,540
It's like a three striking and they 
never evolved to that.

771
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,170
Now fucking striking is evolving quick,
quick.

772
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,990
You know,
it used to be that the only guys,

773
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,013
the only black belts that got to the UFC
were like the guys that were only 

774
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:07,520
dedicated their lives to.
Did you get to.

775
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,340
They just started learning and striking.
You can tell upon,

776
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,170
you can tell like,
holy shit,

777
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,180
they're just trying to fucking get some 
kind of.

778
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,090
It's obvious,
but now with,

779
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,540
there's so many goddamn black belts in 
Brazil now that it's not about.

780
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,920
It's all about,
you know,

781
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,870
here's,
here's 100 black belts in the camp.

782
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,850
We're only going to take the best 
strikers.

783
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,370
Like the fierce ones.
You know the guy,

784
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,880
the days of pure Jujitsu guys coming out
and looking like this,

785
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,980
that there are long gone now.
You can't,

786
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:36,020
you can't get,
get through the minor leagues.

787
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,130
Well,
in a way like that.

788
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,960
Your attitude is like,
I got this

789
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,400
right.
Like my forestry isn't combat.

790
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,273
I didn't write shit.
I would just go up on stage and do that 

791
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,630
in New York.
Shit to live in.

792
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,270
Yeah.
It was 50 slash 50.

793
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,480
What do you do for a living?
You do this.

794
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,050
I got really good at it,
but I couldn't make a living doing that.

795
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,783
If I'm bombing,
I could fall back to that shit and rock 

796
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:03,500
the house.
I don't work that muscle anymore.

797
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,320
Do you know what I'm saying?
When I first started comedy,

798
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:10,010
I had to go on stage every Tuesday and 
further the same fucking people.

799
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,480
So you had to write a new five minutes.
For two years I did that.

800
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,340
There was some weeks I couldn't do it,
so I just decided just to improvise.

801
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,383
I got so good at improvising and by the 
time I got to Seattle and started 

802
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,390
featuring,
I was really good improvised.

803
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,233
So what?
What are you saying about how does this 

804
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:27,944
equate to fighting?
I don't improvise no more because I got 

805
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,794
it.
When you first met me at the store 15 

806
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:34,034
years ago,
I would go onstage and do seven minutes 

807
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:37,920
of material and the rest of it is 
improvised.

808
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,450
I thought it was cool.
Right?

809
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,210
They will sheet and when it works it 
works.

810
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,590
When it doesn't work,
but I'm pretty good at it.

811
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,450
I could really improvise.
Pretty good.

812
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,830
Do I still do it today?
No,

813
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,680
because you have to evolve.
I could fall back on the dog.

814
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,620
I could fall back on my wrestling.
That's my wrestling.

815
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,483
That's my pedigree.
When me and you will feel when I call 

816
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,480
you and I make you laugh on the phone,
it's like that.

817
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,790
I didn't call you with a script when I 
call you.

818
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,430
I mean you're talking about something 
that's not a script.

819
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,290
That's me.
And you drive and getting excited,

820
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,820
right?
I got that pedigree.

821
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,940
I could rock that pedigree,
but that pedigree isn't going to take me

822
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:12,774
to the next level.
You have to sit and you have to write 

823
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,230
and you have to evolve different things.

824
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,290
So I think that when I'm a wrestler,
okay,

825
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,810
I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.
I've been doing this since I was 18.

826
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm 31 now.
I've won Abu Dhabi.

827
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,620
Dubai,
Abu Dhabi?

828
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
No,
GIP and Americans.

829
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,260
I got this.
I got these.

830
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,750
Yeah,
like two different styles of winters.

831
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,763
There's the all around the guy like Dj 
and then there's a guy like Anderson 

832
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Silva that really,
I mean he might submit people,

833
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,800
but it's so rare.
And when he submitted chell center,

834
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,250
it's almost like Chael Sonnen.
He gave it to him.

835
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,533
I mean that,
that,

836
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,930
that fucking armbar triangle combination
wasn't even locked in.

837
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,850
It wasn't even locked in.
I mean it was,

838
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,560
uh,
it was kinda over the calf a little.

839
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:55,560
It wasn't clamped down.
I mean maybe chair was so exhausted that

840
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,810
he had a tap.
But honestly,

841
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:59,050
I mean if you asked him,
he was.

842
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,100
He was pretty honest about having mental
breakdowns in fights.

843
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,933
He did it with a polo female members.
Same thing on the Anderson Silva fight 

844
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:07,661
though.
You said going in,

845
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:09,840
he and he goes,
I know I'm gonna get submitted.

846
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm get submitted.
So when he was taking down,

847
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,080
he's in this guide for like three 
minutes.

848
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:14,400
He's going,
it's just a matter of time.

849
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,140
He's going to catch me.
He's going to catch it again.

850
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,450
So again,
to understand this in silver.

851
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,733
Well,
he had been submitted a few times in 

852
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,920
fights that he was winning.
The whole thing is.

853
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,170
It's weird,
but my point is,

854
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:27,600
Anderson's never been like a great 
Jujitsu guy.

855
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,270
He's a black belt.
Tapped out Dan Henderson,

856
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,460
wherever that will beat the fuck out of 
him before.

857
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,410
But he.
It was a beautiful tape was.

858
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,580
That is true.
He did get his back and choking him out.

859
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,090
Disagree with you on that triangle.
That triangle was legitimate.

860
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,953
Let's look at it.
But a trial versus a Anderson Silva 

861
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,300
Triangle,
if I remember correctly,

862
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:50,490
it wasn't fully locked in.
There was a little bit of space.

863
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,603
It doesn't have to be fully felt like.
It depends on how much you're squeezing 

864
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,400
it lead curling's true end.
He has long legs,

865
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,380
so due to.
That's true.

866
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,420
Good point.
To Joe's point is exhausted guy,

867
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,140
but my point is Anderson Silva is a 
goddamn specialist.

868
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,350
His specialty is more tie in,
especially as striking.

869
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,420
When you look at Anderson Silva's 
highlight reels,

870
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,620
is that front kick to the face on 
Vittorio?

871
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,240
It's that fucking need of the body down 
Stephen Bond and that's his gift.

872
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:19,110
I care.
So here it is them at this point.

873
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,620
This is a gel at a beautiful double,
didn't he?

874
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,480
He drove it so hard on that double.
He takes him down.

875
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,910
Should he fights in a couple of.
This is the fourth round.

876
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,680
[inaudible].
Let's go to the end of the flight.

877
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,910
Okay,
let's see this.

878
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,910
This we're child stands up and sits 
back.

879
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,750
That's tight as fuck dude.
Let me see.

880
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,673
That's tight as fuck.
That's titus as a lot tighter than I 

881
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:44,080
thought.
Well,

882
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:44,914
when he finally got the arms are opened 
up the line because he looked like he 

883
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,750
was about to swing the leg.
Oh,

884
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,600
I haven't seen that in awhile.
Go back then.

885
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:52,930
I'm getting there.
It's tight right there.

886
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,040
That's tight.
I take it back.

887
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:54,874
Chill.
When he,

888
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,460
right when he gets the arm is.
That's when he opens up.

889
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,290
Now it's a different thing now.
It's an arm bar.

890
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,870
Yep,
that's right.

891
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,900
So my point being like the best guys at 
one particular thing are pretty rare,

892
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,193
like the guys like an Anderson that is 
just so elite at striking that nobody 

893
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:14,004
wants to strike with them or it got like
Damien Maia solely to Jujitsu that he 

894
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,800
makes guys like Carlos Condit look like 
they have no idea what they're doing.

895
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,710
He gets you on the ground and it makes 
you a little white pill.

896
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,020
But so there's that kind of guy that 
could do that.

897
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:27,660
Or there's a guy like mighty mouse,
mighty mouse.

898
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,390
Although he's got really good 
submissions,

899
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,733
you're not going to see that style and 
he's not going to be able to submit the 

900
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,900
best Jujitsu guys in the world.
One hundred 25 pounds,

901
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,140
most likely in a Jew Jitsu match.
Damien Maia probably could,

902
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,363
you know Damien Maia has the potential 
to beat pretty much anybody he rolls 

903
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,040
with on the Mat and an actual straight 
up Jujitsu match.

904
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,873
So it's,
you have two different styles you have 

905
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,344
like that style of winter which has 
never won the title and there's only a 

906
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,580
few guys like Anderson that have,
you know,

907
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,840
and,
and Anderson in all due fairness,

908
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,943
he wanted like what in 2005 was that 
when Anderson somewhere around there in 

909
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:05,900
the UFC.
That's a lot.

910
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,680
That's done.
Might as well be 30 years ago.

911
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,080
It's a totally different class of 
fighter.

912
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,760
This evolution of the game is so fast.
Like four years ago,

913
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:18,450
we're in leather helmets.
Like I would love to watch tyron woodley

914
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:20,130
versus Demian Maia.
Love it.

915
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,980
I would love to watch it.
That would be incredible.

916
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,420
That to me is maybe one of the most 
interesting fights on the horizon for me

917
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,263
so far.
Damien Maia has been able to take down 

918
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,634
wrestlers that he's been able to take 
them all down like easy and just the 

919
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,740
beautiful technique and a black kid do 
that.

920
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,550
That would lead.
You got to go.

921
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,620
No,
you got to go through the storm.

922
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,220
The storm of fucking meteors coming your
way.

923
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:45,054
The Woodley drops on you because he's 
the most dangerous in that first round 

924
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,633
when you're trying to take him down,
you're closing the distance on them and 

925
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:56,040
you haven't figured out how fast he is 
yet because he's not.

926
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,350
He doesn't hit hard.
He's fucking fast.

927
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,710
I saw some,
uh,

928
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,410
just rumor,
I'm sure.

929
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:05,570
But a big thing was talking about it.
Him and Woodley agreeing to a super fund

930
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:07,590
at one 80.
Really?

931
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,280
Bisbee and Woodley.
Really?

932
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,360
When did they agree to this?
Uh,

933
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,190
I was talking to my brother.
He was like,

934
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,040
you see woodland bisbing want to do like
cathaway that one 80.

935
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,570
I'm like,
that's an interesting fight.

936
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,000
First of all,
can bisping make that healthy?

937
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,230
That's what I was thinking because 
five's the tough cut for him.

938
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,550
Remember when he used to fight two?
Oh,

939
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,730
one,
two.

940
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,300
Oh,
five.

941
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,500
Yup.
Wow,

942
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,730
that's an interesting fight.
Well,

943
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:32,190
I think what,
what would the want is that big payday?

944
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,060
He's like,
let's.

945
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,390
Yeah,
I mean he's campaigning for it.

946
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,370
Look at this.
Mike Bisbee and tyrone Woodley.

947
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,440
Agree to catch weight about this is 
legit.

948
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,740
So it just happened today on the 
Internet.

949
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,120
What is the name of the um,
the Internet low kick MMA.com.

950
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,300
Interesting.
Let's banks.

951
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,420
Instagram is very interesting.
Very interesting.

952
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,120
So gangster weight as Jill Sullivan 
calls it.

953
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,200
Yeah,
I like it.

954
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,090
I like it.
But like to your point will,

955
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,750
he just wants a big fight for lucrative 
payday.

956
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,120
He wants the biggest thing possible to 
get paid.

957
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,931
Yeah.
Smart.

958
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,400
That's the name of the game.
Yeah.

959
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,900
And you know,
an Anderson back.

960
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,970
Uh,
and that has been still been calling for

961
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:11,804
a rematch with bisbing too because his 
fight with bisping so fucking close in 

962
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:16,640
England,
he feels like he beat him.

963
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,720
That was one of the craziest situations.
He hits him with that flying knee.

964
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,100
Awesome.
I mean,

965
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:23,900
bisping was out,
he went out,

966
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:26,960
he dropped and Anderson does a walk off 
Kale and they go,

967
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,100
Eh,
not so quick.

968
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,740
It was so weird.
So weird.

969
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,920
Oh,
why does that make get a video of that?

970
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,740
Because remember [inaudible] being takes
a break because his mouthpiece falls out

971
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,440
and he's like talking to the ref and 
Nancy goes,

972
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,520
oh,
that's right.

973
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,340
That's right.
He,

974
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,173
he was trying to get the referees 
attention and Anderson Flying Nita and 

975
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,080
the ref like coming into stop it then.
So did that flying knee.

976
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:50,300
That's why the ref was like,
hold up.

977
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,650
No,
that doesn't look at that.

978
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,880
That's very weird.
Stitching box his fucking face off.

979
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,270
Like he's saying something.
He's herb dean.

980
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,370
Look,
he's like right there,

981
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,510
right there.
Boom.

982
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,520
Oh Jesus.
That was also the end of the round two,

983
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:04,820
right?

984
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,170
Yeah.
Oh my God.

985
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,340
Jesus,
look at this again.

986
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,481
He's like,
Hey,

987
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:12,470
let me get my mouthpiece.
Oh Shit.

988
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,200
Oh boy.
So look at this.

989
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,560
Boom.
That is such a crazy drop to the way you

990
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:23,360
get hit thrown the knee.
Regardless whether he looked to the side

991
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:24,194
or not,
I think he would have thrown it 

992
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,680
regardless and it wasn't like bisbing 
put his hands down.

993
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,630
He looked over,
but he was still covered up.

994
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,630
Here's the moment that I think he was a 
little distracted there for sure.

995
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,493
Here's the crazy thing.
Pittsburgh comes back and wins that 

996
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,090
fucking fight.
Face off.

997
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,610
How's you when that actually comes out 
that I think that was the third round,

998
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:41,444
right?
He comes out that fourth round and I 

999
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,970
knocked his his face off crazy.
Like a kangaroo crazy recovery.

1000
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,080
That means unbelieved cardiovert insane.
Yeah.

1001
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:52,130
Because most people get hit like that.
That's it.

1002
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,380
I mean his body shut off and he dropped.
No,

1003
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,710
the power of give us a second June and 
we're back.

1004
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,410
Partially blind in one eye or 
completely.

1005
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,370
Partially.
Yeah,

1006
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,233
but he could still see.
He can see enough where they let them 

1007
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,520
fight.
Yeah.

1008
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,570
I mean he does those dye tests.
They have to do.

1009
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:12,404
I test.
Apparently what they did is they put 

1010
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:14,324
some kind of oil in his eye and that oil
like protects his retina somehow or 

1011
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:22,250
another and that's why it looks so crazy
and once he's done fighting then they'll

1012
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,084
fix it.
But the problem is like if he gets it 

1013
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,800
fixed now and then he goes and fights 
again and tears it even worse.

1014
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,980
And then the other thing is the more 
time he waits more advanced,

1015
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,230
all the stem cell shit is getting.
Like they,

1016
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,960
they brought someone's vision back with 
stem cells.

1017
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,440
Sign guy.
Someone was blind and they injected stem

1018
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,540
cells and this guy's eye and brought his
vision back then.

1019
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,170
And that's today,
2017.

1020
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,790
What's it gonna be like five,
six,

1021
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,280
seven years down the line and be retired
by then?

1022
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,260
I would will be,
be retired three or four.

1023
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,360
I mean I think he's 39 now,
right?

1024
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,620
Michael?
Uh,

1025
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,350
yeah.
I might not be that old.

1026
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,320
I might be.
I might be up to 36.

1027
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,120
You might be 37,
36,

1028
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:04,860
37,
37.

1029
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,860
I don't think he has three years left.
Well,

1030
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:10,730
he might look so fucking game,
you know,

1031
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,783
Michael Bisping does not have any 
extraordinary physical attributes and 

1032
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,260
not that he's not a great athlete.
He certainly is not.

1033
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:18,120
He's done a very good fighter.
He's certainly as cardio.

1034
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,900
But if you look at a guy like rumble,
extraordinary physical attributes,

1035
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,420
John Linacre,
extraordinary physical attributes,

1036
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,600
well Michael Bisping has is just 
toughness.

1037
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,450
Just game as fuck.
Toughness,

1038
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,553
knock them out.
He comes back and he just keeps coming 

1039
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:34,650
back.
There's was no quit.

1040
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,260
He doesn't know any of this.
Great Cardio is no quit.

1041
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,140
Amazing Cardio.
Ryan Parson says in the gym,

1042
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,033
he said he's never seen a guy that hates
getting tapped and hates losing 

1043
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,330
exchanges more.
I've never seen anything like it.

1044
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,640
Even even just,
you know,

1045
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,140
you do,
you like your normal warm up.

1046
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,980
Like if you're doing an under hook,
just he's going 100 percent nonstop,

1047
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,980
like slow down.
Um,

1048
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,823
the title man,
while I'm fucking title better and 

1049
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:02,400
better even watch him improve.
Fight to fight.

1050
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,340
Look at his boxing.
His boxing is ridiculous.

1051
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:08,670
Man.
Lost Innocence Silva knocked out.

1052
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,540
Luke rockhold,
Luke rockhold disdainful in that fight.

1053
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,770
Like like,
come on man,

1054
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,290
what are you going to do?
Yeah,

1055
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,810
he's busy.
It's show up for that flood.

1056
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,663
Yeah.
He was disdainful that that was his 

1057
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,130
challenge and he got burned.

1058
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,850
He got murked.
Oh.

1059
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,160
And bisbing was shooting triple x 19 and
Toronto is like,

1060
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:26,941
Huh,
yeah,

1061
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:29,150
I'll be down there four days.
World Champ.

1062
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,180
What a great fucking story for 10 years.
That store I fucking love Brisbane.

1063
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,460
And then beats Dan Henderson.
And a close decision for this book was a

1064
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,323
fucking fight.
You forget about that fight when you 

1065
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:44,460
talk about fights of the year.
That fight was so good.

1066
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,800
So good.
And again,

1067
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,670
his cardio.
You got he,

1068
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,563
he landed h bomb twice.
Landed it that Zombie Mod back and just 

1069
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:56,310
starts fucking box and it's fucking 
crazy.

1070
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,233
It's got nothing to tell you.
Something I had a funny feeling about 

1071
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:01,824
Luke rockhold.
Luke was taking it seriously I think 

1072
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,543
four days and I'm like,
he already beat bisping two fucking 

1073
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,890
years.
All it needs is one shot,

1074
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,443
but business name and knockout artists 
like the bedding off for him to knock 

1075
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:19,470
Luke rockhold on the first round.

1076
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,820
I don't know.
Let me tell you something,

1077
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:21,654
if my daughter catches you with one of 
those swinging overhand punches and 

1078
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,010
clips,
the tip of your chin,

1079
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,040
you got a problem.
Brian told,

1080
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,900
he went to this new blocks in gym and 
the guys that came mind,

1081
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,100
if this girl is going to kill me for 
telling the story,

1082
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,380
you might have this girl jumps in there 
and squat some rounds in.

1083
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:37,840
Brian's like,
sure.

1084
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,300
He starts walking around.
This bitch is dead serious and shit.

1085
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:43,510
Some of the right hand.
Brian was like,

1086
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,490
Oh shit.
He said,

1087
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:49,070
he's like a little wobbled myself.
Anyone catches you flushed,

1088
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:51,030
man,
you're going to be in for a long night.

1089
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,893
I see the point of that.
The way rockhold cotton and bisbing 

1090
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,120
bisbing swung it over the shoulder,
was a beautiful left hook.

1091
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,073
He stepped in with it and just whipped 
it over the top and it was something 

1092
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:04,990
that him and Perillo had seen in rock 
holds game coach of the year.

1093
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,180
Very good code.
Hands down.

1094
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,500
Coach of the Jesus coach.

1095
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,970
He worked with Bj.
He's worked with a lot of guys.

1096
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,910
Dj Tito,
Cris Cyborg,

1097
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:18,350
and Michael Bisping.
He's a quiet guy in terms of what?

1098
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,530
He's not out there trying to get a lot 
of publicity.

1099
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:24,360
He's not a attention whore is just an 
excellent boxing coach.

1100
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,443
Really knows his shit.
I'm one of the best in game and good at 

1101
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:34,380
adapting it for MMA too.
He understands MMA and it's like,

1102
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,333
you know,
it's like there's those camps that do 

1103
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:38,344
it.
They don't want to hear something 

1104
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:41,120
fucking crazy that Woodley told me the 
other day would love to.

1105
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,820
I went to dinner with Woodley and mighty
mouse and some dude and his wife who won

1106
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,050
the um,
uh,

1107
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:47,884
they want some vip thing,
UFC thing and we met them dog route to 

1108
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,454
and I had dinner with them.
I'm with didn't have a fucking head 

1109
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:54,424
coach.
He coached himself up until the Calvin 

1110
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:57,364
gasoline fight.

1111
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,203
The Calvin gasoline fight was the first 
fight that he worked with Duke roufus 

1112
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,780
and he was trying to figure out if he's 
going to go to att off.

1113
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,360
He's got to work with Duke roufus that 
att before his son.

1114
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,650
No,
he never had like a head coach.

1115
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:09,940
You go down there and do a camp.
Fuck,

1116
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:13,510
was he thinking just talented,
talented and just figuring it out on his

1117
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:14,344
own.
His son told him to go to Chicago or 

1118
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,870
Milwaukee rather held to such a little 
kid.

1119
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,830
Told him he had the idea that his dad 
should.

1120
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,733
You should go.
He goes,

1121
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,481
I got it.
He goes,

1122
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:26,314
it was 15 below zero.
Got My fucking car and drove to 

1123
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:30,880
Milwaukee.
Then looked at him and he won.

1124
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,250
He beat Calvin and then he's won every 
fight since then.

1125
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,680
This one,
the title this day and age,

1126
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,700
you have to have that head coach.

1127
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,000
You have to.
You have to have all bases covered.

1128
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,900
Does another guy be distracted with 
this?

1129
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:43,120
You can't be doing this over here.
You can't live here.

1130
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:43,954
Then flying just for your camp.
You can't decide to get serious six 

1131
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,130
weeks before that.
People are too good,

1132
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,350
but how can you imagine that the NFL did
that?

1133
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:51,663
Tom Brady was like,
I'm going to do this even though I'm in 

1134
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,570
season.
Then right before training camp starts,

1135
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:57,340
so I'm gonna get serious.
They can't.

1136
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,930
You just can't man.
Yeah,

1137
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:01,750
and Duke's another guy that doesn't get 
enough credit because he's another guy.

1138
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:02,584
It's pretty quiet like Duke roufus is 
not out there trying to make a lot of 

1139
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,660
noise and get a lot of people to pay 
attention to him.

1140
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,580
It's just an awesome striking coach.
Amazing strength coach.

1141
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,493
I think the reason why maybe he doesn't 
get enough credit with the Woodley's 

1142
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,500
because what's going on with pedals?
Yeah.

1143
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,533
Yeah.
That's the only reason badasses in a 

1144
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,090
weird state.
How man?

1145
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,010
I mean,
he can't fight at 1:45.

1146
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,170
It's just too weak for him.
He just can't take it.

1147
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,200
You know?
You watch that fight and it's like,

1148
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,073
God,
Max Holloway just beat the fuck out of 

1149
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:27,944
him.
But like

1150
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,800
I don't get why you went to 45 million 
is lost at 55.

1151
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,710
It's like it's not that bad.
You talking about split decision,

1152
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,810
the decisions,
it's really not that bad.

1153
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:38,000
You obviously can compete in the top 
five there.

1154
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,913
He definitely competed and could 
actually go the full distance while 

1155
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:44,510
getting beat up.
Whereas at 45,

1156
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:46,540
his body was breaking down and he even 
said,

1157
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,393
he goes,
I did everything in my power to make 

1158
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,004
weight.
I just my body shut down on it to tell 

1159
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:52,970
you guys maybe he should just go fucking
heavy.

1160
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,100
Just start strength and conditioning 
work.

1161
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:58,850
Start fucking doing dead lifts and Shit.
Be beef his body up.

1162
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,990
Because if you look at dos Anjos,
there's Dasan Joe's before.

1163
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,570
I'm like Habib number got that off and 
then there's also hundreds afterwards.

1164
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:07,740
You mean?
You mean you saw it?

1165
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,170
I don't know what you're saying.
You saw johnny who you are,

1166
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,413
who you are,
but there is absolutely a difference 

1167
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,970
when a guy gets on a serious strength 
and conditioning routine,

1168
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,620
regardless of Mexican supplements.

1169
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,720
He went with Nickerson.
Nickerson.

1170
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,430
You ever seen the videos of Hockfield?
Dos?

1171
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:27,350
Anjos and curse.
I'm working on doing work.

1172
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,980
Curse on is a beast.
He has guys doing crazy shit.

1173
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,170
He's got you doing all that.
Marvin Marinovich Shit.

1174
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:36,590
Well you got all this footwork stuff and
he believes in like foot strength.

1175
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:38,270
Above all,
all plyometrics,

1176
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,163
all these explosive box jumps and shit 
and all this crazy fucking burpees and 

1177
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:44,230
all the,
all the,

1178
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:48,550
the nutty explosive sprinting back and 
forth because for one,

1179
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,633
I love that Meta chick for awhile.
Remember Carlos Condo is a climate on 

1180
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,203
trees and shit and fucking connor was 
doing all this weird stuff and then all 

1181
00:51:58,221 --> 00:52:01,760
of a sudden just the meat head movement 
is back the meat head movement.

1182
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,810
How so?
Like what was that?

1183
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:05,180
That training is not a meathead.
I wouldn't say.

1184
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,910
I'm not saying that meat head movement 
at all.

1185
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,970
I think that's the opposite.
No,

1186
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:08,211
no,
no.

1187
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:11,060
What I'm saying is that that raw power,
that strength condition,

1188
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:11,894
you can't make up for that by climbing 
on trees and doing this weird yoga 

1189
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,140
movement.
All that shit.

1190
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,050
There's room for that.
That's all good.

1191
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:21,440
But you got your focus,
your fucking focus.

1192
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,830
But Connor,
what what?

1193
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:23,783
What Connor's been able to do is develop
like extremely agile back and forth 

1194
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,110
movement and I think a lot of that is 
that ido portal guy.

1195
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,470
I got to admit that is weird.
As his stuff looks,

1196
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:38,330
when he's flipping around and doing all 
these jumps,

1197
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,403
if you can move your body like that,
that's going to directly translate into 

1198
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:45,560
your footwork and your movement.
I'd give more credit to his head coach.

1199
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,380
One hundred percent mean John,
Kevin Wisdom it.

1200
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,650
Speaking of that use to.
You know who the biggest winner is?

1201
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,790
Who?
Conor mcgregor.

1202
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,980
How so he's the only star.
Oh yeah.

1203
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,230
He's the only mega stone goes.
He gets all the stock.

1204
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,480
You fell.
You fell as you want to talk.

1205
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:01,460
Now what do you want to do?
Because I'm the only guy left.

1206
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,323
Well,
how about this?

1207
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,223
Hits that.
And then the next paper view is Holly 

1208
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,020
Holm versus a Germane to Rhonda May,
which is.

1209
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:15,220
It's a tough sell.
I would buy it as a hardcore fan,

1210
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,450
but for sure for sure.
And we'll probably,

1211
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,230
but the bottom line,
100,

1212
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,630
100,000
people.

1213
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:23,690
Well yeah.
Yeah.

1214
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,770
It ain't going to be Connor Mcgregor 
numbers.

1215
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,160
Right.

1216
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,300
Bottom line comment when she lost,
and I'm sure he likes Rhonda by,

1217
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,820
but business wise he's excellent.
Excellent.

1218
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,753
Yeah,
that's.

1219
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,963
Well,
it's a tricky situation now with the 

1220
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:38,424
marketing campaign,
the dumb yet wme wme put together for 

1221
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,044
this.
It was so Rhonda heavy and then Rhonda 

1222
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:48,030
gets smashed and now what are you going 
to do for it?

1223
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,010
You're gonna like the girl who smashed 
Rhonda.

1224
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,320
Is that what Amanda gets for her next 
title?

1225
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,630
You do a press tour.
World press door with her.

1226
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,430
Like let's,
let's introduce you to the girl.

1227
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:57,330
Beat the shutter.
Rhonda.

1228
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:58,164
Now she's not fighting.
Let's do this press tour that she 

1229
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:01,110
deserved.
So they do all this stuff.

1230
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,650
Piggyback on Ronda again.
Yes.

1231
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,460
And show the beating.
Well,

1232
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:06,294
you know,
she sort of retired two legends in the 

1233
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:10,290
sport.
That's why she's my fighter of the year.

1234
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,540
She retired Nisha.
And then she retired.

1235
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,040
Rhonda if Rhonda retires.
That's huge.

1236
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,170
She retired.
Both of them.

1237
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,560
All of a sudden,
Amanda is Nate Diaz,

1238
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,453
did you say cat Zingano posted on 
instagram that Amanda blocked her 

1239
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,790
because Cat Zingano,
uh,

1240
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,710
stopped.
Amanda and Amanda was a hurting cats and

1241
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,670
donald bad first round real bad.
I was in big fucking trouble,

1242
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,360
but she survived and went on to stop.
Amanda and I love cat,

1243
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:37,320
but I'll,
I'll,

1244
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,160
I'll,
uh,

1245
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,530
fucking America dudes like you lost the 
chick.

1246
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:43,350
I just beaten 17 seconds,
but she got caught in an arm bar.

1247
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,230
I mean,
how did Amanda lose the fight?

1248
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,700
I don't remember if she beat her down.
She beat her down the third round.

1249
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,580
Cat got on top and started blasting her 
and she kinda gas.

1250
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
No.
Well she kinda.

1251
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,860
Gas is ferocious.
Amanda,

1252
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,003
you know that fucking scream.
There's a is a recording of Cat Zingano 

1253
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:05,760
screaming after she won that fight.
And it's so primal.

1254
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,560
Dude.
It's like an animal screen.

1255
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,320
I think you played it before on the 
podcast because it was,

1256
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:11,840
it was like when she did it,
I was like,

1257
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,010
Ooh,
there's some shit you hear.

1258
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:16,870
That's cool.

1259
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,900
Come on man.
That can't fake that.

1260
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,200
That's in your bones.
That's your number.

1261
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,310
That's after all that darkness.
She dealt with,

1262
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,460
her husband committed suicide and just 
all this diabetes was that.

1263
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,500
That was after.
That is.

1264
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,310
That was the virus afterwards was the 
play that again,

1265
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:36,770
Jamie plays out again.
Listen to this shit.

1266
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,870
But to answer your question from before,
not to interrupt you,

1267
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,150
this sitting on a goldmine,
William Morris now with this fuck Amanda

1268
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,983
Nunez.
I told you last night she spotted the 

1269
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:06,450
lbgt community.
Jack fucking pockets.

1270
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:08,820
Okay.
LBTG.

1271
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,620
It's Lbgtq a.
Now listen,

1272
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:18,350
what does that got to keep up lesbians?
I don't know how churches.

1273
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,640
One lottery ticket.
They just hit the fucking lottery thing.

1274
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,100
ASEXUALS are in there today.
Carmouche before

1275
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,933
that.
But it still wasn't the champion work 

1276
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,800
once you're the chair.
She's the champion.

1277
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:35,320
But it's everything.
And when Liz carmouche fought Ronda,

1278
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:38,530
she fought her at the first fight when 
no one knew who Ronda was.

1279
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,820
So Rhonda has all this hype behind her.
She wins that fight and then goes on.

1280
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,740
And you know Liz has done well in the 
UFC,

1281
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,380
but having that it does.
It's not the same.

1282
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,730
Tony Evans says she has her.
Victor,

1283
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,360
she's awesome.
Have you ever seen her fight?

1284
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,710
Tony Evans.
Very tough.

1285
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,290
She is bad ass.
She's an eviction.

1286
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,000
Super tough.
She's really good.

1287
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,050
And she's openly gay too.
And what way does she?

1288
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,120
She's hilarious man.
I love that chick.

1289
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,610
She's like 1:35,
1:35,

1290
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,310
1:45.
She's good.

1291
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,603
This is going to be more.
It says the same thing we were talking 

1292
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,120
about like when Anderson was in his 
prime,

1293
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,890
when he was just a light and people on 
fire.

1294
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,350
The division was like,
there wasn't,

1295
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,750
you know,
you had to like Patrick [inaudible].

1296
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,010
He had a couple of fights for the title 
palace.

1297
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,100
Latus real like there's no one frank,
there's no rich.

1298
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:24,934
Franklin was the champ,
but there's no overwhelming need to see 

1299
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:30,280
that fight.
You know what I mean?

1300
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,990
Like you want to see the fight because 
I'm interested in.

1301
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,490
See,
Patrick's got a great chin,

1302
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,440
he's got power,
let's see what happens.

1303
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,000
But it's not like,
oh,

1304
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:37,834
here's the next one.
It's like cody garbrandt fighting 

1305
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,600
dominick Cruz.
We were like,

1306
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,230
oh,
let's see what happened to us.

1307
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:43,803
There was no one like that for Anderson 
for a long ass time and I think in the 

1308
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,830
women's bantamweight division you got to
kind of similar situation.

1309
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:54,900
Now it's like now you have Amanda Nunez,
who beats the shit out of Misha.

1310
00:57:54,901 --> 00:57:57,280
Misha is going to step back.
She's gone now.

1311
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,670
She beats the shit out of a Rhonda.
Rhonda steps back.

1312
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,290
Holly goes up to 1:45
remainder random.

1313
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,124
Ain't got to change that shit.
Why fight for both belts to save that 

1314
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:11,710
card?
Fuck yeah.

1315
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:14,470
I mean let's make some moves because.
Because if you've seen the car window,

1316
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,830
the cop man holly's car.
How was the headliner?

1317
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,023
That's what I'm saying.
Holly's fighting Germane to random may 

1318
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,250
for the 1:45
pounds.

1319
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,910
I think they should give Jermaine 
demand.

1320
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,520
You may thousand dollars a has already 
beat her,

1321
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,393
but you know they need a new lesbian who
I thought Nunez Nunez already beat 

1322
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,320
Jermaine.
She beat her in the UFC.

1323
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,593
Jermaine is a wicked kickboxer her.
She's a world world class multiple time 

1324
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,330
world champion kickboxer.
I think she's,

1325
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,410
I think she won the Moitai world.
Moy Tai try titles several occasions.

1326
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:52,411
She's like really elite as a Meu Thai.
But they'd gloves stand up,

1327
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,060
stand up.
There's no ground.

1328
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:55,894
And as soon as she got in the UFC you 
could see like that transition between 

1329
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,950
learning,
the striking with uh,

1330
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,833
with,
with take downs versus just fighting 

1331
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,190
kickboxing about.
It's a big transition.

1332
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:07,024
Takes time,
but you're also going to people who 

1333
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:10,030
aren't going to give you the time.
Exactly.

1334
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:10,864
They just fucking shooting out on her 
and beating her up and taking her down 

1335
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,720
and just.
It's just a different sport.

1336
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,350
I thought the card is pretty good.
It's in Brooklyn.

1337
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:18,790
Yes.
Travis Browne is fight.

1338
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:20,560
Derrick Lewis.
That's an interesting fight.

1339
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,070
But what's.
You know

1340
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,380
what is true?
Where's Travis has head out right now?

1341
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,090
He's training the same camp,
isn't he?

1342
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,350
Yes.
God dammit.

1343
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:28,370
Travis.
Yeah.

1344
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,280
Holly Holm versus Amanda Nunez.
That's the fight right there.

1345
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,570
Yeah,
I agree with you.

1346
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:35,220
I think at 1:35
lights will do that at this.

1347
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,400
For this card.
No.

1348
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,780
Make It.
Make Amanda the two belt champion.

1349
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:42,680
But then you have to remember the 
volunteership Shevchenko just beat holly

1350
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:45,200
and Peter's come up 10 losses.
Yeah.

1351
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:50,201
And Valentino beat her up.
Stand up together.

1352
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,940
Yeah.
They need help with this car.

1353
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,310
The problem is most people,
you know,

1354
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,710
volunteer one,
they don't know who she is yet,

1355
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,933
even though she won.
I mean she needs a few more victories 

1356
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:03,730
inside the UFC in order to get people 
excited about this paper.

1357
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,750
Yeah,
Brooklyn.

1358
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,510
The only reason people know holly too is
they don't know the.

1359
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,870
Her past losses really?

1360
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,840
They granted her fight was on Fox,
but all they know is she's the girl that

1361
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,270
knocked out Rhonda.
That's what's selling this.

1362
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,143
Eddie Bravo.
You trying to say that this isn't going 

1363
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:15,704
to get your last 60 bucks.
I'm just saying that I will illegally 

1364
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,790
streamed the last one.
Amanda Nunez just Vod for 45 seconds.

1365
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,770
She's fresh.
Have her headline.

1366
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,670
That car.
Hey Man,

1367
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:26,900
let's build her up.
What's the.

1368
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,160
Where's the.
Where's the superbowl card?

1369
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,480
Can't I know.
I agree with that.

1370
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,710
That's not.
That's February.

1371
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,930
Nothing.
No,

1372
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,770
no.
Super Bowl weekend is in Houston.

1373
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,450
Different Card.
Oh,

1374
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,170
it is?
Yeah,

1375
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,080
he's totally changed in one.
I don't think they have that card locked

1376
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:45,914
up either,
by the way.

1377
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:46,963
I think there's still moving fights 
around for that Brooklyn Card because I 

1378
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:50,054
think they recognize that they did need 
a little bit more juice on that card in 

1379
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,124
Vegas this year.
It's in Houston this year and the suit 

1380
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:00,260
bulge and he she or is it a problem?

1381
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,700
Houston or Dallas?
I thought it was.

1382
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,300
Downs is a Houston,
Texas,

1383
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,260
Texas,
so that's a,

1384
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,120
they'll have a big card for,
uh,

1385
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,040
for the UFC there.
They don't have a great.

1386
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,810
Now is Bermudez and chance on John.
That's a good fight.

1387
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:16,490
But what,
what a day is that?

1388
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,800
That would sell seven paper.
February,

1389
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:19,910
fifth,
fourth,

1390
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,530
fifth.
The fourth.

1391
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,830
Yeah.
So one of those cards.

1392
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,830
I'm not there for that.
You need to slow down.

1393
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,120
Jesus Christ.
That's the fight.

1394
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,220
That's a superbowl card and it's a fight
night.

1395
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,620
What's the soup bowl?
We superbowl week.

1396
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,950
That's it.
The 29th.

1397
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,550
The game is on the fifth.
That's the night before.

1398
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,453
It's a free flight.
Free fight night because superbowl 

1399
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,870
weekend,
it's always been a paper view.

1400
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,700
UFC.
It's usually been in vegas.

1401
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:47,631
Vegas,
yeah.

1402
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:49,550
I wonder whether the only man.
Well,

1403
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:52,500
you know what man is going to headline 
cards right now to sell the paper,

1404
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,810
but it's a good fucking question.

1405
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,753
There's no heavy weights other than 
steep Emile Church that can sell a big 

1406
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,110
card right now and he has to sell it in 
Cleveland too.

1407
01:02:02,111 --> 01:02:02,944
There's a lot of stars out there.
There's a lot of stars out that would 

1408
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,141
sell us.
Guy Who?

1409
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,720
Eddie.
Which one?

1410
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,640
Serious and and just give me three.
Ankle.

1411
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,520
Well,
Alpha Centauri has really didn't.

1412
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,800
I mean she put in 45 seconds.
Take.

1413
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,430
There's.
I mean,

1414
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:21,264
do you want.
I'm talking about legit paper view 

1415
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,124
sellers.
The honestly there's conor mcgregor in 

1416
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,203
this.
Everybody else.

1417
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,923
There was a thing that they showed the 
other day that connor in three fights 

1418
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,560
drew more paper view than the entire UFC
roster in 2014.

1419
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,440
His is three worst gates and paper is 
all time.

1420
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,180
We beat Ronda is best and brock Lesnar's
best.

1421
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,290
He's the best.
He's the biggest for sure and no,

1422
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,020
no,
no,

1423
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:45,853
no,
but some people are looking at you and 

1424
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,740
Dana's our hate it.

1425
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,650
Right.
You know what Ron is?

1426
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,750
His is like,
here's what's different.

1427
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:55,763
When Rhonda,
his face came on the screen the first 

1428
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:02,160
time in Vegas this weekend,
I heard young girl scream and that's all

1429
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:03,600
I heard.
I heard young girls.

1430
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,910
It was like Justin Bieber pulled his 
dick out.

1431
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,433
How about,
how about talking shit about beavers 

1432
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,490
talking shit.
No,

1433
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,520
he made a tweet that said you just got 
knocked the fuck out.

1434
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,383
Hey bieber singing fucking songs.
No music with the fuck you're talking 

1435
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,780
about that dude.
So sick.

1436
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,340
I can't stand when people aren't 
involved in the game.

1437
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,640
They say stuff like that.
It's like,

1438
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:28,760
what have you ever done to risk your 
what?

1439
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,970
What are you talking about?
Yeah.

1440
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:36,170
Damn it got it's 39,000
likes and it's because Rhonda,

1441
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,003
her shoes at some concert or something 
into her little sister on meet Biba and 

1442
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:41,244
he didn't have time.

1443
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,290
So then she got mad,
remember that?

1444
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,153
She was like,
fuck.

1445
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,120
So that's where it stems from,
like waiting,

1446
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,000
like,
well you remember when,

1447
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,810
when fucking Rhonda got killed by Holly 
Trump said,

1448
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:53,240
uh,
I'm glad she got knocked out.

1449
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,093
Not a good person to talk shit again.
Denise trumped did another tweet about 

1450
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:57,804
Rhonda,
about Rhonda and he's the president of 

1451
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:03,120
the United States.
I'm pretty sure he is so critical to his

1452
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,380
tweet.
He's so,

1453
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:05,214
why was he mad at Rhonda on the first 
fucking know she could talk shit about 

1454
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:08,730
him.
She said she goes,

1455
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,470
I would,
I would never vote for trump.

1456
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,753
Yeah.
She said she was going to vote for 

1457
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:14,790
Bernie in the United States.
Motherfucker.

1458
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,680
What do you care?
No.

1459
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,603
Hey Man,
don't you have bigger fires to put out 

1460
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,650
instead of tweeting bullshit.
Not only that politician.

1461
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:24,300
Matt,
that's not what he is.

1462
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:26,220
He's not,
he's not.

1463
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:27,523
He don't even want to stay at the 
lighthouse because I gotta I gotta get 

1464
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,910
the Fuck Outta Shit.

1465
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:46,200
It's probably rubbed down to the playboy
mansion.

1466
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,500
It's nasty.
Milgard windows.

1467
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,430
Shit.
You been in the mansion right?

1468
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,670
Didn't you come with me.
And then the marijuana policy project at

1469
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,300
first when I first got invited to the,
uh,

1470
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,050
the mansion,
I thought,

1471
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:01,884
oh my God,
it's going to be just like those videos 

1472
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:05,910
you see,
they used to be the like commercials and

1473
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:10,020
Little Jon voight mansion and you'd see 
like on EU,

1474
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,490
she's the playboy mansion and you're 
like,

1475
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:15,120
Oh shit,
we get invited to an event there.

1476
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,130
And then you figured you figured it out 
really quick.

1477
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,210
That okay.
Not every night goes off because there's

1478
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:26,470
like no girls there.
They had giant screens everywhere in the

1479
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:27,304
backyard,
plain loops of people partying on the 

1480
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,150
good nights.
So you got this,

1481
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,153
you're at the party at the playboy and I
looked into it and it turns out they 

1482
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:45,390
rent out the place like all the goddamn 
going to be.

1483
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,353
It's not like what you see on TV.
There's only two times per year where 

1484
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:49,894
it's that what you imagined where 
they're just 80 percent girls and 

1485
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,250
they're all in there.
That does happen,

1486
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,353
but it's only the Halloween party and 
their fourth of July or a midnight 

1487
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:04,291
summer's eve possible to get into that.
Do you remember when we'd see fights?

1488
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:09,391
There was fights.
The strikeforce bottleneck to attach.

1489
01:06:11,061 --> 01:06:11,894
Man,
that was a tough loss and it's probably 

1490
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:13,960
over in it.
Yeah.

1491
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:16,570
He just.
He looked terrible on the ground,

1492
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:16,900
man.

1493
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,630
He was making big rookie mistakes and 
super amateur.

1494
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,650
Yeah.
We just like he was.

1495
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,290
He was like leaving himself open.
It wasn't patient.

1496
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,050
It's hard to Tony,
if you saw them in the gym,

1497
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:26,620
you're like,
go home.

1498
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,370
Like I've seen me as the best in the 
world.

1499
01:06:28,371 --> 01:06:30,610
Like this motherfucker's going to do it,
man.

1500
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,503
So what is it a commitment to the 
grappling commitment to grappling 

1501
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,030
commitment to a Jujitsu?
Yeah,

1502
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,340
me just so good at standup.
He,

1503
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,333
you know,
his dad's this legend in Denver as far 

1504
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:41,404
as striking and he was a taekwondo guy 
and he trained him since he was little 

1505
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,290
and Thatcher was always the it factor in
the gym where you're like,

1506
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,430
dude,
if you're staying with him,

1507
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:50,950
good luck.
He could do it all both ways.

1508
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:53,440
Whatever you wanted.
He can mimic anything.

1509
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,850
He looked good standing up to man.
It was amazing.

1510
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:59,410
But he made the mistake of,
of initiating the grappling.

1511
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,733
I was like,
Jesus Christ and what hurts him even 

1512
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:03,034
more.
I don't know if you guys saw this with 

1513
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:05,870
all the chaos going on with UFC two.
Oh seven.

1514
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,620
Their head coach,
leaster Bolin who was my head coach,

1515
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:09,454
right?
And I think one of the best in the game 

1516
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,820
is retiring.
He's leaving a Mussel farm.

1517
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,620
Why is he doing that?
Because his kids,

1518
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:16,970
his kids in wrestling and he lives far 
away and he's like,

1519
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,180
don't spend too much time with the guys 
traveling stuff.

1520
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,820
That was in the summer.
I had three weekends with my kids.

1521
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,020
He's like,
I just can't do it.

1522
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,033
And his,
his,

1523
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:24,963
his son,
little easters like really getting 

1524
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,330
competitive and wrestling and leasers 
his wrestling coach.

1525
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:31,000
How far away does he live from the gym?
Why can our.

1526
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,270
That sucks.
You should move closer to fuck.

1527
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,380
But again,
he's like,

1528
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,463
because he owns his own business.
He makes crazy money so he's just doing 

1529
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:41,110
it and it Kinda got out of hand.
He's like,

1530
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:41,944
do.
I'm spending too much time with the 

1531
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:43,840
team.
None of time with my family.

1532
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,460
He's a good dude too.
One of the best.

1533
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,690
Really good guy.
One of the best.

1534
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,733
Very smart too.
I tell you what I'd like to see and I 

1535
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,393
have no idea.
I don't know if they've talked about so 

1536
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,500
I'm going to do it,
but I'd like to see Matt Brown take kind

1537
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:57,580
of a leadership role with that team 
really and move that into the next phase

1538
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:59,650
of his career.
I don't even know if he's into it.

1539
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,890
I've seen him with the guys and with his
mentality and experience.

1540
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,720
You're talking about a coach kind of 
knows it all.

1541
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,070
Like we were talking about with Matt 
Hume,

1542
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:09,460
who's been there be a good idea.
I have no idea if he's even into it.

1543
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,653
Yeah,
it was interesting because Dwayne was 

1544
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,710
working with Matt Brown for this fight.
He work with them for a few weeks,

1545
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,160
but I thought maybe

1546
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,993
we'd see more like footwork and movement
from Matt that's like similar to Dwayne 

1547
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:22,550
style,
but dwayne style doesn't work that way.

1548
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,443
Duane,
you have to be in and you have to spend 

1549
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:29,330
a ton of time with them and I really 
think he's the perfect coach for Tj,

1550
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,540
but unless you're one of those small 
guys with that crazy footwork,

1551
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,950
he's not a guy who can go to for six 
weeks and pick shit up.

1552
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:35,870
Oh,
you know what man,

1553
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:36,704
I agree with you,
but do you remember when Travis Browne 

1554
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:42,560
was first on the scene?
Like when he fought a skyscraper?

1555
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:46,550
Any funny mood like Dominick Cruz at 
alliance.

1556
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,380
That's what I'm saying.
The entire division was like,

1557
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,480
what the fuck are we going to do?
Yeah.

1558
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:53,100
Well what happened to him?
Edmond?

1559
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,000
100 percent,
100 percent.

1560
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,650
Think about all those fights since he 
left there.

1561
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,480
He was a bar man.

1562
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,240
I always said that he was the dark horse
in the division.

1563
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,433
I was like,
let me tell you something that this guy 

1564
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:04,964
puts it all together.
He can do some shit that you rarely see 

1565
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:08,504
from a heavyweight.
Went from alliance to Winkeljohn for 

1566
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,820
awhile.
Yes.

1567
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,990
Always.
He,

1568
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,750
he went,
he went to a alliance,

1569
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,740
then he went to Jackson's and was good 
there.

1570
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,640
Those guys.
Then overeem,

1571
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,483
stayed there.
Then he left and then he ended up going 

1572
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:24,620
to a Edmond with Rhonda.
So,

1573
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,050
but I,
I.

1574
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,640
same thing I met on,
I forget what UFC it was ufc one,

1575
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,100
I forget.
Anyways,

1576
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,840
um,
I fought Ben Rothwell.

1577
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:36,500
He was on the card fighting some scrub 
and I looked at my coach and I was like,

1578
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,240
do you get,
do you know about that guy?

1579
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:39,830
And it was leased fingers a little bit.
I went,

1580
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,210
he's probably your next heavy weight 
champ.

1581
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,133
Have you seen the way moves on?
We don't want to fight them like down 

1582
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:46,370
the road.
Want to fight them soon because I got so

1583
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:48,230
much talent.
He's probably the next champ.

1584
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,303
They're like,
really?

1585
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,440
Then we saw him and was like,
Jesus Christ.

1586
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:52,274
I'm like,
he has footwork like dominick Cruz and 

1587
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:55,040
he's a c,
six seven.

1588
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:55,911
Yeah.
You know,

1589
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:56,744
I talked to Brian,
stand about him and Brian was pretty 

1590
01:09:58,011 --> 01:10:00,560
adamant about it,
like after the last fight,

1591
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,280
he's like,
where's all this footwork worlds?

1592
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:05,420
He's like,
I remember this guy having an incredible

1593
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:09,710
footwork and movement when he was at 
Jackson's camp and now he's just kind of

1594
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:12,650
lost all of it and he's become this 
stagnant,

1595
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,370
like great.
Has the same desire anymore.

1596
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,100
Like when he knocked out Gonzaga or Josh
Brown.

1597
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:21,150
Bingo.
You know Josh,

1598
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,360
Josh Barnett,
brother who just got flagged.

1599
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,680
Yeah,
he got flagged.

1600
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:27,890
Huh?
What do you know what for steroids?

1601
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,020
Really?
Hey Man,

1602
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,350
that guy,
he's been flagged before for God's love.

1603
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,520
Josh Shit happens.
He's got caught a few times.

1604
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:37,354
A whole Edmund somebody put a video out 
pretty funny about everybody getting 

1605
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:45,710
knocked out admin camp with a little 
flute like fucking type panic and shit,

1606
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,970
you know?
And it's uh,

1607
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,370
it's,
it's fucking sad.

1608
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,210
You know,
right before the Fight I had to pee.

1609
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,330
I was paying,
I said to myself,

1610
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,820
you know what,
I can't call this fight,

1611
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:59,660
but what do I want to happen?
Let just pull girl fucking win.

1612
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:04,070
Let him let her retire with Amanda.
She would never retired if she won,

1613
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,150
you know,
whatever.

1614
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,750
I was hoping I didn't want to see what I
just saw again.

1615
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,240
Yeah,
but why do we feel that way that I see,

1616
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,040
but you didn't see what you just saw 
again,

1617
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,040
what you saw was

1618
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,000
way worse with holly fight.
It was her trying to get holly,

1619
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:21,210
but holly was fighting wisely.
She was sliding away.

1620
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,130
Cracking noise shots.
It was Rhonda Being Ron.

1621
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,040
She got hunted.
Yes.

1622
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:31,130
Rhonda got hunted down and destroyed by 
an assassin on totally different kind of

1623
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,863
profile on tim down right now.
If I get up and go and say I have two 

1624
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:40,320
seconds before his head adjust and he 
realized his way.

1625
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:42,180
He is.
Even that if I got on top of them,

1626
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,840
insight control was big as fat as I am 
and you'll go,

1627
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:46,860
fuck,
I can't breathe,

1628
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:49,860
but you know,
but after a while you get it together.

1629
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,830
She didn't even get it together,
but it's all to do.

1630
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,420
The big difference is getting hit in the
head.

1631
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,550
Oh,
when you get a headship,

1632
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,530
probably had no idea what the fuck was 
going on,

1633
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,513
but it was like.

1634
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,460
But Joe,
she just came from a training camp.

1635
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,950
Was her media scrum stuff like training 
camp?

1636
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,830
Usually she's got little guys.
She's thrown around in training camp.

1637
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,360
This time I didn't see her throwing 
nobody around the trinet.

1638
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:16,320
She's definitely had judo work.
She's definitely doing a lot of work.

1639
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:17,154
Was She?
There was some footage that was up 

1640
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:20,090
sheet.
Hidden takedowns towel.

1641
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,220
A admin.
I don't want to see nobody.

1642
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:24,054
I don't want to talk to.
Nobody was a training reflective of her 

1643
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:28,650
attitude towards the media and 
everything like this.

1644
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:29,843
Yeah.
There's something that's not fucking 

1645
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:33,170
right here.
Joe.

1646
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,400
I love you.
I appreciate the headshot,

1647
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:38,430
but something wasn't there.
I get shot in the head.

1648
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:39,264
I put my hand.
Fair to say was not there because 

1649
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,210
something was not there that that's why 
I feel under public.

1650
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:47,790
I mean guys were brilliant.
You feel broken heart in a way.

1651
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:48,883
It's weird.
Why would we feel broken than I do to 

1652
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:51,973
hold you up the next morning and told 
you you were driving back from the 

1653
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:54,783
airport?
Like,

1654
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,520
I'm broken me.
Everybody gets fired after Holly Holm.

1655
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:00,743
Everybody.
I go back to the Japanese cultural 

1656
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,640
center when Misaki Donna for $7 every 
time.

1657
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,960
That's not what made Rhonda.
Rhonda.

1658
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:10,770
She's so loyal but something.
But if she was so loyal,

1659
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:14,880
she wouldn't let the guy that got her 
into the UFC guy who website,

1660
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,850
not the manager managers.
Different managers come back.

1661
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:23,700
She wouldn't have left 10.
She knows what that deal is different.

1662
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,860
That's different though,
right?

1663
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,753
This,
but there's two different versions of 

1664
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:28,344
that story who I don't know who's right 
and I feel the same way where for 

1665
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:33,520
whatever reason,
right?

1666
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:34,760
Yes,
I agree 100 percent sure.

1667
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,890
The head punches great,
but something wasn't there.

1668
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:42,900
Joe Wasn't there when she went to 
Grandpa Joe.

1669
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:51,120
Joe Breland like this was Rhonda that 
came out for Holly and chill.

1670
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,980
You remember that time when he told me a
Mug,

1671
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:55,270
that gay guy and he beat the shit out of
you.

1672
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,850
Get in trouble.
Now let's.

1673
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:07,060
That's what happened was God highs that 
were thinking they wanted to be gay guys

1674
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:08,204
that had families and shit that wanting 
to get the dick suck would have a few 

1675
01:14:10,831 --> 01:14:14,920
drinks in them and they'd go to Hudson 
county park to see if there was somebody

1676
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,160
there to get the Dixon before I wanted 
to show shell parked.

1677
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,190
Shaundra said parking lot.
I didn't park in that lot.

1678
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,400
I parked in the lot that was empty and 
when I was walking over there,

1679
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,580
some dude kept making eye contact with 
me.

1680
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,200
He wanted me to suck Dick.

1681
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:37,110
He,
you know,

1682
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,723
when somebody looks at it,
know when somebody looks at me because 

1683
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:46,840
they see me from the podcast getting his
head.

1684
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,230
No,
no,

1685
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:48,620
no,
no,

1686
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,430
no.
I know exactly.

1687
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,240
I know it's either he had either.
He wanted to sell me drugs.

1688
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,920
Oh,
he wanted to suck my dick.

1689
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,630
Okay.
How'd you decide that it was dick?

1690
01:14:58,810 --> 01:14:59,790
How creepy.
It was.

1691
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,310
Just his appearance.
I don't want to say he look gay,

1692
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,680
but just as a pretty little guy.
He was a male.

1693
01:15:04,681 --> 01:15:07,050
Prostitute.
Mouth is watering.

1694
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,201
Okay.
Okay.

1695
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:10,000
So anyway,
so these guys,

1696
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,700
these guys will come down and they'd be 
half drunk.

1697
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:13,803
Like in hindsight I think about it and 
they all these types of dudes that may 

1698
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:19,330
not just be gay,
they just have a family,

1699
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:24,331
but they liked the scene in 1980 you.
It wasn't easy to go.

1700
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,593
I'm coming out of the closet.
There was a lot of guys and let me talk 

1701
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:31,410
to you about stuff.
Been around.

1702
01:15:31,411 --> 01:15:35,760
The Guy told me the truth as a man 
around the guy that when you get in your

1703
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:36,780
car and go home,
you're like,

1704
01:15:36,781 --> 01:15:37,614
you know one for sure.
I could definitely talk that in the 

1705
01:15:39,991 --> 01:15:40,750
second question.

1706
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,583
He's dying or something like,
even though he's got a hot girlfriend 

1707
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:48,370
and they got a dog and he goes to 
fucking crossfit.

1708
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:49,783
You can tell.
Maybe he could talk them into switching 

1709
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:58,060
governments if he's got a lot of dudes 
like that.

1710
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,190
When a kid is walking his dog,
it's like,

1711
01:16:04,191 --> 01:16:05,090
fuck,
am I gay?

1712
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,661
No,
no,

1713
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,494
no,
no.

1714
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:13,130
Evil fantasies like robin fantasy.
But he was gay as fuck.

1715
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,070
No,
that's not saying that,

1716
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,680
but I'm just saying that you got another
thing.

1717
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,510
There's a lot of fucking guy's dog that 
you see that you know,

1718
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,420
maybe their dad's still alive and he was
a marine.

1719
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:30,703
You can't,
you can't go home and tell your dad was 

1720
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:34,094
a general guys.
If your dad was alive and you want to 

1721
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,030
blow guys Rogan,

1722
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,310
urine in color,
how many guys do you think are out there

1723
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:44,440
right now?
We've had this,

1724
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:46,730
this millions that have married 
whatever,

1725
01:16:46,731 --> 01:16:50,990
but every once in a while they put a 
feather suit on and they'd go dance like

1726
01:16:50,991 --> 01:16:53,390
in anything.
It's probably more than 10.

1727
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:57,260
And that's what we used to.
We used to go down and we was dumb kids.

1728
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,290
We figured out we can rob these dudes 
that were drunk.

1729
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,810
They'd come down and get the Dick 
sucked.

1730
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,420
So we got the captain,
the police's son,

1731
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:06,254
so we weren't going to go to jail.
He was better looking than you were 

1732
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,580
going to go to.
We put him out there.

1733
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:11,414
We could put like a a Guinea tee shirt,
you know those white beans with little 

1734
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:16,184
gold chain with a cocktail.
We put them out there and then we hide 

1735
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:26,840
in the trees and then he'd go and suck 
his Dick and the guy would park and then

1736
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:30,500
he'd walk them back and right before I 
went through to get that one knee,

1737
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,030
I come up with that straight,
right,

1738
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,300
kicked Jon Jones to the fucking nut 
sack.

1739
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,460
Go down.
We were in the trees in the trades.

1740
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:39,623
Fuck.
Fucking fly down from the tree and we 

1741
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,690
detain Pam.
Pam,

1742
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,130
we take your money and we run with 16 
guys.

1743
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,250
You don't.
Nobody knows what's right and what's not

1744
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,450
that my mother,
no.

1745
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,160
Perfect guy.
The host who is.

1746
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,873
You got to remember my crew was the 
third crew out there was a crew from 

1747
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:00,440
64th street.
They will not only robbing you,

1748
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:01,303
they were taking you to your house.
I had friends that were in high school 

1749
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:06,620
that actually would get.
Was setting you up here.

1750
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:07,454
Let's get thick and then they put you 
back in your car and go to your house 

1751
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,720
and rob you.
We were the light crew.

1752
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:14,750
We were just going down.
They're peppering you with a few shots.

1753
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:17,000
I'm running away with again,
my point,

1754
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:19,460
but the store was,
there was one time where he got beat up.

1755
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,710
I went down there by myself.
You went to.

1756
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:22,430
Yeah,
you went by myself.

1757
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:25,340
I had to mix minus the eight and a half 
and I only won by eight,

1758
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:29,930
so by the and I called my buddy that I 
go dog,

1759
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:32,060
we lost and he goes,
I'm with my girlfriend,

1760
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:38,350
but at the time I'm with you on it up.
I'm hanging out with my buddies back,

1761
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:47,690
do nothing to me.
He lit me up.

1762
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,420
It was.
It could have been known as his uncle,

1763
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:57,230
his uncle.
He punched me with so many shots,

1764
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,950
but again,
he lit up,

1765
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,600
lit me.
I'd had a bronco.

1766
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:05,870
But here's the funny thing that in 
hindsight now I know what Joe's saying.

1767
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,940
Levels of striking.
I never saw striking.

1768
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,550
It was nighttime,
so I didn't even see his hands.

1769
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:11,790
I just kept seeing it.

1770
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:18,020
Kept seeing the light.
When you see lights at night,

1771
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:20,960
that's the motherfucker had some 
training.

1772
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,133
It's funny.
There's a funny thing about striking 

1773
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:25,970
too,
and this relates to what Amanda can do.

1774
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,670
There's power and then there's like,
whoa,

1775
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:29,504
power.
There's like crazy God gifted 

1776
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:31,523
boundaries.
Some people just have it and you see it 

1777
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:34,640
with Linacre.
Linacre for sure.

1778
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:36,470
Has it rumbled for sure.
Has It?

1779
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,450
There's people that have this weird 
power,

1780
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,403
they have an ability to hit people and 
you see people that normally can take a 

1781
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:45,260
shot and you see the look in their eye 
when they're in big trouble,

1782
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,510
like right away.
And when you get hit like that,

1783
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:49,190
man,
you don't know where the fuck you are.

1784
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,160
Let me ask you this.
In Jujitsu,

1785
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:53,403
uh,
every black belt knows how to do a rear 

1786
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:56,324
naked choke,
but very few people can do a rear naked 

1787
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:01,520
choke like Marcella Garcia.
Very few people.

1788
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,340
Uh,
it's because.

1789
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,560
Would you,
would you say it was natural,

1790
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:08,100
like Linacre or

1791
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,110
was it because he spent a lot of time 
perfecting the back?

1792
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:13,050
And I know for a fact that he did,
he used to,

1793
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,143
he used to ride on people's backs with 
the over under and not even trying to 

1794
01:20:16,531 --> 01:20:17,364
tap him.
He would just spend a lot of time just 

1795
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:22,050
riding and perfecting the control.
Then he just mastered the fight and then

1796
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:22,884
he,
he realized how important that squeeze 

1797
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:25,314
was so that he would ride and squeeze 
and he knew that it was all about the 

1798
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,824
power of the squeeze.
So he's spent a lot of time with the 

1799
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:33,800
rear naked choke and you know,
there's a lot,

1800
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,733
there's,
there's quite a few guys out there now 

1801
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,510
that,
that are,

1802
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,530
uh,
have a foul,

1803
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,583
you know,
his students and other guys that have 

1804
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:44,010
developed back attacks is,
is,

1805
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,510
is almost as good as marcel,
but probably not as good now when you're

1806
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:50,140
talking about power,
you know,

1807
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,250
the certain guys have the power whether 
they're born with it or not.

1808
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:58,490
What if just what if the guys with the 
power actually in their training working

1809
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:03,750
harder and more consistently at 
developing power.

1810
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:08,550
Like what would you need?
Like you got that is a possibility,

1811
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:11,550
but it's also a physics issue.
It's also an anatomy.

1812
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:13,650
It's both though.
It might be both,

1813
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:15,660
but there's the big right.
It is like,

1814
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:16,494
okay,
here's the Kurt Cody Garbrandt is not a 

1815
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:18,774
big hands.
He's not built like a George Foreman 

1816
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:21,504
type character.
Like George Foreman has freakish 

1817
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,430
physical attributes,
he's got hands and they're like the size

1818
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:31,260
of like canned hams there,
fucking gigantic and he would just slump

1819
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,800
just some guys with a jab and you'd see 
them get stunned and hurt.

1820
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,233
Obviously trained like a motherfucker 
obviously had very good check technique 

1821
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:41,670
to obviously worked on all those things 
too,

1822
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,260
but you can't overcome the physical 
attributes if a guy does all those other

1823
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:49,080
things as well,
that's where the freaks come in.

1824
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,430
That's where the people that just have 
this ridiculous one shot power.

1825
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,370
There's just an.
But there's technique.

1826
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,100
We can look at Congress on a big guy.
He's a wide shoulder guy,

1827
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,690
but he has that one hitter quitter.
Yeah,

1828
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,573
no question,
but when you think about your turning 

1829
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,290
sidekick,
right?

1830
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,133
Like your personal turning sidekick,
it's everybody knows now that it's 

1831
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,920
extremely powerful,
a scary,

1832
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:15,450
powerful,
very few people.

1833
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,660
I've never seen anybody throw turned 
inside.

1834
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,503
Kick as hard as you have.
I've worked with a lot of martial 

1835
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:22,830
artists in my time.
Still to this day.

1836
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,850
Holy Shit Up.
Michael White.

1837
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,310
Excuse me.
He's right up there too,

1838
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:28,890
but he's like six,
four to 40 anyways.

1839
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,980
Uh,
but you have said many times that the,

1840
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,103
the,
the secret behind your power was the 

1841
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:37,194
reps.
you knew that it was all about just 

1842
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:40,104
hitting that heavy bag as many goddamn 
times as possible every day to standing 

1843
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:45,234
in front.
And you said that most people don't 

1844
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:51,900
develop that power because most people 
just don't spend the time stealing a bag

1845
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,080
and just working.
So that was also built though.

1846
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,800
Well,
that to listen,

1847
01:22:56,801 --> 01:22:57,634
man.
There was a lot of guys that I trained 

1848
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:03,261
with and had good turning sidekicks.
I always knew that I had a cheat.

1849
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,980
I had a physical advantage,
like the

1850
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,813
size of my hands for someone my size.
I mean you have to realize I had hands 

1851
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:13,240
as big when I was fighting at 1:54.
It was ridiculous.

1852
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:14,074
They were just there.
Just certain physical attributes to the 

1853
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,433
width of the shoulders is big,
but that has nothing to do with your 

1854
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:20,434
turn inside dies.
It does because in the hips to ask all 

1855
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:30,220
the explosive.
It's also the fast fiber with powers.

1856
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,060
A lot of it is fast twitch and you 
didn't have fast,

1857
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:38,800
which you don't mean like Nick Diaz is a
hard puncher,

1858
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:40,330
but he's never going to be a puncher 
like weirdly,

1859
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,733
but no matter what he does,
when he trains with it will never be 

1860
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:45,560
able to punch them.
In average,

1861
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,713
your average a MMA fighter,
how much time do you think they spend 

1862
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,770
working on the power of their turning 
sidekick?

1863
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,450
Very guy,
very.

1864
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:58,650
No one really fills a space side kick 
very well.

1865
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:03,660
There's a few guys allotted a certain 
amount of time a week for 20 minutes I'm

1866
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:05,254
going to power how many guys,
folks on throwing a right hand or left 

1867
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:08,850
hand?
If they're dominant.

1868
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:12,100
Lefthanded are southpaws does.
There's only.

1869
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:14,690
There's very few can do it in one punch 
and knock guys out.

1870
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,843
You know,
fighters that specifically train 

1871
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:20,230
everyday just to develop specific 
punching.

1872
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:21,064
Like today I'm going to expense power 
punches right in between camps in 

1873
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:27,430
between shows do that for sure.
Guys will just like go.

1874
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:30,400
Like George was famous for doing that.
He would go down to [inaudible] and just

1875
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,340
just only trained Jujitsu for like 
months on end,

1876
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:34,720
you know,
just to really tighten everything up.

1877
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:37,870
You went to Brazil a couple of times 
just to train in boxing.

1878
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,960
You know,
I would do a dachsund towards what's the

1879
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:44,170
best thing you can do?
Like you're a professional fighter.

1880
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,003
You fight in the UFC,
you ranked 13th and you want to take 

1881
01:24:46,811 --> 01:24:47,241
your,
your,

1882
01:24:47,241 --> 01:24:48,700
your,
your power of your hand.

1883
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,970
You want to be able to knock someone.
You want to be.

1884
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:53,020
You want to have that conor mcgregor 
strength.

1885
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:57,820
What do I gotta do to get weight out?
I don't think so.

1886
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,430
Genetics.
Genetics.

1887
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,473
Genetics has a lot to do with it.
Ninety percent of if you go see 

1888
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,330
somebody,
they could clean up the efficiency.

1889
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,620
Yes.
It's your shoulders.

1890
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,953
Yes.
Technique is a lot of stuff that goes 

1891
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:14,290
into that punch.
You know,

1892
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,183
if a wrestler,
a world champion wrestler came in and I 

1893
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,820
came in and I was world champion 
wrestler,

1894
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:21,760
but my punches weren't that hard.
I think in time.

1895
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:24,640
True.
But let me tell you something.

1896
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:25,474
You talk to someone who's a real boxing 
trainer and they will tell you that 

1897
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:32,080
there are guys that just come in and for
whatever reason they might not have ever

1898
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:32,914
boxed before,
but you have them throw a jab and 

1899
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:35,620
they're like,
and you're like,

1900
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:38,160
oh Jesus,
whatever.

1901
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:42,040
For sure there's those pen.
Then it makes it better.

1902
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,023
You know the technique,
like if you look at a guy like Sergei 

1903
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,460
Kovalev who's a vicious knockout 
artists,

1904
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,710
vicious puncher,
he's got both.

1905
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:54,040
He's got the the,
the beautiful technique,

1906
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,710
but he also has that free gift.
God given strength.

1907
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,000
Those are the guys that oftentimes wind 
up being champions to.

1908
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:02,130
To that point,
look at Andre Ward who just fought,

1909
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:04,010
who doesn't hide trains more than

1910
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,750
surrogate.
He was an Olympic medalist.

1911
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:08,510
Gold medalist has been training,
fighting since he was 10.

1912
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:09,810
I think so,
yeah.

1913
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,040
He works on power punches,
but he's not a knockout or saying you're

1914
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:13,874
a head coach of a team.
You until all your fighters to a era 

1915
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:18,770
that bar north power.
You're not.

1916
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,980
Don't worry about working on your power.
Just work or not.

1917
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:25,280
I always work on your power editor.
You can always improve everything,

1918
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,263
but you're never going to get it to that
rumble level like I'm never going to 

1919
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:29,510
tell them,
hey,

1920
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:33,350
let's let's pick our shots here.
Let's do more volume.

1921
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,430
Can you do specifically 15 minutes a 
week,

1922
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,810
30 minutes a week it.
We're focusing on developing power.

1923
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,960
You're not known for a rugby coach,
doesn't matter.

1924
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,560
Two years.
We're going to do.

1925
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:46,483
What is it though specifically with 
dumbbells like Muhammad and just throw 

1926
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,790
punches.
I

1927
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,510
certainly do some strength and 
conditioning work that would help.

1928
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:58,850
Just setting a back,
hitting a bag would help a lot.

1929
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,180
Hitting power shop.
Maybe it's all the above.

1930
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,014
Will help.
Like evander holyfield started working 

1931
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:05,384
out with Mackie.
She'll stone when he went up from 

1932
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:06,884
cruiserweight to heavyweight,
so we did a lot of weight lifting and 

1933
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:10,140
his power came along with weight on 
them.

1934
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,210
Put a lot of weight on and maybe Mexican
supplements,

1935
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:15,170
so explosive and maybe definitely 
Mexican supplements.

1936
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,070
One hundred percent,
100 percent,

1937
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,460
and he could win the Olympia at the same
time,

1938
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,453
but the guys who are like,
like there's a good video of Joseph 

1939
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,113
Volta on is go to have a bazooka.
Joe Valtellina on his instagram page 

1940
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:28,843
fault Illini who was glory champion,
how to step back for it because because 

1941
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:33,940
of concussions and I think he's gonna 
stay retired,

1942
01:27:33,941 --> 01:27:37,370
but he hasn't decided yet,
but he went down on top.

1943
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,960
I mean he's one of the best kickbox in 
the world,

1944
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:42,740
but there's a video of him hitting the 
pads and just digging,

1945
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,083
digging into pads and talking about like
the importance of sometimes just going 

1946
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,230
all out with power.
Just all our power shots on the paths.

1947
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:53,150
Like watch.
I could see this guy.

1948
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:56,720
He's a butt and when he's doing it,
when he's,

1949
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,583
when he's hitting these pads,
the good thing about it is hands never 

1950
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:03,980
dropped from his chin.
Always good position,

1951
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:09,430
but to really dig in and work only 
solely on your power,

1952
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,870
you don't want to do that all the time.
Like,

1953
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:15,140
this is just something that you're going
to do occasionally and only,

1954
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,180
you know,
every athlete has to decide.

1955
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,570
It really depends on the person.
Depends on what else you're working on,

1956
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:22,840
five minutes a day.
It's a bit like this combination.

1957
01:28:22,841 --> 01:28:23,810
This is so simple.

1958
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:26,150
Combinations like right hand,
left hook,

1959
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,050
right kick to develop,
right?

1960
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:30,760
Isn't it better on a heavy bag then as 
opposed to these?

1961
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:32,510
Not necessarily.
That's just as good.

1962
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,373
That's just as good that style,
but that's not as good for straight 

1963
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:38,000
kicks because you can't kick a person to
the body that way.

1964
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,180
Like if I put a body pat on a dude and I
spinning back,

1965
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:42,740
kick him,
he's going to get really hurt.

1966
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:46,250
Like I'll break your ribs even with one 
of those big body shields on it.

1967
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,230
If you let someone spinning back kick 
you in the body,

1968
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:50,150
it's going to break your ribs.
There's some punches too.

1969
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:50,984
If they.
If they do a liver shot on the coach 

1970
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:53,650
with a Ipad,
they'll drop the.

1971
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,440
Drop them internal bleeding or hit soil.
Fuck up Mitch.

1972
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,300
Yeah,
the dude who lost,

1973
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,010
who was the first boxer that got choked 
out in

1974
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,500
the UFC?
I heard that dude.

1975
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,600
Oh,
he can fuck some meds.

1976
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:10,610
Oh,
people snow piece.

1977
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,580
He said,
Oh,

1978
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,950
you got to put extra.
He will.

1979
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:14,813
Fuck your shit up.
He was an artist when he was at his 

1980
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:17,750
best.
He was an artist.

1981
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,980
He jumped from that national team that 
let's say,

1982
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:22,080
who's the best boxer most talented of 
all time.

1983
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:24,540
Every single person unanimously says,
James,

1984
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,930
Tony,
even floyd mayweather,

1985
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,750
the best we've ever seen.
Talent wise.

1986
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,540
James Tony.
He was a bad motherfucker,

1987
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,010
but he liked to eat.
He loved him.

1988
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:34,110
Some fucking big banks.
That's a problem.

1989
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,720
He got sick.
He went all the way up to heavyweight.

1990
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,280
Remember that?
You know I'm James.

1991
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:41,160
Tony started out his career at one 61 68
freak.

1992
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:43,710
Super Freak to to to.
To that point though,

1993
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,570
and we can end on that.
I'll get rid of it.

1994
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:48,000
Look at baseball,
like Mark Mcguire.

1995
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,920
He's never going to be a single base 
guy.

1996
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:50,783
He's a fucking guy who'd example full of
Mexicans supplements when he's at his 

1997
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,130
best.
True.

1998
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,710
If you get that guy on the couch and had
them hit a baseball,

1999
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,420
I mean how,
how much,

2000
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,380
how much distance is the difference 
between.

2001
01:30:02,381 --> 01:30:05,640
He might hit 30 home runs at a 70,
but still,

2002
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,770
I mean he was in his genetics.
Big Forums,

2003
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,340
powerful hips follow through.
He's never going to be the guy who would

2004
01:30:11,341 --> 01:30:14,310
bunt the ball or lead on so,
so same thing,

2005
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:16,830
same thing,
Jack to the deals,

2006
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,320
but that might not necessarily translate
into punching power,

2007
01:30:19,321 --> 01:30:21,780
which is really interesting.
It's like they might just be really good

2008
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:22,810
at that.
You know,

2009
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,200
punching power is a weird one,
man.

2010
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,160
It's,
it's a real weird powers.

2011
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,690
Just as quick as it hit hard because 
that motherfucker throw hard.

2012
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,480
It again that,
that movement from the hips,

2013
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:36,670
all that same movement.
They said that when you.

2014
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:41,880
They had a documentary on him that he 
needs three draft 30 for 30 hells yeah.

2015
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:45,270
They fucking slammed him while they had 
a scam him up.

2016
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,150
Like they had pulled a starting.
Brenda had a.

2017
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,880
had a drafted because he didn't want to 
go to Baltimore.

2018
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,340
Yeah.
He don't want to go into the culture.

2019
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:53,850
Man.
This shit kinky shit,

2020
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:57,030
but bro,
this dude standing on the warning sign,

2021
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,390
that's a true story.
He could stay at the hunt,

2022
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,233
the warning track,
John Elway take one step and put the 

2023
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:08,151
ball right there and your glove at home,
but really that's deadly there.

2024
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:11,520
There's a really.
You have no idea.

2025
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,860
How far is that?
I have to say three.

2026
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:14,461
Oh,
five,

2027
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:15,900
305 feet.
Three hundred.

2028
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:18,240
Five feet and he's easy throwing.
Is it?

2029
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:20,890
Does it going up in the air or is it a 
straight line?

2030
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,033
Just a bullet bullet.
They're not to throw so fast for that 

2031
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,650
ball,
not to dry.

2032
01:31:25,651 --> 01:31:29,850
You have to watch some of the third 
piece of fruit or like that.

2033
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,880
It's very interesting how he didn't want
to play with Baltimore,

2034
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:35,970
so somebody went to Stein brothers 
office and they said,

2035
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,103
we'd like for you to draft John Elway.
Steinbrenner goes and he opened up the 

2036
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:43,770
schedule for the fucking the line up for
like three years later.

2037
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:47,190
He had always starting right field.
Here's why that's crazy.

2038
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:49,860
His wife being able to throw from the 
warning track into home plate,

2039
01:31:49,861 --> 01:31:50,694
as is crazy.
If you took a baseball and you through 

2040
01:31:53,491 --> 01:31:58,491
it and you shot a bullet,
they would both drop at the same rate,

2041
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,010
so the bullet is only going to be in

2042
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,220
the air for a few seconds.
That's why you could be 200 yards away,

2043
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:04,054
put your crosshairs on.
Someone pulled the trigger and then 

2044
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:06,844
boom,
they die immediately is because the 

2045
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:09,424
bullets traveling so fast,
but the drop has the same amount of 

2046
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:12,214
time.
So it depends on how long it takes to 

2047
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:16,090
get there.
It's how far it's going to drop.

2048
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,180
So like if you're shooting someone 
something from really far away,

2049
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:21,430
like there's a lot of people that get 
into long range shooting.

2050
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,770
Like the goal in those ranges that will 
hit these plates,

2051
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:27,790
these steel plates that are like five,
800,000

2052
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:31,690
yards away and you hear bang clink like 
you.

2053
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,030
There's a delay,
a noticeable delay,

2054
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,820
and in that delay they have to calculate
the drop.

2055
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:41,440
So like if they're shooting at that 
plate there radical where they aim,

2056
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:42,274
it has to adjust for the fact that this 
bullet is going to drop and the amount 

2057
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:48,040
of time that it takes to get 800 yards 
to aim higher.

2058
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:48,923
Yeah,
so it's going to take a second or so or 

2059
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:51,700
half a second,
whatever it is.

2060
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:54,760
So they have to aim higher so that its 
scope adjust for that.

2061
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,163
If you're throwing a baseball,
imagine how much slower than it is than 

2062
01:32:59,351 --> 01:33:02,800
a bullet.
So you have to throw so fucking fast.

2063
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:05,260
If you're throwing straight,
if you're just gonna,

2064
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:08,500
throw straight,
silly and go get into home plate.

2065
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:10,930
That mother fucker must be throwing a 
bullet.

2066
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:12,593
It must be crazy.
You know his receivers in Denver the 

2067
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:15,144
first few years I couldn't catch them of
catch the ball they played catch with 

2068
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:18,214
their pads and will be so hard.
Dude leave imprints on the nuclear 

2069
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,260
plants on the chance.
People crazy.

2070
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:24,423
And that's a known,
that's a known skill that some people 

2071
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:29,290
just never developed the ability to 
throw a fastball.

2072
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:30,363
That's another one.
It's like punching paint discussed it 

2073
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:32,370
last time.

2074
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:33,203
The dynamics of it,
I'll tell you who I think would 

2075
01:33:35,851 --> 01:33:39,700
translate from if he threw a punch,
a guy who was explosive with as fuck and

2076
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:41,680
could throw and do it all.
Bo Jackson.

2077
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,650
Oh yeah.
Bo Jackson Bunch.

2078
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,460
Have you taught both?
Jackson had a punch,

2079
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,260
but you know,
here's another example.

2080
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:48,094
Herschel Walker.
Herschel Walker could punch like a 

2081
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:51,790
motherfucker and he was a karate black 
belt.

2082
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,653
I mean he,
he fought a bunch of MMA fights deep 

2083
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:59,071
into his forties.
Remember Jack didn't like 48.

2084
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,280
Bridgette giant six pack.
Not an ounce of fat.

2085
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,650
Looks like a superhero like you'll 
reveal,

2086
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,370
but age to look old.
It was weird.

2087
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,300
It didn't.
Real weird.

2088
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,550
He still looks good.
He's in his fifties now.

2089
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,650
Talking about having one more fight 
before he stopped.

2090
01:34:14,651 --> 01:34:15,281
Yeah,
let's not.

2091
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:18,640
But yeah.
Hearing why not get some.

2092
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:22,880
How about fucking rising?
My gabby.

2093
01:34:22,881 --> 01:34:25,120
Go see grandma's going to post it.

2094
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,500
I was going to pose it.
I got the video.

2095
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:29,260
I was gonna.
I was just going to post what the fuck?

2096
01:34:29,261 --> 01:34:31,620
Japan.
Then I thought about it.

2097
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:32,360
I go,
I can't do it.

2098
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,780
It was running.
The chick was that.

2099
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,020
Can we see that?
Yeah.

2100
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,270
Do you know where it is?
Jamie?

2101
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,240
I've got to pull it up here real quick.
Go ahead and put myself.

2102
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:42,190
I'm going to put it up on instagram,
Jamie,

2103
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,910
and when I put it up on instagram you 
could.

2104
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,610
I'm just going to put it up.
Have you seen this?

2105
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:50,910
And I'm going to write a fucking huge 
straight up grandma.

2106
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:56,540
She comes out and is doing like the wwe 
off the ropes.

2107
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:57,980
Selfish.
Coming out like it's a game.

2108
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:59,270
You don't mind girl.
Jessica?

2109
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:02,330
Tap fucking Gabby Garcia.
Jessica who flowers.

2110
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,253
Oh really?
She did in competition and competition 

2111
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:10,340
at worlds.
I just posted it.

2112
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:15,230
So if you go to my instagram Joe Rogan,
you'll see it.

2113
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:16,064
Just says what the fuck?
Japan WTF Japan and you see this one 

2114
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:23,630
woman,
our ring Jack to that tits.

2115
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,710
Looks like Jose Conseco.
Nineteen 84.

2116
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,240
Oh my God.
That old lady.

2117
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:30,074
Which a thought of 50 year old woman who
looked like she hasn't worked out in a 

2118
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,433
year and she looks so scared.
Can we get a go fund me so she doesn't 

2119
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:38,630
have to do this shit?
That woman looks so scared to open.

2120
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,750
Scared.
Can we re?

2121
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,890
Can you refresh that God looks she needs
are in the body.

2122
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,853
All my God and punches her in the face 
and mercifully Gabby Garcia is not the 

2123
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,840
most vicious striker in the world.
Not The friendly is.

2124
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:51,410
Oh,
it's hot.

2125
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:52,680
Well,
she had to do what she had to do.

2126
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,100
Would you take that fight,
Gabby?

2127
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,443
Easy cash.

2128
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,760
Well,
that must've been to north Hollywood and

2129
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:06,761
give him massages are going to north 
Hollywood and stuff.

2130
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,560
I don't even think they give her the 
option.

2131
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:14,720
I think they just delay the trip to 
North Hollywood.

2132
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,310
Watch this.
Look how scared she is.

2133
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,830
Look at our big deep breaths while she's
looking at Gabby's body.

2134
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,480
She's like six,
four.

2135
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:25,220
She's legit.
Six [inaudible] four,

2136
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:26,670
probably two.
Oh,

2137
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:29,990
totally natural.
And this grandma steroids are natural.

2138
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:34,610
They all come from.
What the fuck is going on in Japan?

2139
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,100
So crazy.
Are you doing so crazy?

2140
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,360
Why that grandma?
Even in the.

2141
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,810
I just can't.
Man.

2142
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,980
I'm going to win.
No fans.

2143
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:43,814
If I do this well,
I don't think most people have seen 

2144
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:47,470
this.
I just get the sucker Robin.

2145
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,560
Nice knee braces on and place.
Yeah.

2146
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:52,580
What is the reason why she did it?
This lady,

2147
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:56,780
you gotTa.
Look how scared she shook her hand after

2148
01:36:56,781 --> 01:36:59,220
it's over and maybe she was a pro 
wrestler or something.

2149
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:02,360
Think she was a protester.
They probably gave her a big ass pay day

2150
01:37:02,361 --> 01:37:03,830
to lose a few years of her life.

2151
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,420
What the fuck?
What the fuck and deed?

2152
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:10,490
That's what the deal.
I will say this.

2153
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:11,324
That's the worst Japanese freak show 
I've ever seen because that was a woman 

2154
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:17,080
who did not belong.
That's the worst flight I've ever seen.

2155
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:18,860
Yeah.
That's the worst.

2156
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:22,460
The worst person ever.
The most brutal mismatch ever.

2157
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:25,010
Yeah.
Horrible man.

2158
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,010
Horrible.
Why?

2159
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:26,853
But Kathy black belt.
Why didn't you just grab a hold of her 

2160
01:37:29,571 --> 01:37:30,404
and choke her?
I mean she could have easily not even 

2161
01:37:32,151 --> 01:37:35,720
hurt the old lady.
People will pay to watch anything on new

2162
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:36,471
users.
I know,

2163
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,320
but I mean if you're Gabby,
Gabby,

2164
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:43,010
and you're looking at that old guy that 
wants to fuck his dog,

2165
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:45,810
you look them over five years.
Eve is eve.

2166
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:49,820
Make it the way I got to go to the 
solid.

2167
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,860
See one of those videos when you were a 
kid,

2168
01:37:51,861 --> 01:37:54,860
did you know anybody that had like a vhs
of like a barnyard?

2169
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,770
You never saw the flux barnyard.
Oh No.

2170
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,770
My friend billy when,
when I was 20,

2171
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:02,604
I guess got a vhs tape of this chick 
that got fucked by animals and we went 

2172
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:10,160
to his basement.
He had,

2173
01:38:10,161 --> 01:38:12,630
he had to hide it so he had to like go 
get it.

2174
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,583
And then we had a meet down the base and
then one of us had to watch the door so 

2175
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:17,330
that no one would,
uh,

2176
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:18,270
you know,
one of the parents,

2177
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:19,104
like.
So one of us was like on the stairs 

2178
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,970
looking down like railings in the 
basement,

2179
01:38:23,971 --> 01:38:26,250
there's like the fucking gap between the
stairs and the railing.

2180
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,280
So I don't remember who it was,
but he was like on the stairs,

2181
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:30,263
like watching the TV through the gap 
because he had to be the guy with his 

2182
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:37,140
arm up in case the door open because 
we're watching this chick blow a fucking

2183
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:37,974
dog and blow a horse and get fucked by a
donkey and all this different crazy 

2184
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:42,030
shit.

2185
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:46,290
Same lady or multiple.
It was so grainy and so hard to tell,

2186
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:49,830
but it was real.
I mean she really was like letting a dog

2187
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,290
fucker.
She was like letting a pig fucker.

2188
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:53,700
It was,
it was horrible.

2189
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,820
It was horrible.
I,

2190
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,030
I remember faces of death.
I remember being.

2191
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,800
I couldn't even finish it.
I was so scared.

2192
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,750
Do you understand?
I see them all.

2193
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,550
You've seen them all.
Remember the woman they tied to?

2194
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:03,470
Dude,
between two co,

2195
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,570
two trucks pulled them apart.
I don't remember that.

2196
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:07,620
Yeah,
it was in the Middle East.

2197
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:09,210
Yeah.
I didn't get down or tired.

2198
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,044
You got that x rayed and she took it all
under the one with the guy that the 

2199
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:15,120
newscaster that was walking backwards to
the alligator.

2200
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:16,530
Got Him.
What?

2201
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,430
He was like,
well,

2202
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:22,430
here at the fucking clear clearwater,
Florida,

2203
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:29,220
see the railing of the dumps and deeper 
and deeper,

2204
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:29,730
yes.

2205
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:34,730
Now the children are going to stop it if
somebody comes and throws a blanket like

2206
01:39:36,961 --> 01:39:38,670
a leg pops up.
Oh my God,

2207
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,990
the guy hang gliding and he had like the
camera and he's hang gliding.

2208
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,873
Just goes into that fucking swamp.
And then just Crocodylus oh Jesus 

2209
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,070
Christ,
the one with the guy hanging the power.

2210
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:53,910
You have a car when you drive in and 
those guys and hanging the terminals.

2211
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,193
And they showed a guy doing something 
and the bolt just blow them up and him 

2212
01:39:58,651 --> 01:40:02,530
just like his head going on fire.
It was just dropped dead.

2213
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:04,980
God,
they showed the monkey and China,

2214
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,040
will you go into a restaurant and you 
get hit him in there?

2215
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,310
Yeah,
that's awful.

2216
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:15,090
No one wants to tantric ritual where 
they said that they said that.

2217
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:16,293
So that one's fake.
There was a few of those did they did 

2218
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,650
with a stage stuff where they pretend 
uh,

2219
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:24,510
pulling out the guts that was like 
starting fake and cheesy.

2220
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,730
But at that point,
monkey was really screaming,

2221
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:27,564
man.
They were hitting him in the fucking 

2222
01:40:28,081 --> 01:40:29,670
head.
God Damn.

2223
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:32,580
That's a hard thing to the way that's 
all.

2224
01:40:32,581 --> 01:40:36,120
Before they knew that eating primate 
brains is like super bad for you.

2225
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:37,640
Is it?
Fuck yeah.

2226
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:38,723
He primates have prions in their brains.
That's where you get mad cow disease 

2227
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,680
like mad cow disease or Jacob.
Jacob how?

2228
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,683
How are you saying that disease comes 
from eating the same tissue as the 

2229
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:52,440
species that you are.
So that's why cows get it.

2230
01:40:52,441 --> 01:40:57,441
Cows get from eating brain tissue of 
other cows like you feed cows.

2231
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:58,653
The like.
That's one of the horrible things about 

2232
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:00,544
industrialized farming is they would 
actually take whatever the fuck is left 

2233
01:41:03,021 --> 01:41:06,490
to the cow they're not using and they 
grind it up and feed it to fucking cows.

2234
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,390
Cows that are straight vegetarian that 
are only supposed to be in grass.

2235
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:13,240
They're not even supposed to eat corn.
When we eat corn,

2236
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:16,000
it fucks them up and they're feeding 
them cow brains.

2237
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,073
They're feed them their own bodies.
It was hard and that's what gets in and 

2238
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:23,160
that's how they got mad cow disease 
spreads.

2239
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,760
That's okay.
That's okay.

2240
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:28,820
You can raise your good.
My mother used to slice them thin rather

2241
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:33,850
than with Italian progresso and deep 
frying God damn fucking lemon.

2242
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:37,430
My uncle vinny used to cook them on the 
grills.

2243
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:41,180
Any hold up brands?
Brands,

2244
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:46,400
brands have a cow.
Cats.

2245
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,020
Oh Shit.

2246
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:55,930
That's such a small scoop of cat.
A cat guy.

2247
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:56,873
No,
no.

2248
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:03,120
Oh my God.
My mom used to slice those cat cow.

2249
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,130
We used limit on them.
If I give them to you and go,

2250
01:42:08,131 --> 01:42:10,780
go ahead and eat that chicken cutlet,
you'll go joey,

2251
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:13,310
this shouldn't call it,
so I have a fuck of that.

2252
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,520
Chicken cutlets,
calves,

2253
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,540
brands.
He'll probably throw a cow brains.

2254
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:19,720
It's good,
but it's really good.

2255
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:25,780
We won't leave this guy.
Don't feed it to another cow.

2256
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:29,230
And there's a thing called prions and 
those are what the problem is.

2257
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:31,120
And these prions.
Here's what's really crazy.

2258
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:34,270
It's almost like nature has a foolproof 
way.

2259
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,133
There's Catholic pranks.
Nature has a foolproof way of making 

2260
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:40,450
sure it fucks you up with these prions 
because he's.

2261
01:42:40,451 --> 01:42:45,451
Prions can exist at a thousand plus 
degrees for a long time,

2262
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,610
so you can't cook them out like they.

2263
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,990
They exist at a temperature way above 
anything you've ever been to expose your

2264
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:53,824
food too and they can,
I think find out how long prions can 

2265
01:42:57,311 --> 01:43:02,311
exist at over a thousand years.
That's something stunning like hours,

2266
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:05,800
hours at a thousand degrees,
so you're not going to kill them,

2267
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,663
so if you've got them in your food,
if you're eating and where they found 

2268
01:43:09,431 --> 01:43:12,730
this also not just in mad cow disease,
but in New Guinea,

2269
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:15,370
in cannibals,
when they find cannibals,

2270
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:16,204
they exhibit the same sort of 
neurological issues where their whole 

2271
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:20,380
body starts shaking.
Like with Jacobs,

2272
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:23,180
Clark's felds is.
It's like a lot like Parkinson's,

2273
01:43:23,181 --> 01:43:25,410
like they start fucking shaking.
It's an.

2274
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,273
It's a neurological disease that those 
prions from eating brain matter from 

2275
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:31,024
human beings,
it actually gets into your system and 

2276
01:43:33,221 --> 01:43:35,260
just fucks you up.
Apparently.

2277
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:37,360
You can eat meat though.
You can eat human meat.

2278
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:37,880
It doesn't do any.

2279
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:38,570
You're fine.
Yeah.

2280
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:39,403
It's human brains is the real issue.
It's just who the fuck is he in human 

2281
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:44,500
brains?
A lot of people,

2282
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:45,334
man,
I mean there was one of the best 

2283
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:47,583
evidence,
best pieces of evidence that human 

2284
01:43:49,631 --> 01:43:53,050
beings homosapiens preyed on the 
undertones.

2285
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:57,680
It was finding neanderthal brains,
our skulls with their brain scooped out.

2286
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,753
They had scratch marks on the inside 
where people are scooping out the 

2287
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:03,320
brains.
They had spoons,

2288
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:07,070
they had rocks that whatever the fuck 
they could use to scoop stuff up,

2289
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,710
but they're scraping.
You know when you're getting a brain,

2290
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:10,544
there's that connective tissues,
the shit that all goes wrong when you 

2291
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:15,940
get knocked out too many times and that 
connective tissues,

2292
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:16,783
this fibrous matrix that holds the brain
in place and they're scraping that shit 

2293
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:24,140
away with a rock as gel that covers your
fluid fluid.

2294
01:44:24,141 --> 01:44:25,670
But there's also like tissue.

2295
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,390
There's scratches and shit,
you know,

2296
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,400
knows it's tools.
It's like deep bone scratches,

2297
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:34,580
gnarly as well.
They figured out.

2298
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:38,600
They know the difference between what 
the characteristics of,

2299
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:40,340
of,
of predatory stuff like,

2300
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:41,323
like an animal that's like gnawing on 
bones and real obvious slices that came 

2301
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:46,460
from like a,
like a tool.

2302
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:50,060
Like when when human beings made lowe's 
flint tools and shit like that.

2303
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:51,253
So they've done enough of those tests 
were these archeologists can examine 

2304
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,393
these flint marks on bones and with a 
very high degree of certainty tell 

2305
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:02,600
whether or not someone's using a flint 
tool on bone,

2306
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:04,640
whether or not they're using.
You know,

2307
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:07,010
what's one of the more interesting 
things about Egypt.

2308
01:45:07,011 --> 01:45:07,844
In fact,
it's because there's some artifacts in 

2309
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:10,994
Egypt that are so perplexing.
When I had John Anthony West on the 

2310
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:16,150
podcast,
he and I had some conversations about.

2311
01:45:16,151 --> 01:45:19,610
It was really interesting because they 
don't know how the fuck they carve these

2312
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:20,444
things out.

2313
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,550
There's these,
there's some vases,

2314
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:23,480
vase,
vase,

2315
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,650
um,
that they made out of stone that exhibit

2316
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:27,991
like,
well,

2317
01:45:27,991 --> 01:45:29,690
looks like someone cut them with a 
diamond,

2318
01:45:29,691 --> 01:45:32,360
like some diamond headed drill.
Like they don't.

2319
01:45:32,361 --> 01:45:33,194
They literally don't know how they did 
it because it's missing all the 

2320
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:36,493
characteristics of a that you would 
normally get from someone making 

2321
01:45:39,531 --> 01:45:40,331
something like this.
Like the,

2322
01:45:40,331 --> 01:45:41,164
the hole at the front is too small and 
it goes inside and it's all smooth 

2323
01:45:44,661 --> 01:45:46,220
insides.
Like how the fuck did they did this?

2324
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:47,054
They did it all out of stone.
They carved out a one piece of stone so 

2325
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:53,030
they can see stuff like they found some 
other things,

2326
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:55,750
different holes in things that they're 
pretty sure like some,

2327
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:59,100
they use some sort of a,
if not a diamond drill,

2328
01:45:59,101 --> 01:46:01,340
like some kind of a drill with an 
incredibly hard tip,

2329
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,013
but so they know.
They know that people were eating 

2330
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,930
neanderthal brains,
which is fucked up.

2331
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,100
Fucked.
It's fucked up,

2332
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,320
but it makes sense.
You know what I mean?

2333
01:46:12,321 --> 01:46:13,154
We know the Donner party,
they fucking hate each other and they 

2334
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:15,434
knew each other and they ate each other 
about that lily alive plane that went 

2335
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:20,300
down to Argentina.
Yeah,

2336
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,830
Dude.
You get hungry.

2337
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:24,320
You do whatever the fuck you gotta do to
stay alive.

2338
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:28,490
If we go down and play there when be 
started looking at me and shit like,

2339
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:33,470
oh Joe,
you got some good ribs.

2340
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,630
How long it takes?
How long?

2341
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,113
How many days of no food does it take 
before you start looking at other dudes 

2342
01:46:44,421 --> 01:46:45,254
and you're like,
damn.

2343
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:48,080
Yeah,
like his shoulder starts looking good.

2344
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,070
Well,
it's also like if

2345
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,770
you were with your friend and you were 
like trapped somewhere,

2346
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,870
you would have to think like,
okay,

2347
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:58,860
if I eat this dude,
I have to live with that for the rest of

2348
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:01,080
my life.
Like even if you guys drew straws,

2349
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,071
like you said,
okay,

2350
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,870
one of us going to live when I was going
to die.

2351
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,390
If I come up short,
I'm jumping off this fucking cliff.

2352
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,313
You climbed down the bottom and eat me.
Like you make an agreement with someone 

2353
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:11,784
who's so gangster,
they actually fall through that Matt 

2354
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:18,030
Brown type character.
Right?

2355
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,864
So if you did do that,
like you probably were going to die 

2356
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:23,000
anyway eventually.
Like,

2357
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:23,843
and then on your way,
you'd be so ridden with guilt and even 

2358
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:29,730
if you made it,
even if you made it home,

2359
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,340
you'd be fucked for the rest of your 
life.

2360
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:35,310
Like what kind of a life do you even 
have now that you ate your buddy?

2361
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:37,110
That'd be a good time to know Jujitsu,
right?

2362
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:37,944
In a plane crash and Sir you're trying 
to survive up in the mountains that 

2363
01:47:40,611 --> 01:47:43,070
there's 20 people.
It'd be for a while.

2364
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:43,943
You just put a little children,
no fucking Jujitsu game eating after 21 

2365
01:47:48,331 --> 01:47:50,490
days without foods.
When you start getting fucked up,

2366
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:52,620
that's that naked.
Afraid yet three days with water.

2367
01:47:52,621 --> 01:47:53,940
Twenty one without food,
right?

2368
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,451
Yeah.
Well,

2369
01:47:54,451 --> 01:47:55,284
you're fucked up pretty much right away,
but your body goes into a state of 

2370
01:47:57,511 --> 01:47:59,880
ketosis that he eats off as much fat as 
you have.

2371
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:02,550
The more fat you have,
the better you know we don't think about

2372
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:04,980
that.
What are carbohydrate rich diets?

2373
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,240
Leave this.
What are you showing me?

2374
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:08,140
Jamie?
Survivals last resort.

2375
01:48:08,141 --> 01:48:10,350
In the case of one group adrift in a 
lifeboat,

2376
01:48:10,351 --> 01:48:11,184
hundred 16 passengers,
116 days passed without food before the 

2377
01:48:14,311 --> 01:48:15,870
party turned to eating human flesh.

2378
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:16,703
In most cases,
anything even remotely resembling food 

2379
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:22,920
was first eaten.
Dogs candles,

2380
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:23,754
leather shoes and blankets are all 
consumed first before cannibalism 

2381
01:48:26,611 --> 01:48:30,210
becomes the only recourse for survival.
Leather shoes.

2382
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:32,760
The shoes and blankets,
blankets,

2383
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,190
eat it.
Oh Jesus.

2384
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:38,970
That's dark you.
What you do is you rear naked,

2385
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,500
choke one dude and just say,
hey,

2386
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:41,850
look.
Fucking had a heart attack,

2387
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:44,910
and then you always have another body 
and you're in charge of that.

2388
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:47,610
Bob,
you're fucking choked them out.

2389
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:50,460
If you choke him out,
his body goes into fucking.

2390
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:51,703
The meat's going to be tough.
You know what I'm saying is that when 

2391
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:57,480
you shoot it the wrong way,
so you've got to let them die of natural

2392
01:48:57,481 --> 01:48:58,920
causes.
Then the meat tender,

2393
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,440
then you cut a little slice off a leg.

2394
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,480
I thought you were going to kill this 
guy and on.

2395
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,910
I'm killing them with kindness.
Kindness to this tab,

2396
01:49:11,911 --> 01:49:14,160
and then the meat is gave me,
gave me.

2397
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,880
My buddy called me some guy,
go see you in Colorado.

2398
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:22,750
He invented a bullet that hits the duck.
It has marinated in it.

2399
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:27,200
Why have you heard about or I sweat a 
lot.

2400
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:31,920
It has a marinades Teriyaki or something
for duck that when you shoot the gun,

2401
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:36,070
as soon as you hit it goes in it.
I swear to God,

2402
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:39,690
so ridiculous.
Something crazy.

2403
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:41,370
I don't think that would work but yet.
But I go,

2404
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:42,970
he's done Denver this weekend.
Go see him.

2405
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:47,060
He goes bad.
But the thing about marijuana is rotten.

2406
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:47,933
Yeah,
that's a good point to know what the 

2407
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:49,234
fuck it was.
It was marinated the capital peppers 

2408
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:53,704
here and we're in a fixed.
You've got to keep the bullets in the 

2409
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:56,704
freezer.
I think.

2410
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:00,420
Sounds like a bad business plan though,
Julia.

2411
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:01,413
It sounds like a dude is high on meth 
and comes up with a wacky idea that's 

2412
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,990
not going to sell.
Come on Rogan.

2413
01:50:04,991 --> 01:50:06,220
I get these teriyaki bullets.

2414
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:12,820
You have to do shit cannibalism.
Shoot him with a Teriyaki bullet,

2415
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,620
but marinade is like if you marinate the
steak,

2416
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:18,454
you need to like a pan.
You fill it up with marijuana and you 

2417
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:24,490
lay it in there and the idea is that 
slowly works its way into the muscle.

2418
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:28,180
Soaks in over like a day or two.
The doc,

2419
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:31,750
he's up in the end.
By the time you get to him,

2420
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:34,510
two days later,
two days later,

2421
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:36,870
be content spread though.
Let's get the party started.

2422
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:39,890
I see that.
You see that fight?

2423
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:40,801
Yeah,
man,

2424
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:44,710
he's amazing and here is no joke.
First big test.

2425
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,380
First real test for chrome.
Yeah.

2426
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,070
Why don't you see if he could find that 
online?

2427
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:49,810
Because I've only seen the finish.
I love the way.

2428
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:50,644
Trap the leg and caught him when he was 
trying to drop stomps on them and stuff 

2429
01:50:54,401 --> 01:50:55,600
and he's off his back.

2430
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,420
The whole rising card was sick.
It was a great card.

2431
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:03,430
He pulled guard three times.
Why not freak people frown upon it?

2432
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,293
Well,
but he's another one like we're talking 

2433
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:07,684
about.
That's an elite specialist in this one 

2434
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,290
area,
you know.

2435
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,153
I mean he's not fighting anywhere in UFC
type mean close was that I thought was 

2436
01:51:17,561 --> 01:51:18,700
45.
40th five.

2437
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:21,280
40th five.
I don't know.

2438
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:26,610
I'm pretty sure that was 45.
I was like 55 or seven.

2439
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:29,130
That's Japan.
So he might've weighed 45 cards.

2440
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:30,083
My weight one 80 that a grandma fight 
gabby for God knows that like 55 or 65 

2441
01:51:34,991 --> 01:51:37,690
probably walks at one 80.

2442
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:43,630
Abu Dhabi one 70.
What do you think?

2443
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:46,600
He walks around and he walks in one 70.
He's,

2444
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,580
he's.
He has size one 80.

2445
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,760
But when we had him on the pockets,
he didn't seem that big.

2446
01:51:51,761 --> 01:51:53,920
He didn't seem one a.
But he did seem one 70.

2447
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,260
But I could be wrong.
You know what?

2448
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:57,160
He could be one 70,
75.

2449
01:51:58,190 --> 01:52:00,100
Jamie,
what a well out Jamie.

2450
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,420
I'll find out for us.
Look at him.

2451
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:03,160
He's got a t shirt.
I'm looking.

2452
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,610
Wow.
Fighter in the kid.

2453
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:08,170
Tee Shirt by the kid.
Jamie.

2454
01:52:08,171 --> 01:52:09,060
I'm powerful.
Jamie.

2455
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:10,603
Um,
it's,

2456
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:11,483
it's good that they had that car,
but didn't they have that card over 

2457
01:52:13,151 --> 01:52:14,380
three days?
Is that what happened?

2458
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:16,610
They had the heavyweight tournament over
the three days.

2459
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,320
Terrible for your brain.
Not for Cro.

2460
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:25,000
Cop for the pride festival.
It's like a weekend thing.

2461
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:28,120
It's awesome.
It's really from that movie warriors.

2462
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:28,953
The only time that existed in real life 
up until these guys were getting fucked 

2463
01:52:31,391 --> 01:52:33,160
up.
Except for Cro.

2464
01:52:33,161 --> 01:52:33,971
Cop,
Cro,

2465
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:36,220
cop 42.
Who did he beat?

2466
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:39,880
King Mo time.
That all the time.

2467
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:43,160
King Mo.
Father time that iranian monster gas.

2468
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,390
Irene,
how did he knock him out?

2469
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,830
Caught up with the leFt hand.
Oh king.

2470
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,850
But the left hand to it.
Fucking mop.

2471
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:51,470
But some kicks to the body.
Oh,

2472
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,850
nas.
Through some heat.

2473
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:57,560
He looked in a cro.
Cop can go back to his old ways.

2474
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,410
You know,
there's no usada in Japan.

2475
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,460
As a matter of fact,
they encourage it though,

2476
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,900
lIke hop on buddy,
just like,

2477
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,080
what are you doing?
They both weighed in at 1:44

2478
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:09,400
point four.
Caligiuri weighed 144 point four.

2479
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:10,234
So basically 45 in Japan.
You get suspended for not doing 

2480
01:53:12,381 --> 01:53:13,230
steroids.
Yeah,

2481
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,050
no,
it's crazy.

2482
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:17,450
So crone is fighting at 1:45.
Yeah,

2483
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:18,350
he's a small dude.

2484
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,630
Listen,
how crazy would it be?

2485
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,990
He got to the fight to the ground so 
easily by just pulling guard.

2486
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:25,250
There's no way he was going to take him 
down.

2487
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,740
Caligiuri has got some serious 
wrestling.

2488
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,230
He's a tough motherfucker,
dude.

2489
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:31,210
How crazy would It be?
Etc.

2490
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,860
Crone in the fucking ufc.
That'd be sick.

2491
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,590
He's oh no,
five years.

2492
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,980
No.
But here's the thing.

2493
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,110
It will trap that leg.
Really nice.

2494
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:39,950
Look at that.
Look at that.

2495
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:41,840
Beautiful jar.
Very attractive.

2496
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:44,450
He trains with the right camp to do it 
too.

2497
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:45,460
Yep.
What'd you train?

2498
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:49,160
We train them as jake shields.
The diaz brothers.

2499
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:52,000
Jake shields got um,
he lost to john fitch yesterday.

2500
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:54,530
I pulled guard right there.
No problem.

2501
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,420
Big decision.
Look at 46,

2502
01:53:56,421 --> 01:54:00,140
49 when he's bored.
He likes getting into second side guard.

2503
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,670
I call,
I call it the cliff,

2504
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,720
but it's like a side thing.

2505
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,553
It's,
it's,

2506
01:54:04,350 --> 01:54:06,900
it's a good position to get good at.
Woo.

2507
01:54:06,970 --> 01:54:08,730
Good dexterity of that right leg.
Okay.

2508
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:11,780
Sneaks that right leg in and gets that 
butterfly under the armpit.

2509
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,960
But if you go back back up a little 
jamie,

2510
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:17,130
watch how he does that.
Such a wiki is.

2511
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:21,260
He has them right there with jamie.
Let's get rid of that tv this week.

2512
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:25,760
We have this classic piece.
Images are right here,

2513
01:54:25,761 --> 01:54:26,690
dude.
Yeah,

2514
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:31,840
against the ropes and that forever shit 
right here,

2515
01:54:32,441 --> 01:54:32,900
dude.
They'll get it.

2516
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:33,733
He's thinking.
This is where I saw a crowd rise right 

2517
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:37,040
here.
Tell jewish.

2518
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:38,480
No punk either.
Yeah.

2519
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:41,250
This is this test we can.
I'm trying to flip up and you know what?

2520
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:42,103
He didn't even try to take him down.
He just kept pulling guard on them 

2521
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:46,090
beCause they get this couch gum to the 
day.

2522
01:54:46,091 --> 01:54:46,730
Okay.
Kelly.

2523
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:49,190
Julie tried to kick him in the face from
there and then he went.

2524
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:52,970
How did it get us back here?
It's a compilation.

2525
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,510
Yeah.
Oh,

2526
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:55,340
okay.
That's interesting.

2527
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:56,473
Yeah.
Crones,

2528
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,510
jujitsu is just so next level and 
compare to these guys.

2529
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:00,550
So there's no,
you know,

2530
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,350
when you're fighting mma guys like these
guys,

2531
01:55:03,351 --> 01:55:06,740
they're just not going to have the same 
kind of technique that he has,

2532
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:08,470
you know,
and he's,

2533
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:10,160
he's gonna have to get there though.
I mean,

2534
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:10,994
you see,
look at the acute stand up and take 

2535
01:55:12,741 --> 01:55:14,210
down.
No problem.

2536
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:15,670
I'll fight you off my back.
You know,

2537
01:55:15,671 --> 01:55:17,360
the ufc right now,
it'd be a little tough for him,

2538
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:18,490
but fuck yeah,
it would be.

2539
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,333
He's obviously on the right,
but the cool thing about pulling guard 

2540
01:55:21,441 --> 01:55:24,320
and having a guard good enough to make 
it a good idea.

2541
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:27,890
If yOu could do it at any time to 
anybody trapped it again,

2542
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:31,960
that same way he catches that leg when 
the guy tries to Kick him and cower.

2543
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:34,430
Jerry's got wind that again and we say,
we cut that leg.

2544
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,350
Let's see a little Bit before that.
Before that right there.

2545
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:40,583
Who catches it,
wraps it up with his legs and then use 

2546
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:43,980
it to sweep them.
Beautiful.

2547
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,230
Was his dad in his corner?
Oh yeah,

2548
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,640
go ahead.
Jen was in the corner.

2549
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:50,340
This is classic as shit right here,
man.

2550
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,920
And I'm mad at the army green gloves 
rising.

2551
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:54,500
Yeah,
that's kinda cool.

2552
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:56,250
Yeah.
Um,

2553
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:57,084
I just think that.
I just hope they don't continue with 

2554
01:55:58,801 --> 01:56:00,670
that three man.
Three days.

2555
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:02,730
His right arm,
the right arm.

2556
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:05,280
What it does right here.
It's not doing anything to defend.

2557
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:07,080
Look,
it's not really doing anything like that

2558
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:08,490
in trouble.
It's not doing anything,

2559
01:56:08,491 --> 01:56:10,500
but it's like just hanging out his right
arm.

2560
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:14,060
He kind oF just look at that shot.
What are you?

2561
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:16,590
Look at that shot.
You got to put your hands,

2562
01:56:16,990 --> 01:56:20,480
dad fujita.
Yes.

2563
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:21,800
I mean not for gita.

2564
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,170
That's legit man.
This is a big statement for chrome.

2565
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,970
Yeah.
Crazy man.

2566
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,440
And what's really interesting is like if
he keeps going,

2567
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,613
you know,
a couple more fights and continues with 

2568
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:43,050
his standup training,
you could easily see him fighting in the

2569
01:56:43,051 --> 01:56:45,210
ufc in the next few years.
Easily.

2570
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:49,600
Yeah.
He mayBe he stays a rise and they signed

2571
01:56:49,601 --> 01:56:50,434
them to an exclusive.
And the gracies in asia have such a big 

2572
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:53,131
name.
Yeah,

2573
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:53,964
he's making bank.
He's probably making more money over 

2574
01:56:55,171 --> 01:56:58,020
there.
Then I'll go through the.

2575
01:56:58,050 --> 01:57:00,080
He'd have to go through the small fight.
Uh,

2576
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:03,270
the titan and have to go straight from 
this.

2577
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:03,770
Well,
no,

2578
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,140
no,
no.

2579
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,410
But before,
if he decided to go through the us route

2580
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:08,783
at the beginning,
he couldn't get into the ufc until he 

2581
01:57:10,051 --> 01:57:11,590
had like four or five five to thrive.
But yeah,

2582
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,470
I bet I bet they'd sign him.
No,

2583
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:15,130
not right away with no fights.

2584
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,900
No chrome?
No.

2585
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,810
They wouldn't sell the garcia.
Why would it do?

2586
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:22,500
But I think they would do that.
I'm saying chrome right now if.

2587
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:25,350
Can you.
What are you guys talking about?

2588
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:26,820
Beginning of his career before he 
started?

2589
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:27,460
No,
no,

2590
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:27,960
no,
no.

2591
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:31,410
I'm talking about he went this way.
It's a smart way tO go.

2592
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,820
he went,
he fought,

2593
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:35,160
aNd one fc.
I think it was maybe.

2594
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,940
Maybe iT's like we would all be better 
off.

2595
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,820
Everybody will be better off if rise and
continue to blow up.

2596
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,163
If they continue to blow up.
It'd be just like pride in the ufc back 

2597
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:46,674
in the day,
be great for everybody if they develop 

2598
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:50,810
some sort of fate or type character,
you know,

2599
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:54,090
if someone comes along that is like a 
legit consideration,

2600
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:54,924
like he fade or my opinion is the only 
consideration for not only best pound 

2601
01:57:58,411 --> 01:58:00,600
for pound but like best heavy weight 
ever.

2602
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:02,580
THat didn't fight in the ufc.
Oh yeah.

2603
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:04,920
He's the only one.
I can't think of another one.

2604
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:07,040
I think brides an bella tour,
if you,

2605
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:07,913
if you have those three,
if you have those three big dogs where 

2606
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:13,500
even if american fighters want to stay 
in american fight and not be in the ufc,

2607
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,393
you need bella to develop.
You've got to pay attention to one fc 

2608
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,100
two.
Yeah,

2609
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,410
I mean that's a whole.
That's has nothing to do with Japan.

2610
01:58:19,411 --> 01:58:21,340
Southeast asia as a whole.
It's a whole.

2611
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,850
Franklin runs ebis me.
He's got some rich franklin shot tree.

2612
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:30,970
No real big exeCutive job though.
Not.

2613
01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:34,950
What's the situation with cyborg at this
point?

2614
01:58:34,951 --> 01:58:38,020
To check out again,
no good waiting for.

2615
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,023
To see what the commission does,
what kind of suspension she's going at 

2616
01:58:41,111 --> 01:58:41,944
least a year,

2617
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,173
at least.
What she pissed hot for is also an anti 

2618
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:49,900
androgen.
It's dyo has a dht inhibitor.

2619
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:53,530
I used to rub that shit in my head to 
prevent hair loss.

2620
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:54,843
They might give it.
And it's also used by people that take 

2621
01:58:57,191 --> 01:59:01,150
steroids to diminish the effects of,
um,

2622
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:04,330
of like when females take steroids,
diminish the effect.

2623
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,970
it's also a,
it's a masking agent.

2624
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,140
So if you take steroids,
some people take that stuff as a mask.

2625
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:12,550
She's 31.
It's also a diarrhetic.

2626
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:17,420
So it's a very weird drug called 
spironolactone dean lactone,

2627
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:21,640
but it has many different uses if she,
if she gets three years,

2628
01:59:21,641 --> 01:59:25,180
that's what meant.
That sounded good argument.

2629
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:26,403
All the arguments that she gave her,
not good arguments that she took 

2630
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:33,460
something out of competition that she 
was told bY her doctor that will be okay

2631
01:59:33,461 --> 01:59:35,590
when it's clearly on the usada banned 
list.

2632
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:39,190
It's 100 percent band.
It's not like there's certain things you

2633
01:59:39,191 --> 01:59:40,720
could take out of,
out of context,

2634
01:59:40,721 --> 01:59:41,554
like the big ones pot,
like say if they catch you tomorrow and 

2635
01:59:44,501 --> 01:59:46,990
you're supposed to fight in six months 
and you're smoking weed like crazy,

2636
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,610
and they test you and they go,
look,

2637
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:49,420
we got to test you,
go look,

2638
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:51,100
I just want to let you know,
but smoke a lot of weed.

2639
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:51,970
They're like,
okay,

2640
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:52,803
as long as it's not steroids,
that's what jon jones didn't get in 

2641
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:59,470
troUble when he pissed hot for cocaine 
three weeks out of the fight with daniel

2642
01:59:59,471 --> 02:00:00,304
cormier because that's not in 
competition and it's not a performance 

2643
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:04,150
enhancing drug.
He's Just partying.

2644
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:04,984
Right?
So what this is though is a performance 

2645
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:09,460
enhancing drug,
not just a performance enhancing drug,

2646
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:14,461
but problematic in that it inhibits its 
performance enhancing in,

2647
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:17,290
that works as a diuretic and you're not 
allowed to use diuretics,

2648
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:20,380
but it's,
it also inhibits your,

2649
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,410
um,
the,

2650
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:23,680
their ability to detect steroids in you.

2651
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:24,543
She's in trouble.
She wAs in the truck you saw that's 

2652
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,150
going to eat her ass.
And if she gets three years,

2653
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,711
well,
here's the thing,

2654
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:32,030
how old is she?
She's in her mid thirties.

2655
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:32,933
Third day they started to get tested her
because she passed on three world title 

2656
02:00:37,151 --> 02:00:37,984
fights.
They had three world title fights lined 

2657
02:00:40,661 --> 02:00:41,494
up for her at 1:45,
which is the way class that she asked 

2658
02:00:43,481 --> 02:00:44,314
for that.
She said she couldn't make it in eight 

2659
02:00:45,941 --> 02:00:48,560
weeks and so then they gave her more 
weeks and they gave her.

2660
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,193
They gave her a third test and then like
sums up and whether or not they were 

2661
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:54,910
going to test her anyway.
Who knows?

2662
02:00:54,911 --> 02:00:57,400
But that's when they tested her and 
that's when she pissed hot.

2663
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,353
It makes sense.
And she did not reveal before that that 

2664
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:04,020
she was taking that and then she does 
the whole thing is a.

2665
02:01:04,650 --> 02:01:05,970
He's in trouble man.
There it is.

2666
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:09,990
Have you seen escaping all babies?
Skeptical baby now.

2667
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:17,310
So basically that it was so funny.
He was like bitch.

2668
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:24,010
Like that skeptical snake.
So skeptical with sideburns.

2669
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:29,100
Super scheduled.
Have you seen the skeptical house?

2670
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:30,660
No.
Motherfuckers so skeptical.

2671
02:01:30,661 --> 02:01:31,950
Skeptical,
skeptical,

2672
02:01:31,951 --> 02:01:33,900
cadillac.
So ridiculous.

2673
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,793
Cadillac house.
What the fuck is so is that a real 

2674
02:01:40,611 --> 02:01:41,520
house?
yes,

2675
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:45,360
those are windows,
but the window is that window.

2676
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:49,550
Do you think they did that on purpose 
held what's wrong with people?

2677
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:51,830
It almost seems like that was an 
accident.

2678
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:54,870
It's so funny,
but with sideboard,

2679
02:01:54,871 --> 02:01:55,730
she.
She gets three years.

2680
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:56,564
She's in trouble.
I find the answer to when ronda lost 

2681
02:01:58,241 --> 02:02:00,140
again and she's throwing shade at ronda,
I'm like,

2682
02:02:00,141 --> 02:02:01,270
bitch,
you.

2683
02:02:01,570 --> 02:02:05,840
You just got busted for steroids.
Steroids.

2684
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:08,720
She got busted for a dihydro 
testosterone.

2685
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:08,911
No,
no,

2686
02:02:08,911 --> 02:02:09,920
no.
It's not a precursor.

2687
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:12,800
It's a dihydrotestosterone inhibitor.

2688
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,260
That's what it is.
Inhibitor and to me,

2689
02:02:15,261 --> 02:02:16,910
my brain goes,
you're in trouble.

2690
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:19,400
You're in trouble.
She certainly could be in trouble.

2691
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:24,320
It's one thing if she got it,
she said was she's got a bunch of issues

2692
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:27,080
because she really did record body 
getting down to 1:40,

2693
02:02:27,081 --> 02:02:31,460
which happen,
which I'm sure that that seems fine when

2694
02:02:31,461 --> 02:02:34,190
you wreck your body,
like I think she's saying that she takes

2695
02:02:34,191 --> 02:02:35,024
him too much water down or bodies like 
trying to hold onto water and that they 

2696
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:40,910
gave her a drug to diminish the amount 
of water.

2697
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:44,420
I talked to a couple of doctors about 
this.

2698
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:49,421
I asked them questions and they all gave
me that snake face in there.

2699
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:52,670
You know her background too.
It's like,

2700
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:53,743
fuck man,
he don't fuck with anything that's 

2701
02:02:55,251 --> 02:02:56,084
illegal and you definitely don't fuck 
with anything that people use because 

2702
02:02:58,941 --> 02:03:00,380
they're women that take steroids.

2703
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:03,230
Even if it's just a coincidence that you
happen to be.

2704
02:03:03,231 --> 02:03:06,310
You should look at every fucking label.
Extremely careful.

2705
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,570
Is that the worst of all time?
Yeah,

2706
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,570
that's one of them.
What do you mean cut?

2707
02:03:11,571 --> 02:03:12,500
But here's the thing,
man.

2708
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:16,690
Sanchez,
diego sanchez made 1:45.

2709
02:03:16,691 --> 02:03:20,120
He fought and won 85 in ultimate fighter
one.

2710
02:03:20,121 --> 02:03:21,800
Kenny florian.
Here's the problem.

2711
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:26,890
She fucking dead lifts 305 pounds a 
couple of weeks after passing on fights.

2712
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:30,540
She passes on the fight and then puts up
instagrams of her dead,

2713
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,930
lifting massive weight.
You're in,

2714
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,773
you know,
it was whoever the fuck handles her 

2715
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:39,200
twitter account because I wrote that up 
because,

2716
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:40,580
uh,
me and brett akimoto,

2717
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:42,530
we're having a discussion about it on 
twitter.

2718
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:43,483
Very good dude.
We were having a little back and forth 

2719
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:46,870
on twitter about it.
And uh,

2720
02:03:46,871 --> 02:03:47,481
you know,
he said,

2721
02:03:47,481 --> 02:03:49,190
isn't it weird that she's not fighting 
for the title?

2722
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:51,500
And I'm like,
what's weird is that they pack that,

2723
02:03:51,501 --> 02:03:56,030
she passed on title fight and then post 
instagram photos of her dead lifting.

2724
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,013
And then she responded that it's just 
like what football players do when 

2725
02:03:59,151 --> 02:04:00,410
they're not in camp.
Excuse me.

2726
02:04:00,411 --> 02:04:01,460
The other day,
and I'm like,

2727
02:04:01,461 --> 02:04:04,480
what you saw the golden snitch was like,
what?

2728
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,920
What would you say?
She's not writing.

2729
02:04:06,921 --> 02:04:08,900
Now I'm looking at the,
the english is perfect.

2730
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:10,420
I'm like,
this is not sisters.

2731
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:11,263
Whoever works with her or her boyfriend 
or whoever the fuck handles the 

2732
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,840
instagram account.
I'm like,

2733
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,390
that's no excuse.
There's a lot of maintenance that you do

2734
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:20,030
that's not dead lifting.
Three hundred and five fucking pounds.

2735
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:20,983
You do that to put on mass.
That is why you deadlift you dead lift 

2736
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:28,400
to put on fucking mass.
She's got muto mass.

2737
02:04:28,401 --> 02:04:32,180
He's got plenty of mass.
She has no problem with mass.

2738
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:34,190
You know what I mean?
That's not what she needs.

2739
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:35,024
If she really wants to fight at 145 
pounds and she needs more than eight 

2740
02:04:36,831 --> 02:04:38,430
weeks to make the weight,
she would.

2741
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:42,420
She should be doing as long term cardio 
too though.

2742
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:43,051
Jo.
She goes,

2743
02:04:43,051 --> 02:04:45,000
I do that.
And then the morning I run every morning

2744
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:45,631
though.
Dude,

2745
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:49,930
come the fuck on those.
Those aren't as heavy as they learn.

2746
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:52,440
Develop that power.
Sun light.

2747
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:54,630
No,
that's 300 something pounds.

2748
02:04:54,631 --> 02:04:56,220
So that's 300.
Five pounds bro.

2749
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:59,640
That's what she's doing.
This is youtube.

2750
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:02,150
Why did she tag she?
Gabby.

2751
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:05,190
That's worse.
Gaby,

2752
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:08,250
to start curling that shit.
You have the same doctor?

2753
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:10,290
I dunno.
fuck.

2754
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:11,040
Say,
look.

2755
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,080
The whole thing is awful.
It's awful.

2756
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:13,800
It's awful.
I,

2757
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,830
whoever the fuck was in her corner that 
let her post that video.

2758
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,221
I'd be like,
hey,

2759
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:17,760
hey.
Hey,

2760
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,600
what are you doing with your phone?

2761
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:20,950
What are you doing with your phone?
You're going to put that online.

2762
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:22,920
Get the fuck out.
Give me just the golden snitches.

2763
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:26,580
Literally just waiting.
He's looking at going,

2764
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:29,910
a woman dead lifting 305 for reps were 
going there.

2765
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:31,870
Six am tomorrow morning.
Boom.

2766
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:34,043
Look,
it is possible that you could get that 

2767
02:05:35,161 --> 02:05:35,994
big and that jacked without anything,
but it takes a long fucking time and 

2768
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:42,210
that's what you're doing.
That's what you're doing all the time.

2769
02:05:42,211 --> 02:05:45,450
If you look at some of those Crossfit 
gals that some of those are on steroids,

2770
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,220
100 percent,
but some of them are not,

2771
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:48,203
and you can get big if you have the 
right genetics and you do that kind of 

2772
02:05:50,731 --> 02:05:51,564
lifting.
Lifting is for people that want to put 

2773
02:05:53,431 --> 02:05:55,740
on power.
She's got ridiculous power.

2774
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:59,700
Cyborg has some of the nastiest power 
you're ever going to see in women's mma.

2775
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:00,820
Probably the most.
Probably the most.

2776
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:02,010
The most.
It right up there with.

2777
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:03,033
Well she has the full range,
like she'll kick you and me you and 

2778
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:09,480
punch you and elbow you.
Whereas nunez nunez will kick you hard,

2779
02:06:09,481 --> 02:06:10,314
but it's her punches that are fucking 
ferocious and she doesn't hit hard and 

2780
02:06:12,241 --> 02:06:13,110
cyborg.
No way.

2781
02:06:13,150 --> 02:06:15,450
So subway hits you like Mike Tyson with 
braids.

2782
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:16,230
She hits.
Yeah,

2783
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:18,610
she hits girls,
you see,

2784
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:23,940
seem to shut off the.
She makes worldclass girls would be like

2785
02:06:24,181 --> 02:06:26,040
that grandma.
She's a beast.

2786
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,143
Muster.
Unfortunate that there's so much 

2787
02:06:28,591 --> 02:06:29,424
controversy,
like I would love if there was someone 

2788
02:06:30,781 --> 02:06:32,940
like cyborg with no shade attached to 
it,

2789
02:06:32,941 --> 02:06:33,774
no weirdness attached to it,
but now she's got these two strikes 

2790
02:06:36,061 --> 02:06:37,900
against her.
Will Amanda Nunez?

2791
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:39,510
She has no shade.
Yes.

2792
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:40,920
She knocks girls out.
She just.

2793
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:41,754
Merck,
misha tate can tell you probably the 

2794
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:47,040
number two most famous girl of all time 
in women's mma and it's just merck.

2795
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,380
The number one.
There's your star with no shade.

2796
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:50,700
Great person.
It's true.

2797
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:51,593
The other thing that's happening with 
the youth now that they're already 

2798
02:06:54,871 --> 02:06:55,704
coming up without that pride,
we would get a lot of guys from pride 

2799
02:06:58,771 --> 02:07:00,600
and the beginning of the truce was,
okay,

2800
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:03,550
these new guys,
cody's and these men,

2801
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:06,780
the nunezes tend to come up straight up.
Right?

2802
02:07:06,781 --> 02:07:07,320
Right,
right.

2803
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,960
They're going to come up the right way,
which iS even scarier.

2804
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:12,870
They're not going to flag.
They're not going to be no drama.

2805
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:14,400
Maybe.
I hope not,

2806
02:07:14,401 --> 02:07:18,660
but that's what I'm seeing is he shorter
careers for young generation,

2807
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:20,570
you know,
is uh,

2808
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:22,840
I think you'll remember you're seeing 
short careers anyways.

2809
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:24,330
Like to me this,
this,

2810
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,420
and I feel the same way as you guys do 
with.

2811
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:27,383
It's sad the way rhonda loss what's not 
that sad because she had such a great 

2812
02:07:30,451 --> 02:07:30,870
run.

2813
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:31,703
She was a pioneer.
She was on the mount rushmore of mma in 

2814
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,860
general.
She goes on mat restaurant.

2815
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,350
It's really not that sad.
Like god damn.

2816
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:42,720
What are iconic run man?
Sad is like a guy like more homeowner or

2817
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:44,830
a guy like if Mark Hunt word retire like
that.

2818
02:07:44,831 --> 02:07:47,800
Sad people don't have money and fame.
She set man.

2819
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:48,753
it's not that sad.
She did some great shit and great 

2820
02:07:50,951 --> 02:07:51,784
things.
You know what's interesting here is 

2821
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:54,820
going on,
it's like the ronda fans,

2822
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,600
they're not mma fans.
A lot of them,

2823
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:02,710
they're ronda fans and so like you see 
how they respond to stuff on twitter and

2824
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:05,440
you see like the reaction of the things 
that they're saying.

2825
02:08:05,441 --> 02:08:07,900
Like it's pretty emotional.
It's very emotional.

2826
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,330
It's also almost like they don't 
understand.

2827
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,250
They don't understand the sport.
You know,

2828
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,390
get back on the horse.
Like,

2829
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,691
whoa,
whoa,

2830
02:08:13,691 --> 02:08:13,991
whoa,
whoa,

2831
02:08:13,991 --> 02:08:14,980
whoa,
fuck the horse.

2832
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:16,540
No,
listen to your mom,

2833
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:18,280
your mom,
your mom saying stop.

2834
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:19,180
Her.
Mom's brilliant.

2835
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,133
Yeah,
and her mom's.

2836
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,940
Her mom's brutal.
She so brutal.

2837
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:23,110
She says,
she goes,

2838
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:23,944
go.
Let stupid people get punched in the 

2839
02:08:24,851 --> 02:08:25,421
face.
Sorry.

2840
02:08:25,421 --> 02:08:26,650
Stupid people.
Her mom,

2841
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:30,790
her mom's brilliant and she's a doctor 
and the good thing for rhonda to out all

2842
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:33,370
of this is she's going to find out who's
in her corner.

2843
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:34,480
There's been.
There's been so many.

2844
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:35,314
Yes.
Miss out is in holiday when you're on 

2845
02:08:36,851 --> 02:08:39,370
set,
you know that bullshit is your agents.

2846
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:40,353
These other people.
You're working with these other 

2847
02:08:41,141 --> 02:08:42,130
celebrities.
Toenail.

2848
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,023
Good.
Your will.

2849
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:45,610
Now when you lose that,
the phone stops ringing,

2850
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:48,360
the tech stop coming.
Everyone asks you to dinner.

2851
02:08:48,361 --> 02:08:49,194
That stuff,
you're going to find out who's in your 

2852
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:50,674
corner.
That's probably they might be good for 

2853
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:52,630
now.
Let me ask you,

2854
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:54,490
what did you do the last two years?

2855
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:58,240
Because I heard they cut her down and 
the other one disappeared.

2856
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:00,610
Who knows?
Who knows what kind of deal she has,

2857
02:09:00,611 --> 02:09:01,444
but things definitely dried up 
substantially after the holly knockout 

2858
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:05,320
because she's not the same person 
anymore.

2859
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:06,333
The thing about all those deals is when 
you're a winner in hollywood and they 

2860
02:09:09,851 --> 02:09:13,600
start throwing all these movies at you 
and you're some athletes coming over,

2861
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:16,750
it's all predicated on you being that 
person that they're selling.

2862
02:09:16,751 --> 02:09:17,860
Right?
What are they selling?

2863
02:09:17,861 --> 02:09:20,260
They're selling this undefeated women's 
ass kicker.

2864
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:21,790
The likes,
if you've never seen before,

2865
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:23,210
right?
Throwing people in their head,

2866
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,000
get them in an arm bars.
That's what they're selling.

2867
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,740
Well,
that's not you anymore.

2868
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:30,910
Now you Just got smashed by holly and 
then smashed again by amanda.

2869
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:35,660
They can't sell your acting abilities to
fit.

2870
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:38,700
She'd.
She'd do roadhouse.

2871
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:40,030
Did she redo?
Roadhouse?

2872
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,400
Killed him.
They killed him.

2873
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,500
I don't know about any of that stuff.
I just know to,

2874
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:47,890
to his point where it's.
It's almost a good thing for it.

2875
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:48,850
It reallY is,
man.

2876
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:51,400
It's not a sad story.
I don't find it as a sad story.

2877
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:52,630
I really don't.
Well,

2878
02:09:52,631 --> 02:09:54,240
it's definitely sad.
She was an angel.

2879
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,650
It's disappeared,
bro.

2880
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:59,480
Story came,
leaves all that different.

2881
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:01,360
Do we feel safer?
Tiger woods,

2882
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:03,100
like I said,
when that foundation rocks,

2883
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:05,170
what do you think is different with 
tiger's swing?

2884
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:06,920
No,
hold the different tiger woods.

2885
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:09,540
He can get the fuck beat out of them and
48 seconds.

2886
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:10,433
I know and that's fighting,
but what I'm saying is the mentality 

2887
02:10:12,701 --> 02:10:15,830
changes.
When tiger was unstoppable and he.

2888
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:17,290
Something happened.
He's had that.

2889
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:18,183
He had the scandal,
but then he also had some significant 

2890
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:21,790
back injuries.
Correct.

2891
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,420
Or what?
Okay.

2892
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:24,250
For better example to your fight 
example,

2893
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:25,720
like thaisa.
Yeah.

2894
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:27,550
That's also wear and tear too,
man.

2895
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:29,020
You know,
you can say that.

2896
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:29,863
I got to tell you why I can say that.
One of the reasons why is because the 

2897
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:34,220
driver

2898
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,053
that I had this weekend in vegas that 
took me to the airport was mike tyson's 

2899
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:41,660
driver for 17 years and I had a long 
conversation.

2900
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:42,703
Cool dude.
I wish I could remember his fucking 

2901
02:10:43,941 --> 02:10:44,774
name,
so I only met him for the brief brief 

2902
02:10:46,101 --> 02:10:46,934
ride to the airport,
but he was telling me how fucked up 

2903
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:50,840
tyson was after the lennox lewis fight.
He's like,

2904
02:10:50,841 --> 02:10:51,674
dude,
lennox lewis hit mike and mike was 

2905
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:56,870
fucked up for a long time for that.
And You don't think that you watch a guy

2906
02:10:56,871 --> 02:10:59,210
get knocked out.
You watch guy get stopped and you know,

2907
02:10:59,211 --> 02:11:01,160
mike was talking after the fight and he 
was like,

2908
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:01,791
hey,
you know,

2909
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:02,011
I'm,
I'm,

2910
02:11:02,011 --> 02:11:04,550
I'm done.
It's over and eat and they step back,

2911
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:10,420
but when he goes home and he's alone and
the cameras are off and he's got vertigo

2912
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:13,033
and he's got an equilibrium problems and
his ears won't stop ringing in and his 

2913
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:17,540
head won't stop throbbing.

2914
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:19,790
You don't see that he's doing 
interviews.

2915
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:20,624
His head's throb and his ears are 
ringing and it was no internet back 

2916
02:11:22,761 --> 02:11:23,421
then.
It's harder.

2917
02:11:23,421 --> 02:11:26,100
It's harder to hide nowadays.
You know a way.

2918
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,253
Got your daily thing that you do and 
everybody that your followers and they 

2919
02:11:29,341 --> 02:11:31,880
all know your daily thing and you guys 
can build the daily things.

2920
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:34,940
All of a sudden he disappeared.
Everybody knows he disappeared.

2921
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:38,370
No one really knew you lost the fight.
You never really see him again.

2922
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:41,240
When you do this,
also like when you're suffering alone,

2923
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:42,103
the only way people find out is if you 
talk about it like we don't know what 

2924
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,780
happens to a lot of these guys after 
they get beat the fuck up.

2925
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:49,340
You know?
Here's one,

2926
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,473
terry adam,
when terry adam got knocked out by the 

2927
02:11:53,421 --> 02:11:57,080
wheel kits and barboza the wheel kick 
from another dimension.

2928
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:01,540
It was the first wheel kick,
kale in the ufc and the worst we'll kick

2929
02:12:01,541 --> 02:12:01,820
kale.

2930
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:02,653
It was fucking horrible and he has never
been the same again because he's still 

2931
02:12:06,321 --> 02:12:07,160
fight.
yes,

2932
02:12:07,161 --> 02:12:07,994
he's fought a few times,
but before that terry adam was a bad 

2933
02:12:11,061 --> 02:12:11,894
motherfucker.
He waS really good and terry adam was 

2934
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:14,834
one of those kids that was coming up 
like a lot of other guys in the 

2935
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:17,241
division,
you know,

2936
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:19,250
he's looking like he might be a 
contender someday.

2937
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:21,440
He's slick.
He's got a good,

2938
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:24,170
you know,
he's got a good boxing kickboxing style.

2939
02:12:24,171 --> 02:12:26,390
He's got good submissions.
He works hard.

2940
02:12:26,391 --> 02:12:28,250
He's a smart fighter.
He's a good guy.

2941
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,000
You meet him,
he's a gentleman.

2942
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:31,610
You're like,
this kid might have real potential.

2943
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:32,663
She just got you get hit with those 
goddamn kick and it's life changing and 

2944
02:12:37,581 --> 02:12:39,440
that's,
that's why to dana's point,

2945
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:41,630
you make as much as you can when you're 
there,

2946
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:44,420
you got a domain.
That's why your boy tony first then hold

2947
02:12:44,421 --> 02:12:45,560
out and be like,
I need more money.

2948
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:48,230
He could get.
We'll kick the chance of that happening.

2949
02:12:48,231 --> 02:12:49,041
Not good.
Hey,

2950
02:12:49,041 --> 02:12:50,180
he could get.
We'll kick.

2951
02:12:50,181 --> 02:12:52,820
So that's why it goes like,
do I need as much money as possible?

2952
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:54,260
Well against.
He's not going to get.

2953
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:58,340
We'll kick against a off.
But he never changed.

2954
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,710
He fights.
He beat them.

2955
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:02,540
You know that barboza was amazing.
I was.

2956
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:04,550
Oh,
tourney some fun.

2957
02:13:04,730 --> 02:13:06,920
Tony ferguson is one of my favorite guys
to watch for sure.

2958
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,110
He's so fun.
He's a.

2959
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,630
He's like You said he's a straight up 
and figure it out.

2960
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:12,973
What's going on with that?
Because I saw he posted instagram that 

2961
02:13:14,391 --> 02:13:18,280
he's in big bear.
He's in big bear with his family.

2962
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:19,740
Enjoying the snow.
Oh,

2963
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:20,950
just chilling.
He's training.

2964
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,970
I thought he was going up there to 
train.

2965
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:23,873
No,
so I thought it was on a hopeful note 

2966
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:28,850
that I know of.
Not that I know of,

2967
02:13:28,910 --> 02:13:31,230
but you know what they're trying to do,
what they're trying do.

2968
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:32,073
Although,
and norma met off for a fucking interim 

2969
02:13:34,231 --> 02:13:35,640
1:55
and I'm like,

2970
02:13:35,641 --> 02:13:38,340
how do you have a 1:55
interim when connor?

2971
02:13:38,341 --> 02:13:40,260
Just one the 1:55
a week ago.

2972
02:13:40,261 --> 02:13:42,600
What about max though?
What about max holloway?

2973
02:13:42,610 --> 02:13:43,880
He.
Well,

2974
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:48,890
he's got the interim 1:45
such shit show and holloway is one inter

2975
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,900
cars all over.
Nigga murda of his sick.

2976
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:52,860
Sick.
Yeah.

2977
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:54,180
It's a great fight.
ALdo versus.

2978
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:55,273
Well,
especially when you see what happened 

2979
02:13:57,511 --> 02:14:00,180
with Michael Johnson.
Michael johnson stunned habib,

2980
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,610
you know he stung him.
He hit him and stung him.

2981
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:03,683
And Michael Johnson with all due respect
is nowhere near the striker that joseph 

2982
02:14:06,621 --> 02:14:07,510
aldo is.
Joel dot.

2983
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:08,383
Joseph was on a totally.
Josie is as powerful as johnson 

2984
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,630
explosive question because he's not as 
big.

2985
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:13,643
He's been fighting at 1:45
his whole career and he's going to be 

2986
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:16,764
fighting a fucking go rilla they know 
russian go really is a difference 

2987
02:14:21,451 --> 02:14:25,290
between johnson's bottom game and all 
those bottom 100 percent.

2988
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:26,413
One hundred percent will be way better.
All those kicks there a giant factor 

2989
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,640
because if aldo who has amazing takedown
defense,

2990
02:14:35,641 --> 02:14:39,150
fucking amazing,
some of the best takedown defense.

2991
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:43,140
So he's also got fucking nasty lick 
kicks.

2992
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:46,500
So if number got at off moves at him.
what is this?

2993
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:47,370
Who is this?
Is this.

2994
02:14:47,371 --> 02:14:48,204
Will you show me here how beam number 
given off slams ufc for lying to the 

2995
02:14:50,521 --> 02:14:51,354
fans about josie?
Aldo demands relevant fight against 

2996
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:55,320
trump.
Why is he saying this line to the fans?

2997
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:56,640
Let's see.
Let's see what he says here.

2998
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:58,730
Oh no,
it'll come back on this.

2999
02:14:58,731 --> 02:15:00,840
This goddamn screen dude.
Uh,

3000
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:03,870
it's clear to everyone that you hiding 
connor from me.

3001
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:08,040
But stop lying to your fans.
Like I don't want fight with aldo.

3002
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:09,960
I'm ready to fight with anyone in my 
division.

3003
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,380
Give me relevant fight.
So you won't.

3004
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:14,460
First of all,
take your phone away from your sister.

3005
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,860
Somebody.
Somebody's got this phone then making.

3006
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:17,783
No,
he's definitely doing it broke even 

3007
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:21,150
though she's so ralph.
But I love it.

3008
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:22,800
It makes it more gangster.
Okay.

3009
02:15:22,801 --> 02:15:24,270
You've never matched up.
What is it?

3010
02:15:24,271 --> 02:15:25,830
I can't see tHat jamie.
This thing is in front of it.

3011
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:26,664
oh,
you never matched up to guys with nine 

3012
02:15:28,381 --> 02:15:31,260
and eight winds streak in ufc.
Never in ufc history.

3013
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,240
That doesn't mean anything.
See,

3014
02:15:33,241 --> 02:15:37,320
here's the problem is too expensive.
I see what he's saying,

3015
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:41,430
but let me explain why it's wrong.
They need big,

3016
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,440
relevant fights to sell pay per views.
Right?

3017
02:15:43,441 --> 02:15:45,060
And that's all they care about.
Here's the deal.

3018
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:50,180
The ufc was purchased for 
$4,000,000,000.

3019
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:53,130
Bill,
imagine if you bought a.

3020
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:55,920
I mean you have,
you own a place in your house.

3021
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,860
You know what a mortgages,
mortgages are pretty cunty.

3022
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,840
You'll look at them every month and go,
jesus.

3023
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:04,890
Now if you have a mortgage for a nice 
house and he spent a million bucks,

3024
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:07,470
that's a fucking nut you've got to make 
every month,

3025
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:07,680
man.

3026
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,030
You got to think about it.
you've got to go,

3027
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:10,800
okay,
we've got the mortgage is covered.

3028
02:16:10,801 --> 02:16:11,634
All right?
And then you move on with all the other 

3029
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:12,761
bills,
right?

3030
02:16:12,761 --> 02:16:16,260
Tell me about,
it's a $4,000,000,000

3031
02:16:16,261 --> 02:16:20,080
house.
What kind of fucking mortgage and how?

3032
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:23,040
How do we pay the bills by doing huge 
fights?

3033
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:23,903
Huge.
So we gotta figure some shit in term 

3034
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:26,250
interim.
Interim.

3035
02:16:26,250 --> 02:16:28,790
Everybody in your belt,
the reality as jon jones is,

3036
02:16:29,830 --> 02:16:31,870
and jon jones isn't even the champ right
now,

3037
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:34,360
so when he comes back,
he's not even fighting for a world title

3038
02:16:34,361 --> 02:16:35,194
unless he fights for the world title.
So you gotta have dc has got to be 

3039
02:16:38,891 --> 02:16:39,724
healthy or you got to have john fight 
for an interim because they're just 

3040
02:16:42,491 --> 02:16:43,324
throwing interims out like they're 
fucking fliers that they're put on your 

3041
02:16:45,821 --> 02:16:48,300
car when dudes are trying to like sell 
carwash.

3042
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:50,560
Yeah,
and my brother,

3043
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:53,590
they'll start getting these fucking cars
selling.

3044
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:54,833
They've got to be another season.
The fear factor is going to be added on 

3045
02:16:56,550 --> 02:16:57,383
please.
No,

3046
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:58,493
no,
there's not going to see samsung for 

3047
02:16:59,470 --> 02:17:03,370
some brad pitch to sell paper or some 
shit or something.

3048
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:07,220
I don't know what they're gonna do you 
know who knows if I'll be for it,

3049
02:17:07,230 --> 02:17:10,510
but when you look at,
when you look at like the,

3050
02:17:10,550 --> 02:17:11,390
the,
the,

3051
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,393
the title picture,
who that card that they have in 

3052
02:17:15,311 --> 02:17:16,870
brooklyn.
I mean That is,

3053
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:19,130
that's a pay per view card and it looks 
like an fs.

3054
02:17:19,131 --> 02:17:21,220
One car right now.
I'm sure they're going to juice it up.

3055
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:24,490
They'll get more,
but it's not a die hard fan.

3056
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:26,770
Pay 60 bucks for that shit.
It's hard.

3057
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,630
It's hard to make those cards.
So we.

3058
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:31,420
I think we kind of nailed it when we 
were talking about it earlier,

3059
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:33,760
like what guys sell paper reviews.

3060
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,270
I think woodley's a bigger star now that
he'd be wonder boy,

3061
02:17:37,271 --> 02:17:40,150
but he still wants that.
A big review too in like dana and I were

3062
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:42,070
having this conversation.
It's like you can't have nick diaz.

3063
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:42,904
He goes,
nick diaz doesn't want a fight since 

3064
02:17:43,481 --> 02:17:44,314
2011.
He can't have him step in and just go 

3065
02:17:46,421 --> 02:17:48,940
right up to the title and that's what I 
said.

3066
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:50,140
I said,
but I want to see it.

3067
02:17:50,310 --> 02:17:51,280
He goes,
I want to see it too,

3068
02:17:51,281 --> 02:17:52,114
but you Can't sell it will you will.
No one's going to take the sports 

3069
02:17:54,221 --> 02:17:55,054
series.
So if you give a guy who hasn't won 

3070
02:17:55,841 --> 02:17:58,420
since 2011 or 12,
give him a title shot.

3071
02:17:58,421 --> 02:17:59,920
People fans were like,
come on bro.

3072
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:05,140
But I think they missed the boat if they
wanted to make a fucking big money.

3073
02:18:05,170 --> 02:18:08,680
It's nick diaz versus conor mcgregor.
Big brother.

3074
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:11,350
He's trying to fight at one 70 some on.

3075
02:18:11,370 --> 02:18:12,203
No,
his.

3076
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:15,610
His brother was too big for him.
You think he's too big?

3077
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:16,503
way too big.
I think that talk is nonsense because 

3078
02:18:18,551 --> 02:18:20,260
connor's the 1:55
pound champ.

3079
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:22,870
Nate fought at 1:55
most of his career.

3080
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:25,870
He fought at one 70 a couple of times 
and he's undersized.

3081
02:18:25,871 --> 02:18:27,990
Don young.
Kim beat Him at one 70.

3082
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,890
He's a.
He's a legit one.

3083
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:33,610
Seventy year though.
He's 70 maybe,

3084
02:18:33,611 --> 02:18:35,470
but he fights 1:55.
Easy look.

3085
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:36,304
Great against Michael Mcdonald at 55.
Tyron woodley if his fucking life 

3086
02:18:40,631 --> 02:18:41,970
depends on it.
Tyron woodley is not gonna.

3087
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:46,150
Make it $55.
The champ can't make 1:55

3088
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:47,560
at one 70.
Nate,

3089
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:49,890
ken.
So nate is not a real one.

3090
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:51,340
70.
Now here's to your point,

3091
02:18:51,341 --> 02:18:52,174
in dana's point,
he doesn't want to fight since 2011 and 

3092
02:18:53,651 --> 02:18:58,550
ended up connor ger your cash cow fight.
THis monster isn't one forever.

3093
02:18:58,551 --> 02:19:00,900
It's a great story.
It really is.

3094
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:04,780
Love big brother's steps in on.
I would watch it,

3095
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:06,550
I'd watch them in,
but to your.

3096
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:08,770
To your point,
they have to figure something out to get

3097
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:11,200
these stars it because you can't do it 
overnight.

3098
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,031
To me,
it doesn't matter.

3099
02:19:12,031 --> 02:19:15,400
You put nick diaz for what he's done out
of respect who's going to complain,

3100
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:20,140
but apparently they offered nick diaz,
robbie lawler and nick passed on it.

3101
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,660
That's the word.
That's the word behind the scenes.

3102
02:19:22,690 --> 02:19:23,500
Interesting.
Maybe,

3103
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,300
maybe I'm not supposed to say that,
but uh,

3104
02:19:25,301 --> 02:19:27,800
I wanted to see that fight.
I would love to see that rematch.

3105
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:29,840
But I think nick wants a fucking title 
fight,

3106
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:31,220
you know?
I think nick is like,

3107
02:19:31,221 --> 02:19:31,971
look,
I want a big,

3108
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:34,700
big name or a title five.
I literally make these demands.

3109
02:19:35,490 --> 02:19:38,120
Make nick made some money.
He's not ridiculous.

3110
02:19:38,121 --> 02:19:39,150
He doesn't spend it all.
Well,

3111
02:19:39,151 --> 02:19:39,780
how about nate?

3112
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:40,613
I'm not,
I'm not answEring the call and this is 

3113
02:19:41,601 --> 02:19:42,930
20 million.
Yeah.

3114
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:43,813
We talked about.
We talked about that reCently in the 

3115
02:19:45,591 --> 02:19:46,281
podcast.
I was like,

3116
02:19:46,281 --> 02:19:47,960
well,
let's break this down because like,

3117
02:19:47,961 --> 02:19:50,210
let's say they do a million pay per view
buys,

3118
02:19:50,211 --> 02:19:51,620
which is like top end,
right?

3119
02:19:51,621 --> 02:19:54,170
There's only a few people that have ever
sold a millions like brock.

3120
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:58,280
Rhonda conner set a million is top of 
the food chain,

3121
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:01,130
so a million pay per view buys at 60 
bucks.

3122
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:04,460
That's you're taking one third right off
the bat.

3123
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:05,323
For nate,
it's really hard to jUstiFy giving 

3124
02:20:06,831 --> 02:20:09,010
someone $20,000,000
to do that.

3125
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:11,540
It's got to be real hard and then 
obviously our Could demand.

3126
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:15,020
That is like one of the only guys that 
can get that kind of money.

3127
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:16,880
He's the only one.
What are you guys?

3128
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:18,950
You think eventually guys will just 
start doing?

3129
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:19,820
I think it's so big.

3130
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:20,653
Like connor,
he just does his own show and he gets 

3131
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:23,294
his own people.
No use lawyers are too good to let you 

3132
02:20:24,681 --> 02:20:27,320
get out of your contract.
They realize that if,

3133
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:31,760
if nate had a legit fight with someone 
other than connor,

3134
02:20:31,761 --> 02:20:32,594
that was exciting.
The problem is there's no one else in 

3135
02:20:34,401 --> 02:20:36,950
the division that's got that kind of 
marquee value.

3136
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:38,403
YeaH.
There's nO one in the division that has 

3137
02:20:39,261 --> 02:20:41,570
the kind of marquee value that if you 
had a look,

3138
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:44,740
I think nate is a fucking huge star,
but in less than.

3139
02:20:44,750 --> 02:20:46,010
Especially now.
I mean,

3140
02:20:46,011 --> 02:20:48,890
after he beat conor,
he's one of the biggest stars outside of

3141
02:20:48,891 --> 02:20:51,590
that upper echelon,
paperview low level,

3142
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:54,350
but he's not a world title holder right 
now.

3143
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:58,040
So if you wanted to really have a big 
fight for nate,

3144
02:20:58,330 --> 02:21:02,060
I would have him fight a whole tab.
Would work.

3145
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:02,870
That would work.

3146
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:06,010
That would work.
That would be ever come back.

3147
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:09,830
Gsp apparently they couldn't work out 
the deal with the reebok deal.

3148
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:13,340
Like he's got to deal with uNder armor.
He's got a Big deal with under armour.

3149
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:15,780
It makes a lot of money through under 
and shit.

3150
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:16,813
Yeah.
And so he couldn't work out a deal with 

3151
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:21,410
that was worth it to him.
You know,

3152
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:23,960
there was an offer on the table.
He didn't like it.

3153
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:26,930
They're still talking.
He stIll says he wants to fight,

3154
02:21:26,931 --> 02:21:27,764
but if the ufc,
you know that now that they've lost 

3155
02:21:30,651 --> 02:21:32,930
rhonda,
most likely lost rhonda.

3156
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:34,160
We don't know what happened.
I mean,

3157
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:35,990
you,
she's not the same anymore.

3158
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:38,750
It's definitely,
definitely a tough sell.

3159
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:42,800
But I mean,
who fucking knows a yeaR and a half down

3160
02:21:42,801 --> 02:21:44,870
the line,
she's still only 29.

3161
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:48,950
I think she's still get paper views if 
she comes back on a year for sure,

3162
02:21:48,951 --> 02:21:50,240
but it's not the same.

3163
02:21:50,330 --> 02:21:53,090
It's not the same baby.
You sit and money flows like water.

3164
02:21:53,730 --> 02:21:55,670
People will not want to watch it even 
more,

3165
02:21:55,671 --> 02:21:56,504
but she's not fighting anytime sooN so 
he can't paint on her as stable going 

3166
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:01,670
up.
So you got to move on from it.

3167
02:22:01,671 --> 02:22:02,504
She comes.
Great.

3168
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:04,010
Let's keep going.
You know what I'm saying?

3169
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:05,660
You know,
it's interesting,

3170
02:22:05,661 --> 02:22:07,310
man.
It's a crazy sport.

3171
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:08,144
It goes up,
it goes down and moves all over the 

3172
02:22:09,351 --> 02:22:11,000
place.
Every sports like this though.

3173
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:13,520
Here's the other thing.
When's brock Lesnar back?

3174
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:15,560
I mean,
if brock lesnar suspended,

3175
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:17,780
first of never,
that's not true.

3176
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:18,450
Uh,
when,

3177
02:22:18,450 --> 02:22:19,820
when,
when they damn it son.

3178
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:20,570
Listen,
he,

3179
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:24,200
he only got suspended for,
for clomifene clomifene.

3180
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:25,480
Even though it is a,
it,

3181
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:26,180
it enhances

3182
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,790
steroids,
uh,

3183
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:28,753
your recovery from steroids because it 
reduces estrogen psychotherapy for 

3184
02:22:32,251 --> 02:22:33,110
steroids.
It's,

3185
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:33,983
it's definitely not good.
But it also exists in a bunch of 

3186
02:22:36,331 --> 02:22:37,950
different supplements,
like over the counter stuff.

3187
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:39,870
Hey man,
are you arguing he wasn't taking?

3188
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:40,441
No,
no,

3189
02:22:40,441 --> 02:22:40,891
I'm not.
No,

3190
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:41,724
I'm not.
What I'm saying is how much time do you 

3191
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:43,404
think they're going to give him off?
Like how much time are they going to 

3192
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:48,540
have times when we let him not do these 
tests and beat up a guy,

3193
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:48,871
but.
No,

3194
02:22:48,871 --> 02:22:50,820
no,
he will have to do the usada test again.

3195
02:22:50,821 --> 02:22:51,654
He didn't get the last time he did it.
They had a couple of exemptions where 

3196
02:22:53,761 --> 02:22:54,594
they can get in on the four month thing 
that they Built in in case they wanted 

3197
02:22:57,301 --> 02:22:58,980
to make a big fight where they get 
signed somebody.

3198
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:04,130
So that one obviously blows up in their 
face and he's gonna get suspended.

3199
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:05,483
But how long for how long?
I thought they gave him a year and 

3200
02:23:07,321 --> 02:23:09,410
$225,000.
Is that what it is?

3201
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:10,290
Pretty sure.
Okay.

3202
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:12,570
So that's from what?
July?

3203
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,291
Yeah,
it's all.

3204
02:23:13,291 --> 02:23:16,800
It's all retroactive.
So that ain't that long from now.

3205
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:18,690
What's where we were in january,
february,

3206
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:19,380
march,
april,

3207
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:20,213
may,
june six months than the heaVyweight 

3208
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:25,170
division needs him.
Jon jones,

3209
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:30,171
first heavyweight fight.
Brock lesnar ba ba ba ba bum bum bum bum

3210
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:31,740
bum,
bum bum.

3211
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:32,940
Yeah.
Imagine that fight.

3212
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:35,880
The only problem is if you think so.
Yes.

3213
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:39,390
Mercury in the grappling.
I think you're just completely died.

3214
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:42,630
Fucking steel.
Brick would fucking ratchet you.

3215
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:43,583
Pissed.
Pissed that mumbles and he'll fuck left 

3216
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:51,330
because they'll say it.
You better do the fucking steroids feel.

3217
02:23:51,331 --> 02:23:54,040
Pick this crazy motherfucker.
Shit.

3218
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,430
I love him.
I love Him to immigrant mentality.

3219
02:23:56,460 --> 02:24:00,090
Bringing them on board in America.
Give him more fucking steroids.

3220
02:24:00,091 --> 02:24:00,510
what's that?

3221
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:02,220
You want another one in America?
Whatever the fuck.

3222
02:24:02,221 --> 02:24:05,640
He was definitely born in cleveland,
Ohio.

3223
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:10,050
That fucking crazy blood in them and he 
don't give a fuck croatian listening.

3224
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:14,000
he proved it with fucking overran.
They don't give a fuck.

3225
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:16,140
Put him in there with.
Go ahead.

3226
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:21,160
I gave you the product at all to the 
guilt in brooklyn who just ragdoll pull,

3227
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,503
pull poor fucking out of mark has never 
been the kind of grappling the steepest 

3228
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:30,540
just way better.
oh no.

3229
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:32,070
I think steve baY beats.
You know what?

3230
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:35,190
If he punches in the face it's going to 
get more steam out of his fucking.

3231
02:24:35,191 --> 02:24:36,024
He is and he Won't let his then coming 
back thinking that because he's not 

3232
02:24:40,981 --> 02:24:43,130
going to come back and fight for a world
title right away.

3233
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:44,253
You don't think so?
I think it's the biggest embarrassment 

3234
02:24:47,241 --> 02:24:48,720
to the lord.
That would be a crazy,

3235
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,670
the biggest fucking embarrassment of the
year.

3236
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,950
That why would that be embarrassment,
but it was embarrassing.

3237
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:54,540
It's just embarrassing and we've got 
smart.

3238
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:58,470
They knew he was on the juice.
He went in there loaded to the gills.

3239
02:24:58,650 --> 02:24:59,483
It was just an ambassador.
It was an embarrassing thing for 

3240
02:25:02,281 --> 02:25:03,114
everybody,
and mark hunted every fucking right to 

3241
02:25:04,711 --> 02:25:07,110
be mad.
They put them in there with a guy that's

3242
02:25:07,111 --> 02:25:11,030
coming off rocket fuel.
That dude don't just only deep ball lift

3243
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:11,873
the sides of his head.
He's taking shit that makes you fucking 

3244
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:19,250
had grown fucking pit bulls.
I hope they put them against my yo.

3245
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:21,310
Check.
I will fly the fucking wreck.

3246
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:23,180
Government's climate climate mouth.

3247
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:26,890
I found the snot in my nose that was 
bigger than this gum.

3248
02:25:26,891 --> 02:25:28,420
The.
I take the gum out there either.

3249
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:32,410
Anyway,
it was so long.

3250
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:33,244
It was like a code book.
I got a flashback from the hell that 

3251
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:38,590
motherfucker anyway,
because I love him.

3252
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:42,120
I love him.
From time to time I have a little button

3253
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:48,670
and it just comes out and it's got like 
a little clam was on board with you with

3254
02:25:49,001 --> 02:25:53,370
all this steve notes from time to time.
Oh,

3255
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:55,360
when you eat,
when you quote for 30 years,

3256
02:25:55,361 --> 02:25:56,700
it's a habit.
You wake up in the morning,

3257
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:59,230
pick one out.
It's like a candy cane.

3258
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:03,100
You inhale that motherfucker.
It's like going to the dentist for free.

3259
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:08,760
I will throw up on this fucking table.
Do you ever do that?

3260
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:11,920
To be honest With ourselves.
We're all friends here.

3261
02:26:11,921 --> 02:26:14,200
that was the most embarrassing fucking 
thing I ever seen.

3262
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:16,720
I agree.
They knew he was on it and they put that

3263
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:18,210
fucking animal in there.
Okay,

3264
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:20,350
and you know what man?
Go ahead.

3265
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:23,510
Keep doing those steroids.
Put them in there against pop whatever.

3266
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:29,500
Cleveland motherfucker just kill him.
He'll fucking kill him in general.

3267
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:30,363
Stupid.
I think they would ever be able to have 

3268
02:26:32,891 --> 02:26:35,110
him come off a suspension and fight for 
the title.

3269
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:39,220
That's not how it goes.
$4,000,000,000

3270
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,263
though.
He The scab off of iranians heaD right 

3271
02:26:41,411 --> 02:26:42,244
now.

3272
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,470
Right now.
They're fucking shit.

3273
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:47,650
That gun we lost.
Come out of your mouth.

3274
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:50,700
Dry patient.
Give me a tissue.

3275
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:54,630
Was rhonda and the only other thing we 
got his fucking condom.

3276
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:56,800
He's having a baby.
He don't want to fucking come back.

3277
02:26:56,801 --> 02:26:59,350
Now you know what he's talking about.
He might come back.

3278
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:01,280
Right?
But they don't want to give them a.

3279
02:27:01,290 --> 02:27:02,123
We supposed to fight.
Who is he supposed to be supposed to 

3280
02:27:03,401 --> 02:27:07,440
fight that fucking collar.
Beat and and stories.

3281
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:11,350
One of them.
Let's do it.

3282
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:12,960
Let's set it up.
No,

3283
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:14,800
that's not.
I'm with joey.

3284
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:16,750
Fuck that.
This shit.

3285
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:19,750
You don't need to find out though.
He don't need to fight nobody.

3286
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:20,830
He's number one.
Right?

3287
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:22,420
Or if it was your boy,
number one.

3288
02:27:22,730 --> 02:27:24,310
Tony khabib's number one.
Okay,

3289
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,203
then that's the fight enough.
And tony was number one and then khabib 

3290
02:27:29,501 --> 02:27:32,350
can became number one.
Why did it could be a leap frog.

3291
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:33,410
Tony.
I don't know.

3292
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:37,620
Who knows the rank because he talked to 
fought a couple times.

3293
02:27:37,621 --> 02:27:40,840
I don't know what his brother khabib's 
number one.

3294
02:27:40,841 --> 02:27:41,980
Well,
that's the thing he did.

3295
02:27:41,981 --> 02:27:43,090
Listen,
he's fighting now.

3296
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:45,820
He's available today.
He's available today.

3297
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:47,560
He's available for brooklyn.
Okay.

3298
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:49,810
He said it when he fought against 
Michael Johnson.

3299
02:27:49,811 --> 02:27:52,330
He's available for fucking.
Okay.

3300
02:27:52,331 --> 02:27:55,930
He's available for brooklyn and let's 
get eddie against raphael.

3301
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:56,943
That's a good fight.
Let's get that back in that people like 

3302
02:27:58,751 --> 02:27:59,700
watching him.
Very.

3303
02:28:00,010 --> 02:28:00,843
Let's get it done.

3304
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:04,630
Let's get.
We got some fucking people here.

3305
02:28:04,631 --> 02:28:05,870
Okay.
A lot of good guys.

3306
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:09,323
Let's get here.
He south paper views bounce around 

3307
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:13,980
300,000,
but he's.

3308
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,880
He's robbie lawler.
That got as good.

3309
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:19,823
Fuck it.
They got joey needs to be the 

3310
02:28:21,231 --> 02:28:22,640
matchmaker.
Fucking got it.

3311
02:28:22,641 --> 02:28:24,980
Okay.
Yeah man,

3312
02:28:24,981 --> 02:28:28,840
it's an interesting situation and find 
out a whole shitload.

3313
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:31,580
Want to give us the fights we want to 
see.

3314
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:35,670
No problem.
Don't they want to be.

3315
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:39,780
That's the beep and the story.
There's no outdoor,

3316
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,360
no pony.
Ferguson,

3317
02:28:41,530 --> 02:28:43,910
and there's no babies.
There's no nothing but he has a.

3318
02:28:44,710 --> 02:28:48,310
He's got a baby.
It's not a big draw.

3319
02:28:48,550 --> 02:28:52,170
Just fuck.
It sounded like throw 20 million on you.

3320
02:28:52,171 --> 02:28:53,630
The baby's weight.
Six weeks,

3321
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:56,050
but canada's already got 20 million.
That's the difference.

3322
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:58,830
He wants to take time that he can.
The breadth of his.

3323
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:02,990
His life is more important than what the
ufc was running the show.

3324
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:06,740
I agree with you on May 5th,
may labor memorial day weekend.

3325
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:12,070
It's called habib habib ferguson before 
ferguson ferguson.

3326
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:14,420
Sharon,
let's have some fun.

3327
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:15,770
Get ferguson.
So ron,

3328
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:20,420
let's have some fucking.
Drone is not fighting 55.

3329
02:29:20,421 --> 02:29:21,380
Again.
I didn't say that,

3330
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:24,350
but we're all mixing wall mixing weights
right now.

3331
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:27,350
Did we not say that before?
They want to put out against compete,

3332
02:29:27,351 --> 02:29:29,900
but know how all those thinking about 
moving up and moving up anyway.

3333
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:30,734
So who gives a fuck?
It seems like he's kind of chasing like 

3334
02:29:32,301 --> 02:29:36,600
a chest if he wants that fight.
Let's.

3335
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:38,330
That's what everybody wants to see you 
again,

3336
02:29:38,510 --> 02:29:41,690
whatever the fucking orders,
but the order that they're trying to put

3337
02:29:41,691 --> 02:29:42,524
together,
it was the order I don't want to see 

3338
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,730
because they have to sell paper,
but they're going to do this.

3339
02:29:46,731 --> 02:29:48,950
Okay.
This is the route you flux,

3340
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:52,673
is that gonna is going to bring him back
against fucking the black dude at one 

3341
02:29:56,440 --> 02:29:57,050
70.

3342
02:29:57,050 --> 02:29:58,370
That's the fight.
Tyron woodley.

3343
02:29:58,460 --> 02:29:59,293
That's already been made at the thing 
that's going to come to get the fuck 

3344
02:30:02,151 --> 02:30:02,960
down.
Watch it,

3345
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:03,771
watch it.
Well,

3346
02:30:03,771 --> 02:30:07,430
we just said that woodley's going to 
fight bisbing to catch what I know.

3347
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:08,390
I know.
That's all great.

3348
02:30:08,391 --> 02:30:11,480
They're going to want you think that 
tyron woodley is going to fight.

3349
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:14,550
That was already a staff in New York.
Tyrone woodley,

3350
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:16,360
tyron,
tyron will leave.

3351
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,020
He's going to fucking fight.
I'm okay.

3352
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:20,900
That's the first fight.
Then they're going to try that.

3353
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:23,810
That's the right thing and to put at one
70 maybe in may.

3354
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:24,733
What happens?
It could be.

3355
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:28,010
Then this is what he used to go to one 
sentence.

3356
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:30,230
My decision.
This isn't my decision.

3357
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:31,093
This is beyond you.
This is beyond this because I already 

3358
02:30:33,230 --> 02:30:34,063
seen the setup at the fucking New York 
where you fucking blind because you 

3359
02:30:36,591 --> 02:30:37,440
didn't see what I see.

3360
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:39,050
I talked to them.
I know you talked to them,

3361
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:39,913
but to tell you the deck that I'm 
talking to the people that know this 

3362
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:42,464
again,
so you didn't know because I did 

3363
02:30:45,150 --> 02:30:48,320
understand,
but the problem is here that that was.

3364
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:51,110
The seed was already planted in New 
York.

3365
02:30:51,111 --> 02:30:53,440
It was already planted.
None of you motherfuckers side.

3366
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:54,283
What do you guys watch?
Let's see what a seed of him talking 

3367
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:59,230
back and forth with tyrone.
Tyron woodley.

3368
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,610
Okay.
That's the fucking jesus christ.

3369
02:31:01,900 --> 02:31:04,900
Fucking shit.
Smells like a zoo.

3370
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:07,450
He's gonna.
He's gonna.

3371
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:11,210
Look at you already at the press 
conference and people already.

3372
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:13,070
He said,
oh,

3373
02:31:13,071 --> 02:31:14,490
he doesn't fight enough.
Okay.

3374
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:15,380
Wait,
what's going on here?

3375
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:20,480
That's wayne's talking shit to seed.
Your dumb fucks happening here.

3376
02:31:20,941 --> 02:31:22,600
What is he saying?
He's just talking shit.

3377
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:24,440
You hear what he said?
No,

3378
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:28,800
I don't think so.
It went on and said,

3379
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:31,070
hey,
come out.

3380
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:34,280
Came out like you're lucky.
I don't come to 70.

3381
02:31:34,330 --> 02:31:36,760
Hold on.
Look at.

3382
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:38,610
I'm trying to be cute with them as a 
moment here.

3383
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:43,611
There's a momentary going between tyron 
woodley and it got set up right there.

3384
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:49,350
Each other down the next fucking fight,
conor saying we can do it at 70.

3385
02:31:49,351 --> 02:31:54,351
We can do this Job because you see what 
you want to fucking see.

3386
02:31:54,990 --> 02:31:56,370
That's the next fight.
They already.

3387
02:31:56,371 --> 02:31:59,290
He already planted the seed.
He's not going to fight tyrone.

3388
02:31:59,291 --> 02:32:00,124
He's gonna.
Fight tyronn and killed one time for 

3389
02:32:02,590 --> 02:32:07,590
copied like they threw with frankie.
Edgar was fucking working through dennis

3390
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,680
receivers available.
Look so good.

3391
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:18,150
The color of his skin so now already 
gets.

3392
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:21,240
He's talking to some truth.
It's in between.

3393
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:23,790
He's.
He doesn't want to fight ferguson.

3394
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,830
He's dropping a fight.
Tony ferguson.

3395
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:26,693
Why not just grow?
It takes too much height and tony 

3396
02:32:29,641 --> 02:32:30,780
ferguson don't give a fuck.

3397
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:35,010
He's backstage again in fucking Florida.
That is a horrible for me.

3398
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:40,280
It's just tremendous.
Look at this.

3399
02:32:40,441 --> 02:32:43,410
They are going to get some volume on 
that.

3400
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:44,890
Can we get volume on that?
What?

3401
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:48,090
You here this go all the way back.
Way back.

3402
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:50,250
There we go.
Crank it up.

3403
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:51,283
He's setting it up.
She up the one that's eight guys did 

3404
02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:05,900
with that phone.
Whoa.

3405
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:07,800
Whoa.
It's crazy out.

3406
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:11,430
There's 10 guys in the fucking drain.
Tyron looks.

3407
02:33:11,710 --> 02:33:13,290
Let's hear.
Let's hear rewinding tech.

3408
02:33:13,410 --> 02:33:18,410
We want to.
We want to hear that lady said,

3409
02:33:24,801 --> 02:33:26,160
what's up?
And he said,

3410
02:33:26,161 --> 02:33:26,760
what's up?
He said,

3411
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:28,590
not much,
but meanwhile you look at tyron.

3412
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:29,453
Tyron looks so drain there.
When he made that weight is like right 

3413
02:33:32,581 --> 02:33:37,020
after you made the way he's going to go 
for three.

3414
02:33:37,070 --> 02:33:40,020
Fuck.
Nobody ever saw this shit.

3415
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:42,690
He doesn't want.
He's not going to fight ferguson because

3416
02:33:42,691 --> 02:33:45,750
it's a fucking.
It's a aerosmith.

3417
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,823
Guns and roses was aerosmith on steroids
and tony ferguson is little ds with 

3418
02:33:52,741 --> 02:33:56,790
fucking blood in them.
You understand me?

3419
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:01,820
He doesn't want that.
You don't want tony ferguson and dana.

3420
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:08,390
It's another whole John uncle bobby dana
is not going to let his nephew Fight.

3421
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:14,450
Kidding connor versus is not a draw.
It's not a draw for connor.

3422
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:17,230
he's your guy.
That's a big fucking fight.

3423
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:18,213
Make total

3424
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:24,250
though could be.
Why do you think they're making it?

3425
02:34:24,251 --> 02:34:26,650
Eddie?
You tell me.

3426
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:30,100
Why do you think it's not going to sell 
and I love these guys.

3427
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:30,963
Don't get me.
I'm not.

3428
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:31,803
I'm not a clown in your guy,
but as far as the average consumer 

3429
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:36,520
buying a paper view,
that's not a sell.

3430
02:34:36,521 --> 02:34:37,770
It's just not hell.
Yeah,

3431
02:34:37,771 --> 02:34:38,604
it is.
I just of fighting somebody buddy cop 

3432
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,880
top challenger is always a sale and 
tony,

3433
02:34:45,390 --> 02:34:48,010
but tony ferguson is most certainly a 
top challenger.

3434
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:50,840
When nate dIaz fought conor for the 
first time,

3435
02:34:50,841 --> 02:34:55,150
it was a giant fight because nate diaz 
had a name and he's a bit.

3436
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:57,730
He's a bigger name than tony arguably 
for sure.

3437
02:34:57,850 --> 02:35:01,420
Not even close,
much bigger now after he beat for before

3438
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:04,480
others and tony wasn't the same as it is
now either.

3439
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:06,640
It's a different.
It's a different thing now,

3440
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:06,960
but.

3441
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:07,793
But he had it because of nick and nick 
had had all the strikeforce success 

3442
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,620
elite,
see success,

3443
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:18,220
you know all that is a lot of tv time.
There's the ultimate fighter winner,

3444
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:20,380
nate.
And then on top of that,

3445
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:24,580
nick just got done beaten anderson or 
fighting anderson rather.

3446
02:35:24,581 --> 02:35:27,810
And you know nick,
nick is like a pretty well known figure.

3447
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:30,190
These brother,
they're both the diaz brothers are like,

3448
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:34,570
so that's a different level.
But having them take that fight on short

3449
02:35:34,571 --> 02:35:36,550
notice too.
But connor was the main.

3450
02:35:36,551 --> 02:35:41,551
Draws my points because I agree it's,
he's the main draw.

3451
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:45,810
if you're calm and you're his manager,
he'd go on,

3452
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:48,190
let's fight tony,
who's a tough fucking matchup,

3453
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:53,140
but he's not as big as the name as a guy
like nate diaz at 55 who were gonna make

3454
02:35:53,141 --> 02:35:53,974
more money,
maybe not as tough as a fight bigger 

3455
02:35:55,991 --> 02:35:56,824
name,
so they're doing it from a business 

3456
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:01,210
point and not fighting,
not fighting khabib.

3457
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:03,360
You also have to fight fightiNg.
Horrible fight for.

3458
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:06,370
They're going to do a Russia card and 
when they do a Russia card,

3459
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:09,220
they want to do a Russia card with 
connor or with hubby brother.

3460
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:10,443
So when they do a Russia car with habib,
it's most likely going to be for a 

3461
02:36:13,241 --> 02:36:14,690
title,
I would imagine.

3462
02:36:14,691 --> 02:36:16,680
That's what a title it.
It all depends if comment,

3463
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:20,920
except that reminder might be tony and 
in my current interim,

3464
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:23,830
and apparently they offered it to tony 
and tony said that he wanted to make the

3465
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:24,664
same amount of money that habib bank,
which is perfectly fine at first prep 

3466
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:28,150
fine,
but you know,

3467
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:29,013
they said,
nope,

3468
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:30,910
you got a contract.
You've got to honor your contract.

3469
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:34,120
That's at least how it's been explained.
Yes.

3470
02:36:34,121 --> 02:36:35,230
That's how it's been explained.
They go,

3471
02:36:35,231 --> 02:36:36,580
nope.
Will you sign these contracts?

3472
02:36:36,581 --> 02:36:38,080
You got to honor the contract.

3473
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:39,350
Yeah,
but that,

3474
02:36:39,351 --> 02:36:40,720
that,
that only works one way.

3475
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:44,570
The only works for the ufc because they 
don't honor all the contracts ready me.

3476
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:45,940
If it works for,
they can cut them.

3477
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:48,490
They can.
You have a six week contract plus two,

3478
02:36:48,491 --> 02:36:49,324
But that seems to cut.
it's in the contract that you can get 

3479
02:36:51,311 --> 02:36:52,144
cut if it wasn't in the contract.
There's guys who have fought and they 

3480
02:36:54,131 --> 02:36:56,320
fought out their entire contract for 
sure.

3481
02:36:56,610 --> 02:36:57,443
I'm just saying.
I remember the early days and pedro 

3482
02:36:59,891 --> 02:37:00,724
huizar had this giant contract because 
they thought that pedro is going to be 

3483
02:37:02,531 --> 02:37:05,140
the heavyweight champ and so they were 
giving him like undercard fights.

3484
02:37:05,141 --> 02:37:06,580
He's making quarter of a miLlion 
dollars.

3485
02:37:07,070 --> 02:37:08,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

3486
02:37:08,410 --> 02:37:09,243
It's tricky man,
because I get the idea that they would 

3487
02:37:11,051 --> 02:37:13,560
want to protect connor,
you know,

3488
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:16,220
and really set up the big fights.
Especially

3489
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:19,750
now because he's the biggest guy.
But then you've got connor who's kind of

3490
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:23,480
fucking crazy and he's like the way he 
was john [inaudible],

3491
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:25,590
he gets caught or don't.
I think from,

3492
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:27,350
from a business standpoint,
they're going,

3493
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:30,260
what's the biggest fight pot?
Let's say you have three fights left.

3494
02:37:30,261 --> 02:37:31,094
Who were the three biggest names we can 
fight and to make this happen so you 

3495
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:35,690
stay undefeated big and make the most 
money.

3496
02:37:35,691 --> 02:37:36,524
He might not be under feet.
I mean it's definitely not undefeated 

3497
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:38,450
now.
Right?

3498
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:42,190
But the biggest thing is the woodley 
fight because that's a one seven.seven

3499
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:43,550
seven.
That's a third belt guys.

3500
02:37:43,551 --> 02:37:47,970
That's a fight.
As much control on your fuckers up.

3501
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:49,370
You didn't see it.
Number two,

3502
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:50,443
listen,
I'm not saying that khabib is going to 

3503
02:37:52,221 --> 02:37:53,054
be kind of,
especially after I talked to take the 

3504
02:37:54,591 --> 02:37:56,530
punch or michael kahn.
I'm not saying michael,

3505
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:57,793
Michael Johnson,
but the fight is khabib and then the 

3506
02:37:59,661 --> 02:38:01,100
next fight has to be ferguson.

3507
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:03,580
If he beats him,
not just the way it is cooked.

3508
02:38:03,850 --> 02:38:05,570
ferguson came.
Wait,

3509
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:06,433
they can't wait like ferguson needs a 
fight like in the next four or five 

3510
02:38:09,051 --> 02:38:09,884
months.
It could be me as a fight in the next 

3511
02:38:11,170 --> 02:38:12,003
two,
three months.

3512
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:12,933
I don't find in brooklyn from now.
To what extent when you went to viewed 

3513
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:20,760
them,
put the hat on your dad.

3514
02:38:21,050 --> 02:38:21,883
He said he'll fight and brooke,
we put the hat on my head every time I 

3515
02:38:23,321 --> 02:38:24,590
put every time right now.
It's great.

3516
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:28,150
I fucking love it.
He looks at me,

3517
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,160
shows me that I give him the nod,
like,

3518
02:38:30,170 --> 02:38:32,110
yeah,
I'll put that on the flood lights.

3519
02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:37,310
That had me as a fan is tony rush.
Can be.

3520
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:40,210
That's.
That's the fight.

3521
02:38:40,211 --> 02:38:41,660
That's a fight.
It's not a better match up,

3522
02:38:41,661 --> 02:38:43,700
but it can be.
I don't know about that.

3523
02:38:43,701 --> 02:38:47,090
I like a tony versus connor.
I even like beef versus connor.

3524
02:38:49,930 --> 02:38:53,080
Connor versus woodley.
I like tHat fight to fight gun.

3525
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:56,700
That's the next money fight,
but he's going to eventually use.

3526
02:38:56,720 --> 02:39:00,040
Gives them enough power to do that.
I get that.

3527
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:03,130
Yeah.
He's got all the files.

3528
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:04,093
Well,
here's the thing about do more 

3529
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:08,720
powerfully loses to bisping.
If he loses those catch weight fight,

3530
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:12,150
he still keeps that $170 strap.
That's if that catch weight.

3531
02:39:12,780 --> 02:39:15,030
That's just use my.
No,

3532
02:39:15,130 --> 02:39:18,220
you can't hold two divisions.
I run against my boy.

3533
02:39:20,050 --> 02:39:23,300
I'm telling you.
They going after tyro.

3534
02:39:23,330 --> 02:39:26,630
Planted the seed right there.
Who can't tie up to division.

3535
02:39:26,631 --> 02:39:30,400
I've been backstage at ufc is all the 
guys like,

3536
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:31,253
dude,
throw away from the russian as long as 

3537
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:35,564
they can,
but specifically we can talk over each 

3538
02:39:38,211 --> 02:39:38,960
other.
No,

3539
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:40,770
they'll do the nasa thing.
When they go to interview him,

3540
02:39:40,771 --> 02:39:43,910
they'd die in car accidents and shit,
but that's the fight guy.

3541
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:44,743
So that's the fight right there that 
everybody wants to see right off the 

3542
02:39:47,001 --> 02:39:49,580
bat.
I love to see conor and could be by love

3543
02:39:49,581 --> 02:39:50,414
to see ferguson and khabib,
but they don't really do that rIght off 

3544
02:39:52,911 --> 02:39:54,560
the bat.
They're going to hope that they fall off

3545
02:39:54,561 --> 02:39:57,360
a cliff or a plane goes down.
let's give him the money for it,

3546
02:39:57,410 --> 02:39:58,720
which is one sentence.
Kenny,

3547
02:39:58,730 --> 02:40:00,570
get the third belt.
Here's the thing,

3548
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:07,210
if he does lose,
if he goes up the risk for it.

3549
02:40:08,010 --> 02:40:09,090
Same thing with that.
Nate first.

3550
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:12,110
Nate diaz number.
Who runs this shit?

3551
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:14,010
Do you do.
What do you do

3552
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,470
with tony and khabib?
They go to hell.

3553
02:40:17,050 --> 02:40:19,140
No,
fuck you.

3554
02:40:19,141 --> 02:40:20,820
Ufc.
We can't take this.

3555
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:22,530
No more.
Good from us.

3556
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:23,693
Here's another thing at beltour,
there's still one guy left that I don't 

3557
02:40:26,461 --> 02:40:27,294
know where his contracts at,
but Michael Chandler is a motherfucker 

3558
02:40:29,461 --> 02:40:30,930
will fuck.
He is a motherfucker.

3559
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:32,850
He's remarried.
He beat eddie alvarez.

3560
02:40:32,851 --> 02:40:34,620
Who was the champ at 1:55.
Did you see?

3561
02:40:34,621 --> 02:40:37,470
We did want that pit bull guy and starts
to him with one punch them.

3562
02:40:38,010 --> 02:40:40,480
Dude.
MIchael chandler is legit as fuck.

3563
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:42,270
How many fights do you have left though?
I don't know.

3564
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:44,310
It's interesting.
He was just at the ufc the other day.

3565
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:46,650
That's why I'm saying it,
ross.

3566
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:49,080
I was talking to him.
I didn't talk to them about the fight.

3567
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:51,390
Yeah,
he's a bad motherfucker to another guy.

3568
02:40:51,391 --> 02:40:53,760
Lance palmer from team alpha male who's 
series.

3569
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:57,450
He has one fight left and after that 
he's going straight to the use.

3570
02:40:57,570 --> 02:41:02,570
Good luck being that motherfucker.
What way to say 45 can wrestle his balls

3571
02:41:02,671 --> 02:41:03,660
off.
Hm.

3572
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:05,070
Interesting.
Yeah.

3573
02:41:05,071 --> 02:41:06,540
There's a lot of talent coming up,
man.

3574
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,523
Lot of talent coming up.
then you have some interest or like the 

3575
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:11,980
lorenz larkin,
who's a month is he to go to belterra?

3576
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:14,340
They're talking to me.
He's a free agent.

3577
02:41:14,460 --> 02:41:16,530
I hope he stays in the ufc.
I really do.

3578
02:41:16,740 --> 02:41:19,410
Because you're paying pretty good.
Yes.

3579
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:21,400
They have to.
They have to throw it is the,

3580
02:41:21,410 --> 02:41:23,180
you know,
the people are going to get over there.

3581
02:41:23,230 --> 02:41:26,970
Only mcdonald's lark in the lenses on 
there yet.

3582
02:41:26,971 --> 02:41:29,670
But lorens the way he put away neil 
magnet.

3583
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:31,680
I was like,
don't go anywhere man.

3584
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,920
Stick around like lorenzo lorenzo beat 
robbie lawler.

3585
02:41:37,410 --> 02:41:40,170
Lorenzo is legit as fuck.
Nightmare.

3586
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:43,710
He's a dangerous striker.
He's one of the best records in that 170

3587
02:41:43,711 --> 02:41:47,130
pound division and fought a good chunk 
of his career at one 85.

3588
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:48,233
One seven.
And he's a big fella and he's got a 

3589
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:51,023
ridiculous kicks.
He throWs that goddamn oh bleak kick to 

3590
02:41:52,891 --> 02:41:56,470
the body better than anybody I've ever 
seen him pull up the fight.

3591
02:41:56,670 --> 02:41:59,100
Uh,
lorenzo larkin versus neil maGni.

3592
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:01,830
Neil magnet,
who is a tough fucking dude.

3593
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,350
You didn't even have a chance in that 
fight.

3594
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:06,930
Starch.
He beat Johnny Hendricks.

3595
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:09,060
The judge's helped,
but he beat.

3596
02:42:09,470 --> 02:42:10,303
Neil went in one and three in the.
I think he could have been conceivably 

3597
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:17,250
one because of having them in that 
triangle in the third.

3598
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:20,910
But the first round was so loose,
it just didn't look dangerous to me.

3599
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:22,830
That was like a legit loose triangle.
But he.

3600
02:42:22,831 --> 02:42:26,540
But he still did more than john's muscle
biases fucked.

3601
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:28,620
Who might be right.
I just have to look at it again.

3602
02:42:28,621 --> 02:42:29,640
But I,
I saw some,

3603
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,073
I saw some space and I think the arm was
tucked in enough where I don't think 

3604
02:42:33,751 --> 02:42:34,584
johnny was like in real trouble,
but he was definitely stuck thinking 

3605
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:39,020
about those judges though.
They don't know shit.

3606
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:44,040
They see him in danger.
They're given some serious motherfucking

3607
02:42:44,041 --> 02:42:47,720
danger anytime you're caught with one 
arm and one on the mount and the shit as

3608
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:48,913
cinched.

3609
02:42:51,430 --> 02:42:52,263
It's almost like your legs are so long 
that like he gives you a little extra 

3610
02:42:54,961 --> 02:42:55,794
space because his legs are so long was 
the problem was pushed down and started 

3611
02:43:00,571 --> 02:43:01,404
throwing elbows.
And when that does like his hands and 

3612
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:04,830
there,
it pushes them out.

3613
02:43:04,930 --> 02:43:05,890
yeah.
That's what happened.

3614
02:43:05,891 --> 02:43:06,724
So the more you hit them.
So it's like you gotta you gotta couple 

3615
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,613
farting up a storm.
Like you got to land a couple of elbows 

3616
02:43:11,981 --> 02:43:14,230
and then grab the wrist and pull them 
back in.

3617
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:18,060
You got to constantly pull back in,
throw a couple more like this and yeah,

3618
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:20,890
but they remember.
You're pushing them out of your shit.

3619
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:22,690
Remember when anderson stopped travis 
luder.

3620
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:24,700
That's how he got them locked him up.
DOn't miss.

3621
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,430
Wait,
could there have been a more frustrating

3622
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,151
cut?
He didn't.

3623
02:43:28,151 --> 02:43:31,270
Just ms dot dude was the closest I've 
ever seen.

3624
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:32,060
Where we're looking back.

3625
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:33,460
The guy was dead.
Watch thiS fight.

3626
02:43:33,461 --> 02:43:36,370
Here's the lorenzo.
Lorenzo is a slick striker,

3627
02:43:36,371 --> 02:43:37,204
but watch this oblique kick to the body.
a lot of guys are throwing this to the 

3628
02:43:40,241 --> 02:43:41,074
leg,
but lorens throws it to the body and he 

3629
02:43:42,881 --> 02:43:43,714
switches stances a lot.
But the way he lands it launches you 

3630
02:43:46,931 --> 02:43:49,450
through the air with it.
so he hits him with that low kick,

3631
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:53,070
low kick on the bottom of the calf,
like real low.

3632
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:55,930
It's going to happen right now.
It's going to happen.

3633
02:43:55,931 --> 02:43:57,460
I mean,
this is just the fight itself,

3634
02:43:57,610 --> 02:44:00,070
but the way he throws it is really 
unusual man,

3635
02:44:00,071 --> 02:44:01,970
because he'll be like from here,
like right there.

3636
02:44:02,030 --> 02:44:03,160
That's it.
yeah.

3637
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:06,160
You see that?
Yeah.

3638
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,970
That's exactly.
Or rear push.

3639
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:08,270
Yeah.
no,

3640
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:08,510
no,
no,

3641
02:44:08,510 --> 02:44:08,951
no.
Watch,

3642
02:44:08,951 --> 02:44:10,150
watch.
It's the oblique kick.

3643
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,810
Watch.
See that?

3644
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:13,150
This is what he wants.
No,

3645
02:44:13,151 --> 02:44:13,440
no,
no,

3646
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:13,570
no.

3647
02:44:13,570 --> 02:44:14,530
It's not.
It's like this.

3648
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:16,570
He's doing this.
Watch it again.

3649
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:20,950
Watch it again.
Back it up and just watch it.

3650
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:21,970
Just watch it.
Trust me.

3651
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:23,980
I know what the kick is.
Watch how he does it.

3652
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:24,740
Watch.
Watch.

3653
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:28,720
Whereas he lists his toes are pointing.
See his toes are kind of pointing it now

3654
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:30,310
outside.
That fucks me up.

3655
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:31,270
Oh dude.
it's a.

3656
02:44:31,630 --> 02:44:33,730
I'll show you on a Bag.
It's a devastating j.

3657
02:44:33,790 --> 02:44:34,740
Neil.
Talk about the fight.

3658
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:36,820
He goes,
I literally just overlooked the guy.

3659
02:44:36,821 --> 02:44:39,160
He doesn't get a lot of hype,
but he definitely should.

3660
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:40,300
What?
Overlooked.

3661
02:44:40,301 --> 02:44:40,931
Larkin.
Yeah.

3662
02:44:40,931 --> 02:44:41,650
He goes,
he goes,

3663
02:44:41,650 --> 02:44:42,880
there's just.
I don't know.

3664
02:44:42,890 --> 02:44:44,010
He,
he doesn't get a lot of hype.

3665
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:46,270
Thought it was going to be an easier 
fight than it was.

3666
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:48,400
Well,
he just got off a beaten hector lombard.

3667
02:44:48,401 --> 02:44:49,770
He might've been feeling his oats.
Yeah,

3668
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:50,643
exactly.
But larkin is a totally different 

3669
02:44:52,031 --> 02:44:52,330
animal.

3670
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:53,860
He's probably the most hot.
He's tough.

3671
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:57,190
One of the most technical and a capable 
guys in the division.

3672
02:44:57,191 --> 02:44:59,370
When it comes to striking his jujitsu 
again,

3673
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:00,760
you see it again,
like I said,

3674
02:45:00,830 --> 02:45:03,700
again,
reducing his foot is not.

3675
02:45:03,701 --> 02:45:06,500
He's hitting with the heel like this.
It's like this is.

3676
02:45:06,510 --> 02:45:08,770
This is what he's doing.
See how he does it there,

3677
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:09,970
dude.
Come on.

3678
02:45:09,971 --> 02:45:12,950
Sign who kicks like that?
Like again,

3679
02:45:14,050 --> 02:45:16,000
back that up again.
We're going to extension.

3680
02:45:16,001 --> 02:45:17,500
He gets.
Watch this.

3681
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:21,070
Watch how he throws this cake.
This is a beautiful kick man.

3682
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:27,120
He sets it up with that and then steps 
in spartan style food.

3683
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:28,613
It's.
It's a weird kick because a lot of guys 

3684
02:45:30,521 --> 02:45:34,060
don't do it the way he does his stomping
and john does it all the time.

3685
02:45:34,290 --> 02:45:36,310
Yep.
But john does it to the legs.

3686
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,820
It a lot to ronda.
Holly did it to rhonda.

3687
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,880
That's wiggled in instead of out.
Right?

3688
02:45:42,881 --> 02:45:43,714
Exactly.
It's like you step forward and you do 

3689
02:45:45,221 --> 02:45:50,200
this and it's got all the boys in front 
of a bag,

3690
02:45:50,201 --> 02:45:53,830
I'll show you is the ufc.
I knew he didn't invent it,

3691
02:45:53,831 --> 02:45:56,950
but they've been doing it forever 
forever,

3692
02:45:56,951 --> 02:45:59,200
but they weren't doing it to the leg.
Not to this degree though.

3693
02:45:59,201 --> 02:46:02,350
He fucking sparta kicks.
The rens is on another level.

3694
02:46:02,351 --> 02:46:06,000
He just is and the only loss that he has
inside the octagon and one 70 is against

3695
02:46:06,001 --> 02:46:06,834
human off and that was a super close 
fight and he's not so he's not the only 

3696
02:46:09,831 --> 02:46:11,960
guy that ever let him throw it exactly 
like that.

3697
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:15,830
He's one of the only guys have ever seen
throw it to the bottom and knock someone

3698
02:46:15,831 --> 02:46:17,570
down and the way he throws it to the 
body,

3699
02:46:17,571 --> 02:46:18,404
just massive power and speed the way he 
chambers his legs and then gets that 

3700
02:46:23,121 --> 02:46:26,450
kick to launch straight in a straight 
line practices that right.

3701
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:27,413
The guyS are doing now to guarantee 
issue with this success kind of cat 

3702
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,390
league.
You have to see a thousand times before.

3703
02:46:32,391 --> 02:46:34,490
People don't make it part of their daily
routine,

3704
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,473
but he's fucking strikes.
Lorenzo flies under the radar like he 

3705
02:46:38,811 --> 02:46:42,140
Wants more publicity.
They did it again.

3706
02:46:42,141 --> 02:46:44,690
He did it.
He does it from here to the body,

3707
02:46:44,691 --> 02:46:45,524
which is so crazy nasty.
Can you imagine him versus Roy 

3708
02:46:47,670 --> 02:46:48,620
Macdonald?
Bellatore I could.

3709
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,493
Oh no,
but I can imagine him fighting for the 

3710
02:46:50,751 --> 02:46:55,280
title against woodley too.
I want to see him at one 70 in the ufc.

3711
02:46:55,281 --> 02:46:57,820
I was selfish.
What's his last record of the last?

3712
02:46:57,890 --> 02:46:58,723
The last one off.
And it was a razor close decision that 

3713
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:02,790
recent,
uh,

3714
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:05,440
that was like two or three fights ago 
and he's won all the other ones.

3715
02:47:05,490 --> 02:47:07,520
He's a monster on a winning streak.
YeaH.

3716
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:08,353
But this is the big win because 
magnesium a top contender and he beat 

3717
02:47:10,491 --> 02:47:11,480
the fuck out of magna.

3718
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:14,140
Magna was never in this fight.
This fight was,

3719
02:47:14,470 --> 02:47:15,303
it was like he worked.
A man magnet has really only been out 

3720
02:47:17,591 --> 02:47:20,480
class in this larkin fight.
And then he got out class when he fought

3721
02:47:20,481 --> 02:47:23,720
demian maia larkin throws a lot of weird
shit to throw,

3722
02:47:23,721 --> 02:47:24,554
like we'll kicks to the thigh.
Did he came into rain and everyone was 

3723
02:47:26,871 --> 02:47:27,350
like,
well,

3724
02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:28,960
we don't know what the fuck to do.
Really.

3725
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:31,010
There's no.
Me and pat couldn't get them down.

3726
02:47:31,011 --> 02:47:32,660
Is take down a fence.
Was ridiculous.

3727
02:47:32,810 --> 02:47:35,180
His striking was unconventional.
He was a nightmare.

3728
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:36,200
Yeah.
He's got a,

3729
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:37,063
I think a kung fu background.
I think that's where he started his 

3730
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:42,380
career,
but you see like that low leg kick,

3731
02:47:42,381 --> 02:47:44,830
man,
he likes he attacks like below the knee.

3732
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:46,370
We can Just do it again.
He'll up.

3733
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:51,480
As far as the sweet spot with the take 
down defense to speed magnet pulls.

3734
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:53,030
Guard.
Yeah.

3735
02:47:53,031 --> 02:47:53,864
I bet.
It's interesting being a guy of his 

3736
02:47:54,921 --> 02:47:56,270
caLiber going,
god,

3737
02:47:56,271 --> 02:47:59,370
do I go to bella tour where I make more 
money or do I stay in the ufc?

3738
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:02,300
Why could actually be a ufc champion?
And you know,

3739
02:48:02,301 --> 02:48:04,000
the notoriety that comes with that.
It's like,

3740
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,230
it's a tough fucking.
You know what I'm saying?

3741
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,093
The problem is you could go to bell tour
and he could chew away years of your 

3742
02:48:09,351 --> 02:48:11,750
career and no one will know who you are.
You know,

3743
02:48:11,870 --> 02:48:14,010
look at diego lima,
you know,

3744
02:48:14,011 --> 02:48:15,490
or Douglas Douglas lema.
I know,

3745
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:16,041
I'm just kidding.
No,

3746
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:16,761
no,
exactly.

3747
02:48:16,761 --> 02:48:19,760
No lima's a world will look at Michael 
Chandler.

3748
02:48:19,820 --> 02:48:21,120
Yeah.
Michael chandler.

3749
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:22,550
It.
I mean he's better.

3750
02:48:22,551 --> 02:48:23,850
Maybe alvarez.
Alvarez.

3751
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:26,600
Yeah.
Still.

3752
02:48:26,690 --> 02:48:27,800
I mean you,
you,

3753
02:48:27,801 --> 02:48:28,400
you,
you,

3754
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:30,290
you talked about a guy like of that 
caliber.

3755
02:48:30,830 --> 02:48:33,670
He walks down The street in the seVen 11
people are.

3756
02:48:33,770 --> 02:48:35,180
Well,
what are you a crossfit?

3757
02:48:35,250 --> 02:48:36,600
They don't know who he is.
what happened?

3758
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:39,290
He was in the ufc.
Everyone knows who he is.

3759
02:48:39,291 --> 02:48:39,771
Yeah.
No,

3760
02:48:39,771 --> 02:48:41,840
you're right.
It's not there yet.

3761
02:48:41,870 --> 02:48:44,450
I Wish they can get there though.
We don't know man.

3762
02:48:44,451 --> 02:48:45,284
They don't have paper view.
they don't have like those you need 

3763
02:48:47,850 --> 02:48:50,600
spike tv.
It's not the same.

3764
02:48:50,810 --> 02:48:53,300
It's just what they're putting.
I w I agree,

3765
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:54,143
but they,
they've tried one paper view was a 

3766
02:48:55,911 --> 02:48:57,460
terrible disaster.
Who was the paper?

3767
02:48:57,461 --> 02:48:58,880
You the rampage.
Remember?

3768
02:48:59,960 --> 02:49:01,640
I do remember me.
Just mark.

3769
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,260
Nobody bought it.
It's just,

3770
02:49:03,370 --> 02:49:04,550
it's.
There's a difference.

3771
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:07,590
But their ratings on regular cable.
Good.

3772
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:10,890
Just as good as the use.
What's weird is their ratings on regular

3773
02:49:10,891 --> 02:49:12,990
cable still don't translate into 
stardom.

3774
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,363
It's very strange.
It's because I think what they've been 

3775
02:49:17,011 --> 02:49:20,850
doing is they've been getting the older 
guys from the ufc where people are like,

3776
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:21,813
oh,
he's kind of over the hill where now 

3777
02:49:23,401 --> 02:49:24,234
they have a guy like Roy Mcdonald who 
was young and he can be that kind of 

3778
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:32,690
world class athlete,
but the replay of a wonderboy fucking up

3779
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:33,120
rory.

3780
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:34,800
That's what they show over and over and 
over agaIn,

3781
02:49:34,801 --> 02:49:35,634
and then they show robby lauer knocking 
out rory and they'll just show it over 

3782
02:49:38,371 --> 02:49:39,204
and over again in their highlights 
through till everybody knows rory left 

3783
02:49:42,050 --> 02:49:43,110
and went over there.
I look,

3784
02:49:43,150 --> 02:49:47,880
I wish nothing but the best until it 
gets like a michael venom page.

3785
02:49:47,881 --> 02:49:48,714
Let's say he just.
If they get one superstar like a jon 

3786
02:49:51,001 --> 02:49:51,834
jones who started with them,
then you're going to start seeing some 

3787
02:49:53,761 --> 02:49:55,680
gnh got kind of exposed in his last 
fight.

3788
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:58,490
What happened on the distance did knock 
the guy out,

3789
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:00,750
didn't really look that good and he's 
the answer,

3790
02:50:00,950 --> 02:50:01,783
but I'm saying they need a type of guy.
I forget who he fought because the the 

3791
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:07,830
chill zone in versteeg ortiz.
It'll do record breaking.

3792
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:11,490
It's going to kill number wise because 
we know who those guYs are both older.

3793
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:12,630
Oh,
it's going to sell for sure.

3794
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,100
Well,
what's not selling?

3795
02:50:14,101 --> 02:50:15,330
It's going to be a regular tv,
right?

3796
02:50:15,690 --> 02:50:16,660
It's not paper view.
What?

3797
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:17,513
No,
I'm gonna say it's gonna sell ticket 

3798
02:50:18,211 --> 02:50:19,920
wise at the time.
Because remember,

3799
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:25,100
remember that brooklyn card was supposed
to be at the same time as as that a belt

3800
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,520
or card use left because they didn't 
have a headliner for that.

3801
02:50:29,521 --> 02:50:31,980
So they left anaheim.
Remember that same night?

3802
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:34,620
Is that where it was?
Oh,

3803
02:50:34,621 --> 02:50:37,040
well that's the brooklyn card.
They moved back to brooklyn.

3804
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:38,250
That's what happened.
Oh,

3805
02:50:38,410 --> 02:50:39,243
it's interesting that brooklyn card does
look like they're still working on it 

3806
02:50:42,451 --> 02:50:44,180
though.
I'm hoping that they could pull that.

3807
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:47,620
It's a smart room because like tito 
chill and we got fucking holly this like

3808
02:50:47,730 --> 02:50:49,800
it doesn't.
So that's the same weekend.

3809
02:50:49,860 --> 02:50:53,130
Yep.
So the remainder randomly.

3810
02:50:53,390 --> 02:50:54,500
No,
I think they switched it,

3811
02:50:54,510 --> 02:50:58,170
but it was the same as bellatore belt 
towards January 21st on spike.

3812
02:50:58,290 --> 02:50:59,160
Oh,
okay.

3813
02:50:59,161 --> 02:51:02,080
So february.
And they switched it to that february.

3814
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:05,900
Can dos santos rescheduled that?
No,

3815
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:07,980
we'll do for doom.
Was supposed to fight cain,

3816
02:51:07,981 --> 02:51:11,000
but cain got pulled off the card because
she fucked up man.

3817
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:11,853
He did an interview and said that he 
needed surgery after the fight and they 

3818
02:51:14,231 --> 02:51:15,390
were like,
what?

3819
02:51:15,750 --> 02:51:16,583
so you know bob baker from the Nevada 
state athletic commission who does 

3820
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:21,990
fucking awesome job.
He is not going to let you fight.

3821
02:51:21,991 --> 02:51:23,760
If you go around telling people that you
need surgery,

3822
02:51:23,770 --> 02:51:26,340
what's your liability?
It's a liability business.

3823
02:51:26,341 --> 02:51:28,650
One-on-one came and you just can't do 
it.

3824
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:30,450
He fucked up.
He probably didn't think about it.

3825
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:31,313
He just thought,
look,

3826
02:51:31,590 --> 02:51:33,870
I'm just going to show everybody how 
tough I am and go through it anyway,

3827
02:51:34,050 --> 02:51:34,883
which you can do.
See if the thing is his back is 

3828
02:51:36,931 --> 02:51:38,670
structurally sound.
The doctors cleared him,

3829
02:51:38,671 --> 02:51:41,130
so if he did like he thought in his 
mind,

3830
02:51:41,131 --> 02:51:43,770
even though he does need to get the 
pathways cleared out,

3831
02:51:43,771 --> 02:51:47,370
he's got some sort of stenosis where the
pathways to the nerves,

3832
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:50,160
it's irritating as nerves,
but he can get a cortisone shot.

3833
02:51:50,180 --> 02:51:51,480
No,
he gets a cortisone shot.

3834
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:54,210
Then he won't feel it.
He can go through the fight.

3835
02:51:54,211 --> 02:51:55,440
Structurally,
he's fine.

3836
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:57,450
It's not like he's compromised and he's 
got a weak joint,

3837
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:59,280
so he goes,
it's just a little bit of pain.

3838
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:00,293
He goes through it.
Then after the fight he can get the 

3839
02:52:01,741 --> 02:52:03,120
surgery.
That's his doctor said.

3840
02:52:03,121 --> 02:52:03,954
So that's what he was saying.
He just didn't take consideration that 

3841
02:52:05,801 --> 02:52:06,070
whenever

3842
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:09,250
you say two things happen,
first of all the betting line changes.

3843
02:52:09,490 --> 02:52:12,360
You go and Tell everybody needs surgery.
After the fight there was a role,

3844
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:14,860
so that gets squirrely.
Especially with Nevada.

3845
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:15,723
They have to figure out how they,
how they put thIs lineup and second of 

3846
02:52:17,861 --> 02:52:20,620
all there's the liability thing.
It's huge liability.

3847
02:52:20,770 --> 02:52:21,603
And then did you see they did offer the 
fight of junior dos santos and then for 

3848
02:52:24,451 --> 02:52:25,284
doom came out,
so I call calling junior dos santos gay 

3849
02:52:26,950 --> 02:52:29,270
and it was like just come out the closet
said nothing.

3850
02:52:29,271 --> 02:52:31,030
It's homosexuals,
but everyone knows you're gay.

3851
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:33,220
damn son.
Did he say that?

3852
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:36,040
Yeah,
I went hard in the paint at jds.

3853
02:52:36,070 --> 02:52:37,150
Wow,
that's rough.

3854
02:52:37,490 --> 02:52:41,890
Super rough.
So do you see johnson?

3855
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,690
That's not horizon.
Anytime soon.

3856
02:52:43,740 --> 02:52:45,700
Dc's just getting back to training on 
monday,

3857
02:52:45,740 --> 02:52:48,430
dc had a torn muscle and he decided to 
opt for surgery,

3858
02:52:48,431 --> 02:52:49,264
right?

3859
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:52,930
Yeah,
right next to it.

3860
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:53,891
So,
um,

3861
02:52:53,891 --> 02:52:56,920
he wenT for surgery on that surgery,
just getting back to training.

3862
02:52:56,921 --> 02:53:00,850
But who knows how long he's out.
Then he got John Jones is suspensions up

3863
02:53:00,851 --> 02:53:01,684
in july and then rumble said I'm the 
only thing I'm doing is fighting for 

3864
02:53:04,370 --> 02:53:06,460
title.
I'll wait a year if I have to,

3865
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:07,441
but the ufc,
I'm like,

3866
02:53:07,441 --> 02:53:08,274
nah.
So near fight Jon jones for interim 

3867
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:12,070
title.
That's what I think's going to happen if

3868
02:53:12,071 --> 02:53:14,980
dcs not ready.
So joN jones comes back in july.

3869
02:53:15,430 --> 02:53:17,080
I think his,
his,

3870
02:53:17,081 --> 02:53:17,914
uh,
suspension is up right when that July 

3871
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:22,620
4th weekend card comes up.
Boom,

3872
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:23,473
boom.
So he'll be probably the headline for 

3873
02:53:24,971 --> 02:53:25,804
that.
That's a tough go because he had some 

3874
02:53:27,221 --> 02:53:29,000
ring rust when he fought osp.
Yep.

3875
02:53:29,050 --> 02:53:31,720
Let's not get it twisted.
anthony rumble johnson.

3876
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:34,060
You don'T get any mistakes with that 
gentleman.

3877
02:53:34,061 --> 02:53:38,470
And also he had ring rust before the osp
fight and now it's another year off.

3878
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:41,190
That's a this all long time off to your 
point with rhonda,

3879
02:53:41,230 --> 02:53:44,470
run at 411 days off.
Ring rust is real,

3880
02:53:44,471 --> 02:53:45,304
man.
I don't give a fuck what people say and 

3881
02:53:46,661 --> 02:53:47,494
not only is it real,
but you're not getting warm up fights 

3882
02:53:49,421 --> 02:53:51,830
like she's not fighting liz carmouche 
right?

3883
02:53:51,850 --> 02:53:56,170
You're fighting fucking this killer who 
just fought at ufc 200.

3884
02:53:56,670 --> 02:54:00,400
Who's ready to go?
No warmup Is losing about bj.

3885
02:54:00,401 --> 02:54:01,234
Yeah,
year.

3886
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:03,790
That's going to gary's.
Here's the future.

3887
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:04,670
Scary.
You're.

3888
02:54:04,700 --> 02:54:05,810
Yeah,
you're rodriguez.

3889
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:07,360
He's so dynamic,
man.

3890
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:10,140
Clutch bj's at jackson's.
right,

3891
02:54:10,810 --> 02:54:11,920
man.
you know,

3892
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:13,960
that's like a.
That's what everyone was saying.

3893
02:54:13,961 --> 02:54:14,261
Like,
oh,

3894
02:54:14,261 --> 02:54:15,750
bj needs a real camp.
He,

3895
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:19,960
if pj went to jackson's or bj went here 
aka or whatever,

3896
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:20,943
and uh,
he actually listened and he did it a 

3897
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:23,500
little too late.
Yeah,

3898
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:28,750
it's weird that it's too late.
It's never too late.

3899
02:54:29,130 --> 02:54:29,920
Those are,
that we have.

3900
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:32,530
Here is a bad motherfucker.
But bj,

3901
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:33,810
you know,
with the right camp,

3902
02:54:33,811 --> 02:54:36,820
just like everybody said it.
If he had the right camp,

3903
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:38,670
he's got the right camp now.
Yeah.

3904
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:39,610
But what happened?
Why?

3905
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:41,920
What happened to his body where he's 
going to 45,

3906
02:54:41,921 --> 02:54:44,830
like why is he going to 45?
Especially as you get back this real for

3907
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:46,660
the kids.
That was always his real weight.

3908
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:50,380
He was doing jujitsu at 1:47.
I was always this way.

3909
02:54:50,470 --> 02:54:51,580
Right.
But wasn't it like 12?

3910
02:54:52,180 --> 02:54:53,650
YeaH.
He was young as fuck.

3911
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:58,800
And then he wanted the black belt worlds
at 1:47.

3912
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,690
He fought machita for god's sakes.
Like he's funny.

3913
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:03,460
He's a legend.
He's now.

3914
02:55:03,560 --> 02:55:03,960
I'll,
I'll,

3915
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:04,220
I'll

3916
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:05,570
never.
I never root against bj.

3917
02:55:05,610 --> 02:55:09,190
Just goddamn.
Fortunately a year is.

3918
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:11,970
That's a nightmare opponent for future 
man.

3919
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:13,430
But this is the best.
Bj.

3920
02:55:13,431 --> 02:55:15,110
We're going to see.
This is the best one.

3921
02:55:15,111 --> 02:55:17,630
That's it.
That's a strong statement at his age.

3922
02:55:17,830 --> 02:55:20,240
You know when I'm at the best possible 
way.

3923
02:55:21,030 --> 02:55:22,380
Yeah,
that's what you're saying.

3924
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:27,390
He has a great camp shape.
He's sticking around with dj.

3925
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:29,690
Are you kidding?
You can't you get ate up?

3926
02:55:29,890 --> 02:55:30,723
Yeah.
It's 38 years old though and that's 38 

3927
02:55:33,861 --> 02:55:37,280
mma years in 38 years old.
He takes some doors.

3928
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:40,960
Jujitsu.
It's pretty goddamn stepson.

3929
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:45,930
He's a mad scramble or fly to a knee 
bar,

3930
02:55:45,950 --> 02:55:46,783
so I don't think so.
I don't think he's black or brown belt 

3931
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:51,860
levels.
Rodriguez,

3932
02:55:52,220 --> 02:55:53,090
bjj,
rank.

3933
02:55:53,091 --> 02:55:54,140
Okay.
I don't know.

3934
02:55:54,410 --> 02:55:55,440
Find that jamie.
Um,

3935
02:55:55,530 --> 02:55:58,100
but here's the thing about your year.
the distance.

3936
02:55:58,280 --> 02:56:00,850
He keeps that kicking distance.
He's fucking,

3937
02:56:01,270 --> 02:56:06,110
he's lethal on the beaches,
the quickness and stands with them.

3938
02:56:06,170 --> 02:56:09,470
Yeah.
The odds are not in his favor,

3939
02:56:09,560 --> 02:56:13,730
but if bj just decides to take it into 
that clinch and take them down,

3940
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:17,480
squeeze them out and jump on his neck.
I tHink that's the best route.

3941
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:19,660
Not hundred percent.
He's got it.

3942
02:56:19,730 --> 02:56:23,300
He's got to take rodriguez.
I didn't like bj.

3943
02:56:23,301 --> 02:56:25,970
Verse llamas.
What the fuck is the legend,

3944
02:56:25,971 --> 02:56:26,361
man?
Look at him.

3945
02:56:26,361 --> 02:56:28,970
Ricardo lamas.
Carnal lumps a bad motherfucker.

3946
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,640
I know.
So it was here.

3947
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,590
But the problem is going to hurt you.
You didn't like that.

3948
02:56:33,591 --> 02:56:35,450
You don't think your year's going to 
hurt you in the same way.

3949
02:56:35,451 --> 02:56:36,890
Ricardo is jesus.
Dude,

3950
02:56:36,891 --> 02:56:37,724
did you see the touchy feely fight when 
he launched that fucking flying 

3951
02:56:39,621 --> 02:56:41,990
roundhouse kick to his jaw and flattened
them?

3952
02:56:42,050 --> 02:56:44,180
Those are good points.
I'm just,

3953
02:56:44,181 --> 02:56:46,180
I didn't like the llamas fight for.
Um,

3954
02:56:46,610 --> 02:56:50,380
I think they're both equally scary.
The thing about pharmacists,

3955
02:56:50,381 --> 02:56:53,180
llamas has more experience against world
class competition.

3956
02:56:53,360 --> 02:56:56,840
Went five rounds with aldo and was 
beating aldo in the fifth round and good

3957
02:56:57,970 --> 02:56:58,803
ground and pounding him.
He's got a nasty kia team to team 

3958
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:03,260
bermuda has cracked him to the punch and
then,

3959
02:57:03,270 --> 02:57:06,470
and then snuck in that tight arm and 
guillotine.

3960
02:57:06,650 --> 02:57:09,140
He's very good.
Llamas is one of the best guys.

3961
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:10,100
But he's also,
you know,

3962
02:57:10,190 --> 02:57:11,023
34,
35 do anything for bj that [inaudible] 

3963
02:57:13,130 --> 02:57:13,963
and lama's is such a bad as he is.
So skilled that doesn't do much for bj 

3964
02:57:16,910 --> 02:57:19,070
lately.
At least a year if he wins,

3965
02:57:19,130 --> 02:57:20,000
you know,
he's young.

3966
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:23,810
that's a huge feather in his cap.
That makes more sense I guess.

3967
02:57:23,811 --> 02:57:26,540
But if bj beat,
I think if bj beat lama.

3968
02:57:26,541 --> 02:57:28,370
So it was a big feather in his calves.
Like jesus,

3969
02:57:28,371 --> 02:57:32,480
he beat a top 10 contender.
He's fought forever to us.

3970
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:34,160
But what do you mean to anybody else?
Like,

3971
02:57:34,161 --> 02:57:35,050
well,
the only thing about,

3972
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:37,160
or is it your year won the ultimate 
fighter.

3973
02:57:37,490 --> 02:57:39,620
He won the latin America ultimate 
fighter.

3974
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:42,380
Yeah.
Here's a motherfucker a motherfucker.

3975
02:57:42,410 --> 02:57:44,240
he really is.
People hate when we say that.

3976
02:57:44,241 --> 02:57:46,190
By the way,
when we stopped calling people,

3977
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:51,200
multiple crews,
he was a beast.

3978
02:57:53,090 --> 02:57:53,923
Had motherfucker need more need for 
adverbs to talk like me and my friends 

3979
02:58:01,480 --> 02:58:02,260
is

3980
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:04,380
a lot of god damn good fights on the 
horizon.

3981
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:06,990
There's a lot of potential fights.
If you're wonderboy,

3982
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:07,883
wouldn't you be pissed at all?
This woodley talk about woodley 

3983
02:58:09,331 --> 02:58:10,870
fighting.
AnybOdy else other than wonderful.

3984
02:58:10,930 --> 02:58:12,890
No one's even talking about wonderboy.
Yeah,

3985
02:58:12,910 --> 02:58:14,830
they forgot.
He started talKing shit to connor.

3986
02:58:15,570 --> 02:58:18,000
Woo.
Woo.

3987
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:20,010
I'll tell you what I'd watch.
Wonder believers.

3988
02:58:20,011 --> 02:58:21,840
Your boy tony ferguson.
Yeah,

3989
02:58:21,841 --> 02:58:23,410
but they're Just.
Well,

3990
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:25,050
I'm on joy.
Does trading now.

3991
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:27,260
Fuck way classes.
Listen,

3992
02:58:27,580 --> 02:58:32,310
cowboy has fought at 1:55,
one 70 [inaudible] fight between him and

3993
02:58:32,311 --> 02:58:34,230
tony harrison.
You guys were talking before.

3994
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:37,050
I was seeing explosions are going off in
my head.

3995
02:58:37,710 --> 02:58:41,760
That's your guy.
Henderson.

3996
02:58:42,270 --> 02:58:47,270
I always get confused,
so I did it by 19 sprays to been taken.

3997
02:58:48,220 --> 02:58:49,053
Phrases you take lead on the lord's day.
We got nowhere to be and nothing to do 

3998
02:58:53,730 --> 02:58:54,900
with the fuck.
Wow.

3999
02:58:54,901 --> 02:58:56,550
That's pretty scary as well.
It's tremendous.

4000
02:58:56,551 --> 02:58:58,290
I wrote them an email.
they wrote me back.

4001
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,030
The nice people.
I've got to go up to the stop.

4002
02:59:00,730 --> 02:59:02,760
Get some more from them,
but some strong shit.

4003
02:59:02,761 --> 02:59:03,594
Huh?

4004
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:05,993
Listen man,
if you guys are talking about we need 

4005
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:09,560
for a billion dollars when he fights.
This isn't it.

4006
02:59:09,670 --> 02:59:11,420
These are all the fights are going to 
have to do now.

4007
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:15,540
Going to say fuck weight class and just 
making the biggest weight classes.

4008
02:59:15,541 --> 02:59:17,430
Everybody has to respect the weight 
classes.

4009
02:59:17,431 --> 02:59:19,350
But uh,
go up.

4010
02:59:19,351 --> 02:59:21,210
If you want to go up,
if you think you could run with it,

4011
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:24,630
run with it.
You got to convince dana the same way.

4012
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:29,340
A kind of convinced they have some of 
them jumbos have some of those brave.

4013
02:59:30,090 --> 02:59:31,710
One of these.
Exactly.

4014
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:34,940
Can't see without my glasses to read 
them to me.

4015
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:38,520
Jumbos.
It's a fucking super powerful edible to,

4016
02:59:38,521 --> 02:59:40,770
to cookie dough truffles.
Yeah.

4017
02:59:41,050 --> 02:59:41,883
To tell you,
hey,

4018
02:59:41,930 --> 02:59:43,850
gluten free,
gluten free,

4019
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:47,970
and I can go hang out with my faggy 
friends.

4020
02:59:50,530 --> 02:59:52,770
Hang out,
go find that guy was going to suck.

4021
02:59:52,771 --> 02:59:56,430
Your dick doesn't take a smell.
THat organic.

4022
02:59:56,550 --> 02:59:59,550
He makes them with honey.
That's so good.

4023
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:01,920
How many it tastes good.
District death.

4024
03:00:02,790 --> 03:00:05,340
All the above.
Read the strength of straight to the end

4025
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:07,540
of the earth.
It doesn't say on there.

4026
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,673
It tastes like dig.
Why does it taste like dick to organic 

4027
03:00:12,931 --> 03:00:14,730
for you?
Chose you step process.

4028
03:00:14,731 --> 03:00:16,500
Sure.
It doesn't say how much is in there.

4029
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:17,393
Exactly meant that as a compliment.
They don't even want you to know is 

4030
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:21,480
either truffle and he needed a boost of 
energy.

4031
03:00:24,750 --> 03:00:26,940
What does it say about milligrams thc?
It doesn't say it.

4032
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:27,900
Hm.
Interesting.

4033
03:00:28,460 --> 03:00:30,600
I feel like that's something you need to
know.

4034
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:33,810
right?
I feel like that's important,

4035
03:00:34,090 --> 03:00:37,530
but this one says 25 milligrams.
Maybe I'll give you the wrong one.

4036
03:00:38,400 --> 03:00:41,080
This is pretty light.
Twenty five is not that bad for you.

4037
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:42,900
That's nothing.
Twenty five milligrams.

4038
03:00:44,460 --> 03:00:45,630
1,200
last week.

4039
03:00:46,030 --> 03:00:48,120
Scam.
This one's 100,

4040
03:00:48,121 --> 03:00:51,810
but I think there's two of them in new 
edible called this is 200 feet.

4041
03:00:51,811 --> 03:00:52,620
The two of them.
Listen,

4042
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:54,930
there's a thing called moon.
Okay.

4043
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:59,650
It's a chocolate bar.
It's 10 fucking dollars pen.

4044
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:02,710
Donald's called moon.
I've beaten them twice.

4045
03:01:02,830 --> 03:01:04,900
How long have you known me?
A long tIme.

4046
03:01:05,010 --> 03:01:06,010
20 years.
Both times.

4047
03:01:06,011 --> 03:01:08,680
The next day I could not go to jujitsu 
much.

4048
03:01:09,070 --> 03:01:10,600
I didn't do much the next day.
That strong.

4049
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:13,060
What'd you do?
I ate the whole box.

4050
03:01:13,290 --> 03:01:15,220
And then what happened?
Dog.

4051
03:01:15,221 --> 03:01:19,390
You got to see pictures of me.
How many milligrams is at 250.

4052
03:01:19,391 --> 03:01:23,410
But they're lying to you.
Definitely to which I like.

4053
03:01:23,411 --> 03:01:24,244
I like being like,
I don't want to know what I'm eating 

4054
03:01:27,570 --> 03:01:28,403
for.
I saw pictures of me and like I got hit 

4055
03:01:29,561 --> 03:01:34,561
by new fudge.
That rocket fudge,

4056
03:01:35,860 --> 03:01:37,750
that shit will fucking kill you.

4057
03:01:37,750 --> 03:01:41,530
And here's the beauty that you go into 
these places and they have all these $40

4058
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:46,580
edibles and they have all these 10.
This is 10 fucking dollars.

4059
03:01:47,860 --> 03:01:50,830
You eat a half of that thing and you'll 
be drooling.

4060
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:54,450
And I gOt a better one.
There's one,

4061
03:01:55,180 --> 03:01:56,013
there's one called cushy.
They have 50 milligram or 100 and then 

4062
03:01:59,951 --> 03:02:04,951
they have knocked out and listen to me.
It says it will activate in 60 minutes.

4063
03:02:06,490 --> 03:02:09,730
GuaranTee,
here's the thing about this is jamie,

4064
03:02:10,210 --> 03:02:10,780
jamie,
you,

4065
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:14,290
it comes into punch that's super potent,
the,

4066
03:02:14,291 --> 03:02:17,740
the fucking uh,
worries and the recovery one,

4067
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:19,023
but they've got one that is so fucking 
strong and I call it transmission fluid 

4068
03:02:24,100 --> 03:02:25,830
because when you open it up,
it comes to like a,

4069
03:02:25,850 --> 03:02:26,450
you know,
but you know,

4070
03:02:26,450 --> 03:02:28,150
you ever go eat breakfast,
the bundled packages,

4071
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:29,313
you have to rip them open the life and 
the comes on one of those and they chop 

4072
03:02:32,321 --> 03:02:35,350
it in fours figure,
okay me,

4073
03:02:35,351 --> 03:02:36,850
I'm a guy.
I ate the whole bowl.

4074
03:02:36,851 --> 03:02:37,684
When You peel the top off and you smell 
it and she like you walking into a 

4075
03:02:41,411 --> 03:02:45,220
transmission shop like,
that's exactly where is it?

4076
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:47,860
Not that high bred.
Not to get into k o,

4077
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:49,550
t,
k o bitCh.

4078
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:56,920
Oh my god.
Super potent gummy formula.

4079
03:02:57,280 --> 03:03:02,280
That's for high tones users.
Oh man,

4080
03:03:03,461 --> 03:03:05,500
it's a weird time because it's all legal
now.

4081
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:07,720
Now that it's legal,
you're going to see what these dudes can

4082
03:03:07,721 --> 03:03:08,650
do.
You know,

4083
03:03:08,651 --> 03:03:09,484
because they're going to have to be held
back though because I think there's 

4084
03:03:12,281 --> 03:03:14,950
regulations on the potency of edibles 
now.

4085
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:18,130
Is there,
I think you Just have to let people know

4086
03:03:18,131 --> 03:03:19,510
what's in them.
I think it's 10.

4087
03:03:19,570 --> 03:03:20,410
10.
Yeah,

4088
03:03:20,411 --> 03:03:22,420
so you can adjust.
Each one will be 10.

4089
03:03:22,570 --> 03:03:26,590
Like in denver they were selling these 
like containers of 10.

4090
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:27,593
It was 100 milligrams and they were 
these gum drops and each one of them is 

4091
03:03:29,981 --> 03:03:32,470
10.
They're pretty consistent but,

4092
03:03:32,530 --> 03:03:35,800
but not totally consistent.
Like I ate one.

4093
03:03:35,801 --> 03:03:36,401
I was like,
yeah,

4094
03:03:36,401 --> 03:03:37,234
it feels like 10.
And then another one that felt like 40 

4095
03:03:39,221 --> 03:03:40,480
or 50.
I was like,

4096
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:41,323
ooh,
this one,

4097
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:43,030
they don't have the real numbers.

4098
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:43,953
Not if you bring that cushy to you and 
I'll make you eat the whole thing and 

4099
03:03:46,931 --> 03:03:48,970
you'll go joey,
that's not 100 milligrams.

4100
03:03:49,050 --> 03:03:51,220
they lied to us.
That's the case.

4101
03:03:51,221 --> 03:03:52,054
often though.
I mean like it's hard to get real 

4102
03:03:54,101 --> 03:03:54,934
accurate testing.
And then also like who's doing the 

4103
03:03:57,050 --> 03:04:00,840
actual making and blend akin to 
measurements.

4104
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:02,910
Like tomorrow I pick up my shipment,
the attic,

4105
03:04:02,911 --> 03:04:05,270
he edibles.
Those are my home run my shipment.

4106
03:04:05,570 --> 03:04:10,380
Every monday,
every monday before jujitsu,

4107
03:04:10,430 --> 03:04:13,280
about 10:45,
he gives me 100,

4108
03:04:13,350 --> 03:04:15,260
200 milligrams,
100 red ones.

4109
03:04:15,261 --> 03:04:16,094
And a couple brownies brownies away to 
my friends and I keep those for the 

4110
03:04:19,221 --> 03:04:20,054
podcast when I fly and shit like that.
But then you have to get used to the 

4111
03:04:23,601 --> 03:04:25,530
same strain.
It's like marijuana.

4112
03:04:25,531 --> 03:04:27,410
If you smoke the same training for three
days,

4113
03:04:27,650 --> 03:04:30,130
it's not going to get you as high as the
first day because you're telling them to

4114
03:04:30,170 --> 03:04:31,500
build to that strange.

4115
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:35,090
So I make some match bitch.
I'm the only ones that allowed to mr.

4116
03:04:35,210 --> 03:04:38,030
Uncle joe is neighborhood a cushy,
cushy,

4117
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:43,540
the tko brilliant fucking brilliant.
But that new rocket pocket,

4118
03:04:44,310 --> 03:04:47,990
that rocket chocolate,
that shit dog twice.

4119
03:04:47,991 --> 03:04:50,810
I read them already and I'm telling you 
the next day I get up,

4120
03:04:50,811 --> 03:04:52,880
I take the baby to school,
I ride a little bit.

4121
03:04:53,270 --> 03:04:55,430
I'm like 10:30.
Then nothing going on.

4122
03:04:55,460 --> 03:04:57,800
I got to go right back to bed for four 
or five hours.

4123
03:04:57,810 --> 03:05:02,510
Don't fucked up the next day.
There's gonna be a time in our lifetimes

4124
03:05:02,511 --> 03:05:05,390
where they start passing medical 
psilocybin.

4125
03:05:05,900 --> 03:05:08,690
It's going to happen.
And when they have medical psilocybin,

4126
03:05:08,691 --> 03:05:11,330
eventually they're going to go with 
recreational psilocybin.

4127
03:05:11,570 --> 03:05:13,330
And when they go with recreational 
suicide,

4128
03:05:13,331 --> 03:05:15,410
when we're going to see a different 
world,

4129
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:17,180
it's going to be a different fucking 
world.

4130
03:05:17,181 --> 03:05:19,250
But the same benefits that you've seen 
with marijuana,

4131
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:22,450
the difference being that marijuana,
at least when you're smoking it,

4132
03:05:22,451 --> 03:05:26,510
it's easier to regulate the experiences 
and so world changing and dissolving.

4133
03:05:27,050 --> 03:05:28,970
But we're gonna.
We're gonna have freedom.

4134
03:05:29,330 --> 03:05:30,650
It'S not,
it's not here yet,

4135
03:05:30,710 --> 03:05:33,620
but it's here now for pot in a way 
that's never been before.

4136
03:05:33,650 --> 03:05:34,483
I mean,
you think once a big pharma goes 100 

4137
03:05:37,911 --> 03:05:38,744
percent in a cannabis,
what kinds of things do you think 

4138
03:05:42,591 --> 03:05:45,440
they'll do to squeeze out the small 
guys?

4139
03:05:45,441 --> 03:05:46,700
Because I,
you know what I mean?

4140
03:05:46,730 --> 03:05:47,730
They've already done it.
They tried.

4141
03:05:48,710 --> 03:05:50,000
They could make it.
Okay.

4142
03:05:50,001 --> 03:05:52,250
Now it's legal,
but we're the only ones that get.

4143
03:05:52,770 --> 03:05:55,340
Jamie wanted me to sell it if you're on 
your own,

4144
03:05:55,341 --> 03:05:57,590
was that deal in Ohio and that seems 
like,

4145
03:05:57,800 --> 03:06:00,500
like what's going to happen eventually?
The big businesses,

4146
03:06:00,980 --> 03:06:03,620
they're going to squeeze everybody out.
You're going to pass regulation.

4147
03:06:03,621 --> 03:06:04,311
JaMie?
Yeah.

4148
03:06:04,311 --> 03:06:05,144
They were trying to like lock down.
Like I think it was like for coMpAnies 

4149
03:06:08,251 --> 03:06:09,084
that would have been able to grow,
it'll grow or sell or I think it was in 

4150
03:06:12,111 --> 03:06:13,620
perpetuity forever.

4151
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:18,560
That's what we're going to deal with 
people like a regular person.

4152
03:06:18,561 --> 03:06:21,380
there's money in regular people.
Can they make like sick?

4153
03:06:21,381 --> 03:06:23,120
Can they start their own cigarette 
companies?

4154
03:06:23,300 --> 03:06:24,320
Exactly.
Can they do that?

4155
03:06:24,490 --> 03:06:25,700
Right?
It's a good question.

4156
03:06:25,710 --> 03:06:27,290
Getting to the cigarette company.
No,

4157
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:28,580
I think they,
they,

4158
03:06:28,581 --> 03:06:29,271
uh,
I dunno,

4159
03:06:29,271 --> 03:06:30,104
I don't know anything about it,
but I don't hear about people making 

4160
03:06:32,391 --> 03:06:33,224
their own cigarettes.
You make your own wines and make your 

4161
03:06:34,851 --> 03:06:35,684
own cigarettes.
If you buy your own tobacco and you can 

4162
03:06:36,861 --> 03:06:37,694
roll your own.
But as far as like going into large 

4163
03:06:39,081 --> 03:06:40,040
scale production,
yeah,

4164
03:06:40,041 --> 03:06:41,170
you're probably right.
Yeah.

4165
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:43,130
The thing when you think about the 
marijuana thing,

4166
03:06:43,131 --> 03:06:45,860
it's like you already know how easy it 
is to grow you fucks,

4167
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:47,990
you know,
the fact that they tried to lock it down

4168
03:06:47,991 --> 03:06:50,360
and make it so only a few companies can 
grow it,

4169
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:53,240
make it legal,
but only a few people can profit off it.

4170
03:06:53,241 --> 03:06:56,010
That's crazy.
And then then they make it so god

4171
03:06:56,090 --> 03:06:59,550
cheaped at that you've grown yourself 
and trying to sell it yourself.

4172
03:06:59,551 --> 03:07:00,384
Just,
it just doesn't become an option 

4173
03:07:01,831 --> 03:07:02,820
anymore.
They're not.

4174
03:07:02,821 --> 03:07:04,080
People just say fuck it,
you know,

4175
03:07:04,081 --> 03:07:07,590
they're just going to get cheap ass weed
at the liquor store,

4176
03:07:07,591 --> 03:07:08,424
at the gas station.
And they're just after a generation or 

4177
03:07:10,801 --> 03:07:11,634
two people forget it.
It'll be like a kind of sewer thing in 

4178
03:07:14,101 --> 03:07:15,900
the fucking 70,
60 minutes.

4179
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:19,830
Did a show one time and they showed that
all already in the seventies.

4180
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:23,130
The cigarette companies already had 
farms set up.

4181
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,920
They were already working on the 
packaging.

4182
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:27,600
Oh yeah,
in the seventies,

4183
03:07:27,601 --> 03:07:29,030
they were already trying to legalize 
them.

4184
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:30,810
The cigarette companies were already in 
on it.

4185
03:07:31,410 --> 03:07:32,243
Right now we don't think all these 
fucking cigarette companies are setting 

4186
03:07:34,441 --> 03:07:36,510
up that Kentucky was that.
We're from Kentucky.

4187
03:07:36,511 --> 03:07:37,970
That's really good.
Kentucky,

4188
03:07:37,971 --> 03:07:39,870
uh,
they have a weaving can,

4189
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:40,753
like I'll ask guys like matt neufeld fun
to fuck Kentucky has like that blue 

4190
03:07:45,990 --> 03:07:47,430
grass family.

4191
03:07:47,540 --> 03:07:49,320
I went up there.
Once somebody brought me that weed,

4192
03:07:49,650 --> 03:07:50,483
they're going to package all those the 
same way they package poco gold member 

4193
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:54,413
gold.
And I think there'll be a marlboro 

4194
03:07:56,850 --> 03:07:57,683
cannabis dirty get involved in.
I guess we have a mutual friend his 

4195
03:08:01,081 --> 03:08:01,914
name,
but he's in the marijuana business 

4196
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:04,170
account.
No,

4197
03:08:04,260 --> 03:08:06,730
I wish.
But uh,

4198
03:08:06,990 --> 03:08:07,823
he was saying that that's the issues 
that those big cigarette companies are 

4199
03:08:10,681 --> 03:08:13,890
buying up so much shit to make it hard 
for other people get involved in.

4200
03:08:14,490 --> 03:08:15,323
Yeah.
Like they already have their hand in 

4201
03:08:18,540 --> 03:08:23,540
something that's selling like hotcakes.
Eventually the small,

4202
03:08:24,450 --> 03:08:27,400
the small man gets cut out.
Right?

4203
03:08:27,480 --> 03:08:28,890
Yeah.
It happens a lot.

4204
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:29,793
Certainly happens a lot.
Whenever there's anything regulations 

4205
03:08:33,210 --> 03:08:34,043
where you know they can profit and they 
can use their influence and fuck over 

4206
03:08:37,561 --> 03:08:38,990
people.
That also could probably relate.

4207
03:08:39,050 --> 03:08:43,110
The problem with pot is it's so god damn
easy to grow that if they don't do that,

4208
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:44,430
anybody could step in.

4209
03:08:44,610 --> 03:08:48,240
But what they were trying to do in Ohio,
lock it down for perpetuity forever.

4210
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:49,193
You know,
that these companies could be the only 

4211
03:08:50,251 --> 03:08:52,890
ones they're set up.
They're setting up monarchies.

4212
03:08:54,230 --> 03:08:54,781
Common.
No,

4213
03:08:54,781 --> 03:08:56,880
that's not you.
We haven't heard the end of that shit.

4214
03:08:56,881 --> 03:08:57,870
Hell no.
That's coming.

4215
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:59,003
Well,
it's gonna be interesting when trump's 

4216
03:08:59,641 --> 03:09:00,474
the president now see where they go with
all this because that jeff sessions got 

4217
03:09:02,871 --> 03:09:04,950
that.
He's bringing in that guy hates box.

4218
03:09:04,980 --> 03:09:07,170
They're not going to let these hippies 
make millions of dollars.

4219
03:09:07,171 --> 03:09:08,004
That's only going to last.
These are going to be considered the 

4220
03:09:09,211 --> 03:09:10,044
good old days.
They're going to wish you was never 

4221
03:09:11,851 --> 03:09:13,830
legal.
Who knows?

4222
03:09:14,040 --> 03:09:16,140
We're going to find out.
It's going to be interesting to.

4223
03:09:16,170 --> 03:09:17,970
Trump has said that he's going to leave 
it up to the states,

4224
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:21,330
but presidents always say shit that they
don't do.

4225
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:23,760
I mean obama was going to close down 
guantanamo bay.

4226
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,070
That motherfucker still open eight years
later.

4227
03:09:26,130 --> 03:09:29,520
He never even made an attempt at it.
I think sometimes they say that stuff.

4228
03:09:29,521 --> 03:09:31,110
They don't realize how much work goes 
into it.

4229
03:09:31,111 --> 03:09:31,891
Right.
Well,

4230
03:09:31,891 --> 03:09:32,724
I think they say that and then they get 
into office and then they get handed 

4231
03:09:35,881 --> 03:09:39,920
some dossiers and some fucking briefings
and they understand like he went like,

4232
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:41,700
this is why we haven't done like,
look,

4233
03:09:41,701 --> 03:09:42,534
I know you were saying you're going to 
close down [inaudible] bay because it 

4234
03:09:45,031 --> 03:09:45,864
helps your campaign,
but we're going to get you in here and 

4235
03:09:46,801 --> 03:09:49,090
show you what the fuck those guys.
They didn't sit them down.

4236
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:52,770
They knew that shit way before they knew
what they were getting into.

4237
03:09:52,910 --> 03:09:56,110
Maybe the only reason they were allowed 
to rise so high.

4238
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:58,570
I think they say a bunch of shit to get 
in the office.

4239
03:09:58,571 --> 03:10:00,400
They say whatever the fuck they don't 
know for sure.

4240
03:10:00,401 --> 03:10:01,234
They lie their ass off.
Like everything that comes out of like 

4241
03:10:02,410 --> 03:10:04,730
hillary's mouth.
I mean like do you watch house of cards?

4242
03:10:04,940 --> 03:10:08,410
It was like a george w dot bush.
Like everything that George W.

4243
03:10:08,410 --> 03:10:11,410
Bush says when he talks got damn we got 
into conspiracies are bullshit.

4244
03:10:11,411 --> 03:10:14,350
Meter doesn't go off right?
Well he didn't even get to the part.

4245
03:10:14,380 --> 03:10:18,950
Tell them about admin.
The can see.

4246
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:19,960
I hate though.

4247
03:10:23,060 --> 03:10:25,540
Maybe that's the key.
So let's end it.

4248
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:27,130
It's a,
it's 8:10.

4249
03:10:27,190 --> 03:10:28,690
This is a good fucking podcast,
man.

4250
03:10:28,691 --> 03:10:30,310
Happy new year.
Happy to see you man.

4251
03:10:32,560 --> 03:10:34,510
Thank you times.
Ladies and gentlemen.

4252
03:10:34,720 --> 03:10:35,553
We'll be back tomorrow with a hashtag 
who is fat week thompson and bert 

4253
03:10:39,131 --> 03:10:41,650
kreischer weighing tomorrow at 11:00
AM.

4254
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:45,220
They've been losing weight for months 
now.

4255
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:49,290
And tom is right writing hashtag 
[inaudible] fat burn right in.

4256
03:10:49,310 --> 03:10:50,143
Hashtag thomas fat.
Tom and I both started out at about two 

4257
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:55,720
67 in that range.
And now,

4258
03:10:55,721 --> 03:10:56,530
uh,
they're,

4259
03:10:56,530 --> 03:10:58,300
they're fucking light.
I can't wait to see.

4260
03:10:58,510 --> 03:11:01,360
Tom looks fantastic.
Tom's only been drinking water.

4261
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:02,800
That's it.
He doesn't even drink.

4262
03:11:02,801 --> 03:11:03,634
Soda.
Doesn't drink diet soda doesn't drink 

4263
03:11:05,261 --> 03:11:06,094
coffee anymore.
He's just drinking water to my favorite 

4264
03:11:08,351 --> 03:11:09,610
people.
Super disciplined.

4265
03:11:09,611 --> 03:11:12,250
He looks fucking great.
She'd see the videos of his face.

4266
03:11:12,650 --> 03:11:17,650
But can we see that real quick before we
go secure as instagram before you leave?

4267
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:19,740
Because he's got a real funny video.
We'll,

4268
03:11:19,770 --> 03:11:23,710
we'll leave it on this and then we'll 
show one at burt's to balance it out.

4269
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:24,753
But thompson is instagram.
There's a video of him talking to the 

4270
03:11:27,161 --> 03:11:27,994
cameras because burt put this video of 
he ran for five and a half hours and 

4271
03:11:32,531 --> 03:11:36,100
lost like 3000 fucking calories because 
birth is savage.

4272
03:11:36,130 --> 03:11:40,120
I mean he's a psychopath psycho.
He's not the discipline guy that tom is.

4273
03:11:40,121 --> 03:11:42,880
Tom is more slow and steady wins the 
race and bert is like,

4274
03:11:42,881 --> 03:11:47,250
I will run to like die right now.
I went to his house for christmas eve or

4275
03:11:47,290 --> 03:11:50,940
christmas day with the kids.
He's a burly girl,

4276
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:52,053
was a kid.
Then when he was outside the sauna and 

4277
03:11:55,061 --> 03:11:56,830
they were like,
get in there and I can't.

4278
03:11:56,831 --> 03:11:57,664
Right.
So it looks homey that tom go to tom 

4279
03:12:00,270 --> 03:12:05,110
[inaudible] is going on like a fucking.
He starved himself right now.

4280
03:12:05,470 --> 03:12:10,470
I'm looking at the play that I saw a old
ass birds

4281
03:12:13,450 --> 03:12:17,440
instagram and you fucking suckers 
believe in it.

4282
03:12:17,441 --> 03:12:19,900
That's called playing catch up.
Catch up,

4283
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:24,220
have covered so many more miles in you 
have in this beautiful,

4284
03:12:24,221 --> 03:12:25,600
perfect fucking beard.

4285
03:12:25,860 --> 03:12:27,940
You shaved the beard,
man.

4286
03:12:27,990 --> 03:12:29,580
You should run all night.
I don't want to see

4287
03:12:30,930 --> 03:12:34,050
run every day.
Don't even have to fucking run anymore.

4288
03:12:34,051 --> 03:12:39,051
I already had your ass beat.
He looks great already.

4289
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:44,670
I'm heading the game and I am watching a
fucking bowl game because I know I wait.

4290
03:12:44,671 --> 03:12:45,120
List

4291
03:12:45,120 --> 03:12:50,120
you fat motherfucker.
Look how good he looks.

4292
03:12:50,870 --> 03:12:52,010
Great.
Let's go to a bird

4293
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:52,320
here.

4294
03:12:52,320 --> 03:12:53,153
Has to talk to tom the other day and I 
told him I'm turning on the nitrous 

4295
03:12:55,541 --> 03:12:59,500
oxide to this weight loss challenge.
I want to see what the nitrous oxide is.

4296
03:13:00,130 --> 03:13:05,130
Twenty two miles.
God done five hours and 23 minutes.

4297
03:13:06,550 --> 03:13:08,530
How many calories?
3,000.

4298
03:13:08,531 --> 03:13:11,680
Two hundred and 66 at an average of 
four.

4299
03:13:11,681 --> 03:13:12,514
Point one.
This is that mickey mantle gene and I 

4300
03:13:14,321 --> 03:13:15,154
always talk about that long strand dna.
That part of your brain that won't let 

4301
03:13:19,091 --> 03:13:19,924
you quit.
It forces you to go that extra 22 miles 

4302
03:13:22,571 --> 03:13:25,420
to make sure you don't lose your beard 
will be weighing in.

4303
03:13:25,421 --> 03:13:27,700
Live on youtube,
on joe rogan's podcast,

4304
03:13:27,701 --> 03:13:30,190
the joe rogan experience,
January 2nd or January 3rd.

4305
03:13:30,191 --> 03:13:32,710
Tune in to find out who loses their 
beard.

4306
03:13:32,711 --> 03:13:35,500
I can tell you one thing,
it won't be the guy killing it.

4307
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:38,560
It'll be the guy laying in bed watching 
a ballgame right now,

4308
03:13:39,320 --> 03:13:42,790
a big tummy bonds.
I hope you got a sponsorship from dollar

4309
03:13:42,791 --> 03:13:46,210
shave club because I'm coming and I'm 
coming for your beard.

4310
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:51,120
I love those guys.
It's hilarious,

4311
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:52,013
but honestly it's going to be real 
interesting to see whether burt's 

4312
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:56,363
craziness can balance out tom's 
discipline because tom has been 

4313
03:14:00,541 --> 03:14:02,490
disciplined for a long time.
Man.

4314
03:14:02,970 --> 03:14:04,370
I've been watching him.
He.

4315
03:14:04,430 --> 03:14:07,380
He does an hour of fucking cardio every 
day.

4316
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:10,320
Every day.
He's not taking any days off.

4317
03:14:10,410 --> 03:14:12,290
he's not drinking at all.
eating at all.

4318
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:15,450
Births been drinking this whole time.
Burt still drinking.

4319
03:14:15,750 --> 03:14:18,120
You don't think he drank last night.
It was new year's eve,

4320
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:22,490
you know a couple of cocktails,
a cup of vodka sodas and it just figures

4321
03:14:22,491 --> 03:14:23,324
it.
I'll just find out what a vodka soda is 

4322
03:14:24,420 --> 03:14:26,970
and I'll burn that off on the treadmill.
Yeah.

4323
03:14:28,010 --> 03:14:28,843
Yeah.
Was I supposed to be water skinny bitch 

4324
03:14:32,780 --> 03:14:34,070
water?
It's kind of.

4325
03:14:34,290 --> 03:14:38,880
It's really a vodka tonic or vodka.
Soda water.

4326
03:14:39,390 --> 03:14:41,610
They call it skinny bitch.
Yeah,

4327
03:14:41,820 --> 03:14:43,200
man.
Really interesting.

4328
03:14:43,230 --> 03:14:45,330
He always does his shirts with his sets.

4329
03:14:47,130 --> 03:14:49,260
He does.
He takes his shirt off like seconds into

4330
03:14:49,261 --> 03:14:50,094
being on stage,
but it's funny because he's skinny or 

4331
03:14:52,801 --> 03:14:54,660
because he's fat,
like if he gets skinny,

4332
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:59,940
you can't just take your shirt off and 
be jack because he's a big fella.

4333
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:01,013
He put something.
He put a picture of this guy wrote a 

4334
03:15:02,491 --> 03:15:04,230
comic on that.
Maybe you'd had a bit of.

4335
03:15:04,380 --> 03:15:06,060
Don't hang that on the mic and makes 
noise.

4336
03:15:06,150 --> 03:15:06,781
Oh,
I remember that.

4337
03:15:06,781 --> 03:15:08,430
You knew.
Had a bit about that.

4338
03:15:08,431 --> 03:15:13,060
These comments that people write when 
the fuck did they get off these?

4339
03:15:13,290 --> 03:15:16,560
There was just one on there that he's 
just making a statement that guys like,

4340
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:17,843
you can't find a shirt that fits you.
What the fuck do these people get all 

4341
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:23,160
retarded fucking life.
These people don't.

4342
03:15:23,190 --> 03:15:27,830
That's why they're sad fucking world to 
live in when you just.

4343
03:15:27,960 --> 03:15:28,793
I remember oNe day duncan sent me a a 
thing that he did when I read it shit 

4344
03:15:33,360 --> 03:15:34,193
and a bunch of people and they were like
talking to you about like fat comics 

4345
03:15:37,800 --> 03:15:38,633
that they shouldn't that one.
Have you ever seen the successful fat 

4346
03:15:41,551 --> 03:15:43,070
comIc?
Spent up?

4347
03:15:43,080 --> 03:15:45,240
Fucking shitload of them,
and I was reading this going,

4348
03:15:45,241 --> 03:15:46,820
what planet?
Oh,

4349
03:15:46,830 --> 03:15:48,430
you fuck.
Just dark people.

4350
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:49,980
Sam fat

4351
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:52,120
is all korean candy balloon.
Yo,

4352
03:15:52,250 --> 03:15:53,430
what the fuck?
Yeah.

4353
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:55,660
Anyway,

4354
03:15:56,190 --> 03:15:58,110
man,
remember when you were 16?

4355
03:15:58,111 --> 03:16:01,650
You were mcginn gay dudes.
If you had an instagram account,

4356
03:16:01,651 --> 03:16:03,010
you'd probably be talking shit to 
thompson.

4357
03:16:03,190 --> 03:16:05,450
The same thing.
The same thing do.

4358
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:08,550
I had a guy and it's very real.
I ever get back to him.

4359
03:16:08,820 --> 03:16:11,070
This guy said something just ruthless,
and I was like,

4360
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:13,320
god damn it.
I clicked on his profile and it's him.

4361
03:16:13,321 --> 03:16:16,110
A picture of him holding his daughter so
I just can't.

4362
03:16:16,111 --> 03:16:17,130
I said,

4363
03:16:17,610 --> 03:16:19,410

4364
03:16:19,411 --> 03:16:20,400

He might hit me.

4365
03:16:20,550 --> 03:16:24,030
Don't be that loser comment.
Another man's fucking instagram page.

4366

EverYbody likes to come.

4369
03:16:31,940 --> 03:16:33,830
You're morons.
Morons like to comment.

4370
03:16:33,860 --> 03:16:36,410
They can make a kid.
It's just a bummer.

4371
03:16:37,850 --> 03:16:40,670
That's the end,
but he's in gentlemen will be a moron.

4372
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:41,960
Don't be a moron,
but you know what,

4373
03:16:41,961 --> 03:16:43,670
man?
this whole being a moron thing,

4374
03:16:43,671 --> 03:16:48,320
even that it's temporary and it's like 
we're coming to a head.

4375
03:16:48,350 --> 03:16:49,760
It's,
it's not far away.

4376
03:16:49,761 --> 03:16:51,800
Folks.
There will be integration.

4377
03:16:51,830 --> 03:16:55,490
All of Us will be connected in some 
strange hive mind and we're about Five,

4378
03:16:55,700 --> 03:16:56,533
maybe 10 years away from it.
It won't be as simple as like send a 

4379
03:16:59,301 --> 03:17:02,210
fuCking tweet or anything.
It's going to go right to your brain and

4380
03:17:02,211 --> 03:17:03,044
everyone's going to be aware that you 
did it and they're all going to be able 

4381
03:17:04,521 --> 03:17:05,354
to go back at you and we're going to 
share information in a way that's just 

4382
03:17:08,421 --> 03:17:12,710
as weird to us today as the internet was
30 years ago.

4383
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:13,573
Nobody ever thought you'd have to deal 
with this shit mecha back when rick 

4384
03:17:15,951 --> 03:17:18,420
james was a fucking on top of the world 
today,

4385
03:17:18,430 --> 03:17:20,930
you think you would add a d,
w look at his instagram page like,

4386
03:17:20,931 --> 03:17:22,100
what the fuck are they saying?
Oh,

4387
03:17:22,101 --> 03:17:22,934
rick james.
It was a weird time when everybody can 

4388
03:17:25,431 --> 03:17:26,750
just talk to you.
They're going to be.

4389
03:17:26,751 --> 03:17:27,584
It's going to be more than that.
The next level is go right into your 

4390
03:17:29,751 --> 03:17:30,950
brain.
I don't like that.

4391
03:17:31,010 --> 03:17:32,450
I don't like it either,
but it's happening.

4392
03:17:32,930 --> 03:17:35,660
Deal with it.
Bitch tomorrow.

4393
03:17:35,661 --> 03:17:36,980
Who is hashtag?
Who is fat?

4394
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:39,380
Starts at 11:00
AM pacific time.

4395
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:41,870
Uh,
