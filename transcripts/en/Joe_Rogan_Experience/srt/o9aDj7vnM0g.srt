6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,973
Oh my God.

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,350

Here we go.

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,000
Joe Diaz is in the motherfucking house.

17
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,013
Oh yeah.

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
[inaudible]

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,750
a lot of people been complaining
that this is lame music.

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,011
A lot of people.

21
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,150
Yeah,

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,691
and saying,

23
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,021
you know,

24
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:04,021
this song is just not befitting
of such a fucking dynamic podcast.

25
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,820
Why you got some fucking fruity
tooty tunes playing there?

26
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:07,654
Why don't you got some?

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,471
Because we don't want,

28
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:08,831
first of all,

29
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,080
we don't want the song
to overshadow the show.

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,910
What if the song is better than the show?

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,421
And you're like,

32
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:17,170
why don't you fuck stop talking and
play some more of that groovy music you

33
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:21,880
would just hitting me with Joe Diaz
is in the mother fucking house,

34
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,680
bitches,

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,200
baby.

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
That's all you need to know.

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,010
Forget about that Goddamn opening music.

38
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:27,910
Don't be tripping.

39
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,700
Don't beat Paul.

40
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,130
Don't get Joe Shit to give a kid.

41
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,160
The best is when somebody complains about
that song and then they send you their

42
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,120
like keyboard.

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,033
Oh,

44
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,430
there's songs of Daphne and they'll
send it to you a thousand times and kids

45
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:45,430
just like case you didn't get it the
first 50,000 times when I sent it.

46
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,540
This is a new one.

47
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:46,661
I've,

48
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:46,841
I've,

49
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:46,921
I've,

50
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,080
I've,

51
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,250
I've,

52
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,820
I've put some echo to the drums.

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,571
It's a little bit different.

54
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:49,751
No,

55
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,310
it's great.

56
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,760
That's great.

57
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,660
Did you dude?

58
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,050
Dude,

59
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,140
dude to too,

60
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,790
I'm ready to leave Joe Diaz.

61
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,320
If this fucking earthquake comes,

62
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,041
I'm gone.

63
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:57,700
Baby.

64
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,340
Back to the mountains with the full posse.

65
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,260
Load them up in the Lexus.

66
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:06,880
Leave everything behind how
little locations in this country.

67
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,930
You got San Francisco,

68
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,764
Oregon,

69
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,360
California and Nashville.

70
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:12,070
One of the points is the fault on that.

71
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:12,400
We,

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,581
well,

73
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,331
there's other faults.

74
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,410
There's a fault near New York,

75
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:14,991
right?

76
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,060
Does the Fort New York,

77
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,690
yeah.

78
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,081
There's,

79
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,280
there's a bunch of false man.

80
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:18,930
It's like the,

81
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,661
here's the deal.

82
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,081
Honestly,

83
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:20,920
we know what,

84
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,660
what moves on a regular basis.

85
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:22,841
If it,

86
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,280
that doesn't preclude things from,

87
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,330
from moving on,

88
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,690
uh,

89
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,080
you know,

90
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,010
unique basis.

91
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,530
There could be some fucking
new shit that happens anyway.

92
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:29,861
We don't,

93
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,000
we don't have this shit wired.

94
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,200
We don't know what the hell is going on.

95
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,320
There's some recent study with these
scientists are going to drill into the

96
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,080
earth's mantle all the way
through the fucking core.

97
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,390
It's going to take five to try
to figure out how to do it.

98
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,100
It's like they're like little kids.

99
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,761
It's like,

100
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,370
well we know we can't use a
regular drill because it'll melt,

101
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:45,761
you know,

102
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,400
so they're trying to figure out how
the fuck they're going to get a drill.

103
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,740
The drills all the way down to
the mat and you ask them why,

104
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,280
what are you doing?

105
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,641
You're going to,

106
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:52,990
is there a leprechauns down there?

107
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,190
They're going to give you gold.

108
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,570
What's going on is
they're aliens down there.

109
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,440
They're going to suck your Dick.

110
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,423
What are you doing?

111
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Why are you drilling down to the mantle?

112
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,990
Because people are silly fucks
and we just want to see what's up.

113
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,100
We just want to see what's up.

114
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,410
We want to try what's up.

115
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,530
Sometimes you got to dig a hole.

116
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,364
The fun stuff.

117
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,610
Yeah,

118
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,930
but what the fuck man?

119
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,200
What if they dig a hole through the
earth mantle and the earth becomes like a

120
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,170
fucking balloon with a hole in it and
just goes flying around the galaxy?

121
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,470
What if it lava shoots out of
it like she like a balloon.

122
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
You know how you go and
your blow the balloon,

123
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,314
then you let it go.

124
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,580
How about that?

125
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,900
What if the earth becomes like that?

126
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,980
Like a balloon that doesn't does not
tied off at the end and the earth flies

127
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,814
around the galaxy.

128
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,820
I'll fucking haphazardly like a balloon.

129
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,571
What did we find out?

130
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,950
The earth is really made out of rubber
and this whole mantle and all this other

131
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,431
bullshit.

132
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,020
This is just outside the balloon.

133
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,910
This is like the
decoration on the balloon,

134
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,380
but if you pop that mother fucker
it was just fly around Jupiter.

135
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,250
Yeah,

136
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,510
we slamming a Jupiter
and shit and we slam it.

137
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,373
Other planets,

138
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,850
that's is the most fucked up thing about
spaces that occasionally planets hit

139
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:52,684
each other.

140
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,340
God Damn Son.

141
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,170
Could you imagine what kind of chaos
there would be in this world if we saw a

142
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,850
planet common our way,

143
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
if you saw a Mars like
for sure Mars is coming,

144
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,890
it might take five years,

145
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,730
but it's going to hit the
earth and we're fucked in.

146
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,730
There's not a God damn
thing we can do to stop it.

147
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,301
There it is.

148
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,310
You see it in the sky gets
a little bigger every night.

149
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,110
By the time it got real close,

150
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,540
people would be losing their fucking mind.

151
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,210
It'd be fucking great.

152
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
It wouldn't be a party,

153
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,203
you know,

154
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,170
warrior with knives and stabbing people.

155
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,990
It would be like that
scene in event horizon.

156
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,080
You remember that movie event
horizon with Laurence Fishburne?

157
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,140
You don't remember that Badass
fucking science fiction movie.

158
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Sam Shepard and I think it's Sam Shepard
and Laurence Fishburne and it's about a

159
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,870
of spaceship that punches
a hole through a wormhole.

160
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,280
They traveled to a distant part in the
galaxy by folding the space and time

161
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,000
together,

162
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,260
like two pieces of paper,

163
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,570
punching a hole through it in a,

164
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,230
in a arriving on the other end.

165
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,071
But when they did that,

166
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,230
they didn't realize that
they actually went to hell.

167
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,710
So these guys get to this,

168
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,100
uh,

169
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,480
event horizon ship.

170
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,500
It comes back,

171
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,370
everyone's dead,

172
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,870
and they get a video of a,

173
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,010
the,

174
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,220
the,

175
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,280
the crew and the,

176
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:03,581
the,

177
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:03,791
uh,

178
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,750
the captain and everything.

179
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,810
Like they find out later in the movie
what happened to them and they're pulling

180
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:11,600
their own eyeballs out and scream and
shit and Latin and killing each other and

181
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,930
biting each other apart
and cotton each other open.

182
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,220
That's what it's going to look like.

183
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,251
It's not gonna be like,

184
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:16,661
everyone's like,

185
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:17,051
we're going to be,

186
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:17,650
fuck it.

187
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,180
You're not going to be fucking okay.

188
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,800
When there's bars,

189
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,590
it's like a hundred times
bigger than the moon.

190
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,060
Maybe a thousand to,

191
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:25,451
I don't know.

192
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,091
What the fuck am I doing?

193
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:26,500
I think,

194
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,880
I think I would fucking kill myself.

195
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,390
I would close my fucking
eyes and wish for the best.

196
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm not tapping out that fucking easy.

197
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,480
Can you pull up that song?

198
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,230
Dream weaver.

199
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,100
Did you pull up that
side now pull that song.

200
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,840
It's too early for that shit.

201
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,310
We gotta establish the show first.

202
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,540
You're gonna hit it with this gave using.

203
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,520
Now I want to hear you.

204
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,510
I want to hear what you would do.

205
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,950
I want to hear what you
would do over that song.

206
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,871
Not a want of them.

207
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:49,540
Nothing.

208
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,991
First of all,

209
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,070
that shit wouldn't happen to know

210
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,180
if I see shit come in,

211
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,170
I just go home.

212
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,500
You can get stuck up
on some fucking earth.

213
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,890
Get some good books and
wait for the ship to drop.

214
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,280
Go like,

215
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,451
wait,

216
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:01,881
what are you guys?

217
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:02,450
Don't do?

218
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,740
You gotta get on the four or five with
these fucking idiots and you know what

219
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,480
are you going to go get on a one 10
guys with helicopters who have just be

220
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,560
pissing in your head,

221
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,500
out of their helicopter laughing at you.

222
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,320
You're stuck in this stupid grid though.

223
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:14,840
There won't be no fucking helicopters is,

224
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,021
hey,

225
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,260
doesn't this fucking city you got?

226
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,680
There'll be those helicopters.

227
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,650
Yeah,

228
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll be shooting you down.

229
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,220
We'll go and we're gone.

230
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,063
We're gone.

231
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,990
It's going to be fucking chaos.

232
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:24,681
Yeah.

233
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,220
You know,

234
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,911
it's interesting.

235
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,150
People didn't really learn about human
behavior from the Rodney king riots,

236
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,410
but that's what should have taught you.

237
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:35,411
This is what's possible with something
so simple as a verdict for someone who

238
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:39,770
you don't even know who you saw get
beat up and they let the cops go,

239
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,710
and these mother fuckers were going crazy,

240
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,900
throwing rocks at white people.

241
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,460
Smash their fucking and yeah,

242
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,701
yeah,

243
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:46,881
yeah,

244
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,714
yeah.

245
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,370
It was a racially charged issue.

246
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,010
I understand that people
have this feeling of a,

247
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,470
an unfair society and it's set up.
