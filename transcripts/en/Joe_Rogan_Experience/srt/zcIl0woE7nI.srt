1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,200
Byron bowers,
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,430
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,750
What's up brother?
Man,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,400
thank you for having me.
My pleasure.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,770
What's the latest and the greatest with
Byron?

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,150
You've been traveling all over the
place,

7
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:13,860
man.
Check your instagram out.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,220
Oh Man.
I just got back from the Dominican

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,220
Republic a few days ago and uh,
it was a very interesting experience.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
Like anytime you go somewhere tropical
you like,

12
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,280
man,
this place is beautiful.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,280
And then by the third day he'd be like,
man,

14
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,830
this is,
this is horrible politics.

15
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,280
The way they treat people.
Oh.

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,380
So you see the balance of,
you know,

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,680
everything.
Especially as a,

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,850
you know,
uh,

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,730
being from where I'm from and being
black and what's going on,

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,570
I'm always in exotic places when cops
are killing black people.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,950
So it pulls you out of the situation and
it lets you see how fucked up things or

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,710
for like the Haitian people.

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,400
But yeah,
I mean at pretty much every third world

24
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,730
country deals with all kinds of fucked
up shit.

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,130
Yeah,
like way worse than we have it here.

26
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,780
It puts things into perspective.
Like,

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,020
I often think like if,
if United States wasn't established just

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,550
a few hundred years ago,
if that didn't happen,

29
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,020
like what would the world be like?
Like what would most of the world be

30
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,970
like?
A lot of these countries that you visit

31
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,390
where you deal with insane police
corruption.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,060
Like I've,
I've had friends that have been pulled

33
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,720
over in Mexico and you know,
the,

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,250
the,
the cops basically just straight up tell

35
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,710
you like,
do you want to get out of this?

36
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,030
Give me some fucking money.
I think I had a situation like that

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,170
coming through Tsa,
but I didn't realize until they let me

38
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,870
go.
But they held me for a long time where,

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,900
uh,
in Dominican Republic because I had on a

40
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,140
button up shirt that's denim,
like the one I'm wearing now.

41
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,530
And they was like,
take your jacket off and I'm precheck.

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,170
So when he would come precheck it's like
a white privilege.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,030
And I'm like,
I'm not taking off my shoes.

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,190
This is not a jacket.
This is a shirt.

45
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,790
So in the Dominican Republic,
yeah,

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,720
doing this and I'm flying out on glasses
and stuff.

47
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,130
And they was like,
oh,

48
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,570
okay,
oh it's a shirt,

49
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,740
huh?
Come through.

50
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,500
And then as soon as I came through there
was like this your bag.

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,930
And he started trying to take my cologne
like,

52
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,770
yeah,
that's flammable.

53
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,750
You can't take that on a plane or my
umbrella,

54
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,870
you can't take umbrellas on the plane.
That's a weapon.

55
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:24,900
Sorry.
And they just held me there and we just

56
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,430
made eye contact with each other.
I'm like,

57
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,920
show me on the chart.
That's all I kept saying.

58
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,840
And then after awhile they was like,
you know what,

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,660
you can take it,
you know?

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,370
So after a while they just gave up.
Yeah,

61
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,690
they gave up because I was like,
okay,

62
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,370
if I check the bag can I take
everything?

63
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,204
And he was like,
yeah,

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,210
so what I did,
I unloaded all my bags and start

65
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:46,470
rearranging things so I could put it so
I can check it,

66
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,100
can make it back to America.
But once they saw me doing that and they

67
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,080
saw how neat I was,
like every time they touched somebody

68
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,620
had to put it back a certain way.
They like it.

69
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,960
It's just going to be a waste of time,
but even us.

70
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah,
but don't they have rules?

71
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,880
We have rules as far as like how many
ounces of liquid and stuff like that you

72
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,650
could take on a plane.
They do,

73
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,460
but it made it over there.
So that's why I was trying to get them

74
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,990
to explain to me like why exactly it
probably made it over there because the

75
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,830
people that work at Tsa over here
fucking barely paying attention.

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,290
Well you take it everywhere.
I take it everywhere.

77
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,930
But how big is your Cologne?
First of all?

78
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,390
Clones.
Stinky man when we were in that I love.

79
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,790
I love it.
I know you disagree with Cologne.

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,630
You know what I mean?
Just a great political point.

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,510
Disagree with Cologne.
You more Alpha though.

82
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,880
You know what I mean?
You can choke them out with your muscles

83
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,490
and I could choke them with the smell.
I'm

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,570
not exactly sure where to go with that.
But.

85
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,010
So how big is the Cologne?
So you're like three point something

86
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,850
ounces.
Okay.

87
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,700
So I think you could bring on like four
ounces of liquid.

88
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,990
Yeah.
Isn't that how it works?

89
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,640
Yep.
Toiletry bag.

90
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,230
Yeah.
It was a total tree back.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,290
Now mind you,
I just,

92
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,310
I kept,
I went from Montreal to some from

93
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,500
Montreal,
from New York and Montreal here to

94
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,630
Dominican Republic.
So this same luggage has been like

95
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,483
everywhere.

96
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,610
So what were you doing down in Dominican
Republic?

97
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,770
Oh,
I met up with some friends of mine from

98
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:15,160
college,
some African homeboys and I hopped in on

99
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:20,010
their trip because they visit the Dr Lot
and I wanted to see what it was like and

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,890
I snuck it a lot.
Like I came back sore.

101
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,290
But yeah,
I did a lot of time in the water

102
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,470
morning,
evening and like late afternoon.

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,270
What's beautiful for that?
Yeah,

104
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,700
that's one of the cool things about this
tropical climates,

105
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,260
the uh,
the oceans down,

106
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,730
they're amazing.
The ocean.

107
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,380
It's amazing.
Some of the reefs wasn't as you know,

108
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,100
not like when I was in Jamaica or when
I,

109
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,640
like in Hawaii where everything just
comes alive and it looks at the city,

110
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,870
but it definitely.
You do feel like you landed on another

111
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:56,950
planet to me and you're flying like I'm
cruising over,

112
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,780
you know the terrain.

113
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,790
You mean when you're swimming?
When I swim?

114
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,100
Yeah.
Anytime I snorkeled like it's that it's

115
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,160
that other world experience to me.
Yeah man.

116
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm a big fan of the water,
but the sharks fuck it up for me.

117
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,920
Yeah.
I'm just not going to get neat.

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,410
But yeah,
that's the thing about it.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Sometimes I keep looking around like
especially if it's not a lot of things

120
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:23,050
in the water,
but I saw squared that was the most

121
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:28,051
beautiful thing I saw from this trip was
just like 40 baby squid all lined up in

122
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,660
a row
that looked like they'd just been born,

123
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,140
you know,
Popo and they were just there and I

124
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,780
didn't even know they was squid.
I thought it was like fish with interest

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,190
in his fans because it looked like,
you know,

126
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,180
like a lady just doing her dress like
that.

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
When I got close I could.
I realized that I was at a tentacle part

128
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,630
a and I was just locked eyes with him
and I was like,

129
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,920
oh,
this is the most beautiful thing.

130
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,300
You know,
Duncan trussell.

131
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,300
Yeah.
Dunkin has this new virtual reality

132
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,860
thing.
It's a virtual,

133
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,310
it's an htv

134
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,320
vive.
And uh,

135
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,290
you put it on and you,
you actually feel like you're

136
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,150
underwater.
They have this program because I think

137
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,830
it's called deep blue or something like
that.

138
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,220
Something blue,
um,

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
but you put it on and one of the uh,
reality programs that you put on is an

140
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,890
ocean one and you're standing at the
bottom of this like ocean area and these

141
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:26,891
fish swim by and it's,
it's not a hundred percent realistic

142
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,150
because the graphics on totally there
yet,

143
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,690
but it's like 85 percent realistic.
And as amazing a whale pulls up to you

144
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,700
and you get to look at the whale,
like you look in his eyes.

145
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,310
But like,
I dunno if you've ever used any kind of

146
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,840
virtual reality.
I'm pretty new to it too,

147
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,950
but you get a full 360 degrees so you
can look down,

148
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,450
you can look up,
you can look everywhere.

149
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,460
So this whale,
as it's in front of you,

150
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,070
you could choose different spots on the
whale that you look at it,

151
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,170
you can look at its eyes,
you can look at its tail.

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,890
It's fucking fascinating.
And it lets you know that,

153
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,600
you know,
within a hundred years from now,

154
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:03,440
probably not even,
probably more like 20 the 20 years from

155
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,340
now.
Oh,

156
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,960
this is it.
Is this the program?

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,940
So this is it right here.
So you,

158
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,170
you stand there and you're looking
around like that dude's just looking

159
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,960
around with these goggles on and this is
what you're seeing.

160
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,430
I mean,
you're seeing it feels like the actual

161
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,540
ocean.
Yeah.

162
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,374
That's,
uh,

163
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,490
that's basically what it,
that's basically what it looks and feels

164
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,620
like a,
that's beautiful right there.

165
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,330
It's crazy that that's what is it like
79 percent of the earth or some point

166
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,800
that is.
Yeah,

167
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,810
we looked it up the other day.

168
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,810
It was over 70 percent of the earth is
water and 95 percent of that is ocean

169
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:45,290
water.
That's amazing because almost like how

170
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,150
they say our bodies are made up of the
same.

171
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,120
Not Quite.
I think a bodies like 60 percent.

172
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,220
They used to say it was like 90 percent
water,

173
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,430
so finding out what it is.
I think the human body is actually only

174
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,190
60 percent water,
something like that.

175
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Maybe.
But I've,

176
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,570
I've,
I've experienced virtual reality,

177
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,940
the one where you could just travel
everywhere around the world.

178
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,970
60th five average human bodies between
50 and 65 percent water averaging around

179
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:16,100
57 to 60 percent average percentage of
water and infants as much higher

180
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:19,000
typically around 75 to 78 percent water.
Huh?

181
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,130
That makes sense.
Dropping into 65 by one year of age.

182
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:26,690
A little water balloons.
It's probably why the scan gets crazy.

183
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,960
Like the older we get,
the water's drop it in,

184
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
drop it in there.
Then like I said,

185
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,760
the percentage goes down.
The older you get.

186
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh Man,
he probably just drinking too much.

187
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,520
He'll get wrinkles and stuff.
That's actually Collagen.

188
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,343
That's,
um,

189
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,760
that's the wrinkle thing is the last set
of your skin gives out your body stops

190
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,060
producing college incorrectly,
but you can mitigate some of that

191
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,120
moisture and you know,
some people use creams and shit like

192
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,200
that,
but at the end of the day,

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,220
time,
time when

194
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,230
certain ways.
I definitely use creams.

195
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,910
I use cranes.
Do you clone?

196
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,630
Yeah.
All the things that stink things.

197
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,610
Well I can't use,
I can't use dyes and perfumes and

198
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,790
lotions.
How come it,

199
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,320
it makes my skin,
it dries my skin out and make it break

200
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,000
out perfumes and lotions.
But you can work alone.

201
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,980
Yeah.
I wear Cologne,

202
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,100
Cologne last,
a certain amount of hours and it lands

203
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,210
on your skin.
So,

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,310
you know,
look at you.

205
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,060
You clump correctional Atlanta.
Scared.

206
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,630
So dedicated.
Have you always worn Cologne?

207
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,970
No.
Well once I got into it,

208
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,250
my mom,
like I was raised by my mom,

209
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,340
like sense of smell is just so strong,
you know,

210
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,341
so it was always frigates around and to
me that's the first like that.

211
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,190
That can alter your mindset or your
mood.

212
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,690
Like when you smell something good.
Yeah.

213
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,090
Yeah.
It's an anchor.

214
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,520
It'll,
it can cause like a,

215
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,260
like a mental trigger.
Yeah.

216
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,850
It brings you back to that place like
certain smells,

217
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,640
like smell of apple pie.
If your mom cooked up a pie or something

218
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:58,680
like that,
you could smell it immediately.

219
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,960
Transport you back to that good place or
bad place or bad place.

220
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,810
Like yeah,
like I like,

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
like sexy smells,
so I like to be reminded of something

222
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,570
that's pleasant life a woman,
smells,

223
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,140
you know,
so I don't wear like hardcore masculine.

224
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,180
But I liked the smell like a rose,
like you like to smell like a rose.

225
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,240
I like to smell like something fresh
like that,

226
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,540
you know?
I'm learning a lot about like,

227
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,520
yeah,
it takes me two hours to pick out my

228
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,510
fragrance,
you know what I mean?

229
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,950
But hold on,
it takes you two hours to pick out your

230
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:35,280
fragrance.
It's just in a day or like when you go

231
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,360
to a fragrance store.

232
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,360
When I went,
when I went to the fragrance store.

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,220
So you're that dude,
you're just wandering around.

234
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:43,320
They're touching this one?
Yeah,

235
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,410
smelling it.
And if I don't get like a small,

236
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,290
like erection,
like that little erection.

237
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,210
Yeah.
Like if it don't turn me on in a sense

238
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,370
it's not the one.
Huh?

239
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,230
But you know,
it just like,

240
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,510
you know,
like when you feel the energy of a lady

241
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,480
or you know,
whatever you're attracted to the sound

242
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,360
of a motor when it goes by,
you know what I mean?

243
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,040
Well I'm with you on that.
Yeah.

244
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,830
Yeah.
They've said that on with engines that

245
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:10,200
actually like when you hear an engine
revving,

246
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:13,980
it actually raises men's testosterone.
But why?

247
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,710
I wonder why it's uh,
it's like,

248
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,940
I don't know that anybody ever driven a
car with pipes,

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,910
which is rare in California that have
custom pipes.

250
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,830
But you think it's rare?
Yeah.

251
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,660
It'll be like for as far as like loud
and those fucking things are everywhere

252
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,621
really.
Yeah.

253
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,750
They cracked down on them here.
It's not like in Georgia.

254
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,530
I'm from Georgia where you can,
you can get a Honda and put in open

255
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,650
exhaust.
I have a quarter inch and take the stuff

256
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:42,360
off us.
He that stupid.

257
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,690
If you've got a Honda.
Yeah.

258
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,650
You shouldn't do that.
If you're a four cylinder,

259
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,330
that's awful.
I did that before,

260
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:53,331
but my friend had a Cobra Mustang,
68 a and you can hear that car coming

261
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,010
down

262
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,440
the street,
but when you hear in a real car with a

263
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,030
real motor is almost like a,
like a tiger growl in the song.

264
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
It's just an energy that want to
release.

265
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,300
When you press the gas,
you know,

266
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,900
so that it makes you,
it just does something to you.

267
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,230
What's little explosions?
I mean it's controlled explosions

268
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,120
essentially and that's what it
engineers,

269
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:16,570
right?
It's just the steel explosion container

270
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,230
and all these pistons are in there and
they're all firing.

271
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,050
I don't know.
As much as I know about cars.

272
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,220
I really should know more about like how
engines work.

273
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,610
Like I really don't know that much.
I kind of know there's some,

274
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,030
I ain't gotta have cam shafts and you've
got to have some cylinders and there's a

275
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
spark plugs and night,
some shit and some fire explosions going

276
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,950
off.
I don't really know know,

277
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,120
you know more about me when it comes to
cars.

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,750
I know the simple like few air spark
gets it going.

279
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,550
That's it,
yeah.

280
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah.
The simplicity of it.

281
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,050
But you are in the cars to your
conversations.

282
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,240
I definitely liked them,
but I can't get into it.

283
00:12:55,241 --> 00:13:00,241
We'll displacement and offsets and the
correct suspension and steering.

284
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,110
You don't know about all that stuff?
No,

285
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,740
no.
I just know what I like body shapes and

286
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,650
what it feels like.
But don't you enjoy like what it feels

287
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,800
like when you drive them?
Like you have a nice car when you drive

288
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,390
that thing,
like you know,

289
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,950
like it has like a certain feel to the
way like when you turn corners and stuff

290
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,870
like that.
Certain responsiveness to it.

291
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,531
Yeah,
that's true.

292
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,200
I definitely know that but there's not,
I can't dial it in.

293
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,330
I can't put that in a computer and be
like,

294
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,380
hmm,
you know,

295
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,930
like I need my suspension adjusted.

296
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,170
Should I go with this call?
Oversell a colo visit.

297
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,180
But that's the beautiful thing about the
Internet.

298
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,690
You know,
you have a bmw so you can go to a BMW

299
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,150
forum and then you can say,
you know,

300
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:43,630
what is the deal with this year?
A three series.

301
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,970
Like what's the best suspension set up
for handling and some some people like

302
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,070
comfort,
some people like handling.

303
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,420
That's the real trade off is because if
you really want the car to sit flat

304
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,820
around corners that it has to have a
little more stiffness,

305
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,740
still feel everything a little bit more
and I feel that and I liked that.

306
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,310
Like I had enough for for 83,
which to me the best,

307
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,520
but it was the best car or home.
Those portions are sweet man.

308
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,510
Those are underrated cars to be able to
fill a cart.

309
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,690
The field role do this,
like you're on a boat was amazing.

310
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,260
A lot of cars don't give you that
feeling.

311
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,700
The boat feeling like you know the
street is uneven when you drive it now

312
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,880
instead of just the flattest most paved
street,

313
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,910
you know,
you could feel the wave in it.

314
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,290
Oh,
because you must have pretty stiff

315
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,220
suspension.
Yeah.

316
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,750
That car came like that though.
Yeah.

317
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,720
Well those older cars were way more
responsive.

318
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,560
They were way lighter too.
Like if you go to like the really older

319
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,160
porsches like the old nine slash 11.
So the long hood models,

320
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,140
I think it was like 65 or 64,
I think it was two 73.

321
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,810
Those models,
they're really light,

322
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,970
like that's a 2000 pound car a lot of

323
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,570
times.
So you feel everything when you bumping

324
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,450
around those things?
Yeah,

325
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,340
it feels more like a go cart,
you know.

326
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,700
And that was ignorant with my,
like I had to buy tires for it and they

327
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,411
was like,
uh,

328
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,850
it's 83 and I'm like,
it's 150 horses.

329
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
I'd take it to the tire place.
And he was like,

330
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,040
yeah,
you need these $150 tires.

331
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,670
And I'm like,
no,

332
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,970
fuck that.
This car,

333
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,680
the only got 150 horses.
Let's put some van tires on it,

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,490
you know.
And I bought two brand new van tires.

335
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,890
What's a van like times that were going
on a van.

336
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Why would you do that?
Because it to me it's just a tire.

337
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,280
Oh that's ridiculous.
Slot slid on the freeway or bunch of

338
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:32,720
times just stopping and wasn't used to
not having abs.

339
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,130
Automatic breaks.
And every time it stumped the brakes,

340
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,250
you know the car was slide on the
freeway,

341
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,670
but I would stop in enough distance to
where a slot and not hit the car.

342
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,060
So you had antilock brakes?
No,

343
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,390
I didn't.
I didn't have it.

344
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,830
What kind of car was this not for,
for those?

345
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,270
Didn't have any brakes?
No,

346
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,040
not 83.
They didn't come to like 86.

347
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,780
And you put van tires on Jesus Christ.
Dude,

348
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,030
that's a sacrilege.
That's terrible.

349
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,220
It was.
It was what you learned lessons,

350
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,570
you know,
anytime you work on your car is cool,

351
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,360
but you learn your lessons.
You learned about Torque,

352
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,390
torque,
applying torque to old cars and plastic

353
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,224
pieces.
Breaking.

354
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,330
Yeah.
And all types of stuff that,

355
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,340
you know,
antifreeze tastes like.

356
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,460
You know what?
Any furniture,

357
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,720
we drink it in the fridge for you if you
don't drink it,

358
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:28,721
but you have to rework working on a leak
or changing something in drips and it

359
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,670
gets in your mouth and Oh,
I get it.

360
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,330
It is sweet.
It's like koolaid almost doesn't really

361
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,700
taste that good.
I would have no idea.

362
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,300
It looks disgusting and antifreeze looks
nasty.

363
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,153
Looks like,
like,

364
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,110
like nuclear waste or something.
Yeah.

365
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,370
So yeah.
You learn your lessons with cars by.

366
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,650
You still carrying those old ones.

367
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,730
Yeah,
they're different,

368
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,020
you know,
you can actually work on them.

369
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,900
You can open up the hood,
there's stuff you can change and swap

370
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,430
out.
You can go to pep boys or whatever by a

371
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,860
part.
New Cars,

372
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:01,900
man.
You open up the hood.

373
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,150
It's just like a computer.
It's like opening up the back of a imac

374
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:05,571
or.
Yeah,

375
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,590
that's true.
He have no idea what the fuck's going on

376
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,880
there.
And everything's connected to some sort

377
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:11,840
of a,
you know,

378
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,730
a computer management system.
So,

379
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,560
you know,
three,

380
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,800
three and the bemer it's three.
Three what?

381
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,390
Three computers.
Really?

382
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,050
Yeah.
They ignition switch when you put the

383
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,030
key in,
talks to this module,

384
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,050
reads the key code and it talks back and
allows the car to crank,

385
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,380
but all they have to go through the main
computer also.

386
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,260
Wow.
And I know that because I know Colin and

387
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:40,220
I studied engineering for two,
my senior year and I had to,

388
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:44,960
um,
I had to snatch a remote start system,

389
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,360
faulty remote start system out of the
basement when I got it.

390
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,220
So I had to go under the Dash.
Rewire everything.

391
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,750
You did all that?
Yeah.

392
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,190
Wow.
Why'd you do that?

393
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,560
To take it out,
but you did,

394
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,110
you know what you were doing?
What,

395
00:17:57,111 --> 00:18:01,320
what made you decide to embark on that?
That seems like something I would want

396
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,530
to take to a dealer.
Well,

397
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,350
I learned how to do install car stereos.
Oh my friend,

398
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,700
when I was younger,
he used to steal a car.

399
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,300
Radios.
He taught me three basic things to start

400
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,620
a radio is like the cars,
you know,

401
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:19,050
power ground,
you could turn the radio on and the

402
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,570
remote wire was,
makes it switched on and off.

403
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,470
Would you really don't need a remote
wire at the test or radio just like you

404
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,910
got jumped,
started answering.

405
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,400
But you know,
you know,

406
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,390
you start to learn a pattern of things
just like the universe had patterns when

407
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,100
you learn a combustion and stuff like
that.

408
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,410
Just the pattern is was important to me.

409
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,670
That makes sense.
No,

410
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,450
the universe has a pattern and then the
universe,

411
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,680
because now I'm the bigger pattern
scale,

412
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,150
you know,
but the media,

413
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,470
yeah,
the university has a pattern of the way

414
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,520
it runs to me.
You know what I mean?

415
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,710
When it comes to seasons and things like
that.

416
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,810
The revolution of earth around the sun,
you know.

417
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,720
But
Stereo's also had that pattern.

418
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,700
That's an interesting comparison.
Well they definitely have like whenever

419
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:10,340
you're dealing with electronics,
you have to have power in the ground and

420
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,020
then there's a bunch of other stuff that
goes on.

421
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,820
I've installed some stairs when I was
younger,

422
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,213
you know,
but,

423
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,840
but they were easy back then.
It wasn't that hard,

424
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,621
you know,
there wasn't that,

425
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,230
it wasn't that complicated.
You get to everything pretty easily.

426
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,340
Give up the dash pretty easily.
Pull out the existing stereo and you

427
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:28,170
just have to figure out where the power
is and where the wires connect.

428
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,530
You tie everything up.
It wasn't that hard,

429
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,890
but I would never fuck with a new car.
Like,

430
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,050
you know,
like a new lexus or something like that.

431
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,360
Try to take stereo out of one of those
things was more tough.

432
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,390
But if I break it down to you like this
coding and stuff is all if an statements

433
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,020
right.
If end if,

434
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,060
ands.
So if this go there,

435
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,060
go here,
right?

436
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,570
Ones and zeroes,
right.

437
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,170
If there's one poem here because zero
boom here and it's just a bunch of that

438
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,100
going on,
right.

439
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,340
Computing at one time.
That's the pattern,

440
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,930
right.
You know,

441
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,380
has it as a simple.
Yeah.

442
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,300
Well it's more complicated than that.
Right?

443
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,600
Well it's not going on.
What does a bunch of those all in one

444
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,870
was.
It's amazing how well these cars work

445
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,871
when you really think about it because
like I'm like I have a lexus and I have

446
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:23,091
a key that is actually in my wallet.
It's a credit card and that's my key.

447
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,630
So I don't ever take a key,
I just get in my car and it always knows

448
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,880
it's me.
I come near it.

449
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,430
The light goes on near the side.
Mirrors the side.

450
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,040
Mirrors have like an underside light.
The light goes on,

451
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,930
the handle illuminates let you know you
there,

452
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,520
it opens for you,
you get in,

453
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:42,350
you just press start and go.
It's crazy how often it works.

454
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:43,780
We get never fucks up.
Yeah.

455
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,660
And that's cool.
It is cool.

456
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
But it's just when you think about how
many different things fail in terms of

457
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,070
electronics,
you know how many different people's

458
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,180
iphones start fucking up most cars,
especially when it comes to like your

459
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,470
card,
a German engineering or Japanese

460
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,520
engineering,
something like that.

461
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,480
They're so fucking reliable.
I mean the,

462
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,540
the amount of times that they actually
do fuck up is people complain about it

463
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:15,541
but it's pretty small.
And while I was in school and I learned

464
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,010
a study in [inaudible] 95 when it came
to the Lexus and the Honda,

465
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,580
the car,
we're pretty much perfect [inaudible].

466
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,400
So they had to add features.
So now have you noticed where everything

467
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,880
is about the features and less about,
you know,

468
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,770
and there's a cycle of cars having more
power and cost saving gas cars having

469
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,080
power.
That's just a pattern.

470
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,160
It's just gonna happen.
Um,

471
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,260
but yeah,
it's all about the features now.

472
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,630
Even with phones,
it's all about the features.

473
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,060
Yeah.
Well for sure.

474
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:49,480
I mean with new cars tube is like you
have to have apps and all sorts of

475
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:53,470
different things that your car can do.
But those older cars,

476
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,470
the one of the interesting thing is how
long some of them lasts.

477
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,850
Like I have a friend who has Alexa,
so it was a million miles on it.

478
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,280
It's a million miles because the gs
$300,

479
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,290
the fourth member.
But model it is the older,

480
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,700
bigger ones.
The big one.

481
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,490
Yeah.
That's,

482
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,260
that's the one that's supposed to be an
asset car asset car.

483
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,970
Yeah.
Like,

484
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,870
it's gonna appreciate really because
yeah,

485
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,180
you know,
the foreign cars are just now starting

486
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:24,310
to appreciate versus the old American
cars.

487
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,040
Well you mean foreign,
like Japanese cars.

488
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,830
German cars are always kind of
appreciated,

489
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,910
right?
Like porsches.

490
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,510
But yeah.
Porsche's and stuff like that,

491
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,410
but as far as like the little light.

492
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,740
Yeah.
Japanese cars and like the Lexus.

493
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,420
Well,
you know what's really appreciating now

494
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:40,780
it's kind of interesting is those old
Nissan skylines.

495
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,480
Yeah.
The ones that became the gtrs.

496
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,470
When you look at a gtr now,
it's very different looking,

497
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,080
very spaceship looking,
but the older ones are kind of like more

498
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,370
retro and kind of cool looking.
But the oldest ones now are starting to

499
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,020
become really valuable.
Yeah.

500
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,300
Like the early nineties and late
eighties.

501
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,130
Yeah.
It's just hard to find one.

502
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,200
It's not molested because a lot of
people took,

503
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,780
um,
and they did shit to the fenders and

504
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,640
they fucked with this.
He fucked with that.

505
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,300
I just told her ticket about that the
other day we was talking about cars and

506
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,180
I was like,
yeah,

507
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,180
it's hard to find something that you
could find one.

508
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:15,130
It's not been molested.
She was like,

509
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:19,170
what in the heck?
Explain to her what molested was and

510
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,470
what retard tranny is.
Retard.

511
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,300
Yeah.
For a car.

512
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,610
Yeah.
We don't turn over.

513
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,940
It's like when they don't move forward
with something is holding it back.

514
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,590
Yeah,
you called it a retard retard,

515
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,040
like have you tried to turn the car and
it won't turn over retarded.

516
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Slow like it won't turn and then mostly
using like the Europe,

517
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,890
Europeans use it

518
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,040
most of the time.
Do they really use it like a standard

519
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,870
term?
Yeah,

520
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,980
like some of the blogs and stuff.
It's like,

521
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,830
you know,
it's amazing.

522
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,300
Do you read blogs?
I'm cars.

523
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,530
Yeah,
like when I,

524
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,680
because I work on my car myself.
So yeah,

525
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,130
anytime you are trying to diagnose a
problem,

526
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,210
it's more reading then going actually
going out to figure out what it is.

527
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,670
That's interesting.
You read all that kind of stuff but you

528
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:15,380
don't read up about like suspensions or
different tire offsets or anything like

529
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,300
that or no?
How come?

530
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,950
I don't know.
I think uh,

531
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,490
I don't,
I really never really have what they

532
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,010
call a super car up or modified it too
much,

533
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,340
you know,
so everything I get,

534
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,850
I used to just ride basically with it
and I can have fun with that because I'm

535
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:33,410
not a high horsepower guy.

536
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,830
I just need it to be quick and like turn
and handled well and I just live

537
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,510
dangerously within that.
You know,

538
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,710
you live dangerously
well.

539
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,710
Those cars,
like,

540
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:49,690
you know,
you have a BMW three series.

541
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,900
Like those cars,
they're handled.

542
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,420
They handled great anyway.
Like my friend Eddie bought one of those

543
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,660
a few years back and he had before that,
like an old shitty bronco and when he

544
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,060
got that a bmw three series,
he was like,

545
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,500
oh my God man.
He goes,

546
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,420
I like driving now.
He goes,

547
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,210
I never knew that driving was actually
fun.

548
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,390
Yeah.
Like I would go,

549
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,710
he would go,
he was a,

550
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:13,910
I would take Mulholland just for fun,
like just decided I'm gonna take it this

551
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,880
way if no longer just because I'm bored,
you know?

552
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,610
I took,
I was in Topanga like last month with

553
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:22,270
the car.
The road is a road as a ward now.

554
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,310
Pure warped.
My role is a warped from what?

555
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,940
From just breaking and like his driving
Topanga.

556
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,030
Topanga.
How many times did you do it that day?

557
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,470
I was filming something like a
documentary and I went hard that day,

558
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,590
but it was already working for.
I went that day.

559
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,450
You were filming a documentary in your
car?

560
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,040
Yeah.
What are you doing?

561
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,820
Um,
somebody was doing a documentary on

562
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,850
creating comedians create content and I
was showing them like what,

563
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,200
how,
how I get inspired and what gets me in

564
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,960
the mood and the car is one of those
things,

565
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,880
you know,
because when you talk about,

566
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,010
you're talking about engineering,
so kind of you know,

567
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:07,560
and putting it in comedy set.
Yeah.

568
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,500
And I'm just a balance between
the left and right brain,

569
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:17,300
the logic side and the creative side and
the balance between the two because my

570
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:20,420
style is basically that balance,
you know?

571
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,923
Oh,
you don't know.

572
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,793
Well,
I'm,

573
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm trying to get.
So you get this by driving,

574
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:28,190
is that what you're saying?
Yeah,

575
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:30,140
I've been driving is something that's,
that's beautiful.

576
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:35,141
I took him to a junk yard also cause the
death of a car and the rebirth of parts

577
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,640
when you need it,
you know,

578
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,720
the life and death,
the Yang Yang of that.

579
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,930
And I took him to paint a cane because I
did la,

580
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,870
I did acid in Topanga.
And it's a good place to.

581
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,561
Acid.
Yeah.

582
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,420
So at one part we kind of an original
though,

583
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,570
a lot of acid going onto panga.
So when you,

584
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,340
when you out there,
you got nature right?

585
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,360
And then when you turned onto the
street,

586
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,040
you have all these sports cars,
you know,

587
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,270
which is beautiful.
You got a manmade creation.

588
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,870
They also has life to it.
Are you looking at just trying to follow

589
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:11,460
you?
I get it.

590
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,640
I get what you're saying.
So we found and I took traction control

591
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:19,020
off and it was four of us in that little
car and we just slid around a corner a

592
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:22,410
corner and uh,
those guys were scared,

593
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,640
you know?
Yeah.

594
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:25,930
You're sliding.
Yeah,

595
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:28,240
it was a residential street.
They should be kind of nervous.

596
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
It was a little nervous and I was a
little nervous,

597
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,470
but that will made it fun.
You know,

598
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,630
we did that together.
He has tricky though because that's kind

599
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,790
of a lot of people drive into Topanga.
Yeah.

600
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,360
And that's what adds to the,
the edginess of it,

601
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,070
just like my set,
you know,

602
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,540
is that line you can call that edginess
or irresponsible on public roads,

603
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,730
you could call it that.
Yeah.

604
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
What I don't,
you know,

605
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,400
once you get into that,
that's like trying to figure out the

606
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:54,290
offset of attire,
you know what I mean?

607
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,780
What do you mean?
Those little details,

608
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,420
little details of what's fucking
dangerous.

609
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,020
There's no,
that's not a little detail when you

610
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:06,410
slide in sideways on a residential road.
No.

611
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,110
One thing that's a little detail.
Yeah.

612
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,860
That,
that,

613
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,350
that could be the difference between,
you know,

614
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,740
a man that was close in like somebody to
call nine one one,

615
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,180
you know,
uh,

616
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:21,400
yeah.
That's irresponsible,

617
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,243
right?
Isn't it?

618
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,930
No,
it's fine.

619
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,830
No worries.
Just edgy to scuttle sliding around.

620
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,810
Losing control of your car on public
roads.

621
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,850
No big deal.
It's like when you,

622
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,070
we will be at high school at parties and
like a,

623
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,300
a gun would come out.

624
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,610
Oh Jesus,
you thought the Party was fine.

625
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:41,570
But when that pistol came out,
that's when real excitement happens

626
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,160
in school.
Dudes are pulling guns out in your

627
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,240
parties.
Yeah,

628
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,870
right apart.
A party wasn't good and lets the cops

629
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,250
showed up.
Jesus Christ.

630
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,110
So you have the cops didn't show it was
all right.

631
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,270
And so when guns were getting pulled
out,

632
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,210
what were they getting pulled out for?
Oh,

633
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,050
people probably was arguing about
something.

634
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,490
Some.
How many times did you see this?

635
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,880
A.
Not a lot of times this will happen.

636
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,040
It just what happened regularly,
like,

637
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,020
you know,
at the night clothes and you started

638
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:10,620
going to nightclubs.
Yeah.

639
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,940
These things will happen,
you know?

640
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,390
Yeah.
What do you think about all this shit

641
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:16,640
lately?
That it seems like every couple of days

642
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,360
there's some sort of a mass shooting.
Well,

643
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:18,760
the,
the,

644
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,660
the problem with being a black guy from
the,

645
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,730
those areas in your thirties,
that's just what happens,

646
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,073
you know what I mean?

647
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,700
So,
um,

648
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,660
but in your twenties at any man really
took me in the twenties is more fight.

649
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:34,790
It's like that military,
like we're not going to take this,

650
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,610
Yada Yada Yada.
But you know,

651
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,920
and I could imagine like I'd be imagined
sometimes I look at it a funny way like

652
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,001
this,
my grandmother,

653
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,460
this is nothing,
you know what I mean?

654
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,080
Because they were like hanging people
and throw them over the bridge and the

655
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:54,280
county where she's from and shoot them
shot guns for fun.

656
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:55,870
So this is like,
you know,

657
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,470
to me in her mind she's like,
oh they need an excuse now

658
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
who is doing this?
What do you mean?

659
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:05,190
Like they were throwing people,
hanging over bridges,

660
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
shooting them for fun.
Yeah,

661
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,370
because I'm from the south,
so things are a little,

662
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,060
you know,
little old school sometimes it's not

663
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,500
that long ago when certain things
happen,

664
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,680
you know,
like Jim Crow and like these things

665
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,800
aren't that old,
but you still hear the stories.

666
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,710
You're,
you're,

667
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,810
you're brought up a,
I don't know,

668
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,660
I don't want to say racist,
but you brought up to like these people

669
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,190
are their enemy or be careful when
you're on that side of town or like they

670
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,070
say you might not come back home when
you leave the house.

671
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,000
So when you're talking about is white
people doing fucked up shit to black

672
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,690
people like that.
This was something that was so common

673
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,430
that it was just talked about all the
time.

674
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,190
Yeah,
yeah,

675
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,490
yeah.
And you still have nice people,

676
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,380
you know?
Um,

677
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,670
it's an honesty in it that I don't see
anywhere else because when I got out

678
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,690
here people act like racism didn't exist
and it affected comedy like three years

679
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,550
ago.
You know,

680
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,260
who the fuck was acting like racism
doesn't exist.

681
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:03,941
What would be like,
oh,

682
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,700
it's not,
come on and it's not that bad at or who

683
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:07,534
was in that?

684
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,810
People would say that it's not that bad.
Like we don't.

685
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,060
When people love to say there's no
racism because Obama's black.

686
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,290
Hilarious.
That's one of my favorite ones.

687
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,190
Yeah.
Like people.

688
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:22,100
And I was like,
well I'm still shellshocked but my

689
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:26,680
situation is different because I was
treated unfair within my own community.

690
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:30,290
Then I left my community,
you know,

691
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,070
like I had the whole light skin dark.
My sister,

692
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:34,300
light skinned,
fair skinned.

693
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:36,310
I'm dark skin,
you know?

694
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,030
So you were treated poorly within your
own kid because your skins too dark

695
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,890
because of that one thing and you know,
single mother being looked upon

696
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:49,690
differently and we are in the Bible belt
so there's a lot of like not having nice

697
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:54,691
clothes and bullying Brian and then I
got sent to a white school when I was

698
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
bad at my first year.
You know what I mean?

699
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,730
So to me it was like this whole,
this whole world is crazy,

700
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,370
you know?
Yeah.

701
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,610
That's the weird thing,
isn't it,

702
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:10,180
that the racism inside the black
community between light skinned and dark

703
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,630
skinned people.
Well it isn't until you go to Brazil and

704
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,620
you see,
um,

705
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,290
where they all Brazilian and see the
racism Brazilians or you know,

706
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,490
you started hanging out with other
cultures and start seeing the

707
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,250
separation with the other coaches in
saying that what I call a pattern of

708
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,520
human behavior.
Well there's definitely a pattern and

709
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,230
human behavior and trying to find groups
that they belong to and then an

710
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,920
alienating,
isolating themselves from the other

711
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,754
groups.

712
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,863
Yeah,
that's a,

713
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,850
that's an unfortunate thing that people
do and they do it.

714
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,330
The feminist thing to me to separate man
from woman.

715
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,723
Uh,

716
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,580
and then you got the,
you know,

717
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,530
the gays and then you got what's going
on in between the black people in the

718
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,110
cops know.
I mean we just two groups that are

719
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,830
opposing each other more so now than
ever.

720
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,190
So you think feminism is separating men
from women?

721
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:08,490
That's what they're doing.
I think it's a,

722
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,360
it's a slight shifting of,

723
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,280
uh,

724
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,020
especially with the guys,
you know what I mean?

725
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,190
Oh,
male feminists,

726
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,370
male feminists and male feminists or
barely real.

727
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,140
It's weird.
It's a weird situation.

728
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,670
You know,
he just parked his joint.

729
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:24,080
Keep up with you.
Male,

730
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,340
male feminists.
So seriously,

731
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,380
barely real.
They're barely real.

732
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,610
There's a very tiny percentage of men
that are actually male feminists.

733
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,060
The smallest percentage are actually
adhere to those ideologies.

734
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,570
The vast majority are doing what's
called virtue signaling.

735
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,670
Michael Shermer has got the best
expression.

736
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,380
I wonder if that's his expression.
I see it everywhere.

737
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,380
I see it more often now than ever
before.

738
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:51,290
I think since he's been on this podcast,
but um,

739
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,480
what they're doing is just trying to
make everybody think that they're

740
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,810
amazing.
They're there,

741
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:59,811
so virtuous there,
so ethical and so moral and so open

742
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:03,380
minded and fair and they're thinking
that they've,

743
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,420
you know,
they identify as a feminist,

744
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,820
but most of it is guys that just can't
get any pussy.

745
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,170
Well,
I thought I was the truth.

746
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,590
I thought I was a true feminist,
but I was talking to this young lady

747
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,840
about how beautiful women are and I was
like,

748
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,210
they like,
I like to be in place with beautiful

749
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,560
women.
They like cars once good,

750
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,750
you sure.
And she was like,

751
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,610
you objectify women.
And I was like,

752
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,230
well,
I guess I take the five women then,

753
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,440
you know,
you see that thing Jamie and a thing I

754
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,620
tweeted the other day from Cosmo
Cosmopolitan magazine side-by-side

755
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,930
cover.
It was a retweet from the amazing

756
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:39,764
atheist.

757
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,540
We'd a side by side cover.
One of them was white men who objectify

758
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:49,340
women are the effing worst.
And then,

759
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,370
and the very next cover it showed CV.
It's identifying men's bulges during the

760
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:58,340
Olympics.
Yup.

761
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,800
It's hilarious.
That's hypocrites.

762
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,820
Yeah.
But I always had confirmed,

763
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,560
confirmed men who objectify women are
effing horrible.

764
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Thirty six summer Olympic bulges that
deserve gold and then it's just guys abs

765
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,270
with their,
you know,

766
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,290
speedos,
looking at their cocks.

767
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,180
It's hilarious.
People are fucking hilarious.

768
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,100
I agree.
And I feel like,

769
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,100
you know,
when I talk I try to be as truthful as

770
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:27,500
possible,
but I only learned through my ignorance.

771
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
You know what I mean?
You only learn.

772
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,630
Well I learned,
we learned through my ignorance,

773
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,450
but you learned a lot from shit that you
didn't know I'm messing up.

774
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,313
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

775
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,980
Or Yeah.
Or not knowing.

776
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,370
Yeah,
I mean I think there's a,

777
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,460
I think feminism and all these things,
this is like a giant scale,

778
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,820
right?
And then there's,

779
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,240
there's feminism that totally makes
sense to me.

780
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,080
I think there's a lot of women that,
um,

781
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,790
they did get treated unfairly.
They work with assholes who just want to

782
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:01,080
fuck them or want to treat him like shit
because they're a woman or they have

783
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,680
power over them and they know they can
pull some stuff on them that they can't

784
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,940
pull on men.
I think that's 100 percent real and I

785
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,070
think there's a lot of women that are
awesome.

786
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,761
They're,
they're,

787
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,170
they're cool,
they're creative,

788
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,990
they're funny,
they're powerful and you know,

789
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,640
to call it feminism or whatever it is.
They're just awesome humans.

790
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,190
It happened to be women,
you know,

791
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:27,900
so I think like the,
in some ways the idea of feminism is to

792
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:32,901
recognize those women for what they are
just awesome human beings and to sort of

793
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,260
shield them and protect them against a
lot of sexism,

794
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,260
a lot of misogyny and a lot of shit that
gets directed and their direction.

795
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,910
And I know it's real.
I've seen it.

796
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,320
It's 100 percent real.
Yeah,

797
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,970
that's true.
It's a lot of sexism,

798
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,500
just like anybody that would say to you
that there's no racism that is fucking

799
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,960
papaschase.
Of course there's racism is racism

800
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,540
amongst black people,
against other black people.

801
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,530
Yeah.
I experienced that.

802
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,720
This,
I think there's just ignorance,

803
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:01,680
just foolish people and I think in a lot
of ways it's not even the people's

804
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:05,580
fault.
A lot of what we are is a measurement of

805
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,580
who our parents were,
who their parents were,

806
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,450
the neighborhoods that we lived in,
the people that were exposed to and the

807
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,230
think process,
the thought process that surrounds these

808
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,870
areas.
It's super difficult to escape.

809
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,150
You know,
it's just really hard for people to

810
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:25,290
think outside of the box.
It's easier now because you might live

811
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:29,280
in a bad neighborhood with a bunch of
silly people that don't think very well,

812
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,530
but you have access to the Internet now.
So now you can start to take it into

813
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,460
their ideas and consider those ideas and
say,

814
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,020
well,
maybe these fucking people around me are

815
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,550
asshole.

816
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,530
Well,
the problem with the Internet is,

817
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,290
and I got friends and family that don't
have the thought of going to the

818
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:47,030
Internet.
You know,

819
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,850
that's the problem with the Internet,
not the Internet.

820
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,600
But when you know that situation,
you know.

821
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,370
Um,
yeah.

822
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,430
So if I have a conversation with
somebody and I was like,

823
00:37:58,431 --> 00:37:59,980
why don't you just google it?
And they was like,

824
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:01,940
what I'm asking you.
Yeah.

825
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:03,590
You're,
you're hanging around with Chili people.

826
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,380
Well this is just real people.
I'm related to,

827
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,303
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

828
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,950
There's nothing you can do about that.
No,

829
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,060
but it's like you got to leave them
behind.

830
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,620
It's tough though.
It's tough.

831
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,550
It's tough,
man.

832
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,450
I mean,
I would have left,

833
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,370
but I realized once I left home,
the smarter,

834
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:21,650
the only person that's educated or the
person who thought outside the box is

835
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,350
gone.
You were the only person that was

836
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,820
thinking outside the box for the most
part.

837
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,420
Yeah.

838
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,500
Yeah.
Well,

839
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:30,980
what do they think about you being like
this sort of subversive comedian?

840
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,170
You know,
you're this like minded,

841
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:36,850
free speaking.
It says wild shit onstage.

842
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,300
You know,
they don't get it.

843
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,850
Uh,
the funding.

844
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,293
No,

845
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,940
to be honest,
I'm here to tell them they're wrong.

846
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,893
Nah,
they don't.

847
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,380
You can just tell by the look in their
face when they see it.

848
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,540
Um,
isn't that what they,

849
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,750
it's not worldstar hip hop.
Is that what they're expecting?

850
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,040
Yeah,
that's what they found.

851
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,870
Like,
look at this dude gets slapped,

852
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,000
know.
Yeah.

853
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,500
So it's just a different.
I've,

854
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,450
I've,
I've socially,

855
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:08,860
economically,
mentally crossed over,

856
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,180
uh,
but it happened so long ago that you

857
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:15,280
felt like you can't relate sometimes
when you're talking to them.

858
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,700
Well in a sense,
but the thing,

859
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,500
you know,
there's things you find interesting,

860
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,590
uh,
they might not find interesting and it's

861
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,720
always a thing in the black community
when they was like,

862
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,980
how a desegregation in the black
community because it took the doctors

863
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,530
and lawyers out of the community but
don't think,

864
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't want to hang around them.
Niggas ain't trying to sit around

865
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,650
motherfuckers that drink alcohol all
day,

866
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,380
you know what I mean?
And they tend to talk about how to

867
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:45,310
invest in what percentage the bank
returns versus,

868
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,270
you know,
uh,

869
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,453
our,
uh,

870
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,470
you know,
ira or something like that was like,

871
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,700
he tried to like.
So I see.

872
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,500
I understand why these things happen
now.

873
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,040
Why people move out.
Yeah.

874
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,050
Yeah.
You know,

875
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,930
um,
but that's the journey that I'm on.

876
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,480
And then I try to go back and his
spleen,

877
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:05,530
those things,
you know,

878
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,210
there's amazing aspects to all sorts of
different ethnicities,

879
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,210
different parts of the world,
different groups of humans.

880
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:18,410
There's like amazing aspects of their
culture that they,

881
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,830
they have that it's gonna,
it's gonna be weird if all that stuff

882
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:26,831
gets lost.
But I think ultimately what human beings

883
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,240
eventually you're going to have to
figure out is the only things that

884
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:36,530
matter or like,
I mean it's really like basically

885
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:39,350
straight Martin Luther King Jr.
Yeah,

886
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,580
judge a man by the content of his
character or a woman who are you.

887
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,680
But we can identifY each other so easily
by what we look like or where we're

888
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:50,240
from.
It's so easy.

889
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,280
So,
so many people are like so proud of

890
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:56,030
being from a certain part of the world
and in some place I think in some ways I

891
00:40:56,031 --> 00:40:59,660
think it's kinda cool.
Like armenians talk some shit about

892
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:04,190
Armenia and armenians.
They'll smack the fuck outta of play,

893
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:04,860
man.

894
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,790
They're fucking loyal to that and they
don't even live there anymore.

895
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,070
Man.
That's like being someone who's really

896
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,740
into being american and living in south
America.

897
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,990
You know,
you talk shit.

898
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:18,350
If you talk to shift to an ex pat like
that lives in south America,

899
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,460
you know,
if you're like,

900
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,720
man,
America is shit.

901
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,520
America's fucked up.
It's ruined the world.

902
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,031
He's like,
yeah,

903
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:24,790
that's why I'm here.
I'm here,

904
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,300
bitch,
get the fuck out.

905
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,240
I got the fuck out because they didn't
want to deal with anymore that you

906
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:31,970
can't.
Like there's something cool about that.

907
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:36,620
These people that come over and they are
unapologetically like one of the things

908
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,970
I like about armenians,
I don't mean to.

909
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm not picking on them,
I'm complimenting them.

910
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,220
They're unapologetically masculine.
Those dudes will were fucking wife

911
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:49,430
beaters.
Tank tops with a gold chains hanging

912
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:51,140
down.
It's hilarious.

913
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,430
They're like rockets.

914
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,670
So old school.
I like it.

915
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,880
A lot of ways to test out or they look
like they looked through.

916
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,580
You sometimes.
See I don't want to lose that because I

917
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:04,070
think there's something cool about what
that,

918
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,650
that,
that community represents.

919
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,490
I don't want to lose that.
I don't think you,

920
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,390
you lose it.
I hope not.

921
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,430
I mean,
I'm from a situation,

922
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,840
like I got african friends and when we
met they had to sneak me in their home.

923
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,520
Um,
because I'm not african really?

924
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,360
Because you're from America.
Yeah.

925
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,630
What part of africa?
They from Nigeria.

926
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,640
Okay.
It's funny like saying,

927
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,480
saying someone's african,
it's like you don't fucking big africa

928
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,980
is so many different countries in it.
I was a,

929
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,760
I think it was umeboshi.
I was watching some documentary about

930
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,080
Namibia last night.
I think it's a mirrored bia.

931
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,983
No,
maybe not.

932
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,970
Maybe Namibia.
Namibia.

933
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,340
Extremely under-populated.

934
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,690
It's enormous.
It's like bigger than Texas by like one

935
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,380
quarter,
which is Texas fucking huge.

936
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,130
So this country is bigger than Texas by
more than one quarter and I think it

937
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,070
only has like 2 million people in it.
And uh,

938
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,080
they were,
they were showing the little,

939
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,350
this one village that they visited,
how little rain father was.

940
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,830
They had one inch of rain in three
years.

941
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,290
It's crazy,
man.

942
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,030
When you look into how these people
live,

943
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:22,031
like I like watching documentaries that
highlight human beings that just easily

944
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:26,390
could be you or me easily if just this
happened.

945
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,880
And that happened.
And her mother gave birth in this weird

946
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,770
part of the world and they're just
people,

947
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,730
man,
they're waving.

948
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,490
These kids are real playful.
They're waving to everybody.

949
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:36,110
they,
they're waving to the camera.

950
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,680
They're so excited that the camera
people are there to film this and

951
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:42,680
they're out there cooking and it's so
dry,

952
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,890
it's so dry,
you know,

953
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,210
you look at it and be like,
where are they getting their water?

954
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,190
Where's the fucking water?
There's no water.

955
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,090
This is crazy.
They had a on this documentary,

956
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,740
they had a problem,
was a show.

957
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:58,880
It's actually called uncharted.
So this guy named jim shockey and he

958
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:02,030
travels all over the world and he's a
professional hunter.

959
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,580
And he visits these communities.
a lot of times he's helping people.

960
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,630
He had to,
they had to take out some crocodiles

961
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:13,250
that it'd become addicted to eating
people or customers accustomed to eating

962
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,480
people.
And this one,

963
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:18,900
they had to stop a hyena that was
killing all their livestock is hyena

964
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,200
would come in and just mangled their
livestock.

965
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,650
And uh,
they had to get up in the middle of the

966
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,920
night and then drive there super early
in the morning before the sun came up to

967
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:31,040
observe this hyena because he would only
be there for like a few moments.

968
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,100
The early,
early morning.

969
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,700
Then we'd Bolt.
But it looks like a werewolf like this

970
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:39,000
werewolf.
It's tearing apart this cow and I'm

971
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,980
watching this and I'm like,
man,

972
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,360
these people are living in these little
houses near this.

973
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:47,700
This fucking thing is out there.
Just mangling their cows.

974
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:49,830
They have no water.
It's dry as fuck.

975
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,830
It's so fascinating.
Men.

976
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,590
Anyway,
dot is a country in africa.

977
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,281
Yeah,
of course.

978
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:57,750
there's other countries that are
tropical.

979
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,760
There's other crunch.
it means africa's,

980
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,690
it is insane how big that place is.
I haven't even been.

981
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,290
I was going to go this summer,
but I found out that you have to take

982
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,110
malaria shots and I'm like,
I'm not going to have a malaria

983
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,630
medication to my kids.
Fuck that.

984
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,910
Fuck that.
Those shots.

985
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:17,640
I'm not a fan of.
The malaria ones are supposed to be

986
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,740
particularly abrasive on your body.
And there's,

987
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,520
I don't want to see my kids walking
around poison just because I thought it

988
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,110
would be cool to go see an elephant.

989
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,760
It's natural environment
to live on my own.

990
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,490
I mean,
I think it would be fucking cool to see

991
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,840
for sure.
Yeah.

992
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:36,450
Africa,
the africans I met with so real,

993
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:41,190
but they broke down.
The white man will theory to me,

994
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,440
the white man wolf yet.
What's that like?

995
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,250
You're not full blooded.
Not african.

996
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:47,740
Normal.
Are you white man's will.

997
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,750
You'd like to appear.
Oh,

998
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:51,240
that's you.
That you would be the white man's wolf.

999
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,120
That's why on the low the community
black people saying,

1000
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,220
no,
we're not african americans because they

1001
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,680
consider themselves african americans.
Yeah.

1002
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,310
I had a buddy of mine.
I went to africa to another black guy

1003
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,000
was telling me the same thing.
He's like,

1004
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:03,571
dude,
he goes,

1005
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,580
don't don't ever call yourself an
african american.

1006
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,110
He goes,
because you go over there.

1007
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:08,040
He goeS,
they don't like it.

1008
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,720
He goes,
they don't like you.

1009
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,960
They don't want to see you.
And they're jealous and they get angry

1010
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:14,970
at you and they want to fuck you up.
And I go,

1011
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,110
really?
He goes,

1012
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:17,760
don't ever think you're going back to
africa?

1013
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,190
No,
but it's weird because you see people

1014
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:22,080
holding up the fist and all this other
stuff,

1015
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,680
but we're so far removed.
I can send us a group of people that,

1016
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,170
you know,
the things have happened in our past.

1017
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,020
So we're afraid of that,
but we don't know how future looks

1018
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:31,930
either.
Well,

1019
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:36,320
it seems cool to have this idea that
there's africa and it's like,

1020
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,880
like fucking narnia or like it's like a,
it's like the,

1021
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,830
the blue people that lived in,
um,

1022
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,110
the fucking avatar avatar.
What was that planet?

1023
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,630
The planet they lived on.
That's what about the name of those

1024
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:55,980
trees with beautiful matt?
It's like I read it reminded me of other

1025
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,280
tanium.
Pandora.

1026
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,730
Pandora.
Dora.

1027
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,300
Yeah.
Pandora or I'm pandora and dora.

1028
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,560
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

1029
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,910
Um,
but I remember like the way people would

1030
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:15,830
think of a native american life,
like a,

1031
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,210
it's really similar.
Yeah,

1032
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,200
I think they'd had this idealic
existence.

1033
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,020
It was beautiful.
They lived in harmony with nature.

1034
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,230
They only killed what they needed.
And there's no war.

1035
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,440
Like I've had a bizarre conversation
with hippies about north America,

1036
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,430
but native americans,
and not that I'm anti native american,

1037
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:38,470
I'm by far the opposite.
I think it is insanely cool that this

1038
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,050
place was populated just a few hundred
years ago by people that were

1039
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:48,060
essentially living the way people live
tens of thousands of years ago.

1040
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,410
And they were successful at it.
They were,

1041
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,970
they didn't even horses,
man.

1042
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,160
They didn't have horses until european
settlers.

1043
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,970
There's a lot of people don't realize
what's even more fucking weird about

1044
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:01,420
that is that horses actually evolved in
north America.

1045
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,690
Horses started in north America and made
their way to africa on land masses and

1046
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,120
became zebras the course of millions of
years.

1047
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,140
This is a,
one of the weirdest things about plains

1048
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,830
indians and horses is that they didn't
really have them,

1049
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,350
but they,
there's some belief.

1050
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,410
this is all from this guy dan flores,
who's a,

1051
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,370
um,
I guess you would call it an

1052
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:26,830
environmental historian.

1053
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,410
I think that's what he's called.
Um,

1054
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,740
but I'm reading one of his books on
coyotes.

1055
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,160
But when he was talking about north
America that they almost,

1056
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,250
they had like,
almost like a myth about,

1057
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,810
uh,
about horses.

1058
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:45,220
Like it's possible that at one point in
time they had domesticated horses

1059
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,730
somewhere in north America,
killed tens of thousands of years ago.

1060
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:52,000
But this is all like pre ice age,
ice age,

1061
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:54,120
hits,
ice age thaws out like a lot.

1062
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:57,580
A lot of shit has gone down here.
But those people,

1063
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,240
they did not live in avatar.
Existence Is my point.

1064
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,270
Like native americans,
we would go to war with each other.

1065
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:06,700
They fucking kill each other.
They do horrible things.

1066
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,600
The ones in the great lakes area,
they did a lot of cannibalism.

1067
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,340
Yep.
The nez perce,

1068
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,410
I think they,
the name of the indian they were talking

1069
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,130
about,
they were like,

1070
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,360
kill their enemies and shIt.

1071
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,820
They would find trappers and kill them
and eat them.

1072
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,260
You know,
like it was not this beautiful world,

1073
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,990
but dave's doing the same thing.
But I thinK it's just a matter of

1074
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:27,010
resources.
Right.

1075
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,110
That's how I look at a light or.
Yeah,

1076
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,720
that's also the same reason why racism
exists.

1077
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,720
It's like people get in this us versus
them thing.

1078
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,420
We want these people,
whoever these people are,

1079
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:38,920
they want,
you know what?

1080
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,610
Everybody has to be on this team and
fuck everybody else because that's the

1081
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,620
only way they feel like they can
survive.

1082
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,470
That's the oLd way,
you know,

1083
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,010
but what's interesting to me,
I think is that in this day and age,

1084
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,540
thAt old way is just melting in front of
our eyes because people understand each

1085
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,220
other.
I mean white people,

1086
00:49:57,221 --> 00:50:01,000
that black lives movement hashtagged on
their fucking twitter page.

1087
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:06,100
A fuck load man.
How many people today are racist and

1088
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:08,800
compare it to a hundred years ago it was
probably radically lower.

1089
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,540
Is lower.
It's amazing.

1090
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,470
Like how white women want to fuck black
dudes because of this thing.

1091
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,970
Sure.
So in a way,

1092
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,540
it's not all for nothing.
You know what it's like to.

1093
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,300
It's like your first liner,
your first responder,

1094
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,750
like the nine slash 11 firemen.
They got mad pussy after nine slash 11.

1095
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,270
Those guys were superstars.
Girls would just fuck firemen for real,

1096
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,330
especially if a girl worked in a
building that was close to where the

1097
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,030
towers went down.
Like those guys were goddamn heroes

1098
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,980
there.
All their hero genes fired up.

1099
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,200
That's it.
I wonder if that's what makes men want

1100
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:41,210
to do it in the first place.
They know that women are going to think

1101
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:42,200
through heroes.
Fuck them.

1102
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,520
I think so.
I think guys like want to be the alpha,

1103
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,490
you know,
in a certain.

1104
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,240
I found my plAce to be an alpha,
you know what I mean?

1105
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,870
So if I was a black guy,
I would probably play up racism big time

1106
00:50:52,871 --> 00:50:56,680
just for white pussy.
However you could play it up

1107
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,940
its chicks that,
that told me yet now you just want to

1108
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,830
make out with black dude,
they feel nothing they could do.

1109
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,740
so they just want to make out what black
this guy and they could do.

1110
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,260
They feel they feel so whatever about
what's happening.

1111
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:11,080
Oh they want to just make out,
just to make,

1112
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,510
make it.
Could you somehow.

1113
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,120
And I was like,
you know,

1114
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,230
well,
there's a few videos that have come out

1115
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:20,980
this year to just every where
everybody's got to go.

1116
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:22,323
Okay,

1117
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:26,740
we'll now give me an excuse now explain
it now.

1118
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,070
There's a few that are like the one that
the guy got shot in his car,

1119
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,220
reaching for his wallet with his wife
and kid in the car with you telling me

1120
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,180
these things don't exist.
Because everybody was like,

1121
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,460
ah,
that's how they said it went down.

1122
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,990
But you know,
the guy probably said something or he

1123
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:45,760
went and reached for something or maybe
he had a record.

1124
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,920
Maybe they knew this guy was a
dangerous.

1125
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:48,990
Nope.
Nope,

1126
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:50,550
nope,
nope,

1127
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,870
nope.
Just to dude complying,

1128
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,020
reaching for his wallet and gets
unloaded on by some fucking psycho,

1129
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:03,061
some stressed out ptsd.
Who knows what the fuck is going on in

1130
00:52:03,851 --> 00:52:05,860
that guy's head.
Who knows?

1131
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,480
You know,
one of The things I thought was

1132
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:09,610
interesting,
they had this video online recently that

1133
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:11,880
I saw it was,
um,

1134
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,660
they took this guy who was an active,
um,

1135
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:20,730
he was a big time detractor of the
police who's talking about how horrible

1136
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:21,820
the police are.

1137
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,820
And they invited him to go through like
one of their police training safety

1138
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:29,070
courses.
And what they do is they,

1139
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,040
you're supposed to determine when to
shoot or when you,

1140
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,500
when you can get shot,
when,

1141
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:36,370
when someone can be a threat,
when you have to shoot them.

1142
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,420
It was fucking amazing.
It's amazing to watch because this guy

1143
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:44,260
in just a few of these scenarios started
freaking out.

1144
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,840
like he got shot in a couple of them.
When they shoot you,

1145
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,810
they shoot at the ground in front of you
with a blank.

1146
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:50,780
Like,
like.

1147
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,880
So you had to realize that this is how
quick a cop can get shot by a psycho.

1148
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,630
And so there's different times where he
got pulled over,

1149
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,680
he pulled someone over or where he was
handling this one guy in a parking lot

1150
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,650
and the guy went behind the car real
quick and they came out and shot him

1151
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:07,120
like within a second,
you know,

1152
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:07,954
it was like,
sir,

1153
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,060
can I see some identification,
sir?

1154
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,871
Yeah man.
Hey man,

1155
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:11,621
I'm just working,
dude.

1156
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,930
I'm skipping my stuff here.
And he goes in the back and pulls out a

1157
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:14,980
gun and shoots him.
He's like,

1158
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,500
this happened.
This is an actual scenario.

1159
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,120
Yeah.
This has happened and it's probably

1160
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:20,920
happened 100 times.
A bunch of times.

1161
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,420
Yeah.
So they have to.

1162
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,460
They're always fucking like this man.
They're always arguing.

1163
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,860
And you know how people are.
Some people like,

1164
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,150
oh my god,
we're almost out of gas.

1165
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,103
Oh my god,
we're almost,

1166
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,160
we're almost doing this.
What are we going to do?

1167
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,220
What we do there?
And you're like,

1168
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,510
will you shut the fuck up if we get out
of gas,

1169
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,440
will walk to a goddamn gas dash station.
It'll take us 20 minutes.

1170
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,450
We'll get some gas will come back.
Don't cry.

1171
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,770
Jesus christ.
Yeah,

1172
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,810
I know somebody to talk to a cop and
they said that when they started working

1173
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,960
and then 11 years later.
Oh yeah.

1174
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:56,030
Going into those areas where these
things always happen and after years and

1175
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,070
yeah,
it just,

1176
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,130
it just wears on you for sure.
And I know from the air just me growing

1177
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:04,050
up in situations,
you know what I mean?

1178
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,660
I wouldn't want to go back.
I barely go back there,

1179
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,010
you know,
so.

1180
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,830
But they do give you nerves.
Your nerves heightened,

1181
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,260
it naturally kicks in 100 percent,
you know,

1182
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,310
and like,
yeah.

1183
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,140
And soMe people can't handle those
nerves.

1184
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,240
You learned how To breathe quietly.
You don't know,

1185
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,690
like somebody,
you could walk down the street and

1186
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,720
somebody could pull a pistol out on
those things though.

1187
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,250
I've been driving down the street with
my ex lady and she was talking and I was

1188
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:31,980
like,
get down because I saw a guy draw on a

1189
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:36,480
corner and shoot across the street at
another guy that's the gun went up.

1190
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,640
We drove under the,
the,

1191
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,310
the,
the fire.

1192
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,480
Right.
But it was long.

1193
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,010
It was long.
Oh my god.

1194
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,080
And then they went up,
we went under,

1195
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,960
oh,
we got the second shot off and I drove

1196
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:49,890
and I was like,
man,

1197
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:51,390
that was crazy.
Like I'm that guy,

1198
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,130
like lady,
like get up,

1199
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:54,120
we made that was crazy.

1200
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,590
And she's like,
you didn't call the police.

1201
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:58,020
And I'm like,
for what is he like to tell what

1202
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:59,130
happened?
And I was like,

1203
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,600
I don't want to be.
And that's how crazy it is,

1204
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,790
the way you don't even want to be
involved because you've got to go to the

1205
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:08,610
cops.
And I ended up calling the police and

1206
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:10,890
I'm just like,
he described a victim.

1207
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,390
I was like,
white t shirt,

1208
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:14,630
blue jeans,
that's all I said.

1209
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,170
And that he was like,
was he black?

1210
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,260
And that was just a long pause.
It was a long poles like sarah is he

1211
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,580
black.
And I was like,

1212
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,541
man,
you know,

1213
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:28,860
that nick was black
man.

1214
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,830
It felt weird.
But yeah,

1215
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,810
because I realized,
yeah,

1216
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:39,570
like
it's just weird things that happened.

1217
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:44,571
But uh,
it's interesting with goes on because I

1218
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:46,770
met guys who shot at people before and
shot people.

1219
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,230
So if you hear anything About my set,
you know,

1220
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,740
I know both sides,
you know what I mean?

1221
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,950
So it's just interesting attitude,
you know,

1222
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:57,720
the chop people,
how many of them got caught?

1223
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:04,100
One.
Oh my god,

1224
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:09,220
one because he ended up shooting my best
friend's sister and her baby in a

1225
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,700
passion crime.
Oh jesus.

1226
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,940
And his last words to me was,
he was weird.

1227
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:16,860
I was leaving the house one night,
we was in the projectS,

1228
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,931
you know,
he played,

1229
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:19,320
you know,
play cards and shit,

1230
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,270
like I don't really want in thAt like
that.

1231
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,950
Um,
but I remember

1232
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,360
and he was on the steps and he looked,
he looked up at me and he's like a mad.

1233
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,700
He was like,
you're smart,

1234
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,270
you got a chance to get out of here.
And it was one of those weird moments,

1235
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,250
You know,
uh,

1236
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,420
and he was like,
man,

1237
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,520
just keep doing you.
No matter how weird or whatever,

1238
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,340
people say,
y'all just keep doing you type.

1239
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,120
He's like,
I love you.

1240
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,190
And I use love like that.
So I was just like,

1241
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,660
all right,
you know,

1242
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,270
and then I left.
And then that was my last tIme seeing

1243
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:51,610
him.
You know,

1244
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,980
how long after that did they do the
crime?

1245
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:58,870
Probably like a week or two
because I was out of town and I got back

1246
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,940
and they were just.
Yeah,

1247
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,150
there's war zones.
That's what more zone.

1248
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,420
I mean,
when you're in an area that has a lot of

1249
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:11,500
shootings,
so much so that you drive under a car.

1250
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,470
You don't even want to call the cops,
you know,

1251
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,340
if you saw something like that in
beverly hills,

1252
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:19,040
if you were an average person who's like
a successful accountant,

1253
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,710
he was a nice home in beverly hills and
you're driving to your house and someone

1254
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,140
shoots over your car,
fucking for sure you're calling the

1255
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,130
police,
right?

1256
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,820
Because it's rare.
Doesn't happen.

1257
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:32,170
They're very often.
That is if you think,

1258
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,620
how many people died during war time?
Every year.

1259
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,050
Um,
how many find this out,

1260
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:39,520
jamie?
How many?

1261
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,070
Uh,
I wonder if this is possible to know.

1262
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,400
I was going to say,
how many shootings occur in Iraq and

1263
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:49,140
Afghanistan?
How many military involved exchanges of

1264
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:54,150
firearms?
And then compare it to how many people

1265
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:58,000
get killed in America every day from
gunfire and you know,

1266
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:58,950
everybody's like,
well,

1267
00:57:58,951 --> 00:58:01,420
this is just a gun,
a gun,

1268
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:02,254
right?
Tissue.

1269
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,960
No,
just not just looking at what's

1270
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:07,420
happening,
like looking at where they're like super

1271
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:11,530
dangerous spots and the,
and the in the mindset and the lack of

1272
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,620
the so called lack of resources people
think they have.

1273
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,430
Yeah.
Um,

1274
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,240
I all.
When you say lack of resources,

1275
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:21,320
you mean no hope for the future.
Oh,

1276
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:23,140
it just fear based.
So I got to eat.

1277
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,450
You know what I mean?
Like the power company don't care that,

1278
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,340
you know,
you all love each other and you're

1279
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,830
trying to go to better your life.
Exactly.

1280
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,640
And Sometimes your lady,
your girl don't even want to heAr that

1281
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:37,330
either.
I think that is a big part of what keeps

1282
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:39,970
these communities exactly the same way.
You know,

1283
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:44,200
there's a dude named eddie wong,
he's a chef and an author and he's done

1284
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:46,380
a bunch of cool shit and he's funny
dudes.

1285
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:51,390
Got a show on vice and he brought up
this idea of universal basic income and

1286
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:52,541
he's like,
you know,

1287
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:56,410
just giving people enough money every
year so they live,

1288
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,730
you know,
like you don't have to worry about your

1289
00:58:57,731 --> 00:58:58,450
bills,
you don't have to.

1290
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,070
Everything's paid for.
yeah.

1291
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,930
Everything after that you have to work
for.

1292
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,960
And I remember thinking time is fucking
ridiculous.

1293
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,400
You can't get.
People think people are going to get

1294
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:07,760
fucking lazy.
They're just not,

1295
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,250
that is not,
that's not gonna work.

1296
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,810
But now the more I think about it,
the more I think of that might be like

1297
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:18,811
the best way to curb crime,
the curb need to curb people doing

1298
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:22,190
things at a total desperation to,

1299
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,800
uh,
to curb A certain amount of despair that

1300
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:27,650
some people feel.
And then from there it might be like a

1301
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:32,651
jumpstart for people pursuing other
ideas that might successfully contribute

1302
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:34,510
to the economy.
and I'm,

1303
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:38,900
I don't know enough about the economy to
really comment is I'm just reading a

1304
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:41,300
bunch of different things a bunch of
people have said about it.

1305
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,140
And I'm like,
well,

1306
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:45,650
so it might actually make sense in terms
of law enforcement,

1307
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,640
in terms of unemployment,
like all sorts of different things you

1308
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:53,300
would have to factor in like where the
money would come from.

1309
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,560
and I was like,
wow,

1310
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,070
it's kind of counterintuitive.
But once you look into what you like,

1311
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,970
look if how many of these people that
are super desperate and don't have money

1312
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,360
for bills,
there's no jobs.

1313
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,890
How many of those people would relax a
lot if they got x amount of dollars a

1314
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,650
year,
whatever it is,

1315
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,600
they would survive.

1316
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,430
I know like with myself,
I'm like,

1317
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:15,800
I'm around people that make money now
and they like,

1318
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:17,810
money's not important,
but I'm like,

1319
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,540
you made it to the mountaintop already.
You know what I mean?

1320
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:24,230
You made a certain income,
but when you're surviving you don't have

1321
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:29,380
time to feel things.
You don't have time to be philosophical,

1322
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:30,260
to fail.
Yeah.

1323
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,350
I feel like I'm sad.
You know what I mean?

1324
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,940
Like,
or these things.

1325
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:38,870
Like I even look at my mom definitely
now because she had at one point lost

1326
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:43,871
her children and she had to get them
back and she raised us in survival mode

1327
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:48,110
so she never thought or reading a self
help book or learn how to money manage

1328
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,390
all those things,
you know what I mean?

1329
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:53,840
And me and my sister had a place now
where we could do those things,

1330
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,240
you know,
we can talk about,

1331
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,600
you know,
how we feel or even look back and see

1332
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:00,500
where we went wrong.

1333
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,410
And tHat's just a luxury that,
you know,

1334
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,060
I see what you're saying.
My mother,

1335
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,560
who was a father,
a mother,

1336
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:10,530
a woman who becomes a guy and take
though roles on it,

1337
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,550
does something to her emotionally,
you know what I mean?

1338
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,830
Uh,
you know,

1339
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,290
so,
um,

1340
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,060
when the kids is gone now she might have
a chance to grow and see what things

1341
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:25,340
went wrong.
If she doesn't feel it's too late.

1342
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,340
Yeah.
But in survival mode,

1343
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:33,260
I try to tell people that who tried to
talk about these issues but never have

1344
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:37,910
been in this situation before and feel
the need to go out and see why people

1345
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:41,740
get out and don't look back or they try
to help people and people concentrating

1346
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,760
on other things.
The reason why.

1347
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,230
Yeah.
That.

1348
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,260
Yeah,
the survIval mode is very primal.

1349
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,900
You know,
the law,

1350
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,700
the law don't matter and survival model
or a.

1351
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,090
Yeah,
you can take things.

1352
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,940
You could run up in this door and take
things because you just that hungry.

1353
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:02,460
You know what I mean?
So yeah.

1354
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,400
I've seen and been a part of all these
things.

1355
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:06,800
You like clothes,
you want luxury stuff to the point that

1356
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,420
you would take it,
you know,

1357
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:11,560
go to the mall and take a polo shirt.
Yeah.

1358
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,970
You know what I mean?
You know,

1359
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,220
so yeah.
Yeah.

1360
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:20,130
Survival mode is a place that most have
no idea,

1361
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,870
right?
Most people would just guessing me

1362
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,550
included,
just guessing.

1363
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,520
Well,
as people that is in a situation even

1364
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:28,500
worse than mine and I'm.
Yeah.

1365
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,640
You see what it,
it,

1366
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,500
it does the people.
And after a while they kind of like it.

1367
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,310
They might make six figures,
but they still go to the projects

1368
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,100
because it's exciting.
It's exciting.

1369
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,480
One and two.
They can't communicate with people

1370
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:46,490
who've been making 100,000 they whole
life.

1371
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:47,540
I grew up in that situation.

1372
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,121
Well,
you know,

1373
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:50,250
that's a big thing with people that go
to war.

1374
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,220
People that have been to war,
they for some reason,

1375
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:56,580
even though it was awful and saw friends
die.

1376
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,920
It was the best time of their life.
Yeah.

1377
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,810
It's like there's something about living
knowing that any moment you could be

1378
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:07,560
dead that makes the live moments,
the moments where you're not that more

1379
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:11,400
special and then you come back here and
everything's sort of muted.

1380
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,830
Yeah.
Just tone down.

1381
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,050
You know?
I think that's why a lot of rich people,

1382
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,180
they start,
if they don't have any meaning in their

1383
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,770
life,
they don't have a thing that they're

1384
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:22,020
really into.
They just start buying shit.

1385
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,460
They just start collecting houses and
boats and they're just trying to figure

1386
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:28,680
out there's got to be something exciting
to do here.

1387
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,660
There's got to be something.

1388
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,920
Yeah.
You know.

1389
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,730
Well,
once I started making like $30,000 a

1390
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:37,940
year doing a standup,
it changed me because I came,

1391
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:40,280
I wasn't invited to la.
I slept on the floor for a year.

1392
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,970
You know what I mean?
I did the whole car thing and built

1393
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,100
everything up from there.
He lived in out of the car.

1394
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,290
You were doing that for like a couple of
weeks,

1395
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,930
you know,
but everybody's got a cool story that

1396
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,390
makes it,
that might make it that I know a lot of

1397
01:03:53,391 --> 01:03:56,660
people like rhonda rousey.
She had a cool living out of that was a

1398
01:03:56,661 --> 01:03:58,990
very interesting interview.
A lot of emotional,

1399
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,940
a lot of people that live in out of your
car,

1400
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,310
you be to meet x.
That's kinda normal for la.

1401
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,270
But I figured,
I think I made it cop.

1402
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,140
Pardon me,
think I made him.

1403
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,660
I graduate from college because I was a
fresh graduate from college and I was

1404
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,250
like,
I got to unlearn everything I was

1405
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:14,084
taught.
now

1406
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,960
how so?
Because it's institutionalized thinking

1407
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,820
to me there's no difference between the
university.

1408
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,500
Yeah.
There's no difference between college

1409
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:24,740
and prison sometimes to meet what bay
way different.

1410
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,180
You can quit college.
Well,

1411
01:04:26,181 --> 01:04:27,620
yeah you can't.
you can't.

1412
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,510
That's true.
But you know,

1413
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:32,680
both get money for how many occupants
they have and right.

1414
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:37,220
I Look at those stats and they teach.
You assert it's a society within both,

1415
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,920
you know.
Then even the military,

1416
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,840
because I went to Afghanistan for 13
days,

1417
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,610
I think colleges are incredibly
important,

1418
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,940
but I think that like all things when
the world around them evolved quicker

1419
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,290
than they do,
it creates issues and I think a lot of

1420
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,870
what you're seeing,
I've,

1421
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:01,140
I've talked to some kids who go to
school that are taking these classes

1422
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:05,370
from ridiculous left wing professors who
are basically communists.

1423
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,523
You know,
there,

1424
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:09,720
there's a lot of them.
IT's not just a few and this left wing

1425
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,650
thinking is like super uber prevalent on
campus to the point where it's like

1426
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:18,651
distorting kid's versions and views of
the world and it's trickled down.

1427
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:22,390
It's the students is to faculty.
There's a lot going on.

1428
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,480
It's ultimately a lot of it is like the
people at the very top of it all.

1429
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,370
It's really kind of fascinating because
those people are shaping people's minds

1430
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,950
and they're involved in a lot of ways
from what comes out of that in a

1431
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,710
cultural sense,
but there's a lot of backlash because

1432
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,120
that too is a lot of people that are
going to those schools and now we're

1433
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:46,121
reading online accounts of what these
professors do and how these.

1434
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:50,560
A lot of these professors have zero
experience in the world itself.

1435
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,080
They just live in academia.
They,

1436
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,040
they get the degree can go from getting
a degree to teaching and they teach and

1437
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:01,090
they just don't enter the world,
so they live in this world of these sort

1438
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:06,091
of esoteric ideas or these philosophies
that they would like to be real but

1439
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:10,660
might not necessarily be real.
They teach kids.

1440
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:14,800
I was kind of fortunate in that because
like I test,

1441
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:19,730
I took some weird tests in elementary
school that sent me to these schools,

1442
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,720
a upper middle class high school and
they just figure it out.

1443
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:25,190
You're smart.
Yeah,

1444
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:28,020
but It alienated me from my community,
my,

1445
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,080
like my.
We got bused to a school,

1446
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:33,680
so everybody in my apartment complex got
on the bus and went to school And then

1447
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:38,570
we got separated to where it was like
five black people in this class and when

1448
01:06:38,571 --> 01:06:42,320
we would go to lunch we have to walk on
different sides of the hall and

1449
01:06:42,321 --> 01:06:45,060
everybody in my neighborhood just coming
through the whole stuff.

1450
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:50,390
So things started to happen then,
but how could they not see that coming?

1451
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,880
That almost seems like one of those
government experiments,

1452
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,180
lIke a psychological tuskegee
experiment,

1453
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,280
you know what I mean in a,
in a sense.

1454
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,910
But what happened was by the time,
like my professors were like rich

1455
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:06,650
millionaires because they taught the
subject that they did well in.

1456
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,850
Right.
You know what I mean?

1457
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,580
Uh,
I would say like a comedy comedian,

1458
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:14,370
I mean a comedy class,
except that that teacher made it right.

1459
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,930
You know what I mean?
So they write books and they write their

1460
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:19,700
own books.
They got millions,

1461
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:23,120
you know,
they're doing this because they want to,

1462
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,710
you know,
they retired already.

1463
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,460
I think my stat teacher retired at 30,
you know what I mean?

1464
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,130
30.
Yeah.

1465
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,740
He wrote his own book and I didn't like
that goddamn because I couldn't steal

1466
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:37,580
this book.
You couldn't steal It went up because he

1467
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:39,980
wrote his own book.
So he gave.

1468
01:07:39,981 --> 01:07:43,170
We had to buy it from him and,
and he download the uh,

1469
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,110
downloaded somehow.
Oh,

1470
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:47,210
that's interesting.
But sold you his aunt.

1471
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,750
He had to sell his books.
Every time a class he taught.

1472
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,190
Ooh,
that's tricky.

1473
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:56,060
So I went to college my freshman year
and then have books because in high

1474
01:07:56,061 --> 01:07:58,370
school they provided books,
books.

1475
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,940
So I made a,
I made money to buy a book and they got

1476
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:05,880
booked buyback programs,
but they give you 25 percent with a

1477
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,900
book's worth and I just couldn't get
into that.

1478
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:14,240
So I had this still books and I would
sell the books at 50 percent.

1479
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:18,980
You steal them and sell them.
And what would you steal a physical copy

1480
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:21,290
of the book?
Where would you get them from the

1481
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,690
bookstore to snag them from the
bookstore?

1482
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,510
Yeah,
because the thIng that the alarm they

1483
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:29,600
had where they alarm and it's fun
because the engineering books school,

1484
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:33,560
but it never was hooked up properly.
So.

1485
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,350
And I was standing up just to put it in
my waistband and walk out.

1486
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,910
This is all very alleged.
Id never really happened.

1487
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,320
Never really happened.
You know what I mean?

1488
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:42,530
This is just fiction.
If I was the right cast,

1489
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,020
if I was to write a book though is how
it will be done.

1490
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,290
Right.
But I didn't do it like a massive.

1491
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,660
I didn't do massive because I know what
grand theft is.

1492
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,980
Right.
You know what I mean?

1493
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:56,350
So it's only a few people that I
supplied and it's easy.

1494
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,100
You buy,
you getting it for 50 percent and then

1495
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,410
you can have that money back at the end
of the semester.

1496
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,670
Yeah.
That's a good deal.

1497
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,960
Yeah.
That's a pretty good deal when,

1498
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,460
when except for stealing,
stealing,

1499
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,570
stealing part.
But

1500
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:12,880
I allegedly might've gotten college
books that way to a lot of super common.

1501
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,240
Well Today kids can just download most
things,

1502
01:09:16,241 --> 01:09:16,571
right?
Yeah,

1503
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,610
that's true.
It must be really hard for them to sell

1504
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:22,630
their books now because kids can just go
to like a bit torrent because especially

1505
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:26,020
if there's like a college course that's
an a major university and most likely

1506
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:28,420
someone's gonna upload it to a torrent.
Right?

1507
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,670
We assume,
but we wasn't tourists.

1508
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,910
I went to school when napster drops,
so we was a group.

1509
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,790
Oh shit.
That's pushed all that for.

1510
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:39,490
I remember now.
I remember the crazy argument about

1511
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:43,030
napster.
I remember I had to sit back and go.

1512
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,900
I remember very clearly when that
metallica guy got involved,

1513
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:51,990
lars ulrich got involved and he was
saying that this is stealing and and it

1514
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:55,840
was going crazy and freaking out.
I remember literally sitting back

1515
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,720
because I was listening to it on sirius
satellite radio.

1516
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,680
I Think it wasn't something I was
listening to something on my car.

1517
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,050
What year was that?
Like what year was napster?

1518
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,410
O two.
Was there even sirius satellite radio.

1519
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:11,260
My imagine this might have been the
radio actual radio.

1520
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:15,700
Xm was right around that same time.
I think it might've been whoever was out

1521
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:16,810
here,
it might have been howard stern.

1522
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,050
it was listening to something and they
were talking about it and I remember

1523
01:10:20,051 --> 01:10:22,780
thinking just stepping back and going,
whoa,

1524
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:27,220
this is a new thing.
Like people have figured out how to get

1525
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:32,221
stuff for free online that normally it'd
be like 20 bucks or 10 bucks,

1526
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:34,690
where the fuck it is.
And I remember thinking,

1527
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:38,020
whoa,
this is a new door that just opened up.

1528
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:41,080
I remember,
I remember like sitting back in my

1529
01:10:41,081 --> 01:10:42,220
chair,
I was in my car,

1530
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:45,670
I remember the fucking parking lot.
I was going to buy dog food and I was

1531
01:10:45,671 --> 01:10:47,800
listening to this and I remember I sat
back and I went,

1532
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,930
oh man,
this was a moment.

1533
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:52,150
Yeah,
it was a real moment in our culture.

1534
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,750
Well before then,
look,

1535
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,870
our dorms didn't even have the internet,
right?

1536
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:59,210
You didn't have an internet.
You sTill had to go to the computer lab.

1537
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,550
So check this out,
check this out.

1538
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,680
This was the hustle.
We met two white guys.

1539
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,150
One guy broke his foot when he was young
and his dad gave him my old computer and

1540
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:11,300
he started working a little car game and
from there he learned programming.

1541
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,120
Right.
He said we can get him access to a

1542
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:20,121
computer lab.
He could supply our rooms with internet

1543
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,260
because they was wired,
but it wasn't hooked up.

1544
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,380
Oh,
so he can get the numbers and if and

1545
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,130
statements and make the thing
communicate with one another.

1546
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:33,030
So a few of us in the dorms had
internet.

1547
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,710
whoa.
And this hack the door,

1548
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,120
it's like an episode of mash and this
the problem with learning how to learn

1549
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:40,440
how to hustle and survival mode.

1550
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:45,390
You learn how to get stuff for free,
but you don't learn how to monetIze it

1551
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:49,040
all the time.
But what we did was we,

1552
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,380
we started selling like cds and stuff
like that.

1553
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,870
You know what I mean?
So you download stuff and then sell,

1554
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,820
sell,
sell because nobody had laptops.

1555
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:00,420
I'm nothing like that.
Oh wow.

1556
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,580
Yeah.
A friend of mine called the crazy

1557
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:04,430
stories.
We're going to look back on this.

1558
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,480
This is like,
those people were in the camera first

1559
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:07,620
got invented.
Yeah.

1560
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,740
Yeah.
We started around for four hours and he

1561
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:13,530
painted us.
You know whaT I mean?

1562
01:12:13,531 --> 01:12:16,350
This is literally what that's like.
This is what happens man.

1563
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,320
And thanks to I think a year or two
earlier,

1564
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,340
I was in the crack game a little bit.
You were in the crack game a little bit.

1565
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:27,210
Like 600 would be a meme.
I was in the crack game a little bit.

1566
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:32,270
What this thing was new.
ThiS thing was a new hustle because more

1567
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:35,000
people love music.
Yeah.

1568
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,730
When did the crack game open up?
That was 80.

1569
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:42,440
The eighties something.
That was when everything became a.

1570
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,160
They blamed everything on crack.
Yeah,

1571
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:46,410
it was.
They literally blamed everything on

1572
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:47,490
crack.
The epidemic.

1573
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:49,410
like all white people are terrified to
crack.

1574
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,780
They thought that for sure.
For sure.

1575
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:55,170
Do you want to match that brand?
Now you're lookIng at it.

1576
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:58,760
Oh wow.
So like the top off of it.

1577
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,270
Put in your drink,
you'll get smArter.

1578
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,670
It um,
it affected me in the nineties,

1579
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,250
mid nineties.
How so?

1580
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,430
With my father and my aunt
to see,

1581
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:13,350
see a deterioration,
deterioration of people

1582
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,520
and families,
like full on

1583
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,140
somebody you look up to.
Just,

1584
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,920
you know,
it was a,

1585
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,680
it was a way for people to get coke way
easier.

1586
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:29,783
Right?
Yeah.

1587
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,710
That's basically what it is at the same
high for it or the amount of for

1588
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,531
cheaper,
you know what I mean?

1589
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:35,400
Five,
$10,

1590
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,280
but it has a different effect.
It must have some sort of a different

1591
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:40,140
effect because people said that the
crack thing,

1592
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,680
like after you do it,
it's like really good in the beginning

1593
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,590
and then it's not so good after awhile.
But at the same with coke,

1594
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:51,830
I think you still chasing that happened.
Did you ever know say yet though?

1595
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,620
Leaving the possibility.
Open bowers ready to party,

1596
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,120
you know,
everything I've done,

1597
01:13:57,121 --> 01:14:02,121
I do it for experiment with it and to
understand addiction and learn like

1598
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:09,681
comedy makes me so happy that I don't
have to lean on anything for any

1599
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:12,850
emotional thing.
So when I do it it's just to see what

1600
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:14,210
it's like.
Right.

1601
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:17,440
So like when I did shrooms,
you know,

1602
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:20,680
that was,
I was there documenting the experience

1603
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,360
and then I will go back into it and then
I can go out being self aware mentally.

1604
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,660
Almost like from an engineering
perspective,

1605
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:33,250
we trYing to back engineer what's going
on during these drugs to try to figure

1606
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,370
it out.
Let me write this stuff down.

1607
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,000
Then I'll go back and look at it and try
to figure out how I got there.

1608
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:39,310
Well,
even when I got into business,

1609
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:41,500
it was like,
let's see what makes you so powerful.

1610
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,140
I remember having it in my hand like,
let'S see what makes you so powerful.

1611
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:45,970
You were sayIng that to the crack
itself.

1612
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,220
What did it say?
oh sure.

1613
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,360
You basically,

1614
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,080
when it ended,
what was the low?

1615
01:14:54,081 --> 01:14:56,780
For me,
when I stopped selling the low,

1616
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,950
it was a low for me because I didn't
know that the person who sells it is

1617
01:15:00,951 --> 01:15:05,750
addicted just as much as the user
because you're addicted to selling it.

1618
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,430
The power,
the money.

1619
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:12,010
When you walk in a building and people
know who you are and people you can use

1620
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,480
the control you have over people.
I'm like,

1621
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:14,990
this will wipe

1622
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,010
power.
Feels like

1623
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,230
that's.
It was a guy who ran into a store,

1624
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:28,400
got some clothes and brought it back
because he dIdn't have any money.

1625
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,060
That's a powerful thing,
you know?

1626
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:33,780
Right.
Yeah.

1627
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,940
People are sucking your dick,
you know,

1628
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,573
stuff like that.

1629
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:41,730
Wait a minute.
How's it equate to guide getting some

1630
01:15:41,731 --> 01:15:43,230
clothes and bring them back?
What?

1631
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,220
How,
what the power.

1632
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,203
Yeah,

1633
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,240
because they don't.
There's nothing they would normally do.

1634
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,390
You can make somebody do that.
You know what I mean?

1635
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:55,320
So I look at it like if I was,
and I can think like a one percent

1636
01:15:55,321 --> 01:15:57,750
because I got a business education in
business.

1637
01:15:57,751 --> 01:16:01,470
So they give you a republican mindset.
So if I was in control of over society,

1638
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:04,500
right?
And I had a group of poor people and I

1639
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:08,440
control the resources and this happened
on the street with drugs to this drug,

1640
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,470
they will get robbed.
If I control the resources,

1641
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:14,070
I can allow it to go out or I can not
allow to go out.

1642
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:18,090
I can control the price point and if you
can't afford it,

1643
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,250
you know what I mean?
Then it's like,

1644
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:22,320
okay,
let's see what else you could do

1645
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,220
to get this thing that you want.
So you were getting addicted to the

1646
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:33,250
power of controlling these people,
having these people dependent upon you

1647
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,390
that you would show up,
you be important,

1648
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,850
you'd be making money doing something
that's kind of dangerous.

1649
01:16:37,851 --> 01:16:39,080
There's like a bunch of different things
going on,

1650
01:16:39,081 --> 01:16:41,660
but I think I did it enough to see it,
but I didn't do it long enough to get

1651
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,230
out.
I think probably like six months or a

1652
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:45,770
semester to.
How'd you get out of it?

1653
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,083
I had the

1654
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:51,920
one point I had,
I got propositioned to take control over

1655
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:55,640
this town and it was at a point
consciously why?

1656
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,510
Like I was at a private college.
I lived the triple life.

1657
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:04,511
I had basketball scholarship,
I had classes that I was failing.

1658
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,750
It was a religious college,
I had white friends and then I would go

1659
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:11,750
to the black community and hustle at
night.

1660
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,420
There's a lot of stuff to do.
You know what I mean?

1661
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,500
And I'm like,
at one point I was shot at,

1662
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,780
I was hanging with my white friends and
they didn't know what the fuck was going

1663
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:23,120
on.
He got shot at with your white friends

1664
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,930
because they wanted to buy weed,
but guess what?

1665
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:28,160
They had to go get weed in this other
place.

1666
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:30,000
You know what I mean?
Uh,

1667
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,220
yeah.
so,

1668
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:33,830
and that,
that person allegedly,

1669
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,900
his uncle worked for me.

1670
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,260
this is the first allegedly of all this
is a legit,

1671
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:41,570
you know what I mean?
So,

1672
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,930
uh,
I remember it was a pharmaceutical

1673
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:48,110
company in that town that made a lot of
money and I remember standing outside

1674
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,780
face to face with it and I was like,
this is a setup,

1675
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,410
we will never win this.
All the money Is right here in this

1676
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:57,640
pharmaceutical company is illegal,
you know,

1677
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,780
and I met a guy who was addicted to
crack and he owns a pharmaceutical

1678
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:06,530
company and cvs bought them out for like
one point five,

1679
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,200
one point $8,000,000 and you know,
all that money went,

1680
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,270
you know,
um,

1681
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,350
and uh,
and these and these things made me be

1682
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:17,810
like.
And then the fact I was getting angry

1683
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,820
because I'm feeling realized how unfair
life is because now mean black people

1684
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,390
who grandparents went to college,
you know what I mean?

1685
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,440
And during that time they will do like
brown paper bag test to see if he was

1686
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:32,390
allowed to go to school within the black
community.

1687
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:36,080
They will put a brown paper bag up to
you and if you were lighter than that,

1688
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:39,080
you know,
you could go to school and stuff.

1689
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:42,410
But yeah,
who did this?

1690
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,000
This was like certain hbsu bsu,
black universities and stuff like that.

1691
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,520
I know they would do that just to get
into a fraternity,

1692
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,450
you know?
Really?

1693
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,980
Yeah.
You could research this stuff.

1694
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:56,190
A brown paper bag is so white.
I know you're telling me,

1695
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,043
look at me.

1696
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,890
Wow.
Uh,

1697
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:05,420
so the anger started to come and then
you In the streets hustling.

1698
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:07,940
And I don't think I had the mentality.
It got to one part.

1699
01:19:07,941 --> 01:19:10,610
I knew that if I crossed the line,
lIke if I woulda hurt,

1700
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:14,150
harm somebody in a very bad way,
there's no coming back from that.

1701
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,370
I don't think I was ready to make that
decision.

1702
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,520
But I do know the guys,
when I left,

1703
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,040
he went on to build that part of town
and finished.

1704
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,470
It was just two of us at the time.
But it became a a crew of six and each

1705
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,260
made 13,
five a week.

1706
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:33,530
Take home mom.
By the time they hit five,

1707
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:36,530
six or seven years.
But by the time I linked back up wIth

1708
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:40,790
him,
he was the only one left alive,

1709
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:45,970
alive or not in jail.
And no religion saved them reAlly.

1710
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:49,400
So he pulled it out because religion,
the rest of them are gone.

1711
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:52,490
Yeah.
But I just saw the way my mind works.

1712
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:54,190
I just saw stuff early.
You know,

1713
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,600
you just put the pieces together early.
Right?

1714
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,720
Well that's,
that's a skill I just killed a lot of

1715
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:02,510
people who have to learn.
And you learn about watching either you

1716
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,660
do your own fuck ups or you watch a lot
of people fuck up around you.

1717
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,040
Yeah.
Like if you talked to the children

1718
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,840
of alcoholics,
they rarely drink.

1719
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,790
Not,
I shouldn't say rarely.

1720
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:15,630
When I should say is I run into a lot of
people who were the children of

1721
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:19,530
alcoholics who realize like fuck that
noise.

1722
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:24,650
And they realized growing up with
unreliable parents fucked up and this

1723
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:30,510
and those people like proof positive.
You don't have to actually go through

1724
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,190
the mistake to learn yourself,

1725
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,700
but once I learned I didn't hate drug
dealers no more,

1726
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:39,790
but until then I did because one,
not my dad I out and they,

1727
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:44,300
I heard he climbed the flagpole for,
for fun because he didn't have no money.

1728
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:48,230
But before then this was the guy that
raised me who,

1729
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:52,610
who managed to.
We live in a small bedroom apartment,

1730
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:57,670
two bedroom apartment to him,
a five bedroom house and cars and boats

1731
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:03,110
because he was just that smart and good
and I seen it all disappeared,

1732
01:21:03,111 --> 01:21:05,080
you know what I mean,
what I call it,

1733
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:07,310
like Carol King falling or something
like that.

1734
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:12,070
So I just wanted to see like the other
parts of that and I will be in the crack

1735
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:17,090
crack house asking people's parents
about their kids how to make kids feel

1736
01:21:17,091 --> 01:21:19,250
about this and they,
you know.

1737
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:19,671
No,
no,

1738
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:20,470
no.
YoU know,

1739
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:23,240
I talk about that right now.
Like I'm like,

1740
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:26,210
so even during that time,
still like gathering information and

1741
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:27,500
just,
you know,

1742
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,770
well,
what's most insidious about crack is

1743
01:21:30,771 --> 01:21:35,450
that affects poor neighborhoods in
general and black neighborhoods in

1744
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:37,070
particular.
Like

1745
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:41,580
that was one of the weIrder drugs
because there was cracking poor white

1746
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:44,900
neighborhoods.
Like there was an area called lowell in

1747
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,170
Massachusetts that had a big problem,
I think it was crack or was it heroin?

1748
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,160
But there's a lot of it was crack
neighborhoods for sure.

1749
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:55,470
Like I know I know poor white people
that smoke crack,

1750
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,920
but it seems way more prevalent in black
communities And it,

1751
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,170
I always wonder like,
what is,

1752
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:07,050
um,
what's the need that's being met when,

1753
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:10,110
when a,
when a drug provides a certain type of

1754
01:22:10,111 --> 01:22:12,660
sensation,
like what is the need that's being met

1755
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,580
that is uniquely attracted to certain
neighborhoods.

1756
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,230
I don't know that I really don't know.
I know it was cheap for certain.

1757
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,470
It wasn't cheap where we was doing it,
that that's what made it so profitable.

1758
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:28,320
But do you think that it's because of
all these pressures that you were

1759
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:29,430
talking about,
like you're,

1760
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:33,210
you're talking about this despair.
He talking about how it just feels like

1761
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:36,660
you can't get out,
you're stuck in this bad place with all

1762
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:41,661
this danger and violence and just the
constant fucking pressure of that.

1763
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,170
Yeah,

1764
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,890
I think so.
I think I look at what my dad,

1765
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,030
the type of people they are personality
wise,

1766
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:50,600
very friendly and then being in a bible
belt where you're taught to behave a

1767
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:54,870
certain way but they are real like horny
people and they like the fuck.

1768
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:56,870
It's true.
You know what I mean?

1769
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:57,890
They do.
You know what I mean?

1770
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:02,891
So I'm just Being confined,
you know,

1771
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,170
growing up with two parents.
I here,

1772
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:08,080
my friend be like they have to have
pressures.

1773
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,300
I didn't have,
I didn't have a curfew and nothing,

1774
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,880
you know,
but I was just a good kid.

1775
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:15,580
I was still,
they call me a square when I was younger

1776
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,770
I didn't partake anything but I will be
out.

1777
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,950
I'd be like,
it'll be like right there and I see it,

1778
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:26,280
but just instinctively I knew better but
I see people came up a certain way with

1779
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:28,480
certain values.

1780
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,130
Even my friends,
they had to live with that for awhile.

1781
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,120
Well,
I had the freedom to be like,

1782
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,220
nAh,
I'm going to do this.

1783
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:41,520
So you had the forethought or the
foresight to see where this could all be

1784
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:44,650
a problem and then you got proven.
Correct.

1785
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,590
So You got,
you got to see all these other people

1786
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:49,750
fuck up doing all these things.
Yeah.

1787
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:51,320
Well I noticed like,
oh my god,

1788
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:56,350
my grandmother and granddaddy snuff
cigarette people snuff.

1789
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,270
That stuff.
So weird though.

1790
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,200
My grandmas,
they slam that shit for people don't

1791
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,490
even know whAt it's like.
Snuff is like a powder form of tobacco.

1792
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,990
Um,
almost like chewing tobacco is what the

1793
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,190
dude's dead,
but you don't.

1794
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:11,530
It's an snuff is what the women,
there's a powder form and they still put

1795
01:24:11,531 --> 01:24:14,380
a mouth and they got a spit cup and they
will always be like,

1796
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:15,221
oh,
you know,

1797
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:18,970
as a kid,
go grab my spit cup and you watch a lady

1798
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:21,220
just spitting up this beautiful aspect.

1799
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,460
They get a paper towel and put it at the
bottom.

1800
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:26,260
So don't make a noise.
You remember?

1801
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,260
That was like a big deal.
And the wild west,

1802
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:32,740
they have spittoons yeah.
Remember that I saw movies.

1803
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,020
That's the capital,
the capital in sacramento,

1804
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:39,010
and they got those spit things.
I used to work with this dude.

1805
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:43,030
He was a stuntman unfair factor.
It's name is peri perry is crazy.

1806
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,790
He used to swallow was tobacco juice.
Oh,

1807
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:49,640
that's a good aNswer because he said he
said he,

1808
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:54,890
he was working on the movie sets so
often that um,

1809
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:58,660
he couldn't spit.
It couldn't like carry around as cop and

1810
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:01,450
spit.
So he started to swallow and this juice

1811
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,760
and they got used to it the most.
I drank.

1812
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:08,020
I drank,
I drank.

1813
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,500
And their tObacco tobacco.
Before you drank tobacco,

1814
01:25:11,501 --> 01:25:14,320
not drink alcohol and tobacco,
because I used to do focus groups.

1815
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,510
Might have Algeria and friends they put
me on.

1816
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,220
So that gIve you 50,
75,

1817
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:22,270
100,
$200 to drink and taste it and give you

1818
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,230
opinion on it.
Right?

1819
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,230
But if you [inaudible] my name is byron
bowels,

1820
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:28,870
which can be byron powers,
which could be Brian Bowers,

1821
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,130
Brian Powers.
I could do full focus focus groups in

1822
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:34,090
one day.
So you just change the name a little

1823
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:34,990
bit.
Change name,

1824
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,100
put on a different shirt.
Income for like,

1825
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:41,260
this is the hustles that we had to in
college to me,

1826
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:44,470
colleges with four people learn white
collar crimes and stuff.

1827
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:48,940
Right?
So I had to do tobacco and they never

1828
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,190
would do it.
Some people and I will do it and then

1829
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:55,060
they will be at a tobacco me like it'd
be like me and the red and the white

1830
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:56,500
guys,
they all like,

1831
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,020
yeah man,
this one tastes a little more like stuck

1832
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:02,950
at the citrus flavor pops more than
this,

1833
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,060
you know?
And I'm in there

1834
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,780
just lit.
I'm like,

1835
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:08,690
oh man,
they're just choosing my hanging out my

1836
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:09,860
mouth.
I can't even spit.

1837
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:11,990
Right.
What is the feeling of doing chewing

1838
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:15,890
tobacco when you don't do it?
Was duty in that group?

1839
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,280
Uh,
I think it's like I'm the equivalent to

1840
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:20,114
like,
it.

1841
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:23,960
You just get like a weird buzz feeling.
Like you just really like your eyes are

1842
01:26:23,961 --> 01:26:28,610
red and they say it's really good to
write on the nicotine is one of the best

1843
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:29,820
things to write on.
It's like,

1844
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:32,330
it's like a more.
It's like an alertness alert.

1845
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,790
Like if I eat chocolate,
drink coffee,

1846
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:37,250
like my heart exploded,
I just started doing this,

1847
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,760
you know what I mean?
So it's like an alert version of that.

1848
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:43,340
But you still like happy and stuff at
the same time,

1849
01:26:43,341 --> 01:26:45,710
like as if you're on alcohol,
it's like you buzzed in A way.

1850
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,140
So it's better,
better than,

1851
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,220
than coffee.
Uh,

1852
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:54,050
it's more of a,
a drunk feeling in coffee,

1853
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,770
huh?
To me from chewing tobacco.

1854
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,890
This is what kind of,
this is just like the loose leaf stuff

1855
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:05,290
or stuff that you will know when you
watch them do it and then you.

1856
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,850
And then you got,
you don't even know how to spit and you

1857
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,003
like.

1858
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,970
yeah.
And I saw this one fucking dude,

1859
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,860
uh,
who was doing public service

1860
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:19,360
announcements,
who's going to colleges and high schools

1861
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,870
rather,
and grammar schools.

1862
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,200
And he was missing most of his lower
jaw.

1863
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,070
He got jaw cancer from doing chewing
tobacco.

1864
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:32,150
I think he was a baseball player.
He used to be this strapping handsome

1865
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:35,570
gentleman.
And then as time went on the cancer,

1866
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:36,460
eight,
his jaw,

1867
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,760
his things,
to me,

1868
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,320
it's things to me,
it's like a stronger a spearmint mint

1869
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,140
stealing.
And if you don't know how to do it

1870
01:27:45,141 --> 01:27:46,970
right,
it gets all in your well.

1871
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:49,070
How many people actually get cancer from
that stuff?

1872
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,203
I don't know,
man.

1873
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,640
It seems like there's a lot of people
that do that stuff,

1874
01:27:52,641 --> 01:27:54,770
right?
They don't got no electronic version

1875
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:55,730
now.
They got.

1876
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,081
No,
no,

1877
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:57,650
no,
no.

1878
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:00,470
Well,
I mean I apparently,

1879
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,120
according to people that smoke
cigarettes,

1880
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,640
e-cigarettes just don't give you the
same rush.

1881
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,460
They don't believe that they don't give
you thAt kick like a at the end of the

1882
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,170
day to me.
But it's still smoke going inside your

1883
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:13,460
lungs.
Yes.

1884
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:17,090
it's still smoke on of lungs,
but it's not those e-cigarettes or

1885
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:20,540
vapor.
it's actually a liquid tobacco.

1886
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:26,540
It vaporizes the liquid tobacco in some
sort of particles have to be in the air,

1887
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,840
but it's a.
It's attached to vapor to different

1888
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,760
experience than the coal.
I mean,

1889
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:36,810
the hot smoke from fire that was caused
that burn with hydrogen or something

1890
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:41,250
that you've ever raised in the air.
Hydrogen turns into air.

1891
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,320
You burn it,
you know,

1892
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,190
or is it turned the water?
Some water,

1893
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,410
oxygen or water?
Some hydrogen burning.

1894
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:52,500
Burning hydrogen turned the oxygen or
does it turn the water?

1895
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:56,330
The water comes out of jamie and google
five things at the time.

1896
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,430
We need to goddamn assessment.
Um,

1897
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,990
but yeah.

1898
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,710
Yeah,
put cigarettes,

1899
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,570
man.
they do give you a weird rush.

1900
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,270
I don't smoke cigarettes,
but I've had hits of people cigarettes

1901
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:07,620
before.
Just to see what it feels like.

1902
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,010
Like a tony hinchcliffe kamia pull off a
cigarette the other night right before I

1903
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:12,810
went on stage.
it gives you like a rush.

1904
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,850
It gives you,
like your,

1905
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,920
your mind fires up.
And he's like,

1906
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:18,210
dude,
be careful.

1907
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,500
You can get addicted.
These thIngs.

1908
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,570
I'm like,
I am not getting addicted to your

1909
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:25,350
fucking cigarette and relax.
I'm just going to take one puff of a

1910
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:27,210
cigarette.
That's how I feel about stuff.

1911
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,050
Like certain things.
When I told my mom did acid

1912
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:34,150
and I tell people in the south,
I do ask them,

1913
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,510
hey,
thank you know what happened to your

1914
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:39,780
father?
Why would you go down the same path?

1915
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,850
They think it's the same
trend.

1916
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:44,820
See things different.

1917
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,220
I understand what he went through,
but.

1918
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:52,050
And also I came back as moses also,
so that didn't help.

1919
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:54,570
ExcUse me,
but I came back like,

1920
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,190
we mean it came back.
I met god.

1921
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,930
Oh,
after you do,

1922
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:00,630
these are the instructions.
EverythIng's,

1923
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:02,250
everything's gonna.
Be okay.

1924
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,050
I seen life,
I seen death.

1925
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:06,170
I time traveled.
Hm?

1926
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,580
Yeah.
That sounds pretty a trippy.

1927
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,140
It's like god dammit,
byron,

1928
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,410
you went nutty all not around what those
white people.

1929
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:17,790
But that adds on to the fact they
already think I went and for graduating

1930
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,400
and saying I'm going to do stand up.
So they were right.

1931
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,140
Then.
It's like you're confirming,

1932
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,290
but they're confirming that they were
right.

1933
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,461
Oh,
well yeah.

1934
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:29,190
In a sense they already like nuts.
This guy is already.

1935
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,430
He's out there.
I don't know what he's doing to an

1936
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:34,010
asset.
crazy.

1937
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:34,873
He's,
he's telling.

1938
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:36,900
He's telling jokes.

1939
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:37,980
I got introduced like,
yeah,

1940
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:39,450
this is my nephew who graduate from
college.

1941
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:42,840
He say he gonna go tell jokes.
Like it's a joke.

1942
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:45,900
Yeah.
I got introduced to his dad and tell him

1943
01:30:45,901 --> 01:30:48,500
how much Kevin Hart makes.
I said,

1944
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:49,910
tell.
Tell those people how much capital.

1945
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,350
This was before kevin.
It was before kevin.

1946
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:55,050
Tell him how much jamie foxx made.
Tell him how much.

1947
01:30:55,051 --> 01:30:56,070
I mean,
fill in the blank.

1948
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,220
Go to martin lawrence,
work your way up the million different

1949
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:04,221
fucking comedians like jet graduated
from college is a less likely scenario

1950
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,220
than if you're actually funny.
Making a lot of money doing standard.

1951
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,600
Yeah.
You know,

1952
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,360
like I,
it's now.

1953
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:14,250
Now you're at the point be like this is
all you do.

1954
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:14,881
And I'm like,
yeah.

1955
01:31:14,881 --> 01:31:15,810
And they like,
oh,

1956
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:21,000
they realize Now that you're.
I was in Dominican Republic and I was

1957
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:21,451
like,
what you do?

1958
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:23,010
I was like,
I talked to people for a living and he

1959
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:23,844
was like,
that's all.

1960
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,743
I was like,
yeah,

1961
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,250
well you gotta write some shit down.
You got to fIgure out what's funny about

1962
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,950
what you're about to say.
it's a little more complicated than

1963
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:32,880
that,
but yeah,

1964
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:34,830
at the end of the day,
that's all it is.

1965
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:36,330
I call it communication.
That's all.

1966
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,260
Yeah.
You know,

1967
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,700
at this level a level that it's
interesting now because I'm in a weird

1968
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:46,701
space with far as stand up weird space
to me how so far as to show business.

1969
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:51,330
So that's a show business.
How so?

1970
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:56,630
Because there's a place in show business
where art meets the business part.

1971
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,720
You know what I [inaudible]

1972
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,040
and that's when it gets interesting.
That's when the fight begins of like,

1973
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,780
you know,
uh,

1974
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,870
do uh,
what platforms can I,

1975
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:14,500
can this be allowed on or okay,
you're going to put me on the show at

1976
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:16,260
five people.
I waNt to do a show.

1977
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,030
It's just myself,
you know,

1978
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:21,940
and those things.
Or you got agents now you ask them to

1979
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:24,220
book you and then you don't hear from
them for five months,

1980
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,780
you know.
So that was the weird part of just

1981
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:30,580
learning that part of show business.

1982
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,300
navigating the waters of sharks.
Yeah.

1983
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,910
It's funny,
daniel tosh and I were at the improv.

1984
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:39,610
NaMedrop watch me,
we're at the improv the other night and

1985
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:43,990
there was this one dude who was a
manager is kind of shifty character and

1986
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:47,560
daniel came over and he was like,
that guy gives me the creeps and I tell

1987
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:48,071
him,
I go,

1988
01:32:48,071 --> 01:32:49,420
you don't know.
That guy said to me once,

1989
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,910
he said to me,
you're the one that got away.

1990
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,980
And he said,
dude,

1991
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:58,360
he said the same fucking thing to me.
And then tosh even tweeted it to me

1992
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,910
with a bunch of passes.
At the eNd of it,

1993
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:07,180
it's,
there's gonna be those guys.

1994
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:09,700
But if you find someone that's good,
you know,

1995
01:33:09,701 --> 01:33:12,370
you develop a good relationship with a
good agent and a good manager.

1996
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,720
It's like everything else,
man.

1997
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:17,140
You can come to hollywood and meet a
bunch of crazy actors or you can meet a

1998
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:18,070
bunch of artists.

1999
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:19,990
You know,
you can meet a bunch of people that are

2000
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,060
completely out of their fucking mind
full of shit.

2001
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,430
DoiNg math,
doing adderall day,

2002
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:26,530
promising you the world never delivering
shit.

2003
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,780
Or you can meet some of the people that
you.

2004
01:33:28,781 --> 01:33:31,630
And I know from the comedy store,
like you're in a family,

2005
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,430
like you're part of the comedy store
family.

2006
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,190
That's true.
You go down there and there's so many of

2007
01:33:36,191 --> 01:33:37,570
us.
I mean,

2008
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,770
I hate to keep bringing it up,
but this goddamn love fest at that

2009
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:42,604
place,
you know,

2010
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:44,350
it's a very interesting.
It's bEautiful,

2011
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:45,131
right?
People's like,

2012
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:46,060
oh,
that's weird.

2013
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,980
Energy is bad anymore.

2014
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,190
Like,
it's a,

2015
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:53,400
it's a frat and you know,
and this is a thing,

2016
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,800
it's a different place for sure than
it's ever been before.

2017
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:58,810
But there's,
there's no bad energy at the comedy

2018
01:33:58,811 --> 01:34:00,820
store.
That's a goddamn hug fest.

2019
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:01,570
Well,
I,

2020
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:02,400
I,
I,

2021
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,640
I felt a little something when I first
went there.

2022
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:07,280
That's probably what brought me to the
store honestly.

2023
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:11,300
Um,
because I started in the urban rooms and

2024
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:13,130
they didn't want to book me because it
was too far.

2025
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:14,960
It was too experimental,
my style.

2026
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,800
So I was like gonna try to get into
comedy store.

2027
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,290
And I was like,
I broke in the club before I know how

2028
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:24,050
tough it is or whatever.
And he's like,

2029
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,190
hey,
you can't go there.

2030
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,440
They don't,
they don't let black comics and they

2031
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:29,330
racist and I was like,
they racist.

2032
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:30,531
I was like,
man,

2033
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,570
I've been dealing with racism.
Like that's easy.

2034
01:34:32,571 --> 01:34:35,240
That's a mental thing and that's what I
did.

2035
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,400
What do you think the comedy store was?
Racist.

2036
01:34:37,401 --> 01:34:38,900
That's what I heard.
Who said that?

2037
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,480
Like a lot of black comments were saying
that when I got here,

2038
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:43,730
I bet they weren't that funny.
Well,

2039
01:34:43,731 --> 01:34:44,680
it's different,
you know,

2040
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,830
it's a different style.
First off and a racism is mental.

2041
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,573
Like,
you know,

2042
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:53,750
to me hollywood is racist.
You go in a room and be like too light,

2043
01:34:53,751 --> 01:34:54,620
too dark,
too tall,

2044
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:55,580
too short,
too fat,

2045
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,320
but then it's sexist.
It's

2046
01:34:58,570 --> 01:34:59,570
just.
Then it's,

2047
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:04,220
it's a sizes,
just like they don't like fat people.

2048
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:07,730
There's a lot of things at hollywood is,
but it's because they're trying to fill

2049
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:10,130
apart.
I have an idea in their head and what

2050
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:12,320
it's going to be and not live.
You let that get to you.

2051
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:14,730
I had went through so much mentally
they.

2052
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,070
I was like,
that ain't going to stop.

2053
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,290
That's nothing.
But yeah.

2054
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:21,290
But still they were racist.
They were still in higher you like it's

2055
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:26,291
not the comedy store is,
is they get a lot of pressure to be more

2056
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,120
this more diverse,
more.

2057
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:31,340
I know I've seen it.
I've talked to them about it.

2058
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:33,350
Yeah.
Well they tried to do is just book the

2059
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:35,510
funniest people.
That's what they always try to do.

2060
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:38,420
Just before the guy was booking it was
fucking crazy,

2061
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,870
but his idea,
he probably thought he was doing the

2062
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:42,704
right thing.

2063
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,550
He did.
Well,

2064
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:45,740
that's how I made it through that.
You know what I mean?

2065
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:47,350
Yeah,
yeah.

2066
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:50,210
You know,
so everything else was easy.

2067
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:53,960
I sat there and listened to the talks
and you let it,

2068
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:56,750
you can let it affect you or you can or
you can be like,

2069
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:00,090
fuck it.
Well people don't know that.

2070
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,910
That stopped like,
well,

2071
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:06,380
like two years ago that guy stopped
working there and from then on it's

2072
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:08,390
become a completely different
environment.

2073
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:11,270
It's insane now.
It's so much better and I'm glad I'm a

2074
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:15,020
part of it.
Like as far as making the cut because

2075
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:18,620
the talent as far what people got going
on,

2076
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:21,920
I still feel like a regular comic
compared to what the people that I'm on

2077
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:26,921
stage with now and that says something
about me I've failed confidence wise,

2078
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,650
but also letting me know like,
you know,

2079
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:33,350
I gotta get,
you know,

2080
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:36,170
whatever else I need to get done done.
You know what I mean?

2081
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:38,840
Like I should be like,
amongst the big book,

2082
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:41,060
I feel like it'd be a monster,
big monster,

2083
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:42,860
big boy.
Monks amongst.

2084
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,830
I get it because after a while you do
rooms and you're the funniest person in

2085
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:53,690
the room and that can make you cocky.
But then one night somebody don't show

2086
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:57,980
up or somebody don't want to follow joe
rogan and you have to follow joe rogan

2087
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:03,430
and then you learn what season is on a
different level and you can't cheat your

2088
01:37:06,891 --> 01:37:09,980
way to being seasoned in anything.
You know,

2089
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,930
you gotta put your time in your timing.
Yeah.

2090
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:14,800
Yeah.
And that's one of the things that comedy

2091
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:19,130
store's always been very good at giving
guys opportunities because of the fact

2092
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:21,710
that also there's a bunch of people on
it at night.

2093
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,810
It might be,
you know,

2094
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,580
people on an average lineup was like 13
or 14,

2095
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:26,600
12,
12,

2096
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:29,870
12,
so 12 people doing 15 minute sets and

2097
01:37:29,871 --> 01:37:33,200
the show goes on all day.
So you're going to get some

2098
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:37,220
opportunities if you're a young guy or
young girl to go on,

2099
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,040
like right after chris delea or right
after,

2100
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,980
you know,
a joey diaz or ron white,

2101
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:46,940
you get a chance to see these people
take these tough spots after they just

2102
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:50,570
watched he go on after ron white,
you're going on after someone.

2103
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:53,090
These people love.
They love that guy.

2104
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,720
Come to see him.
They're excited when he's there.

2105
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:56,320
They're

2106
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,110
all googly eyed.
The.

2107
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,930
That was their time.
There's a bunch.

2108
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:04,200
If ron white's at the comedy store,
there's a good chance that a bunch of

2109
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:06,510
people in the audience came there
specifically to see him.

2110
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,590
So if you go on right after him,
you have to introduce them to the world

2111
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:11,610
of byron bowers.
You know,

2112
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,670
it takes a little time,
you gotta like ease them in,

2113
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:17,520
you've got to relax them that now you
know,

2114
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:19,500
ron's gone.
I know that he was only here for 15

2115
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:22,020
minutes but he's gone and now I'm going
to come up and it's,

2116
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,900
it's a very,
very unique environment in that sense

2117
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:29,901
because it gives us a chance to also see
how other people do that and then also

2118
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:31,650
see,
I mean,

2119
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:35,640
you're going to get the chance to see 12
different people styles if you sit there

2120
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:36,361
the whole night.
Yeah,

2121
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:39,240
that's true.
So much difference in their style and so

2122
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,380
funny.
So much.

2123
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,740
I mean big difference between you who's
really funny and a guy like michael

2124
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:46,160
costa who's already really funny,
our,

2125
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:49,380
uh,
as well all really funny.

2126
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,930
But when you look at the two of you guys
together,

2127
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:56,310
what you both have in common is that you
both have like all this really cool

2128
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:58,980
potential and you might see that 10
times.

2129
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,140
Yeah.
So,

2130
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,980
you know,
and it's weird because tommy told me

2131
01:39:02,981 --> 01:39:03,521
this,
he was like,

2132
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:05,290
look,
we started you in the belly.

2133
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:08,230
We're going to put you in a.
Later he broke the whole thing down for

2134
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:09,310
me.
He's like,

2135
01:39:09,311 --> 01:39:11,230
your stuff is regional,
right?

2136
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:11,951
He's like,
well,

2137
01:39:11,951 --> 01:39:14,650
I'm gonna put you up in front of these
international people at 2:00 in the

2138
01:39:14,651 --> 01:39:16,330
morning.
And I was like,

2139
01:39:16,331 --> 01:39:18,820
what?
And what happened was I started learning

2140
01:39:18,821 --> 01:39:20,530
how to communicate with.
I thought it was funny,

2141
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:24,610
tell jokes and then he said,
by the time we put you in the main room

2142
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:28,450
with these guys to do theaters,
you will learn how to perform it in

2143
01:39:28,451 --> 01:39:33,280
front of a group of people between
220,000 by the time you mastered these

2144
01:39:33,281 --> 01:39:35,590
rooms.
So he to me,

2145
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,580
regardless,
I listened to what people say he told to

2146
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:39,970
them,
but he didn't have those conversations

2147
01:39:39,971 --> 01:39:40,804
with me.

2148
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:44,290
He just made it.
It just prolonged what I thought I was

2149
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:47,140
ready for.
But by the time I got to the main room

2150
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:51,460
and I'm used to doing these intimate or
all tea rooms and I'm performing behind

2151
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,420
like you are louis.
And I'm seeing like,

2152
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,770
oh,
this is a broader audience and I got to

2153
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:58,270
perform.
I got to walk the stage.

2154
01:39:58,271 --> 01:40:01,350
I got to.
I can't do it like I've been doing it in

2155
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,410
the or,
right.

2156
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:07,411
I gotta I gotta up the ante and it made
me grow as a comic and I tell people now

2157
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:09,700
like,
yo,

2158
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,410
you performing the main room at
midnight,

2159
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:16,420
you're going to be just as strong as
somebody who does it at 8:00 by the time

2160
01:40:16,421 --> 01:40:18,860
it's all over.
And when you go to another club and you

2161
01:40:18,861 --> 01:40:21,400
get an 8:00 spot,
boom,

2162
01:40:21,401 --> 01:40:22,600
you're gonna kill it.
Yeah.

2163
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,790
So you run them with weights on.

2164
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:25,360
Yeah,
for sure.

2165
01:40:25,361 --> 01:40:28,430
I just take cso for this hbo,
uh,

2166
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:31,930
I was at just for laughs and I did that
gallery show they have there and they

2167
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:37,120
had to do a warm up show and my wall was
so strong I had to close the typing.

2168
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,850
You know,
I had to close the taping because they,

2169
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,160
cause I,
they had me like up at a time.

2170
01:40:45,161 --> 01:40:48,700
You got to close the shit that y'all had
to close the taping and I didn't want to

2171
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:50,780
close the taping.
But in their mind they like,

2172
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:53,850
now you're strong enough to do this,
you know what I mean?

2173
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:57,100
Um,
and my first time with the montreal,

2174
01:40:57,370 --> 01:41:00,550
I went up first doing them audition
montreal comedy festival.

2175
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,760
Yeah.
The first time I did the,

2176
01:41:01,761 --> 01:41:04,540
uh,
the call back that got me to montreal.

2177
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:07,510
I went up first and I didn't want to go
first,

2178
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,830
but the set was so strong.
It affected the next three comedians

2179
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:14,980
after me because people were just
staring at him.

2180
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,440
And when you do content,
like you just said,

2181
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,340
but did it affect them or did they just
not be that good?

2182
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:23,100
Well,
there's a,

2183
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,320
that's a lot of what it is,
right?

2184
01:41:24,321 --> 01:41:27,340
It's like when someone sees you kill
what the.

2185
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:29,750
One of the big things that happened to,
one of the beautiful things about the

2186
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:31,970
comedy store,
about what you're talking about going on

2187
01:41:31,971 --> 01:41:35,090
after I was telling people that are
killing is you learn how to relax.

2188
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:38,840
There's a lot of what happens is when a
guy has to go on after someone that's

2189
01:41:38,841 --> 01:41:41,900
really strong is that they panic and
when they panic,

2190
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:44,960
they can't even be themselves,
which is not as funny as that guy.

2191
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:45,853
Yeah,
that's true.

2192
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,050
I used to feel that was a big thing that
happened to me.

2193
01:41:48,051 --> 01:41:51,810
I would always go after.
There's a ton of guys that are going to

2194
01:41:51,811 --> 01:41:53,690
have to.
One of the ones who would always bomb

2195
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,890
afterwards,
martin lawrence,

2196
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:59,970
he was just too good back then in two
famous and too popular and you know,

2197
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,950
he would do it 45 minutes and then I
would do whatever like 15 minutes after

2198
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,780
him and I always bombed,
but I always.

2199
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:09,440
That was the spot that I got and I
realized like a bunch of things I would

2200
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:12,110
see here.
My own jokes come out and knew they were

2201
01:42:12,111 --> 01:42:14,240
not good.
Like I didn't think they were good.

2202
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:19,610
So I realized like okay,
I've got to change pretty much

2203
01:42:19,611 --> 01:42:23,300
everything about my approach because
what I'm doing is I got comfortable.

2204
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:27,740
I found like a little area that I could
sort of a right and performing and these

2205
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:29,360
are,
these are the jokes that I've sort of

2206
01:42:29,361 --> 01:42:32,510
got and try to work with and I didn't
try to expand enough.

2207
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:36,350
And when you get stuck into a situation
where you have to kind of duke it out

2208
01:42:36,351 --> 01:42:38,510
for survival,
it makes you reassess.

2209
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,070
That's true.
Why is all this bad?

2210
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:41,660
Like what's,
what's going wrong?

2211
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:43,910
Like what am I.
People don't like doing that because if

2212
01:42:43,911 --> 01:42:45,140
you do,
everybody wants to think they're a

2213
01:42:45,141 --> 01:42:46,410
finished product.
Right?

2214
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:47,120
That's like,
no,

2215
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,440
that's the comfort zone,
right?

2216
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,690
Everybody wants to stay inside their
comfort zone.

2217
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:51,920
This is it.
I'm good.

2218
01:42:51,921 --> 01:42:53,420
I'm pretty happy with the way things are
like,

2219
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:55,550
okay.
But if you do that,

2220
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,610
like it's gonna take too long.
Like if you really want to get,

2221
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:02,270
you want to be like a martin lawrence,
like you're not going to do it by being

2222
01:43:02,271 --> 01:43:03,680
comfortable.
So it's not going to happen.

2223
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:06,460
That's true.
That's why I came up to you that night.

2224
01:43:06,461 --> 01:43:08,020
I had a following and was like,
yo,

2225
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,410
that was some heavy weights right there.
You know what I mean?

2226
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,170
Off loans.
Just content like.

2227
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,050
Yeah,
just the content and life experiences

2228
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:22,080
and sandstone learning like okay,
if I tell these stories about my dad,

2229
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:25,750
schizophrenia and stuff,
they don't even have to be the funniest.

2230
01:43:25,751 --> 01:43:27,010
They just so interesting.
They hold.

2231
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:27,850
Wait,
yeah.

2232
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:30,460
That if a funny guy to come up and talk
about relationships,

2233
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:32,430
people still going to be like,
man,

2234
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,670
that last year was crazy,
but when I start doing that,

2235
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:38,830
people wouldn't just come up to me
saying,

2236
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:40,750
you find it more.
They were just like,

2237
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:41,820
man,
that's that.

2238
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:45,710
I know what that's like because my aunt
was paranoia,

2239
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:49,420
schizophrenia,
and to me that's the universe saying hi,

2240
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:51,770
now you're onto something,
but that only comes through.

2241
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:54,320
Failed to me.
Like you've improved through failure.

2242
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:57,020
Like the light bulb was invented through
failure,

2243
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:58,910
you know what I mean?
Not through getting it right the first

2244
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:02,630
time to 10,000 times,
but that thing to get perfect.

2245
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:06,230
You know?
So I think also we were thinking a big

2246
01:44:06,231 --> 01:44:08,600
part of what you just said,
that it's important as you were talking

2247
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:11,000
about the way it feels when you're
listening to it,

2248
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:14,600
that it's not like your standard
relationship stuff,

2249
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:18,020
that it's something that's in some ways
more,

2250
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:19,550
more enticing.
Right.

2251
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:22,400
It's an interesting subject like
schizophrenia,

2252
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,460
like there's something,
there's weight to it,

2253
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:26,294
right?
Yeah.

2254
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:27,500
It's honest.
It's honest.

2255
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:32,510
Like my,
my black lives matter stuff is honest

2256
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:35,390
and is not going to get me liked by
people,

2257
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,060
but it's how I feel,
you know what I mean?

2258
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,840
And it's,
it's,

2259
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:41,720
it's,
it's to even,

2260
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:44,180
to me it's a little messed up how I feel
about the situation,

2261
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,360
but it's honest at the moment how I feel
about this.

2262
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:49,430
How do you feel about it?
We'll talk about it.

2263
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,600
Well I can,
but to me,

2264
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:55,601
not that it's the worst part of me about
the video is that he got shot in front

2265
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:59,630
of a toyota camry and I'm like,
that's how shallow I am.

2266
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,480
If it was me,
I would've found a bands or something to

2267
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:06,290
crawl near just because I know it's
gonna look good because I'm about to go

2268
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:07,490
viral,
right?

2269
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:10,700
And I want to look good before I get
turned into a hashtag because that's

2270
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:13,460
what the police are doing is turning
niggers in the hashtags.

2271
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:16,220
And I turned to somebody look white.
I was like,

2272
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:17,930
you know,
the average lifespan for a young black

2273
01:45:17,931 --> 01:45:18,890
man,
25,

2274
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:23,090
but hashtags live forever.
So it's the thing about fear,

2275
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,400
death and shallowness.
And like,

2276
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:28,250
that's the complexity of my bits,
but I have to admit,

2277
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,960
and that's a true how I really felt,
you know,

2278
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:32,540
when even when he hit the car and I was
like,

2279
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,310
oh,
that the car was bouncing.

2280
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,720
I was like,
look at the suspension on that.

2281
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,630
But that's what makes it funny.
The people,

2282
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:40,400
you know what I mean,
that's what makes it fun of the people.

2283
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,340
But I have to learn to,
you know,

2284
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:45,920
as artists we learned and you do this,
you learn to let go of those things.

2285
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:50,900
But the more work I don't get,
the more honest I would come because you

2286
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:53,450
don't,
you stop trying to fit in and you don't

2287
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:55,490
care if they're trying to book a nice
black guy no more.

2288
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,190
You get paid,
you take another jacket off,

2289
01:45:58,191 --> 01:46:00,530
you take another shirt off to you just
dealt with no shirt on.

2290
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,031
Like,
look,

2291
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:03,980
I'm in my thirties.
I got wrinkles right here now.

2292
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,600
But I never got laid more in my life.
You know,

2293
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:10,170
like he's just honest,
like,

2294
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:12,980
uh,
and it's something relieving.

2295
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:17,981
It's something whatever from a kid who
was quiet growing up and held everything

2296
01:46:18,561 --> 01:46:22,130
in such a release into being able to put
this stuff out.

2297
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:25,100
Yeah.
That's probably something a lot of

2298
01:46:25,101 --> 01:46:27,500
people don't understand.
Right?

2299
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,520
A lot of people don't understand that
like that.

2300
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:32,600
Where you're coming from is not just
where you are now,

2301
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:35,740
but it's where you started out.
Yeah.

2302
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,820
And you,
you,

2303
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:40,490
you're taking particular joy in your
freedom.

2304
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:44,270
It's particularly unusual the way you're
expressing yourself.

2305
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:45,643
Yeah,
and it's.

2306
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,070
And as,
as being volunteers,

2307
01:46:47,071 --> 01:46:48,830
that vulnerability that people talk
about,

2308
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,010
but

2309
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,050
as you grow,
as I grow as a person,

2310
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,360
my comedy has grown.
Yeah.

2311
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:55,740
That's got to happen.
It doesn't,

2312
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,780
it doesn't have.
I read something in the day on jen

2313
01:46:57,781 --> 01:47:02,670
kirkman and there was talking about.
She was talking about the comedy is one

2314
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:06,090
of those things you actually do get
better at when you get older and it's

2315
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:08,520
one of those things,
a rare thing for women to,

2316
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:12,450
that they're still at like a 40 year old
woman,

2317
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,670
doesn't have a lot of opportunity as an
actress,

2318
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,250
you know,
kind of play some mom rolls and stuff

2319
01:47:17,251 --> 01:47:19,830
like that.
But as far as like to lead something but

2320
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:23,020
a 40 year old comic,
like a lot of them are just kinda

2321
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,600
getting started.
True.

2322
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,670
Look at sarah silverman.
She's better now than ever.

2323
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:29,190
She's like,
what is she like 46 or something like

2324
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:33,470
that.
Like everything like attractive and sexy

2325
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,380
with a woman.

2326
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,420
Like it just,
it just grows on,

2327
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:38,310
its not,
it's not the way you look,

2328
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:41,380
the way you carry yourself and the way
you move when you talk to.

2329
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:45,680
You're trying to say your fan out the
bat signal before.

2330
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:47,730
But I look at it like I'm talking about
like all women now.

2331
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,080
You know,
you told her that before.

2332
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:50,650
Yeah.
I told him this was attractive looking

2333
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:51,510
woman.
You know what I mean?

2334
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,600
Like I've been in the green room with
her.

2335
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,040
Respected the boundaries,
you know what I mean?

2336
01:47:56,130 --> 01:48:01,130
Not stare there.
I see little bits but she's very nice

2337
01:48:01,471 --> 01:48:04,920
person too.
She's nice outside and it don't get all

2338
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:09,350
like yeah no shit.
But for sure she's real friendly too.

2339
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,280
She's a.
And by the way,

2340
01:48:11,281 --> 01:48:13,180
I'm talking about all women with that
ladies,

2341
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:16,800
like if you have self esteem problems
like we all do and don't think,

2342
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,720
oh,
because your hair doesn't look a certain

2343
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:19,470
way.

2344
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:21,240
It's all there,
but it,

2345
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:23,190
it kind of comes when you stopped giving
a fuck,

2346
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,830
you know,
mean sexiness

2347
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,290
in some ways.
Yeah.

2348
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,810
Because people that are like super
nervous about everything,

2349
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:35,670
every aspect about them to get a
draining exhausting because you know

2350
01:48:35,671 --> 01:48:38,850
that there's a lot going on.
There was too much chaos,

2351
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:41,960
doesn't allow you to be comfortable when
someone's comfortable in their own skin

2352
01:48:41,961 --> 01:48:43,890
and they don't give a fuck.
Like it's like,

2353
01:48:43,891 --> 01:48:45,480
ah,
I kind of like being around you.

2354
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,180
He relaxed me.
He will let me know that it's okay to

2355
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:52,500
not give a fuck.
That's what the benefit of the true.

2356
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,780
Not give a fuck people through not give
a fuck.

2357
01:48:54,781 --> 01:48:56,880
People make you appreciate things
better.

2358
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,730
Women say I look sexy now.
And I was like,

2359
01:48:59,731 --> 01:49:00,630
what?
Who are they?

2360
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:03,030
Why are they learning?
I don't know why they line is something

2361
01:49:03,031 --> 01:49:06,800
that some energy they feel and I don't
believe him because I'm still that kid

2362
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,410
with the look.

2363
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:09,150
You're a talented guy.
That's what it is.

2364
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,070
What they.
My mom still that kid with the scar on

2365
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:11,920
his face.
Yeah.

2366
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:12,900
And the crooked teeth,
you know?

2367
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,930
Well you're,
you're handsome black gentlemen and

2368
01:49:15,931 --> 01:49:17,340
you're funny.
Smell good though.

2369
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:19,570
Just smile.
That's what I hear.

2370
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:22,680
But you know,
I mean talent is a big thing too,

2371
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:26,320
right?
You see a lot of talented people in all,

2372
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:31,230
all sorts of different businesses.
Even even like businessmen,

2373
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:34,530
like a businessman as well,
that she just after him for his money,

2374
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:38,640
maybe you know,
maybe that guy has that really beautiful

2375
01:49:38,641 --> 01:49:43,641
wife because they're just after him for
his money or maybe they're attracted to

2376
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:49,810
his talent for being successful.
Like there's a little bit of that too.

2377
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,470
It's not just the money.
Yeah.

2378
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,120
Like I don't think women would be as
attracted to a guy who just won the

2379
01:49:55,121 --> 01:50:00,121
lottery and got $500,
million dollars as they would to some

2380
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:04,690
guy who's some media mogul who started
his own business,

2381
01:50:04,691 --> 01:50:07,720
built it up into an empire and now has
$500,000,000.

2382
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:09,460
That's true.
Those guys are different.

2383
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:12,340
Like they have that wizard air about
them.

2384
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,450
Like this guy,
you know,

2385
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:18,720
like a certain type of like elan musk
how much pussy elan musk must have to

2386
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:22,390
beat away from him.
How many girls are just

2387
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:28,990
bombing on him?
Just constantly because he's a super

2388
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:32,320
genius.
Multibillionaire was several successful

2389
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:35,420
businesses.
He invented fucking pay pal.

2390
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:39,310
He's built his own cars that run on
electricity.

2391
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:43,690
He's making a fucking rocket ship to go
to the moon is making a hyperloop that's

2392
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:48,120
going to go to san francisco in 30
seconds or whatever the fuck and I'll

2393
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:50,680
still questioning it.
I looked at his stock today.

2394
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:53,260
I still question.
She's not a part of me like this is

2395
01:50:53,261 --> 01:50:54,910
going to be like the naked general
electric.

2396
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,650
That's what I'm telling people in my
mind.

2397
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,170
The thing that thing he's going to do
with energy,

2398
01:50:59,171 --> 01:51:01,420
you know,
he's doing that with everything.

2399
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:02,980
He's a super winter.
There's,

2400
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,540
there's certain guys that are just super
winters and he seems to come without any

2401
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:10,600
of the baggage the most super winters
come with.

2402
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:13,210
You know,
there's a lot of baggage that most,

2403
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:18,240
most of these like crazy entrepreneur
type characters are also genius has come

2404
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:20,050
with.

2405
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:23,710
He doesn't seem to.
He's like remarkably stable for someone

2406
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:26,800
who's that fucking smart and successful.
He's like a god damn alien.

2407
01:51:26,801 --> 01:51:28,930
That guy.
It was weird because I had tickets talk

2408
01:51:28,931 --> 01:51:31,420
about the silicone valley guys and made
money now.

2409
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,990
And it's like,
it's like they said,

2410
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:35,800
yeah,
they nurse,

2411
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,310
but now they got money and power.
So they act like that when you see them

2412
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:40,510
out.
They 10 women,

2413
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:43,000
you know what I mean?
Kissing all on the neck and acting like

2414
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:45,580
the guys we used to beat them up the
job,

2415
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,290
you know what I mean?
They get bullied.

2416
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,470
But if you look at the warren buffetts
and the,

2417
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,450
the uh,
bill gates and the guys was just like,

2418
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:53,860
yeah,
this is my lady right here.

2419
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:58,360
Spent all my time working on algorithms,
but it's a new day now.

2420
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:00,580
You know,
warren buffet still lives in the same

2421
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:01,780
fucking house in omaha.

2422
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:04,120
Yeah.
Me and hannah was a in that

2423
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:05,680
neighborhood.
Did you see his house?

2424
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:09,040
Nope,
but we airbnb the property and they

2425
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:14,041
stared at us.
When you airbnb property in that

2426
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:17,020
community and you have to have a cookout
at 5:00 in the morning,

2427
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:22,300
you don't get some stairs and the next
day he had a cookout at 5:00 in the

2428
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:26,050
morning show after party.
And then was it like when you making a

2429
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:27,970
lot of noise or something?
I don't think so.

2430
01:52:27,971 --> 01:52:30,460
Just the average is that,
you know,

2431
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:33,700
people make after they leave the club.
That's pretty loud,

2432
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:36,400
you know,
stumbling around 5:00 in the morning.

2433
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,290
Shit.
Would it be annoying as fuck if you live

2434
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:41,290
next door to that house and you know,
try and get some sleep?

2435
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:42,730
I think so.
Probably.

2436
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:44,860
Yeah.
The house across the street had three

2437
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:46,940
volvos in the driveway.
I was like,

2438
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,710
oh,
that's a lot of safety.

2439
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:50,120
Yeah.
That's a lot of white people.

2440
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:53,170
That's too much.
It must be furious at you for waking up,

2441
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,500
so I don't know.
We woke him up,

2442
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:57,290
but the grill was outside and so they
can smell it.

2443
01:52:57,370 --> 01:53:01,150
Yeah,
and they had chilean sea bass and we

2444
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:02,910
came with an appetite,
you know,

2445
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,330
but don't you think that that was
probably pretty loud.

2446
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,470
Like how loud were you guys?
I don't think it was that lab.

2447
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,730
I fell asleep.
Oh,

2448
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:12,230
but it was.
We did turn people away though.

2449
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:14,240
You know,
how many people were there?

2450
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,220
I don't think it probably be like five
or seven,

2451
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:18,800
but more came,
but that's chaos.

2452
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:21,920
Five or seven.
Seven people that are awake at 5:00 in

2453
01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:24,860
the morning.
Those people were probably lit up loud

2454
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:28,250
as fuck.
Barbecuing doesn't bother you.

2455
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,690
I slept well.
I didn't bother me,

2456
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:31,280
but at the same time I don't.

2457
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,080
If I look at it from my neighborhood and
my neighborhoods I lived in and they

2458
01:53:36,081 --> 01:53:38,390
bring that bouncy castle over and they
play the myriad.

2459
01:53:38,391 --> 01:53:40,910
I see the 5:00 in the morning,
which happens.

2460
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,230
Doesn't be like,
oh,

2461
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:43,280
okay.
I get it.

2462
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:46,100
I get it.
I don't hate on him though.

2463
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,233
Right.
But that's,

2464
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:49,580
that's the neighborhood that you chose
to live in.

2465
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:50,271
Yeah,
right.

2466
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:51,830
That's what they do.
Like you're saying,

2467
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:54,580
you live in a mexican neighborhood here.
Actually people asked for fucking

2468
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:56,340
parties.
They got roosters in my niche kind of

2469
01:53:56,390 --> 01:54:00,440
deal that get up at 5:00 AM.
Three am in the morning.

2470
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,500
Dude,
my gardener had the son of one of my

2471
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:06,770
dogs,
my gardeners friend of mine and he's

2472
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:08,630
cool as fuck.
Doesn't speak very much english,

2473
01:54:08,631 --> 01:54:09,710
but he's.
He's cool as fuck.

2474
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:15,050
He's got like 100 fucking roosters.
100 of them in his yard.

2475
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:18,320
His yard is like a chicken fighting
ring.

2476
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:22,190
Chicken fighting is different man.
It's funny,

2477
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,630
like you tell people that you know
somebody that fights dogs and they look

2478
01:54:26,631 --> 01:54:31,631
at you like what a monster of a person.
Because dogs are really complex and they

2479
01:54:31,731 --> 01:54:34,310
love you.
They have give you unconditional love

2480
01:54:34,311 --> 01:54:37,760
and for you to violate that and making
them fight each other is fucked up.

2481
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:39,140
I get it.
I agree with it.

2482
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,670
One hundred percent.
I'm not saying that,

2483
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:42,440
but you tell people that,
you know,

2484
01:54:42,441 --> 01:54:44,650
somebody fights chickens and they go
like,

2485
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:47,280
they don't even get grossed out.
I mean there's some super vegans

2486
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,430
probably get really pissed off or animal
rights activist,

2487
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:53,480
but the average person doesn't give a
fuck about a chicken and if those

2488
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:56,030
chickens are fucking each other up with
spurs on,

2489
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:59,990
they put like razor blades on their back
feet and they cut each other up.

2490
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:04,010
I noticed that I saw a tape before vic
went down,

2491
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:09,610
have a recruitment training tape and
that was my first time seeing the

2492
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:14,390
animals electrocuted and how they breed
them and stuff like that.

2493
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:18,740
This was a real tight good that was
going around the hood because people was

2494
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:23,741
fighting these animals and I know people
that executed dog that I'm closely

2495
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:26,210
friends with.
You know what I mean?

2496
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:28,970
And it's very,
you know,

2497
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:32,480
interesting situation.
But once again,

2498
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:33,920
you're talking about people who was
like,

2499
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,180
oh,
we was treated worse than that.

2500
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:40,100
You know,
it's still that innately that's in you.

2501
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,980
But it's shocking when people come out
against dogs like that and

2502
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,750
that's why you have certain communities
like,

2503
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:49,380
oh,
what will we get shot by the cops or you

2504
01:55:49,381 --> 01:55:50,910
know,
and all this other stuff.

2505
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:54,220
Well there's certain communities were
dog fighting is super normal to.

2506
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,740
That's what I'm saying.
Like is this normal?

2507
01:55:55,741 --> 01:56:00,741
It wasn't a but I don't mean normal in
that it's like less offensive than how

2508
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,460
the adult human beings are treated in
that neighborhood.

2509
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:05,200
I mean,
it's a part of the culture.

2510
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:06,563
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

2511
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,560
Yeah.
In the south,

2512
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:09,400
right?
Yeah.

2513
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,340
Yeah.
I know dude who had like 30 dogs used to

2514
01:56:12,341 --> 01:56:14,890
keep 30 dogs in his yard.
He's a professional pool player.

2515
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:20,260
He had a big ass yard down in,
I think it was Kentucky and he,

2516
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:23,620
he,
he was part of what he gambled on.

2517
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,430
He had dogs that they train and they
would fight them,

2518
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:28,803
you know,
and

2519
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:33,430
the person that I am right now looks at
that and goes,

2520
01:56:33,431 --> 01:56:35,680
well that,
that's a fucking terrible thing to do.

2521
01:56:35,681 --> 01:56:36,890
Like why would you do that?
Like that?

2522
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:40,270
That should be absolutely illegal.
But him,

2523
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:45,280
whatever his life was like him growing
up in wherever he grew up,

2524
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:48,040
that was a normal thing.
So I,

2525
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:51,920
I absolutely judge them.
I absolutely judge anybody there

2526
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,030
does that.
But it is.

2527
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,320
We don't understand.
Yeah,

2528
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:55,370
it's weird.
Like,

2529
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:59,360
and to me,
I think understanding comes from me

2530
01:56:59,361 --> 01:57:02,900
personally.
Like if we could really assess ourselves

2531
01:57:02,901 --> 01:57:06,760
and look at our demons and accept all
dana's right,

2532
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:10,400
how bad that we could possibly do some
real fucked up things.

2533
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:15,500
Then it will make us judges other less
and then the conversation can be had

2534
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:18,290
they try to understand.
But yeah,

2535
01:57:18,291 --> 01:57:23,291
it's certain things that you see that
you accept depending on where you are

2536
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:24,380
are,
you know what I mean?

2537
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:28,670
More than a lot of ways than what you're
saying is like those,

2538
01:57:28,671 --> 01:57:31,520
those principles of life and those
things that you're talking about,

2539
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:35,690
these different patterns that you see in
electronics where the universe,

2540
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:40,310
you kind of see that in life.
You see that in comedy to exactly what

2541
01:57:40,311 --> 01:57:44,060
you were talking about in comedy.
Like having gone through things,

2542
01:57:44,061 --> 01:57:46,580
making mistakes,
making things like really obvious and

2543
01:57:46,581 --> 01:57:47,570
then realizing,
whoa,

2544
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:52,190
I got to look at this for what it really
is versus people who look at things

2545
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:56,420
through a distorted perception like most
of the people that you know that have

2546
01:57:56,421 --> 01:57:59,750
distorted perceptions of their own
abilities or distorted perceptions of

2547
01:57:59,751 --> 01:58:02,030
their own life or where they fit in in
the world.

2548
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:05,030
Those are the people that don't progress
because they're not looking at

2549
01:58:05,031 --> 01:58:06,680
themselves.
They're not.

2550
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:11,830
They're not taking these assessments of
themselves accurately so they're not

2551
01:58:12,051 --> 01:58:14,150
moving forward.
They stay where they're at because they

2552
01:58:14,151 --> 01:58:17,810
think that where they're at with
whatever they're trying to do is good

2553
01:58:17,811 --> 01:58:20,600
enough or it's perfect or it's better
than it really is.

2554
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:23,560
That's true,
but yeah.

2555
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,950
What I learned from my last,
my acid trip that the one you saw me

2556
01:58:27,951 --> 01:58:29,390
today after that,
yeah,

2557
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:34,930
the in art and in our genes because I
saw idea or conception with.

2558
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:41,330
I told you it moves everything for

2559
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:45,380
my art,
moves everything forward and the jane,

2560
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:50,390
like you have a child or you have an
idea that moves the culture or the human

2561
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:56,440
species and everything continues to
evolve and move forward.

2562
01:58:56,910 --> 01:59:01,910
Without those things we would.
We continue to make the same mistakes

2563
01:59:01,991 --> 01:59:03,820
over there,
stuck with certain things,

2564
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:05,080
you know?
Yeah.

2565
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:08,110
We're fueled by these things that we
create,

2566
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:11,740
whether their innovation or whether
they're a piece of art,

2567
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,070
a movie,
you know,

2568
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:16,420
we were fueled buddies things and
sometimes in a negative way.

2569
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:18,730
I mean,
how many people have you met that act

2570
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:22,210
like a movie?
Like they think they say things like

2571
01:59:22,211 --> 01:59:23,710
they're in a movie.
Oh yeah.

2572
01:59:23,711 --> 01:59:25,690
A bunch of people.
I know a dude who got in a fight with

2573
01:59:25,691 --> 01:59:28,810
another dude and as they were scrapping,
like as we're about to fight,

2574
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:30,280
he goes,
tonight,

2575
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:31,600
we dine in hell.

2576
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:37,120
He yelled that at him and the dude told
me,

2577
01:59:37,121 --> 01:59:38,320
I'm like,
are you fucking serious?

2578
01:59:38,321 --> 01:59:39,154
He's like,
yeah,

2579
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,390
it really,
really said that to me.

2580
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,250
That's a layer.
And the guy was like,

2581
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:44,830
why did you fucking say tonight we dine
in hell.

2582
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:47,120
And so they get in a fight.
And the other guy,

2583
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:50,410
the guy who didn't say that turned out
to be a really good wrestler.

2584
01:59:50,411 --> 01:59:52,420
So the whole thing was a disaster for
the other guy.

2585
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:56,590
Well the guy did the guy who said that
dying in hell that night.

2586
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:59,200
Well not.
I mean it's just he thought he was in a

2587
01:59:59,201 --> 02:00:01,990
fucking movie or something.
I mean he was drunk too.

2588
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:03,260
There's a lot going on.
Right?

2589
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:08,790
But it's just that movies create these
scenarios in people's minds that they

2590
02:00:09,581 --> 02:00:12,580
almost want to reinvent in the real
world.

2591
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:15,400
If a similar situation presents itself,
you know,

2592
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,280
you really think you could say something
fucking stupid.

2593
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:19,880
I mean,
I was,

2594
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:23,470
I said some things before that sounds.
You know what I mean?

2595
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:27,970
And especially in the throes of passion,
in the throes of passion.

2596
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:30,440
But by even poetic,
you know what I mean?

2597
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,640
That should be.
That should be the title of your first

2598
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:36,160
netflix special,
the throes of passion.

2599
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:39,820
But byron bowers and you just sitting
there with your legs crossed with like

2600
02:00:39,821 --> 02:00:42,610
some nice slippers on in front of a
fire.

2601
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:45,340
That's what I call it now.
Reading a book.

2602
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:48,130
That's what I called it.
Now I won't even say fucking no more.

2603
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:52,450
I call it because I feel I'd do
something a little more creative,

2604
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:54,820
a little more different.
I don't call it create just a lot more

2605
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:56,350
involved.
It's a little more.

2606
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:59,380
There's a little more passionate about.
So you're trying to separate yourself,

2607
02:00:59,381 --> 02:01:00,580
like your branding,
your style.

2608
02:01:00,581 --> 02:01:02,410
Fucking oh,
I wouldn't do that.

2609
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:05,540
That'll be interesting.
That's a lot of fucking right there.

2610
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,770
Well you think about how many different
kinds of music there is.

2611
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:12,010
There's only one pint of vodka and you
know like it.

2612
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:15,730
Music is a style of expressing what's
going on inside your mind,

2613
02:01:15,731 --> 02:01:16,940
your imagination,
sodas.

2614
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:20,890
So was fucking a lot of ways we should
have like different classifications for

2615
02:01:20,891 --> 02:01:22,600
fucking men.
We kind of did.

2616
02:01:22,601 --> 02:01:26,950
We have basic bitch fucking,
which is like missionary little kisses.

2617
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:28,750
Fucking grill.
Fucking.

2618
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:30,100
Yeah.
That's very important.

2619
02:01:30,101 --> 02:01:32,320
You need to couch,
you've got stuff in the corner of the

2620
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:34,690
couch.
That's what gorilla fucking is about.

2621
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:37,260
You gotta grab a hold of things,
going to be all subtraction.

2622
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:40,580
You might want to keep your shoes on.
You got some traction.

2623
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:44,660
I got this nike rope,
a leather and not weird and

2624
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:51,490
I put it out on these young lady and I
put it around her neck like a,

2625
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,040
like a puppy,
like elise.

2626
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,210
And she was like,
what are you doing?

2627
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:58,460
And I was like,
it's the exact right thing to ask.

2628
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:00,750
And I was like a normal.
I was like,

2629
02:02:00,751 --> 02:02:02,210
I'll show you,
I'll show you.

2630
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:05,940
Get up and try to move when she got to
try to move like that.

2631
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,840
But yeah,
she liked it and it turned on.

2632
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:12,590
And then to the fact that she wanted her
around her neck and I put it around her

2633
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:15,290
neck and the more,
you know,

2634
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:16,490
poor white girl,
right.

2635
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:19,370
I don't want to say,
but it's gotta be,

2636
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,270
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

2637
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:24,230
A jewish probably,
you know what I mean?

2638
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:29,300
So I'm super liberal.
Jews and blacks now.

2639
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,000
So as I'm pulling it,
she got more turned on,

2640
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:37,050
but then she died because he started
licking my thing and I got because I'm a

2641
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:42,260
skinny dude,
somebody my was shaking like this and in

2642
02:02:42,261 --> 02:02:44,450
my mind I was like,
this ain't me,

2643
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:47,780
you know,
I just let the rope go.

2644
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:51,800
Follow your instincts,
your instincts with the knock killer.

2645
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:53,660
That's good.
She wasn't gonna die and I don't think

2646
02:02:53,661 --> 02:02:55,700
I'm strong.
I think you could definitely kill

2647
02:02:55,701 --> 02:02:58,680
someone with a belt around her neck.
That was a length of rope,

2648
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:00,890
but it's kind of like the same thing,
isn't it?

2649
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:02,000
Well,
the rope belt,

2650
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,340
what kind of leather?
Very good.

2651
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,940
Very good leather,
you know?

2652
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,380
Very little.
But it seems like you definitely kill

2653
02:03:10,381 --> 02:03:11,610
somebody with a rope.
It hurt.

2654
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:13,970
It would hurt if you,
if you hit them with the leather,

2655
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:16,670
you know,
but then you can kill them if you can

2656
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:19,880
like pull hard enough.
You could kill somebody with any kind of

2657
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,670
like thin wire.
I think I could probably kill someone

2658
02:03:22,671 --> 02:03:24,620
with a boot lace.
That's probably true.

2659
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:28,610
That's probably a true.
Be careful about that.

2660
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,370
If I got a good grip on it,
you know to to.

2661
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:34,680
It's not hard.
The,

2662
02:03:34,681 --> 02:03:36,850
the human nac is real vulnerable.
No.

2663
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:39,020
The weird part about that is having a
condom on,

2664
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:43,640
you know,
like what part of this is safe.

2665
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:49,110
Like
that's hilarious.

2666
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:54,190
She's got ligature marks or nac but std
or she didn't get aids but she still

2667
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:55,703
did.

2668
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,260
Yeah.
Rough sex is fucking strange,

2669
02:04:00,261 --> 02:04:02,810
man.
You gotta be real careful with that

2670
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:05,720
because if you do weird shit and beat
each other up and the girl goes to the

2671
02:04:05,721 --> 02:04:06,950
cops,
you're fucked.

2672
02:04:07,230 --> 02:04:08,750
Yeah.
Especially if they're not the same race

2673
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:12,080
and that's when black people will be
like I told you,

2674
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:16,370
I told you I was reading about this
thing in toronto.

2675
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:21,270
There was just this judge in toronto,
that sentence,

2676
02:04:21,271 --> 02:04:26,270
this man,
he was convicted of rape and he had

2677
02:04:26,271 --> 02:04:31,271
consensual sex in his opinion with this
woman and this woman had sent them these

2678
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,940
text messages saying,
you know,

2679
02:04:34,941 --> 02:04:37,440
come on over,
let's have some savage sex and this and

2680
02:04:37,441 --> 02:04:38,274
that.

2681
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,230
And then afterwards,
and he broke up with her.

2682
02:04:40,231 --> 02:04:43,740
She decided or after they had a bunch of
these experiences.

2683
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:46,170
I forget how it works,
either way,

2684
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:51,200
she lied to the judge and to the court
about sending those texts and then

2685
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,700
because she had deleted them,
but then they somehow or another

2686
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:58,170
recovered them and they found that she
lied about that and she lied about a few

2687
02:04:58,171 --> 02:05:00,750
other things too,
but the judge started quoting all this

2688
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:05,751
feminist theory and quoting different
feminist writers and a wound up getting

2689
02:05:07,831 --> 02:05:10,590
this guy convicted,
which is beyond a reasonable doubt.

2690
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:15,330
Like as soon as someone says,
I did not send him a text asking him for

2691
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:19,830
sex and then you find out they did in
fact send a text asking them for sex and

2692
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:21,900
it deleted.
Well then you've got reasonable doubt

2693
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,390
like instantaneously you have doubt
because you have to go,

2694
02:05:24,391 --> 02:05:27,120
okay,
what about the rest of this stuff you're

2695
02:05:27,121 --> 02:05:28,170
telling me isn't true?

2696
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:32,730
Now I'm not saying that he didn't force
her to give him a blow job or that he

2697
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:33,840
did.
I don't know.

2698
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:35,100
I wasn't there.
He doesn't.

2699
02:05:35,101 --> 02:05:37,920
The judge doesn't know either,
but in my opinion,

2700
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,730
you instantaneously have to have
reasonable doubt when you find out that

2701
02:05:41,731 --> 02:05:44,880
someone's willing to lie about certain
aspects of what happened.

2702
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:46,440
Yeah.
So,

2703
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:47,274
uh,
I was,

2704
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,500
I was watching this and I was listening
to this,

2705
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:50,940
uh,
this woman,

2706
02:05:50,970 --> 02:05:51,990
uh,
from what does that,

2707
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:55,860
what's that conservative website,
the blaze or something like that.

2708
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:00,060
Is that what it is that Glenn Beck
things and it is at the blaze.

2709
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,610
She did this breakdown of it and I was
like,

2710
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:04,770
god,
it's so,

2711
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:07,620
so dangerous when you get involved.
Crazy people.

2712
02:06:07,621 --> 02:06:10,470
You're sticking your dick and crazy
people like you don't,

2713
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:13,410
you don't really know what's going to
happen.

2714
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,390
Like you,
you're there choking that girl with a

2715
02:06:15,391 --> 02:06:18,810
rope and she's looking your arm like,
where's this going to escalate to,

2716
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:22,220
you know,
you can things only a volvo and these

2717
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:28,040
kids
only place to go or she doesn't know

2718
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:33,150
that you've been snipped and uh,
you don't tell her that,

2719
02:06:33,151 --> 02:06:34,230
uh,
you,

2720
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,970
you can't get pregnant.

2721
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:40,140
So you keep pumping loads of nowhere and
you've got to keep ramping up the sex.

2722
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:42,870
And so now she's wearing a helmet.
And you're fucking driving it through a

2723
02:06:42,871 --> 02:06:43,860
wall.
Oh,

2724
02:06:43,861 --> 02:06:47,790
that'll be interesting to doing that to
make her happy.

2725
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:51,060
But you really don't like it at all.
Both of you are confused.

2726
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:54,630
She thinks it makes you happy,
but you think it makes her happy and

2727
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:59,660
you're just giving her cte and
throwing her head through wallboard.

2728
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:02,610
I mean,
someone has for sure putting a helmet on

2729
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:05,280
and some on fuck them from behind and
slammed her head through a wall.

2730
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:08,280
That's 100 percent right.
That's definitely happened.

2731
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:10,290
I think so.
What are you looking up,

2732
02:07:10,291 --> 02:07:11,610
jamie?
I was looking at this case,

2733
02:07:11,611 --> 02:07:13,670
but I stumbled across something I
haven't seen before.

2734
02:07:13,671 --> 02:07:16,350
Did you know canadian lawyers have to
wear an outfit like this?

2735
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:18,780
Thank god.
So you know the ridiculous.

2736
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:20,400
I looked up canadian lawyers and they're
all good.

2737
02:07:20,401 --> 02:07:22,830
The lord.
All the lawyers have to dress like that.

2738
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:26,250
That's hilarious.
Oh my goodness.

2739
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:28,080
Look at this fucking outfit they have
on.

2740
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:30,510
They might as well be working at like
one of those,

2741
02:07:30,511 --> 02:07:33,060
a reenactment restaurants,
medieval times.

2742
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:38,820
That's why none of them are smart.
They got wigs too.

2743
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:42,250
They are barrister.
Wow.

2744
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:46,690
Male barristers make more than doubled
their female.

2745
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:48,340
Um,
what does it say there?

2746
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:49,240
It's dot,
dot,

2747
02:07:49,241 --> 02:07:50,840
dot.
What does it say?

2748
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:55,960
Do the female had to wait weeks to just
wrong crushing question.

2749
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:58,440
Bullshit.
Oh,

2750
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:02,170
their female colleagues.
Male barristers with their ridiculous

2751
02:08:02,171 --> 02:08:06,430
wigs that his.
God damn hilarious.

2752
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,220
Wow.
That's,

2753
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,790
that's an Australia though that you just
pulled up

2754
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,840
still.
There's parts of the world makes you

2755
02:08:16,841 --> 02:08:18,670
wonder,
like what would happen if the United

2756
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:21,280
States had been formed?
There's parts of the world that are

2757
02:08:21,281 --> 02:08:25,000
still wearing wigs when they're doing
their law stuff.

2758
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:30,480
She's hot as fuck outfits.
Portrait of a woman in canadian law.

2759
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:34,360
She don't have to wear a wig,
but the outfit looks better on her.

2760
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,720
You want her to visit you in jail?
No.

2761
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:39,610
She tells you.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to convict you

2762
02:08:39,611 --> 02:08:41,040
and I'm going to work to get you out.

2763
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:44,410
And she don't have no oatmeal's.
He better not come with a different

2764
02:08:44,411 --> 02:08:46,330
outfit in jail.
You have to bring an oatmeal.

2765
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:47,270
Yes.
Let me see the light.

2766
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:48,880
She carries them.
Quaker state.

2767
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:50,730
What's it called?
Wait.

2768
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:52,410
Quaker state is.
Oh

2769
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,630
yeah.
Yeah.

2770
02:08:55,631 --> 02:08:57,730
There's some.
That's a funny one,

2771
02:08:57,731 --> 02:08:59,470
right?
Like what the fuck does pilgrims have to

2772
02:08:59,471 --> 02:09:01,420
do with oats?
Did they grow the oats?

2773
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:04,270
Is that what the deal is?
Because he's a quaker.

2774
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:05,190
It's not a pilgrim,
right?

2775
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:08,550
Quaker oats,
that's like a.

2776
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,530
That's like saying I'm going to buy
mormon granola.

2777
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:14,680
Right.
You imagine how many people would buy

2778
02:09:14,681 --> 02:09:17,260
scientology flakes.
Oh,

2779
02:09:17,261 --> 02:09:18,580
that'll be dope.
Right?

2780
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:20,110
I mean,
that's exactly what it is.

2781
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:22,180
Are clear.
How about catholic?

2782
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:24,280
Crisp.
That's my morning cereal.

2783
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:25,810
I enjoy catholic.
Chris.

2784
02:09:25,811 --> 02:09:28,120
Everybody got the same bowl?
How can.

2785
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:31,210
What does quaker oats.
It's religious cereal.

2786
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,780
What?
What it.

2787
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:33,880
What the fuck does a quaker?

2788
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:36,700
I have to do anything.
They didn't give a fuck about quakers.

2789
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:41,220
Quakers were so innocuous that they were
willing to use them as props was like

2790
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,750
the way they sell klondike bars with
polar bears.

2791
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:46,570
They use the quaker.
It just says that was the first.

2792
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:50,230
That was the right it.
The layers.

2793
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:53,470
Don't you think that's what they did?
That do make sense.

2794
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:56,230
Totally.
I bet quakers had fucking zero interest

2795
02:09:56,231 --> 02:09:58,300
in quaker oats.
I bet they don't get paid.

2796
02:09:58,301 --> 02:10:00,280
I bet they get fucked over on the
commissions.

2797
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:02,980
I bet the quaker oats company keeps all
the money.

2798
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:05,020
Pepsi owns it now.
There you go.

2799
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:08,620
Those quakers are out there going,
what the fuck?

2800
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:11,680
This is ours.
This is our outfit.

2801
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,980
But you look at that outfit and you go
that some wholesome oats.

2802
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:18,760
I bet that oats doesn't even swear he
doesn't drink.

2803
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:23,020
That oats makes its own butter.
That oats lives and the either niceness

2804
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:28,160
falchuk way in a field and they plow
with the fucking like a regular

2805
02:10:29,291 --> 02:10:31,870
mechanical plow and they do everything
old school.

2806
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:34,010
Right?
My grandmother was

2807
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,000
telling about the cotton gin class time
I went to see.

2808
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:38,510
She liked it.
She on her way out.

2809
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:41,360
You telling me about this?
We were in the back of the comedy store.

2810
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,330
Yeah.
It was interesting.

2811
02:10:42,331 --> 02:10:44,930
And then so she wasn't alive when the
cotton gin was korean mother,

2812
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,640
her mother.
These are the stories she heard.

2813
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:48,080
My grandmother was alive.
I was like,

2814
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:50,270
what drugs did y'all do when you were
young?

2815
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:52,430
And she said,
aspirin just came out,

2816
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:54,800
jesus.
So that's what.

2817
02:10:54,801 --> 02:10:56,870
That was the.
That was the thing.

2818
02:10:56,871 --> 02:10:57,620
You know what?
I mean,

2819
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:00,560
we mean people took aspirin for
recreation or she was just like,

2820
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:03,110
that was just the,
that was just the thing outside of like,

2821
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:05,540
you know,
home grown because they was farmers.

2822
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:07,280
My grandmother was like,
that.

2823
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:08,950
Remind me of the movie,
the help,

2824
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,150
the help,
the help.

2825
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:14,030
I don't know that movie.
It's like,

2826
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:15,000
it's about the,
uh,

2827
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:19,610
that black lady who raised the white
family type thing to help.

2828
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:21,890
Is that a recent movie?
Really?

2829
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:24,650
Um,
who was in it?

2830
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:29,780
Who was in will be goldberg,
white family raised her preppy goldberg.

2831
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:31,970
Hilarity ensues.
Emma stone was in it.

2832
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:34,040
Here's a picture.

2833
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,860
What fucking movie is this?
It helped.

2834
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,960
I have no idea what this was.
My grandmother.

2835
02:11:42,290 --> 02:11:45,320
So those two black women raised those
two white women.

2836
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:48,650
But in a sense,
in like the relationship that happened,

2837
02:11:49,130 --> 02:11:50,990
like I went to one of my grandmother's
birthday part,

2838
02:11:50,991 --> 02:11:53,780
I think she was like 80 and it was a
white family there.

2839
02:11:54,070 --> 02:11:55,160
And I was like,
who are these people?

2840
02:11:55,190 --> 02:11:56,370
And their,
my family.

2841
02:11:57,140 --> 02:12:00,980
That's the family that's your
grandmother helped used to nanny for and

2842
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:05,080
they remained close because of,
you know,

2843
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,850
uh,
she helped raise these young ladies,

2844
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:08,750
you know what I mean?
Man,

2845
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:10,160
they fly,
my mom,

2846
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:14,030
my grandmother out to philly to spend
time with them and stuff like that.

2847
02:12:14,110 --> 02:12:15,040
Uh,
and it's,

2848
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:15,950
uh,
it's an interesting,

2849
02:12:16,330 --> 02:12:17,780
you know,
situation.

2850
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:19,340
So,
uh,

2851
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:24,470
just to hear these stories and you know,
my grandmother telling me about when the

2852
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,950
cotton gin and she broke it down like,
yeah,

2853
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:32,000
we'll tape the cotton and take the seeds
out and let it go.

2854
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,480
And people are amazed by this.
They just watching it like,

2855
02:12:35,481 --> 02:12:38,720
whoa.
Like that was the thing that people

2856
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:40,880
looked at,
like how people look at computers.

2857
02:12:41,610 --> 02:12:42,441
Like,
oh man,

2858
02:12:42,441 --> 02:12:45,020
what are we going to do now?
The napster revelation.

2859
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:45,390
Yeah.
Like,

2860
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,820
whoa,
what are we gonna do for her?

2861
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,500
This thing is here to put us out of
work.

2862
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:50,810
And you know how people would do a day's
work and got to,

2863
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,450
like she said,
once slavery in it and people had to get

2864
02:12:53,451 --> 02:12:57,600
paid how somebody,
I don't know if it was a father or

2865
02:12:57,601 --> 02:13:01,580
somebody dealing with a job and they
gave him a dime,

2866
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:03,430
you know?
Wow.

2867
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:07,880
So now you're not getting lodging or
food or nothing like that and you got to

2868
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:12,380
earn a wage and you get like a dime,
like doing like some heavy,

2869
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:14,090
you know,
things.

2870
02:13:14,091 --> 02:13:19,091
And who this is blowing my mind amongst
everything else that's going on

2871
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,393
in the world,
you know,

2872
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:27,020
you know what's crazy,
that person living that life and making

2873
02:13:27,021 --> 02:13:30,920
a dime and living in a modern semi
modern to us,

2874
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,040
you know,
modern in

2875
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,130
its context,
society is doing so much better than

2876
02:13:35,131 --> 02:13:37,050
someone who was born 200 years before
that.

2877
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:39,150
Yeah.
And so much better than someone,

2878
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:41,700
you know,
any anytime prior to that.

2879
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:43,650
So check this out.
My grandmother's 90.

2880
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:45,840
So the women on her side.
Okay.

2881
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:48,110
Family along longer.
My mother,

2882
02:13:48,170 --> 02:13:50,360
my grandmother,
his mother died at 107.

2883
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:52,980
So between them two,
you got over,

2884
02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:55,250
you know,
you got like over 200 years.

2885
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,230
That's incredible.
So,

2886
02:13:57,530 --> 02:14:00,340
uh,
it's just an interesting

2887
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:01,750
timeframe,
you know,

2888
02:14:01,751 --> 02:14:04,240
when you,
when we look back at people that lived

2889
02:14:04,241 --> 02:14:06,670
like a couple of hundred years ago,
we think to ourselves like,

2890
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:08,500
fuck that,
you know,

2891
02:14:08,501 --> 02:14:11,710
especially if you were a slave or if
like,

2892
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:15,970
if he would,
if you were a free person living in

2893
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,040
America in 18,
10,

2894
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:19,210
let's just go to 18,
10,

2895
02:14:19,570 --> 02:14:22,090
just a regular person like you.
And I don't want to do that.

2896
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:24,490
You don't want to go back to that
fucking life.

2897
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:25,840
Like,
good lord,

2898
02:14:26,230 --> 02:14:29,640
good luck getting fresh milk.
Good luck finding vegetables.

2899
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,030
Uh,
in most cities,

2900
02:14:31,031 --> 02:14:33,460
like good luck getting everything
delivered to you.

2901
02:14:33,461 --> 02:14:34,660
They didn't even have cars yet.
Ah

2902
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:36,640
man,
this is a good thing.

2903
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,630
I,
since I lived,

2904
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:41,710
I was born in athens.
My first six years in athens is a small

2905
02:14:41,711 --> 02:14:46,711
town with uga is even athens before.
So everything I ate vegetable wise was

2906
02:14:47,471 --> 02:14:49,000
grown,
you know,

2907
02:14:49,250 --> 02:14:50,410
in that area,
in the yard,

2908
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,480
in the backyard.
That's amazing there.

2909
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:56,560
The grapes on the vine,
the tomatoes came out the ground,

2910
02:14:56,561 --> 02:14:58,170
the chickens,
you know,

2911
02:14:58,270 --> 02:15:00,040
my grandfather haul chicken.
So the chicken,

2912
02:15:00,041 --> 02:15:03,820
the a's came out of the backyard.
He shot there,

2913
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:08,470
we fished on saturdays for cut the fish,
here's off,

2914
02:15:08,530 --> 02:15:10,990
get the skin off and they're from in the
yard.

2915
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:16,710
He took the grapes from the vines and
made wine and if he caught an abundance

2916
02:15:17,441 --> 02:15:19,330
of fish,
he will keep enough for her family and

2917
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:24,390
all the neighbors traded food.
So my first six years is like,

2918
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:25,090
when you know,
when you,

2919
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:27,030
eight or 10,
they put a pellet gun in your hand,

2920
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,570
you work your way up to a hunting
rifles.

2921
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:32,290
Um,
so that's what I left when I moved to

2922
02:15:32,291 --> 02:15:33,640
the city.
That's interesting.

2923
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:36,640
So I was a country,
so vegetables and everything tasted

2924
02:15:36,641 --> 02:15:38,050
good,
you know,

2925
02:15:38,051 --> 02:15:42,850
you get the corn off the stalk and then
grandma and corn was yellow.

2926
02:15:42,851 --> 02:15:45,520
It was like a lighter color.
It was like a whitish color.

2927
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:49,340
She make cream corn from scratch.
Um,

2928
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:52,270
the preserves,
it was jelly was made.

2929
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:56,260
Uh,
the rabbits squirrel,

2930
02:15:56,261 --> 02:15:58,420
the pks fell out of the tree.
You can third,

2931
02:15:58,450 --> 02:16:00,550
you hungry.
You just go outside at any time and grab

2932
02:16:00,551 --> 02:16:02,780
food,
grab two peanuts,

2933
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:05,500
squeezing with your hand.
You got a snack,

2934
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,150
you know,
and that's,

2935
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:10,570
that was the first,
like six years,

2936
02:16:10,571 --> 02:16:14,080
like food was there things you put them,
you get a bucket,

2937
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:16,210
you opened them.
He used to run your thumb,

2938
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:19,180
thumb through them,
which I didn't like none of that,

2939
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:22,210
but that's what,
that's what it was.

2940
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:24,850
Well there's something beautiful about
that right?

2941
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,290
At this point.
Yeah.

2942
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,480
At this point,
because they overcharge them for that

2943
02:16:28,481 --> 02:16:30,170
stuff now,
but for

2944
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:31,810
them it is not easy,
but it looked.

2945
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:33,660
They made it look easy.
Well,

2946
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:36,700
it's large scale.
Everybody could do it like that.

2947
02:16:36,701 --> 02:16:39,610
You'd have to have small populations of
people with good pieces of land.

2948
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:42,160
Like you know,
I'm sure your grandfather had to have

2949
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:44,140
some.
My grandfather had a similar situation

2950
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:46,660
in New Jersey.
He had a pretty good sized backyard.

2951
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:49,960
It was all garden.
He had his area where he would drive to

2952
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:53,620
his driveway and then everything to the
right of the driveway was all sticks in

2953
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:58,200
the ground and tomato plants and my
grandfather grew everything and they

2954
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:02,410
turned their tomatoes into tomato sauce
and my grandmother made homemade tomato

2955
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:05,230
sauce and like all of his vegetables,
he would grow.

2956
02:17:05,231 --> 02:17:08,560
Everything that he would eat all year
would be like in that garden.

2957
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:10,570
That's a.
That was a normal thing for the

2958
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:11,433
immigrants,
you know,

2959
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:14,560
for people who grew,
who came here from other parts of the

2960
02:17:14,561 --> 02:17:18,370
world where you know,
you had to have a supply of food,

2961
02:17:18,371 --> 02:17:19,204
which is true.

2962
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:20,800
I mean,
it only makes sense.

2963
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:24,010
We figured out a way to truck things in.
People have,

2964
02:17:24,011 --> 02:17:25,870
you know,
once we start tracking things in,

2965
02:17:25,871 --> 02:17:29,380
nobody grows anything anymore.
I heard a story about people like my

2966
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:34,150
uncle and his friend I have in money and
they put $300 together and bought a goat

2967
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:36,980
and ate off that goat.
You know?

2968
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:37,901
Smart.
Yeah.

2969
02:17:37,901 --> 02:17:40,510
They faded a little bit and then they
ate off of it for like a month.

2970
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:41,980
Yeah.
If you,

2971
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:45,430
if you kill a goat in your yard though,
when people find out about it,

2972
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:49,780
this is my friend used to say his name,
but my gardener guy that I was talking

2973
02:17:49,781 --> 02:17:51,470
about earlier,
he had,

2974
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:53,380
well his name's jose.
It's not like you don't know.

2975
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:54,910
You don't know which jose it is.

2976
02:17:56,950 --> 02:18:00,100
I don't want to give away his identity.
Probably jose conseco,

2977
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:02,260
but this,
uh,

2978
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:05,270
he uh,
he got a goat and uh,

2979
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:07,110
him and his,
uh,

2980
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:10,930
his friends killed it in the yard and
butchered it.

2981
02:18:10,931 --> 02:18:15,931
And then they had a cookout and the
neighbor complained apparently,

2982
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:19,600
and he didn't understand.
He was like,

2983
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:22,900
what do you like?
What's bothering you about this?

2984
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:24,520
Like,
what is he didn't like?

2985
02:18:24,521 --> 02:18:26,020
He literally didn't understand.
He's like,

2986
02:18:26,021 --> 02:18:27,310
it's safe.
It's healthy.

2987
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:29,080
Like this is an animal.
I know,

2988
02:18:29,081 --> 02:18:30,790
I know where that the meat coming from,
you know,

2989
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:32,590
he's trying to explain this to me in his
broken english.

2990
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,990
He's like,
I know where this animals meat comes

2991
02:18:34,991 --> 02:18:37,450
from.
Like why would anybody have a problem

2992
02:18:37,451 --> 02:18:39,610
with that?
If you buy meat yourself,

2993
02:18:39,611 --> 02:18:41,710
I don't know,
like he didn't understand,

2994
02:18:41,711 --> 02:18:42,670
you know,
he came from Mexico.

2995
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:45,730
He did just did not understand why
someone would have a problem with him

2996
02:18:45,731 --> 02:18:47,050
killing a goat and a yard.

2997
02:18:47,430 --> 02:18:49,360
Like course I killed the goat in the
yard.

2998
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:52,120
What do you want me to kill a kid?
It didn't make sense to him.

2999
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:54,010
They're like,
you can't kill a goat in the yard.

3000
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:56,050
He's like,
where the fuck do you kill your goat?

3001
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:57,640
And like,
you don't kill your kid.

3002
02:18:57,950 --> 02:19:00,310
Strange like,
well what do you get your meat?

3003
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,700
You go to the store.
He's like,

3004
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:03,710
well,
you don't know where that fucking meat

3005
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:06,310
even came for his idea.
That was alien.

3006
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:08,930
It's the logic is man of how things
happen.

3007
02:19:08,970 --> 02:19:11,010
I'm too weird.
And you're like,

3008
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:12,310
yeah,
if you talk to older people,

3009
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:17,410
you understand struggle.
You know what people actually went

3010
02:19:18,401 --> 02:19:23,401
through and on a good part,
like my grandma taught me about the

3011
02:19:23,621 --> 02:19:25,100
first dryers.
Yeah.

3012
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:28,300
And my grandma like,
no,

3013
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:31,820
don't use it once a month.
Once a month.

3014
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:32,940
Yeah,
don't because they,

3015
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,930
you know this better.
The of lennon in the sun.

3016
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:40,910
It still better to dry your clothes in
the sun because the sun kills bacteria.

3017
02:19:42,050 --> 02:19:43,100
Really?
That's why you will.

3018
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:44,690
If you look at how to tie them and they
say,

3019
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,940
how do you take care of denim and keeps
it from fading,

3020
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:51,110
they'd be like it and hanging in the sun
because the sun kills the bacteria that

3021
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,250
gets rid of the smell.
But when I'm in jeans fade because of,

3022
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:59,610
because of the now you want to clean
your genes because it might get smells

3023
02:19:59,611 --> 02:20:00,890
and the like.
When you break it in jeans,

3024
02:20:00,891 --> 02:20:03,480
you really don't watch him like that.
You know you were.

3025
02:20:03,481 --> 02:20:08,481
I'm just like everyday type stuff and
the dye in the denim fades and it at the

3026
02:20:08,931 --> 02:20:13,931
cotton shrinks and all that bullshit.
So hang them in the sun,

3027
02:20:14,660 --> 02:20:16,370
you know,
to keep it from shrinking.

3028
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:19,550
That keep them from shrinking.
And it was heat though.

3029
02:20:19,551 --> 02:20:22,900
That was just the water.
And then the evaporation from the

3030
02:20:22,910 --> 02:20:24,860
extreme heat,
extreme dryer,

3031
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:26,600
that's what makes them shrink.
Right?

3032
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,790
But if you hang it in the sun,
you're still.

3033
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:33,320
The sun still kills some of the bacteria
and stuff and it makes sense.

3034
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:35,420
But if you ever drive,
if you ever like,

3035
02:20:35,890 --> 02:20:37,760
we don't do it here,
but I did something.

3036
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:40,930
I had to stay in the country home and
you watch like a sheet or a shirt and

3037
02:20:40,931 --> 02:20:44,440
you hang out in the sun and with the air
hit it and it just the freshness of the

3038
02:20:44,441 --> 02:20:45,350
smell,
you know,

3039
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:51,560
and what was smart about this place,
they put the lemon trees near the

3040
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:56,040
hanging place.
So now you're close to the city.

3041
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,960
A lemon smell to it.
Right?

3042
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:01,580
Because the wind that comes through.
That make sense?

3043
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,800
Yeah,
it does actually make sense.

3044
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:07,280
But if you're in a city and it's
polluted,

3045
02:21:07,550 --> 02:21:08,780
that's different.
That's different.

3046
02:21:08,781 --> 02:21:09,614
Yeah.
You're

3047
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:13,280
clothes might smell funky.
Like that's the weirdest thing to me is

3048
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:15,620
when people are around people who smoke
cigarettes,

3049
02:21:15,621 --> 02:21:18,170
how strong the smell is in there.
Close.

3050
02:21:18,171 --> 02:21:21,440
Strong.
Like I never realized it until I would

3051
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:25,880
come home from back when you could smoke
in clubs.

3052
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:28,430
It was a big thing.
Comedy clubs,

3053
02:21:28,431 --> 02:21:29,960
man.
I mean everybody smoked.

3054
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:31,910
It was just constantly.
We'd go to a bar,

3055
02:21:31,911 --> 02:21:33,500
everybody smoked,
you would go to comedy clubs.

3056
02:21:33,501 --> 02:21:38,120
Everybody smoked and I remember not
realizing when I smelled like and then

3057
02:21:38,121 --> 02:21:40,880
taking a shower and then picking up my
clothes and be like,

3058
02:21:40,881 --> 02:21:44,810
what the fuck?
Like they stunk.

3059
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:47,720
It's smells bad.
That is a weird thing,

3060
02:21:47,721 --> 02:21:50,710
man,
that people have something that gives

3061
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:54,260
him cancer.
It makes everyone around them stink.

3062
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:57,110
Like not even me.
I wasn't even smoking,

3063
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:01,550
but being around those people made me
stink and people like,

3064
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:05,090
who cares?
I need my smokes.

3065
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,420
I used to smell like gasoline when I had
the nine,

3066
02:22:09,450 --> 02:22:13,310
four it because they had a hairline
crack in the gas tank,

3067
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:17,900
so if you fill it all the way up to the
funerals that get in the car.

3068
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,660
My barracuda,
I used to have to drive with him

3069
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:23,180
window open,
fucking terrible smoke and fumes and

3070
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:24,300
shit.
We're getting that car.

3071
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:27,120
Worst smell.
I remember the gasoline smell.

3072
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:31,200
I remember that car and I met in that
stu about that car and you really broke

3073
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:34,170
it down kinda with and they're like,
oh,

3074
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:36,960
this is a real old school car.
Like the problems that people I know

3075
02:22:36,961 --> 02:22:40,650
have an old schools.
They car was built to look great.

3076
02:22:41,130 --> 02:22:45,210
That was a problem with the suspension,
the setup and everything was very low.

3077
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:50,000
She was very low to the ground because
it was so low to the ground and bottom

3078
02:22:50,001 --> 02:22:50,860
out on things.
Yeah,

3079
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:53,040
it wasn't,
it didn't handle very well because it

3080
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:56,040
wasn't designed for that.
It was just designed to be like a really

3081
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:57,930
low car,
like it was tubbed.

3082
02:22:58,230 --> 02:23:01,030
So the back,
the back area where the backseat is,

3083
02:23:01,031 --> 02:23:05,790
was all cut out and then the frame was
welded and bent up so that the wheel

3084
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,470
tuck deep back wheel.

3085
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:08,790
Well,
it looks great.

3086
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:11,180
I seen him as stupid as fuck.
I watched the being made.

3087
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,800
Uh,
and um,

3088
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:14,760
you know,
I learned with my friends who got old

3089
02:23:14,761 --> 02:23:15,930
school cars.
Once you've started,

3090
02:23:15,931 --> 02:23:18,420
you just can't modify.
One thing was certain cars,

3091
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:21,130
you know,
especially when it comes to suspension

3092
02:23:21,131 --> 02:23:23,520
and wheels and not doing the brakes.
Well,

3093
02:23:23,521 --> 02:23:25,500
you know what they do now,
it's really interesting.

3094
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:30,860
They do these different companies have
suspensions and frames that they build

3095
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:32,600
for these old cars.
Yeah.

3096
02:23:32,601 --> 02:23:34,110
That's one of the problems with those
old cars.

3097
02:23:34,111 --> 02:23:37,590
You're like the suspension and the
frames are just,

3098
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:40,200
it's so whack,
which don't have fully independent

3099
02:23:40,201 --> 02:23:43,830
suspension there.
The way it's all set up is so old

3100
02:23:43,831 --> 02:23:46,290
school,
so they have some upgrades and that can

3101
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:48,390
definitely enhance the way these cars
perform,

3102
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:51,180
but now they do say certain companies
like art morrison,

3103
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:56,410
they take a suspension and they build a
frame and it's like say if you're going

3104
02:23:56,411 --> 02:24:01,411
to build like a 1969 mustang,
they would build a frame and suspension

3105
02:24:02,611 --> 02:24:06,630
for the [inaudible] 69 mustang,
and then you take the old body and you

3106
02:24:06,631 --> 02:24:09,960
bolted down to this modern frame
suspension.

3107
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:13,110
You have a car that performs infinitely
credits and the original car,

3108
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:14,730
it's going to be waste,
stiffer,

3109
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:18,150
it's way better designed,
and then they have all these suspension

3110
02:24:18,151 --> 02:24:20,490
improvements.
Now they've figured out a way to make

3111
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:23,910
suspensions that adjust the way on
modern car does.

3112
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:27,360
So it just constantly like thousands of
times a second.

3113
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:31,320
So if you're driving a car,
like if you say like you get a brand new

3114
02:24:31,321 --> 02:24:32,910
bmw seven series,
yeah,

3115
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:37,110
those things are smooth as a baby's ass.
Just whooo.

3116
02:24:37,730 --> 02:24:40,350
So comfortable with that.
And one of the reasons why they're so

3117
02:24:40,351 --> 02:24:45,120
comfortable is there,
the suspension is constantly adjusting.

3118
02:24:45,450 --> 02:24:49,800
It's constantly adjusting to whether
it's bumpy outside are smooth and every

3119
02:24:49,801 --> 02:24:54,801
bump that it hits it calibrates what it
needs to do to adjust for this impact.

3120
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:58,230
And you get this incredibly stabilized,
right?

3121
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,660
I'm doing a shitty job of explain.
There's a lot of people right now,

3122
02:25:00,670 --> 02:25:02,990
there's car experts like you don't know
who to go.

3123
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:07,380
Cars that make sense.
I know enough to kind of butchered that,

3124
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:08,910
but this,
uh,

3125
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:13,080
they know now they know how to do that
with old school cars so they can take

3126
02:25:13,081 --> 02:25:18,081
that 1969 mustang and put a similar type
of computerized suspension arrangement

3127
02:25:19,801 --> 02:25:23,320
in it where it's constantly adjusting to
the,

3128
02:25:23,321 --> 02:25:24,000
um,
the,

3129
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,570
the,
the terrain.

3130
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:29,530
They're also figuring out how to do
antilock brakes on old cars.

3131
02:25:29,531 --> 02:25:31,120
They haven't figured out that totally
yet.

3132
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:33,850
That's a little bit of a struggle.
My,

3133
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:35,430
a friend of mine,
he,

3134
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:39,430
he bills and sell cars,
but he knows exactly which ones he

3135
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:41,340
liked.
Like the 71 chevelle.

3136
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:43,390
Oh yeah.
He had the 68 colbert,

3137
02:25:43,391 --> 02:25:45,790
which I drove,
and that was two cars and scary.

3138
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:50,080
I drove the 68 cobra mustang.
He put 10,000 into the motor and it was

3139
02:25:50,081 --> 02:25:53,890
like over 500 horses and if it,
if it rained a little bit,

3140
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:55,630
yeah.
Uh,

3141
02:25:55,810 --> 02:25:59,080
for me it had a kenny bail blower on it.
Oh god.

3142
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:03,070
And that was my first experience with a
supercharger and how hype they are

3143
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:05,440
[inaudible].
It's like you could lose control of that

3144
02:26:05,441 --> 02:26:06,550
car.
Easy.

3145
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,220
And a viper or jews.
Yeah.

3146
02:26:09,310 --> 02:26:12,760
I drove a viper before I drove one of
those ones and a rented one.

3147
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:16,330
I have valet.
I got lucky and just an idol.

3148
02:26:16,331 --> 02:26:18,220
That call goes.
It just goes.

3149
02:26:18,310 --> 02:26:19,900
Oh yeah.
Well you've seen the new ones.

3150
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:22,900
Yeah,
they have a poll is up.

3151
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:27,910
They have this new viper viper ar
something I think it's called.

3152
02:26:27,911 --> 02:26:31,720
I think that's what it's called,
attack that attack mode.

3153
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:37,090
This thing is fucking insane.
It's basically a race car that you could

3154
02:26:37,091 --> 02:26:38,890
buy,
but what they're doing with these vipers

3155
02:26:38,891 --> 02:26:40,420
is that bringing them to these race
cars,

3156
02:26:40,421 --> 02:26:42,880
these race tracks,
and it just breaks every record,

3157
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,500
every race,
every race track.

3158
02:26:44,501 --> 02:26:45,770
They take it on this thing break,
right?

3159
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:48,820
Breaks records,
and it looks ridiculous.

3160
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:51,880
Even the curves straight away.
Oh fuck you.

3161
02:26:51,881 --> 02:26:53,800
At curves.
It's got giant tires on it.

3162
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:57,330
The tires are super wide and it's got
more than 600 horsepower.

3163
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:59,350
What is it called?
Jimmy acr.

3164
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:00,660
Acr.
That's it.

3165
02:27:00,670 --> 02:27:03,130
Easier.
You've got to look at this thing.

3166
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:06,460
The deep bevels in the hood.
Look at that face.

3167
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,890
Get the fuck outta here.
You kidding me?

3168
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:14,670
It's supposed to be just a fucking
preposterous automobile and you could

3169
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:17,230
buy that at a store.
I mean,

3170
02:27:17,231 --> 02:27:20,650
it has ground effects that come right
out of a race car,

3171
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:24,190
but this thing is insane.
When people,

3172
02:27:24,191 --> 02:27:26,650
uh,
review it when the review and that's

3173
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:30,280
like you independent canyon going
sideways when that far it was just a

3174
02:27:30,281 --> 02:27:31,120
little bit,
you know,

3175
02:27:31,121 --> 02:27:33,370
if you're going to love it,
it's just,

3176
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:35,180
that's just long enough.
Yes.

3177
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:37,600
Less than a second is long enough for
fun.

3178
02:27:37,601 --> 02:27:38,740
Yeah.
To,

3179
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:40,840
you know,
it's a great road.

3180
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,370
Keep placing more.
That shit.

3181
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:43,380
Don't shut it off.
You know,

3182
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:48,130
it's a great road to go to.
There's a road off of um,

3183
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:51,160
the to chris.
Chris.

3184
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:52,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

3185
02:27:52,661 --> 02:27:53,830
The,
I know what you're talking about.

3186
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:54,970
I don't know the name of it.

3187
02:27:55,030 --> 02:28:00,030
It's a road off the two,
but it's like if you take the 2:10 and

3188
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:02,920
uh,
you head towards pasadena and you go up

3189
02:28:02,921 --> 02:28:04,060
into the mountains.
Yeah.

3190
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:07,360
You know,
there's this crazy abandoned roads where

3191
02:28:07,361 --> 02:28:10,600
you might not have anybody out there
except maybe like a dude on a motorcycle

3192
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:12,970
and everything's like turning and
twisty.

3193
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,040
They do a lot of testing out there.
If you go out,

3194
02:28:15,041 --> 02:28:18,740
they'll use like mules,
like a car that uh,

3195
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:21,260
they cover,
like they would take this car and then

3196
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:23,300
they would cover it over with like
graphics,

3197
02:28:23,710 --> 02:28:26,060
even some plastic or something.
So you couldn't tell what it looked

3198
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:27,080
like.
I've seen that before.

3199
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:28,550
It's kind of dope.
Look at that thing.

3200
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:31,100
Jesus christ.
Yeah.

3201
02:28:31,101 --> 02:28:33,770
They trying to get me to go up to
somebody trying to get me to go up to

3202
02:28:33,771 --> 02:28:35,960
the chris highway up there off the two
of them are fun.

3203
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:37,910
You should go up there,
go up there with your card because you

3204
02:28:37,911 --> 02:28:40,190
don't even have to drive fast.
I have a good time up there,

3205
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:43,310
but I don't drive on any of them.
If there's a car in front of me,

3206
02:28:43,311 --> 02:28:44,970
I might slow up and wait for it to go
by,

3207
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:47,210
but I'm doing like 40,
40,

3208
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:48,860
which is a lot.
That's down.

3209
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:53,150
That's downloadable for what'd you post
to do with a car like this?

3210
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:55,970
You wouldn't be doing that.
You'd be going a lot faster.

3211
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,670
That's the problem with these cars as
opposed to like an old car.

3212
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,370
Like say if you got like an old bmw.
You know what?

3213
02:29:01,371 --> 02:29:05,000
I really like those.
I love those.

3214
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:07,040
They're cool man.
Yeah man.

3215
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:11,360
And their little boxy and.
But when you drive those things,

3216
02:29:11,361 --> 02:29:15,110
apparently you feel everything.
They're so small.

3217
02:29:15,310 --> 02:29:17,450
I'll see this.
See if you could pull up the smoking

3218
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,980
tire two.

3219
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:20,050
Oh,
oh two.

3220
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:21,860
Um,
he uh,

3221
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:25,640
some dude had a souped up one and then
not even souped up like you put a giant

3222
02:29:25,641 --> 02:29:30,410
engine and it was just like a really
well done version of that engine,

3223
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:34,060
but he's driving around in it.
I met matt before he comes.

3224
02:29:34,130 --> 02:29:34,780
Matt farah?
Yeah.

3225
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:37,100
He couldn't come to the club is a big
comedy fan.

3226
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:39,180
He's a good dude.
He's,

3227
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:42,530
he's a real good dude and he fucking
loves cars.

3228
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:46,130
So this is a give you some volume on
this.

3229
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:48,650
This is a course.
He's.

3230
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:52,190
What I really like about him too is he's
like a regular dude.

3231
02:29:52,270 --> 02:29:56,960
Like he's not trying to pretend to be
some super professional presenter.

3232
02:29:56,970 --> 02:30:00,800
He's just a guy who knows a fuck load
about cars and really loves them.

3233
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:02,900
And look at this thing,
man.

3234
02:30:03,550 --> 02:30:04,490
What year is that,
jamie?

3235
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:08,180
They build them up properly from what I
can see.

3236
02:30:10,450 --> 02:30:11,283
No,
no,

3237
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:12,440
no.
That's the name of the car.

3238
02:30:12,441 --> 02:30:16,710
Jamie
[inaudible]

3239
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:21,540
doesn't say what year I was running
into.

3240
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:24,470
They've swapped the interior for this
luxe package,

3241
02:30:24,471 --> 02:30:29,471
which is only available in europe.
Let's scoot ahead so you can hear what

3242
02:30:29,511 --> 02:30:30,980
it feels like when he's driving.
This thing,

3243
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:32,690
yeah,
here we go.

3244
02:30:33,670 --> 02:30:38,670
An interesting because on the one hand
it was sorta bmw's corporate engine at

3245
02:30:39,331 --> 02:30:44,331
the time,
but it actually the way up to and they

3246
02:30:44,571 --> 02:30:49,571
would use these seasoned m 10 blocks to
build their crazy turbo formula one

3247
02:30:51,421 --> 02:30:55,210
engines and there's a really neat
documentary about the history of

3248
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:57,760
pedals.

3249
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:59,320
See he's a.
That's what I'm saying.

3250
02:30:59,321 --> 02:31:03,880
This is a serious geek when it comes to
cars or really knows his shit though.

3251
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:07,270
You know what I like when he's in the
car with a person who built the car much

3252
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:10,090
time and money you put in.
I'm going to put all this time and his

3253
02:31:10,091 --> 02:31:12,160
money and his energy in it and he was
like,

3254
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:14,630
that's you're not going to find another
car like this.

3255
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:15,760
He was like,
we bought to drive it.

3256
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:19,030
Then he'll take off like the brakes,
a little squishy and the suspension

3257
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,240
little off,
but it's got a nice little pull to it.

3258
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:24,930
Like he just started with this like just
disappeared off the title.

3259
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:28,310
He is honest.
Honest jamie.

3260
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:32,950
Sixty six to 77 dope little car man.
Well,

3261
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:37,380
little fucking beer can though.
You know who I had a chance to pleasure

3262
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:38,580
to meet and I used to have to try to.

3263
02:31:38,670 --> 02:31:42,270
I used to drive around downtown and by
nine and see if I can find it at night.

3264
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:44,400
Magnus magnus.
Yeah.

3265
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:48,390
I had the pleasure of meeting.
Somebody was trying to get rid of a nine

3266
02:31:48,391 --> 02:31:51,120
to eight and we went over there and he
showed us around.

3267
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:51,991
Oh yeah.
No,

3268
02:31:51,991 --> 02:31:55,220
he's a real friendly guy here.
His place is amazing.

3269
02:31:56,540 --> 02:32:01,200
There's so many old porsches.
I think he's got like one,

3270
02:32:01,201 --> 02:32:01,711
two,
three,

3271
02:32:01,711 --> 02:32:02,191
four,
five,

3272
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:04,560
six.
He's probably got at least 10 of them no

3273
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:08,490
more.
I counted like 17 or 17 main room

3274
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:15,000
and um,
he got some more like the 9,009 s nine,

3275
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,513
nine,
14.

3276
02:32:16,570 --> 02:32:18,810
Oh,
it's kind a bunch of turbos to quite a

3277
02:32:18,811 --> 02:32:21,270
few turbos now.
He really got into a turbo phase where

3278
02:32:21,271 --> 02:32:23,430
he's buying those nine,
three zero turbos.

3279
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:26,460
Yeah.
He's an interesting character man,

3280
02:32:26,461 --> 02:32:29,910
because his love of his crash.
You fucked.

3281
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,930
Oh boom.
Did.

3282
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:33,750
Yeah,
that was really dumb.

3283
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:39,720
You got a little silly.
He plowed into the back or the side of

3284
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:45,710
his car into the back of a giant.
It looks like a car carrier,

3285
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:51,210
just that's why you're not supposed to
drive like that.

3286
02:32:51,211 --> 02:32:53,790
Byron.
It's not supposed to go sideways on

3287
02:32:53,791 --> 02:32:56,510
public roads.
It wasn't that I just,

3288
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:59,310
I just my my ass with a little bit.
I called it.

3289
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:04,610
His cars are all like pretty reasonably
horse powered up to magnus has cars,

3290
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:07,020
like he doesn't have anything like
really crazy,

3291
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:11,790
but a shark worst gave him one of their
cars to drive around for a little and a

3292
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:17,210
shark works made 800 horsepower gt two
and magnus a painted it like a different

3293
02:33:18,811 --> 02:33:19,561
paint scheme.
You know,

3294
02:33:19,561 --> 02:33:22,680
he's a crazy paint schemes.
I got a picture with that one.

3295
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:25,110
Oh,
the guy that was sitting outside?

3296
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:28,200
Yeah.
I'm their scared the fuck out of me.

3297
02:33:28,290 --> 02:33:30,870
I drove that car of real scared the fuck
out of me.

3298
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,670
It's one of the few cars where I drove
it once.

3299
02:33:32,671 --> 02:33:33,530
I was like,
eh,

3300
02:33:33,690 --> 02:33:35,880
I'm good.
Like this is too much,

3301
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:38,120
but I see I see yours and I'm like,
I'm good on that.

3302
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:40,040
I just want to stop,
you know,

3303
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:43,050
I liked naturally aspirated because a
way of pools in the certain time.

3304
02:33:43,051 --> 02:33:45,990
It just was like taking like a nice
little breather in.

3305
02:33:46,110 --> 02:33:47,070
There.
It is right there.

3306
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:48,991
Yeah.
I saw that.

3307
02:33:48,991 --> 02:33:51,900
The car,
that car is so fast,

3308
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:54,000
it just doesn't even make any sense.

3309
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:04,693
Downhill

3310
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:08,890
with the gravity.
See he's um,

3311
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:14,060
he's taken it around some corners here
is actually this exact same road where I

3312
02:34:14,061 --> 02:34:15,900
took it.
Oh,

3313
02:34:15,940 --> 02:34:19,780
I was there at this time.
I was there with them when they were

3314
02:34:19,781 --> 02:34:22,930
doing this.
But this car is too fast.

3315
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:25,840
It's too fast.
I mean it's not maybe too fast for a

3316
02:34:25,841 --> 02:34:28,480
race car driver,
but too fast for a guy like me because

3317
02:34:28,481 --> 02:34:30,940
it just,
you don't like one of the cool things

3318
02:34:30,941 --> 02:34:34,510
about like that 2002.
As you get to ring the engine out,

3319
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:38,260
there's a lot of range where you can
drive your rev it up and that's where

3320
02:34:38,261 --> 02:34:41,410
you get your power and you,
you can go plenty fast than it.

3321
02:34:42,030 --> 02:34:45,370
The handling of those cars.
A lot of times it's connected to the

3322
02:34:45,371 --> 02:34:49,060
lightness and the whole.
All the feel of the car is coming from

3323
02:34:49,061 --> 02:34:50,830
the fact that it's not,
there's not a lot there.

3324
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,650
This car is a totally different
experience.

3325
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:58,480
This car is like all about managing the
pedal because if you stomp on the pedal,

3326
02:34:58,530 --> 02:35:02,530
that fucking thing is going spinning.
It's way too powerful,

3327
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:06,370
but you know,
it's one of those things where they keep

3328
02:35:06,371 --> 02:35:09,730
coming up with new and improved cars
every year.

3329
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,100
Every year cars get faster and faster
and faster.

3330
02:35:12,101 --> 02:35:15,580
Especially performance cars.
They've broken the three second barrier.

3331
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:20,320
A lot of cars you could buy today goes
zero to 60 in less than three seconds

3332
02:35:20,330 --> 02:35:21,940
to.
There's a gang of them.

3333
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:24,340
I want to drive with gotti.
Fuck.

3334
02:35:24,341 --> 02:35:27,790
Was I going to sit in one?
Do not drive it with just sitting there.

3335
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:29,770
That might as well be a spaceship.
The,

3336
02:35:29,771 --> 02:35:31,330
uh,
those neurons.

3337
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:33,130
Yeah,
those are ridiculous.

3338
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:35,410
The um,
yeah.

3339
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:38,590
My homeboy he built,
he built this 69 shelby.

3340
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:44,340
The 68 got damaged so the insurance had
to cut them a check and he spent that

3341
02:35:45,401 --> 02:35:50,401
money and built a 69,
69 that I haven't drove and he don't

3342
02:35:50,891 --> 02:35:53,350
drive it as much because it's worth a
lot of money.

3343
02:35:53,490 --> 02:35:55,690
Look at that 1000,
200 horsepower.

3344
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:57,580
That's a lot.
That's ridiculous.

3345
02:35:58,120 --> 02:36:01,060
That's a ridiculous car.
I saw one of those the other day in

3346
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:03,100
beverly hills.
Some was,

3347
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:04,900
it wasn't the,
uh,

3348
02:36:04,901 --> 02:36:05,800
the,
the yellow,

3349
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:08,650
the yellow and black one.
I'm.

3350
02:36:08,830 --> 02:36:11,140
No.
What color was it?

3351
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,900
I don't remember what color.
I want to say it was white,

3352
02:36:14,110 --> 02:36:16,690
but it had arab license plates on it,
which is really interesting.

3353
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:20,950
They're getting these cars and these
super rich dudes from Saudi Arabia,

3354
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:23,980
they bring them over for saudi summer.
See,

3355
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:27,340
that's what's going on right now.
Where we are is hot as fuck.

3356
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:31,650
Where they live.
It's crazy way on where they live is

3357
02:36:31,651 --> 02:36:33,760
like 150 fucking degrees or something
nutty.

3358
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:38,230
And so they come over here when they've
got crazy oil money,

3359
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:43,360
they come over here and they bring that.
They bring these cars with their plates

3360
02:36:43,361 --> 02:36:46,900
that are registered to those other
places and they drive them around and

3361
02:36:46,901 --> 02:36:49,690
they get away with it because they're
super rich like is nothing dude.

3362
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:52,840
Did you see that shit that happened
where these guys were racing in beverly

3363
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:56,020
hills?
There were racing with a ferrari and a

3364
02:36:56,021 --> 02:36:59,350
gt three,
a porsche gt three and they were fucking

3365
02:36:59,351 --> 02:37:02,540
racing on a residential street in
beverly hills just

3366
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:09,660
flying through fucking red lights and
the neighbors saw them do it.

3367
02:37:09,941 --> 02:37:12,000
So the neighbors all we're fucking
furious.

3368
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:14,320
They're all standing outside on their
street,

3369
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:15,980
holding up their cameras

3370
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,500
and filming these guys right here it is
right here.

3371
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:21,500
This guy has got them oats of ferrari.
It looks like.

3372
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:24,790
I don't know which version,
but then the,

3373
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:27,850
the gt three.
I mean these guys are a full lying down

3374
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:32,860
residential roads.
You got two things run at the same time,

3375
02:37:33,801 --> 02:37:35,330
buddy.
You got two windows running.

3376
02:37:37,030 --> 02:37:40,280
But I'm so while while these guys are
doing this,

3377
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:42,710
the neighbors are aware of it.
So they start

3378
02:37:43,730 --> 02:37:46,310
filming because it probably do.
See you look at it,

3379
02:37:46,311 --> 02:37:47,360
see everybody.
And then.

3380
02:37:47,361 --> 02:37:50,270
So this car fucking started smoking
guys,

3381
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:52,670
engine started smoking and he pulled it
into his driveway.

3382
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:55,760
But look at everybody standing out here
with their fucking cameras.

3383
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,710
They'll realize like,
oh my god,

3384
02:37:58,711 --> 02:38:00,920
this guy's a piece of shit.
No one cop insight.

3385
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,890
That's crazy to me.

3386
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:03,910
But it's so funny.
Everybody's like,

3387
02:38:03,911 --> 02:38:06,010
world's school of course going to blow
up.

3388
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:07,900
Everybody's assuming that car's gonna
explode.

3389
02:38:08,350 --> 02:38:09,190
So they're filming it.

3390
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:18,960
So this guy was driving his car so fast
and so hard that it caught on fire.

3391
02:38:19,300 --> 02:38:21,390
So I'll never buy a fucking ferrari by
the way,

3392
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:24,600
are people should not be designing
things.

3393
02:38:25,890 --> 02:38:28,320
I saw I a,
a solid nine.

3394
02:38:28,330 --> 02:38:33,330
18 that with the dubai plates on it.
They had the nerve to put the silver

3395
02:38:35,701 --> 02:38:38,880
metallic paint on it.
So not only bought expensive car,

3396
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:41,760
they put the real.
What made the car look chrome?

3397
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,260
Oh,
I've seen that.

3398
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:46,290
Justin bieber had one of those chrome
fisker.

3399
02:38:48,390 --> 02:38:49,350
How do I know that?
Why?

3400
02:38:49,351 --> 02:38:51,450
Because I'm friends with jamie.
Jamie tells me these things.

3401
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:56,480
The cops in shout out to the cops in the
beverly hills because they nice.

3402
02:38:57,330 --> 02:38:59,460
You know,
I was coming through the apart,

3403
02:38:59,461 --> 02:39:00,990
fell off my,
my,

3404
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:04,900
my pores that holds the alternator and
the,

3405
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,670
and the serpentine belt together.
So the car was just lose power.

3406
02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:11,940
Right.
So I'm running through beverly hills.

3407
02:39:12,090 --> 02:39:16,080
I was going to the summit a,
the is a place on mulholland drive.

3408
02:39:16,081 --> 02:39:20,190
I was standing there and I'm,
I'm in beverly hills with no lights on,

3409
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:25,340
just driving up the street and the cops
pull us over and I turn off the car,

3410
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:27,080
can't turn off the car.
Well,

3411
02:39:27,081 --> 02:39:28,690
not because it's not going to come back
home.

3412
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:31,190
I turn it off.
They was like,

3413
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:33,840
what?
Let me explain to you what's going on,

3414
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:36,810
is a piece of mail.
Tried to explain to them the mechanics.

3415
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:38,280
They was like,
nah.

3416
02:39:38,340 --> 02:39:40,470
I was like,
I get out the car and you can do

3417
02:39:40,471 --> 02:39:43,000
whatever you need to do with this car
because I'll here,

3418
02:39:43,001 --> 02:39:46,670
it's going to be here.
And uh,

3419
02:39:46,690 --> 02:39:48,470
I had my,
my african homeboy who I just want to

3420
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:52,230
try with me all right.
And he's like,

3421
02:39:52,231 --> 02:39:53,980
hey officer,
what's going on?

3422
02:39:54,030 --> 02:39:56,490
He's not going to show you how powerful
this thing is that I do.

3423
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:58,133
And he's like,
look,

3424
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:02,490
I'll work for the artists a lot of guff
from visiting from Washington dc.

3425
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:04,560
I worked for the national government.
Yeah,

3426
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,413
yeah,
yeah.

3427
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:08,180
He's like,
I got the irs notice saying that they

3428
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:12,210
should have shot them onsite so
everybody's afraid of the irs,

3429
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:14,280
the terrify,
pull the bags out,

3430
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:15,210
yada yada,
yada.

3431
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:16,170
And then he was like,
okay,

3432
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:19,950
you're free to go.
And then I was in somebody's shrubs and

3433
02:40:19,951 --> 02:40:21,250
uh,
you know,

3434
02:40:21,251 --> 02:40:22,590
uh,
there was a cop right there.

3435
02:40:22,591 --> 02:40:23,101
He was like,
sorry,

3436
02:40:23,101 --> 02:40:26,130
you don't have to be so close and like
in the bushes.

3437
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:29,670
And I remember looking at him,
but sometimes it's fun having your face

3438
02:40:29,671 --> 02:40:31,800
in the bush.
And I smiled and he was just like,

3439
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:33,630
he's like,
just step away.

3440
02:40:34,630 --> 02:40:37,140
They
get my jokes,

3441
02:40:37,141 --> 02:40:37,974
you know what I mean?

3442
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:39,930
Well,
there's tents been a.

3443
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:43,350
So the pulling people over no lights
that say they can't shut their car off.

3444
02:40:43,351 --> 02:40:44,820
They don't know what kind of crazy shit
you're doing.

3445
02:40:44,821 --> 02:40:45,480
Yeah,
that's true.

3446
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:47,070
I mean,
you pull up to a dude,

3447
02:40:47,071 --> 02:40:49,400
there's two dudes.
One of them's from the,

3448
02:40:49,470 --> 02:40:53,160
from africa who works for the irs.
The other one's a comedian with some

3449
02:40:53,161 --> 02:40:55,380
weird jokes.
Their cars running,

3450
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:57,510
they can't,
they can't shut the car off.

3451
02:40:58,520 --> 02:41:00,150
Something to talk about it.
Right.

3452
02:41:00,151 --> 02:41:01,770
But a lot of shit could be going on
here.

3453
02:41:02,100 --> 02:41:03,720
Like whenever you deal with someone who
won't,

3454
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:06,810
they don't have their lifetime.
That's weird.

3455
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:07,380
Like,
okay,

3456
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:10,650
why is this guy not as full time?
And then you deal with another thing.

3457
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:12,510
You won't show this car off.
What,

3458
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:14,040
what?
What's going on?

3459
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:15,840
Like there's a bunch of shit that
supposed to happen.

3460
02:41:15,841 --> 02:41:17,220
One,
you're supposed to have your lifetime to

3461
02:41:17,221 --> 02:41:17,790
get pulled over.

3462
02:41:17,790 --> 02:41:19,230
Shut your car off.
You show your id.

3463
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:20,850
Everything is supposed to go according
to plan.

3464
02:41:20,970 --> 02:41:22,750
So you're throwing in all these new
poles.

3465
02:41:23,790 --> 02:41:25,920
So the improv game,
we're doing no lights.

3466
02:41:25,921 --> 02:41:27,390
Okay.
Why don't you have lights?

3467
02:41:27,391 --> 02:41:28,770
I can't.
Doesn't work.

3468
02:41:28,810 --> 02:41:30,500
Altair got an issue.
Alright.

3469
02:41:30,510 --> 02:41:33,120
Shut your car off.
I can't shut the car off.

3470
02:41:33,150 --> 02:41:34,340
Stays here.
I'm gonna.

3471
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:35,660
Tell you it's is true stuff.
When I moved in,

3472
02:41:35,661 --> 02:41:37,870
I had a honda prelude.
I put a time of building it.

3473
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:41,460
Fourth generation drove here.
I used to get pulled over all the time.

3474
02:41:41,461 --> 02:41:43,010
Black on black.
I,

3475
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:47,400
I lived in inglewood and I realized like
all the time I get my car search put in

3476
02:41:47,401 --> 02:41:51,990
the back of police cars and I talked to
a cop and he told me about proximity and

3477
02:41:51,991 --> 02:41:55,740
how criminals operate and when they wake
up they get descriptions in the morning

3478
02:41:55,741 --> 02:41:58,890
and if you fit that description they
going to profile you and that's when I

3479
02:41:58,891 --> 02:41:59,521
realized like,
oh,

3480
02:41:59,521 --> 02:42:01,800
I'm living in the wrong neighborhood
driving the wrong vehicle.

3481
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:05,460
So when I got denied for four,
I get what I call corporate old white

3482
02:42:05,461 --> 02:42:10,461
man colors that champagne or that boring
gray and I just drive and now I have

3483
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:13,290
really no problems.
You know what I mean?

3484
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:15,370
That's what I,
that's the thing.

3485
02:42:15,371 --> 02:42:18,930
It's like how my mind works sometimes to
figure out that pattern and be like,

3486
02:42:18,931 --> 02:42:21,720
okay,
this is what it's getting pulled over

3487
02:42:21,721 --> 02:42:22,830
and stuff.
Then I need to,

3488
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:26,010
you know,
I don't know if it's the survival in

3489
02:42:26,011 --> 02:42:29,040
your way,
but it's like I have to shift and some

3490
02:42:29,041 --> 02:42:30,150
people real.
I'd be like,

3491
02:42:30,151 --> 02:42:31,980
I don't feel like I should shift like
that,

3492
02:42:32,010 --> 02:42:34,590
but I'm like,
you know,

3493
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:36,630
the cops,
the cops will be like,

3494
02:42:36,631 --> 02:42:39,030
slow down.
I've messed up in the.

3495
02:42:39,031 --> 02:42:41,940
I was doing 60 on franklin one time just
enjoying my life

3496
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:46,590
because white women jogging and
everything and the street.

3497
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:47,520
I'm like,
this ain't bad,

3498
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:48,420
you know,
life is great.

3499
02:42:48,421 --> 02:42:50,400
I tell jokes and the cops were just
like,

3500
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:51,360
sir,
you slow down.

3501
02:42:51,361 --> 02:42:52,810
And I remember putting my hand out the
window,

3502
02:42:52,811 --> 02:42:57,060
like no problem officer.
Then that was it and I was like,

3503
02:42:57,061 --> 02:42:59,990
this is amazing right here.

3504
02:43:03,690 --> 02:43:06,450
But I also experienced another white
privilege thing when I had an.

3505
02:43:06,460 --> 02:43:08,480
I had an accident in the nine,
four,

3506
02:43:08,481 --> 02:43:11,650
four and it was a latino people and the
guy got out of the car.

3507
02:43:11,651 --> 02:43:13,900
The cops showed up and I was sitting on
the car,

3508
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:15,570
the old white guy,
sir,

3509
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:16,960
is this your car?
And I was like,

3510
02:43:16,961 --> 02:43:17,860
yes sir.
He was like,

3511
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:19,900
okay,
everything is gonna be okay.

3512
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:23,910
And then he went.
He lit into the mess and people to where

3513
02:43:23,911 --> 02:43:26,440
I got uncomfortable for a while.
I almost said something to yelling at

3514
02:43:26,441 --> 02:43:30,910
the mexican people assuming this ain't
regulation and where the paperwork for

3515
02:43:30,911 --> 02:43:33,380
this and asking them all the time,
let me see your id.

3516
02:43:33,410 --> 02:43:36,940
When did you get this?
And and me coming from Georgia,

3517
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,850
not using.
I'm used to seeing black people treat

3518
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:39,880
it,
but no other culture,

3519
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:42,550
so to.
I almost stepped in but something was

3520
02:43:42,551 --> 02:43:45,040
like hold on,
don't.

3521
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:49,120
And I swim sitting on the car like damn,
feeling guilty.

3522
02:43:49,121 --> 02:43:51,100
Like this was white,
white guilt feels like,

3523
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:54,730
but I'm still on the other side.
Right.

3524
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:56,770
So I'm just letting it ride.
Like,

3525
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:00,640
you know,
that's funny,

3526
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:04,030
but like I said before,
it's like when you in that place where

3527
02:44:04,031 --> 02:44:06,010
you see different stuff,
it's shapes you.

3528
02:44:06,020 --> 02:44:10,030
Somehow it gets that understanding.
I think with a lot of cops,

3529
02:44:10,031 --> 02:44:13,390
something can happen to where they pull
over so many people that are illegal

3530
02:44:13,391 --> 02:44:15,940
immigrants.
They start getting upset and start

3531
02:44:15,941 --> 02:44:18,520
getting upset of that and they treat it
like disproportionately.

3532
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:23,740
You know?
I've seen a lot of fucking people that

3533
02:44:23,741 --> 02:44:26,310
are driving illegally in los angeles
truth.

3534
02:44:26,470 --> 02:44:28,690
I got rear ended by a dude.
That's right.

3535
02:44:28,691 --> 02:44:32,800
I remember that there was no driver's
license,

3536
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:35,230
but I know a lot of white people who
were driving illegally.

3537
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:36,103
They don't worry about it.

3538
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:37,900
Nothing happens.
But you do.

3539
02:44:37,901 --> 02:44:40,780
If you get pulled over though,
if they find that if a cop finds out,

3540
02:44:40,781 --> 02:44:42,700
you're driving illegally,
you're in trouble.

3541
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:43,750
Yeah,
for sure.

3542
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:45,130
Everybody,
no matter who you are,

3543
02:44:46,450 --> 02:44:48,730
they'll tell your car,
but the odds are you're getting pulled

3544
02:44:48,731 --> 02:44:51,130
over.
It's kind of slim.

3545
02:44:51,390 --> 02:44:52,780
Um,
um,

3546
02:44:52,781 --> 02:44:56,230
yes.
The odds are greater if you are black or

3547
02:44:56,231 --> 02:44:57,640
if you're mexican of getting pulled
over.

3548
02:44:57,641 --> 02:44:59,860
I would say that probably,
definitely true.

3549
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:02,110
Cut the me getting out the car like this
and was like,

3550
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:02,944
no,
not you.

3551
02:45:03,070 --> 02:45:03,791
And you're like,
oh,

3552
02:45:03,791 --> 02:45:05,560
I was just stretching,
you know.

3553
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:08,370
Yeah.
But you know this,

3554
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,900
it's what it is to me.
You know what I mean?

3555
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:13,900
I wouldn't want to be a fucking cop.
Oh no,

3556
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:16,110
no.
I think me honestly,

3557
02:45:16,111 --> 02:45:21,111
I think that their job is to nurture to
nerveracking for the regular person.

3558
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:22,630
And I think so too.

3559
02:45:22,690 --> 02:45:25,780
And they don't make enough money to go
through the mental part of it.

3560
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:27,610
Exactly.
To affect their relationships and their

3561
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,473
family.
Life.

3562
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:30,870
Suicides.
Yeah.

3563
02:45:30,871 --> 02:45:33,610
The cops commit suicide.
Lots of cops feel despair.

3564
02:45:34,180 --> 02:45:36,580
It's a crazy job.
This is a crazy job,

3565
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:37,700
you know?
Yeah.

3566
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:39,370
Like,
yeah,

3567
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:40,580
they got to go.
Like I said,

3568
02:45:40,581 --> 02:45:42,160
I got to go.
They got a reputation.

3569
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:47,940
Cops have almost a reputation now of a,
of a black man to act like they,

3570
02:45:49,811 --> 02:45:51,940
like people look at them like prejudice
against.

3571
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:53,440
Yeah.
And it's like,

3572
02:45:53,441 --> 02:45:54,820
oh,
to me it's like,

3573
02:45:54,821 --> 02:45:56,070
oh shit,
truths.

3574
02:45:56,071 --> 02:45:57,590
Ironic.
Um,

3575
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,440
and they have to go in those situations.
They have to go to the hood with that

3576
02:46:02,441 --> 02:46:03,460
reputation.
Yup.

3577
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,640
And that's outfit on.
And that's a scary thing.

3578
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:08,950
You know what I mean?
If your outfit is being represented by

3579
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:11,630
people that do and fucked up things like
those videos that we were talking about

3580
02:46:11,631 --> 02:46:13,010
earlier,
that's your outfit,

3581
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,030
that's the team you're on.

3582
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:17,860
So you have to go and you know that
these people are gonna see you and

3583
02:46:17,861 --> 02:46:20,240
looking at you and know that you
represent that team,

3584
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:21,860
that they've been watching all these
videos.

3585
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:25,760
And I'm from a place where the cops
looked like said the cops,

3586
02:46:25,761 --> 02:46:28,710
they treated you fucked up like,
oh,

3587
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:31,500
they were dirty.
So it's a different ballgame.

3588
02:46:31,550 --> 02:46:32,730
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

3589
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:35,660
Um,
but that's what it is.

3590
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:40,690
It's so much that isn't understood
outside of the videos that are being.

3591
02:46:41,210 --> 02:46:45,380
Do you think there's a way on stage that
you can relay a lot of this stuff that

3592
02:46:45,381 --> 02:46:47,960
you're talking about?
Say I feel like,

3593
02:46:47,961 --> 02:46:49,760
um,
if you could figure out a way to make

3594
02:46:49,761 --> 02:46:54,320
humor out of the difference between your
background growing up and what you're

3595
02:46:54,321 --> 02:46:59,321
experiencing now and you just,
you're on your own unique perspective.

3596
02:47:01,310 --> 02:47:01,881
Yeah,
I'm talking,

3597
02:47:01,881 --> 02:47:03,050
I'm slowly talking about it.

3598
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:04,380
Yeah,
you can ask.

3599
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:05,800
Touch.
When I worked with tosh,

3600
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:08,390
my opening jail,
I walk on stage and be like,

3601
02:47:08,391 --> 02:47:13,391
not all black lives matter.
Some niggas should die and that's a

3602
02:47:13,740 --> 02:47:15,170
shot.
Just 30 seconds.

3603
02:47:15,171 --> 02:47:17,690
I will get applause break in 30 seconds
at the,

3604
02:47:17,810 --> 02:47:21,470
at the tense time or that.
And by that I'm telling them,

3605
02:47:21,890 --> 02:47:26,750
I explained the story of the protests
when traffic is being held up and I'm

3606
02:47:26,751 --> 02:47:28,820
driving with my gas light on.
Yeah,

3607
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:30,380
and I'm like,
this don't if this,

3608
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:34,010
my car dies,
I'm a hostage in a situation I don't

3609
02:47:34,011 --> 02:47:36,860
want to be in.
And then feeling sorry for that black

3610
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:40,460
guy who's stuck in traffic and don't
know why.

3611
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:44,300
And every white person looking at him
and he liked this ain't got nothing to

3612
02:47:44,301 --> 02:47:46,830
do with me.
I'm just on my way to owners counties.

3613
02:47:46,850 --> 02:47:47,840
I can fuck this white girl.

3614
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:52,190
That was the bit,
but all of it's based on truth.

3615
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:54,740
But you know what I mean,
on truth,

3616
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:57,950
I felt like when those black lives
matter protesters were shutting down

3617
02:47:57,951 --> 02:48:00,140
highways,
I'm like fucking white people.

3618
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,480
It was white people that are trying too
hard to be dealt with.

3619
02:48:02,481 --> 02:48:05,030
Black lives matters.
So they took it to the highway and shut

3620
02:48:05,031 --> 02:48:08,000
down the highway.
So I knew this one dude is like a super,

3621
02:48:08,001 --> 02:48:11,690
super lefty guy and he uh,
he was a part of the black lives matter

3622
02:48:11,691 --> 02:48:16,691
shutting down highways and I was like,
what are you doing man out in berkeley?

3623
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:19,340
But super,
super liberal,

3624
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:22,130
crazy people.
It is a hierarchy of black people just

3625
02:48:22,131 --> 02:48:25,220
like a of white people.
And me and jim martin neighbors,

3626
02:48:25,221 --> 02:48:29,010
we say some shit like real niggas don't
give a fuck about black issues.

3627
02:48:30,210 --> 02:48:32,300
It's just true because their survival
mode,

3628
02:48:33,070 --> 02:48:33,950
you know what I mean?

3629
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:35,810
You know,
so things like,

3630
02:48:35,811 --> 02:48:38,540
you know,
education and shit like that don't

3631
02:48:38,541 --> 02:48:42,480
really matter who leaving to me.
I didn't talk about politics going on.

3632
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:45,500
So I really don't care about politics.
That's how I feel about it.

3633
02:48:45,501 --> 02:48:50,030
Like I still got to grind either way.
Do you care at all?

3634
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,950
Like when you,
when you're looking at hillary clinton

3635
02:48:51,951 --> 02:48:53,440
and Donald Trump,
like what's your thought?

3636
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:55,160
You just don't think about things.
I think,

3637
02:48:55,290 --> 02:48:57,980
and I said this before,
before everything got crazy.

3638
02:48:57,981 --> 02:48:59,910
Trump got crazy.
Uh,

3639
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:03,710
I understand sometimes where he's coming
from through educational purposes.

3640
02:49:03,711 --> 02:49:05,930
I understand republican mindset,
you know what I mean?

3641
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:08,280
Because that was taught to export

3642
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:10,200
businesses and stuff like that.
You know,

3643
02:49:10,201 --> 02:49:12,570
all that makes sense to me.
But I don't think.

3644
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:17,840
I think this part is for ratings.
I see it as a show and I think,

3645
02:49:18,150 --> 02:49:21,130
I think trump is like a,
uh,

3646
02:49:21,270 --> 02:49:23,340
a character.
Uh,

3647
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:25,500
definitely they want everybody to vote
for hillary.

3648
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:27,660
I think they're gonna lead people that
way,

3649
02:49:27,661 --> 02:49:31,430
like you leave water to go down a
certain ravine and then hillary is gonna

3650
02:49:31,450 --> 02:49:35,280
make a because their personality and the
best,

3651
02:49:35,310 --> 02:49:37,170
like it ain't like a barack obama people
be like,

3652
02:49:37,171 --> 02:49:38,190
oh,
like this lady.

3653
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:41,820
But I think once you get in,
she'd been to kind of personnel is

3654
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:43,230
terrible.
Well,

3655
02:49:43,310 --> 02:49:45,630
you know,
I think she's going to make some

3656
02:49:45,631 --> 02:49:48,660
adjustments on the low that's going to
really fuck up people.

3657
02:49:48,661 --> 02:49:51,950
She does things that make me super
nervous to sing.

3658
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:55,440
Have you ever see the video of her?
Was she was talking about uh,

3659
02:49:55,850 --> 02:49:56,780
uh,
gaddafi.

3660
02:49:57,610 --> 02:49:58,310
She,
she's,

3661
02:49:58,310 --> 02:50:00,600
she was laughing about how uh,
she,

3662
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:05,550
I think she says we came,
we saw he died and it was like off

3663
02:50:05,551 --> 02:50:08,370
camera and like she,
I don't think she realized that she was

3664
02:50:08,371 --> 02:50:12,570
being filmed or this is just not her
behaving like I'm gonna play it for you.

3665
02:50:13,810 --> 02:50:17,000
This came,
we saw he died.

3666
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:19,550
Yes,
we came,

3667
02:50:19,850 --> 02:50:23,210
we saw he died.
What

3668
02:50:23,210 --> 02:50:27,350
is basically she's also looking off at
someone else,

3669
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:30,950
like for their approval when looking at
the woman she's talking to necessarily.

3670
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:34,940
It's just,
that's so weird thing to joke about,

3671
02:50:34,970 --> 02:50:39,970
the enormity,
the magnitude of assassinating a foreign

3672
02:50:40,071 --> 02:50:42,380
leader,
whether he's a dictator,

3673
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:45,590
dictator or not,
like there's a lot going on there you

3674
02:50:45,591 --> 02:50:49,730
are overthrowing the ruler of a
government even though it was a terrible

3675
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:54,760
reader and you are now opening up that
government and those people that were

3676
02:50:55,761 --> 02:50:59,390
being suppressed by that car,
you were opening them up to the turmoil

3677
02:50:59,570 --> 02:51:01,910
of establishing a new leader.
That's true.

3678
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:05,720
And that's where it is right now.
So when you see someone who is running

3679
02:51:05,721 --> 02:51:10,721
for president and they are joking around
about a scenario that has taken place

3680
02:51:11,031 --> 02:51:12,800
that they were a part of,
she was a part of.

3681
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:18,070
And that scenario is now directly
connected to horrific tragedies and this

3682
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:22,640
chaos that,
that is an isis stronghold.

3683
02:51:22,641 --> 02:51:24,590
Now,
Libya is nicest store.

3684
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:27,040
So I,
uh,

3685
02:51:27,050 --> 02:51:27,650
that,
that,

3686
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:29,650
that sits in that living situation isn't
the.

3687
02:51:32,930 --> 02:51:34,570
Yeah.
Okay.

3688
02:51:34,700 --> 02:51:37,050
This goes on Libya.
Yeah.

3689
02:51:37,170 --> 02:51:38,080
Yeah.
Well,

3690
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:39,470
it's none.
None of those things are good.

3691
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:42,680
You know,
whenever you have a brutal dictator like

3692
02:51:43,010 --> 02:51:44,750
Iraq,
saddam hussein,

3693
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:48,860
it's not good when the world is
entertaining.

3694
02:51:48,861 --> 02:51:53,210
Brutal dictators is a brutal dictator
that's in charge of these people.

3695
02:51:53,211 --> 02:51:53,780
They're,
they're,

3696
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:55,310
you know,
it's not,

3697
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:59,870
it's not fair is dangerous and we have
to interact with this person in some

3698
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:03,320
way.
I love a country where there's a curfew

3699
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:05,230
and I'm thinking that's going to happen
here,

3700
02:52:05,231 --> 02:52:06,100
but I just love a country

3701
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:10,840
where the public has a curfew for women
at a certain time and they will.

3702
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:13,870
If a chick was out by myself,
they just put a straight into van.

3703
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:17,500
Yeah.
And if the republicans and if a dude was

3704
02:52:17,501 --> 02:52:20,250
out and his lights wasn't right or he's
on a motorbike,

3705
02:52:20,310 --> 02:52:22,540
the cop got on the bike with him and
rolling with it.

3706
02:52:22,541 --> 02:52:24,190
The jail,
he had to take the copper jail.

3707
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:25,530
Whoa.
Uh,

3708
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:28,990
so yeah,
it's certain things like,

3709
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:30,280
you know,
that it's like,

3710
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:31,150
wow,
that I,

3711
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:35,860
that I see like it happened here.
And as far as that video,

3712
02:52:35,861 --> 02:52:39,520
to me that's how people power act.
When I say like real,

3713
02:52:39,820 --> 02:52:43,450
like rich and successful,
powerful people like and poor people.

3714
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:46,890
I always tell people they don't give a
fuck the people in the middle of all the

3715
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:49,480
ones that's timid and like,
we should do this for animals in that,

3716
02:52:49,970 --> 02:52:52,830
but those people and poor people like
you listened to that jokes.

3717
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:55,620
They don't give a fuck.
Just like guys I met,

3718
02:52:55,621 --> 02:52:58,660
we talked about man,
I shot three times,

3719
02:52:58,661 --> 02:53:00,270
man,
I shot the first time they go through,

3720
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:01,420
he started hobbling.
I was like,

3721
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:03,690
oh shit.
And the gun jammed.

3722
02:53:03,730 --> 02:53:06,310
I got nervous.
Like these are the stories.

3723
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:10,500
So I had the ability to sit with both
and just the,

3724
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:12,040
the,
and it ain't,

3725
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:14,110
it ain't my comedy is based off this
too.

3726
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:17,230
So I got to be like one of these people
to talking to some of these murders,

3727
02:53:17,231 --> 02:53:19,360
someone with a gun.
It's laughing and joking around about

3728
02:53:19,361 --> 02:53:20,380
it.
It's got to be fucked up,

3729
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:22,960
but it's like this guy didn't die but he
did get hit,

3730
02:53:23,050 --> 02:53:26,850
you know,
but you hear it's like somebody telling

3731
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:30,610
his story and they tell him how bad it
was because you know,

3732
02:53:30,611 --> 02:53:33,160
they live,
they live it and it was over something

3733
02:53:33,161 --> 02:53:33,550
simple.

3734
02:53:33,550 --> 02:53:37,150
Like I told you next time I see you that
this was going to go down,

3735
02:53:37,180 --> 02:53:40,270
you know what I mean?
And it just went down,

3736
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:42,280
you know,
over something simple.

3737
02:53:42,281 --> 02:53:46,750
But I always say like the people like
that at the top when people at the

3738
02:53:46,751 --> 02:53:51,310
bottom don't give a fuck and that's.
And if you look at the politics and now

3739
02:53:51,311 --> 02:53:55,300
you got trump and you got to support it.
The redneck shit that people say they

3740
02:53:55,301 --> 02:53:59,170
don't like those top and bottom people
that pattern wise.

3741
02:53:59,790 --> 02:54:01,460
Um,
but I think yeah,

3742
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:03,320
hillary get in,
I think they're trying to lose everybody

3743
02:54:03,330 --> 02:54:06,730
the whole way and then she's gone on the
low side,

3744
02:54:06,731 --> 02:54:09,370
some document that's really gonna fuck
people up down the line.

3745
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:12,160
Those are my predictions.
Why do you think she's going to do that?

3746
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:13,630
You know how you find that outfit?
Why?

3747
02:54:13,631 --> 02:54:14,770
You know,
how you found out later on?

3748
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:15,610
Like,
oh man,

3749
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:17,650
that document,
that president signed three years ago.

3750
02:54:17,651 --> 02:54:18,950
Fuck people up,
right?

3751
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:20,170
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?

3752
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:21,280
It was a lot of the us.
Yeah.

3753
02:54:21,310 --> 02:54:23,170
So I think it's going to be something
like that.

3754
02:54:23,670 --> 02:54:26,290
Well,
she's gotten away with so much already.

3755
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:28,690
That's what I'm saying.
She's gotten away with so much already.

3756
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:32,740
The idea that she's gonna stop once you
get to the office is ridiculous because

3757
02:54:32,741 --> 02:54:36,040
she broke so many fucking laws where
their email server,

3758
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:40,690
all the lies that she told about bengazi
all throughout her career.

3759
02:54:40,691 --> 02:54:43,240
There's like,
there's many websites document all the

3760
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:45,160
time.
They've caught her lying about like

3761
02:54:45,161 --> 02:54:48,040
pretty important issues.
The idea that she's going to stop doing

3762
02:54:48,041 --> 02:54:49,840
that once she becomes president.
It's crazy.

3763
02:54:49,841 --> 02:54:52,990
She's gotten away with it.
She lies when she talks about getting

3764
02:54:52,991 --> 02:54:56,380
caught in lies like what?
You talked about the fbi.

3765
02:54:57,620 --> 02:55:01,210
I'm having this long interview with her
about her email server.

3766
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:04,370
There's a direct video

3767
02:55:04,370 --> 02:55:09,370
that shows like the direct comparison
between what she said and what he said,

3768
02:55:09,650 --> 02:55:11,900
what she said and when he said it's
horrible.

3769
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:15,740
It's horrible to watch.
Like how is this person even qualified

3770
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:17,930
to run for office?
Forget about the fact that everybody

3771
02:55:17,931 --> 02:55:20,600
wants a woman to be the the new
president.

3772
02:55:20,601 --> 02:55:21,600
I get it.
Yeah.

3773
02:55:21,601 --> 02:55:23,420
That'd be fun for everybody.
Yeah,

3774
02:55:23,421 --> 02:55:24,440
let's,
let's do this.

3775
02:55:24,730 --> 02:55:28,120
The one,
six months to that new car smell gone,

3776
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:29,860
but this is,
she's not the one.

3777
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:31,570
This is not the one you don't want.

3778
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:33,810
I mean,
the only thing good is that she's a

3779
02:55:33,811 --> 02:55:36,570
longterm politician,
so she understands the business.

3780
02:55:36,780 --> 02:55:39,660
The only thing bad is that she's a
longterm politician.

3781
02:55:39,661 --> 02:55:41,990
She knows the business.
So the both things.

3782
02:55:42,430 --> 02:55:46,630
She knows the business sucks and people
don't understand it as a business.

3783
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:48,850
You know what I mean?
They are mostly caught up in it.

3784
02:55:49,110 --> 02:55:51,040
Exactly.
But I definitely think,

3785
02:55:51,330 --> 02:55:55,840
I think people like we all should,
we could find a better way to do things

3786
02:55:55,841 --> 02:55:58,390
better.
I'm hoping and not put power and like

3787
02:55:58,391 --> 02:56:01,600
church and government and these things.
It's just hard.

3788
02:56:01,630 --> 02:56:03,470
It's got such a stranglehold.
Yeah.

3789
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:08,050
The idea that you have to register as
either a democrat or republican to vote

3790
02:56:08,051 --> 02:56:11,110
in the primaries,
the primaries decide which candidate is

3791
02:56:11,111 --> 02:56:14,880
going to represent these parties.
It's a show rate.

3792
02:56:14,920 --> 02:56:17,230
It's never been more obvious.
So that's a charade.

3793
02:56:17,231 --> 02:56:21,200
And I fully never learned learned it
because I look at the bigger picture and

3794
02:56:21,201 --> 02:56:22,034
the pattern.
So,

3795
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:24,250
you know,
um,

3796
02:56:24,710 --> 02:56:26,000
well byron,
we're going to come back

3797
02:56:26,110 --> 02:56:29,530
four years and we'll see if you're right
about hillary clinton if she fucked up

3798
02:56:29,531 --> 02:56:31,120
because you don't remember just a little
while ago,

3799
02:56:31,121 --> 02:56:32,630
everybody was saying that,
that,

3800
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:33,790
uh,
hillary clinton,

3801
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:37,930
that the fbi was going to drop some
bombshell and that more information was

3802
02:56:37,931 --> 02:56:40,570
going to come out about the horrible
things that she's involved with and

3803
02:56:40,571 --> 02:56:43,660
she's done and then she's going to
probably be indicted and then she's

3804
02:56:43,661 --> 02:56:46,240
gonna wind up pulling out and she's not
going to be running for president.

3805
02:56:46,250 --> 02:56:49,390
That was like the big rumors just a few
months ago now.

3806
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:54,550
Trump has gotten so fucked up.
He's done so much stupid shit and said

3807
02:56:54,551 --> 02:56:55,900
so much stupid shit.
Then now,

3808
02:56:55,901 --> 02:57:00,550
like the harvard republican club for the
first time in over a hundred years is

3809
02:57:00,551 --> 02:57:03,130
coming out against the nominee.
The,

3810
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:07,210
there's like a bunch of different
prominent politicians that have come out

3811
02:57:07,211 --> 02:57:09,130
against him.
Like you don't remember that.

3812
02:57:09,460 --> 02:57:12,460
Usually by the time someone gets to a
point where they're running for

3813
02:57:12,461 --> 02:57:15,790
president,
the republican nominee with mitt romney

3814
02:57:15,791 --> 02:57:18,550
or anyone else,
like they're kind of embraced,

3815
02:57:18,610 --> 02:57:19,001
you know,
like,

3816
02:57:19,001 --> 02:57:20,350
okay,
we've got the nominee,

3817
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:22,360
everything's in order,
let's move forward.

3818
02:57:22,510 --> 02:57:26,710
That's not happening now.
Even even with the election just a

3819
02:57:26,710 --> 02:57:28,640
couple of months away,
people were freaking out and they got to

3820
02:57:28,641 --> 02:57:30,160
go.
We can't have this guy,

3821
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:31,660
this guy can't be our guy.

3822
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:33,480
Well,
what happened in dr.

3823
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:36,690
They got a lady,
you know,

3824
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,200
I'm in charge and it was some sneaky
stuff like that,

3825
02:57:40,201 --> 02:57:43,590
but when she got here,
she started doing the curfews and she

3826
02:57:43,591 --> 02:57:46,010
took the haitians and kicked them out.
You know,

3827
02:57:46,020 --> 02:57:48,000
she gave him to be fair.
She was like,

3828
02:57:48,001 --> 02:57:50,650
you got this amount of money,
you can stay a haitian church.

3829
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:51,970
Yeah.
So it got in.

3830
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:55,740
God was showing me scars that allowed
them to stay into in the dr.

3831
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:59,040
So yeah,
it got real for me over there because I

3832
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:01,710
finally talk to

3833
02:58:02,050 --> 02:58:06,000
these dudes that used to be kids asked
for money and now they adults asking for

3834
02:58:06,001 --> 02:58:07,590
money,
what's going on?

3835
02:58:07,960 --> 02:58:10,650
And they started breaking it down like,
yeah,

3836
02:58:10,651 --> 02:58:12,600
let's see.
A group of people just like kicked out

3837
02:58:12,601 --> 02:58:14,520
of a country like that.
And he's like,

3838
02:58:14,521 --> 02:58:15,354
man,
maybe we,

3839
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:18,480
maybe we should be glad we're lost tribe
that could easily be,

3840
02:58:19,350 --> 02:58:22,320
you know,
it could always be worse for sure.

3841
02:58:22,350 --> 02:58:22,801
Yeah.
Yeah.

3842
02:58:22,801 --> 02:58:25,410
And they look up to us and he was like,
you know,

3843
02:58:25,450 --> 02:58:27,220
it was like,
regardless of what's happening,

3844
02:58:27,230 --> 02:58:29,580
and I know this guy,
I know black people getting killed by

3845
02:58:29,581 --> 02:58:32,070
the cops,
but you still got a chance to be

3846
02:58:32,071 --> 02:58:36,100
something.
And I couldn't even say nothing like me

3847
02:58:36,101 --> 02:58:40,320
while North Korea looks up to them.
North Korea,

3848
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:42,420
you know,
at least they don't have to deal with

3849
02:58:42,421 --> 02:58:45,990
dear leader.
They don't have to cry for hours and

3850
02:58:45,990 --> 02:58:48,240
hours when his dad died,
if they don't cry correctly,

3851
02:58:48,241 --> 02:58:51,600
they get put in jail for six months and
forced to work in labor camps.

3852
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:54,570
They have labor camps in North Korea
where people are literally starving to

3853
02:58:54,571 --> 02:58:56,580
death when they sick dogs on them and
the dogs eat them.

3854
02:58:57,070 --> 02:58:59,100
I mean,
this is game of thrones type shit and

3855
02:58:59,101 --> 02:59:00,330
it's going on right now.

3856
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:05,720
This guy who he grew up in a slave camp,
he was a child of someone who was

3857
02:59:07,441 --> 02:59:10,920
convicted of some sort of a crime and
forced to work in these slave camps,

3858
02:59:11,490 --> 02:59:14,730
grew up in this camp,
did not know the rest of the world,

3859
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:17,550
did not know that there was a whole
world out there and somehow or another

3860
02:59:17,551 --> 02:59:19,200
escaped,
but he talked about,

3861
02:59:19,201 --> 02:59:21,820
turned his own family in like they had,
um,

3862
02:59:22,010 --> 02:59:26,670
they have everybody narcan on.
Everybody turned his whole family and in

3863
02:59:26,730 --> 02:59:30,090
his description of the different levels
of torture and treatment,

3864
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:33,930
like different levels of slavery,
what you're capable of doing when you're

3865
02:59:33,931 --> 02:59:35,480
almost dead,
what you're capable of doing.

3866
02:59:35,500 --> 02:59:39,000
Like they have it like classified,
like what jobs you get dependent upon

3867
02:59:39,001 --> 02:59:42,390
how close you are to death.
Fucking terrible man.

3868
02:59:42,510 --> 02:59:43,343
It's crazy.
Like,

3869
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:44,370
you know,
you hear these stories,

3870
02:59:44,371 --> 02:59:46,920
you meet people that like one six
degrees away from that.

3871
02:59:47,190 --> 02:59:48,100
Yeah.
You know,

3872
02:59:48,300 --> 02:59:53,300
what's crazy is that it's 2016 and where
we're living here in los angeles,

3873
02:59:53,791 --> 02:59:56,910
this super progressive at the front line
of culture,

3874
02:59:57,270 --> 02:59:58,020
we feel like,
well,

3875
02:59:58,020 --> 02:59:59,070
hey,
everything's looking up.

3876
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:00,400
Everything's getting great.
No,

3877
03:00:00,430 --> 03:00:03,960
I'm hearing no Korea.
You fucked up the world,

3878
03:00:03,961 --> 03:00:05,600
fucked you,
and you got you gotta.

3879
03:00:05,630 --> 03:00:08,280
This is where you.
You came out into the world.

3880
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:12,050
That's your spot or Namibia.
What we're talking about before an inter

3881
03:00:12,051 --> 03:00:15,240
rainfall in three years you're like,
fuck thirsty,

3882
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:16,380
fuck

3883
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:18,980
you got all that koolaid and only the
interwar to come in.

3884
03:00:19,820 --> 03:00:24,460
If they even get koolaid to get going.
Now is that my mind processed,

3885
03:00:24,461 --> 03:00:25,870
starving.
That's a.

3886
03:00:25,880 --> 03:00:28,460
There's not a lot of food there.
All that peanut butter they're eating

3887
03:00:28,461 --> 03:00:31,910
and they can't
shoot animals and shit.

3888
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:34,280
That's all I can do.
