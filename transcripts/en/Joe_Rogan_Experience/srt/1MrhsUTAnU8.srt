1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,880
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,570
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,560
That was a struggle to put that tweet
out and I think I fucked it up as I was

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,580
releasing it and I was like,

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:14,821
bitch,

6
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,230
you didn't even spell check that.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,030
Are you laying ladies and gentlemen?

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,931
Artie Lange?

9
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,111
Yeah,

10
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:19,944
I fucked it up.

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,083
Whatever.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,620
I didn't do the right thing.

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,870
The colon was fucked up.

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,890
Whatever people figured out.

15
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh,

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,790
any Langley's gentleman.

17
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,230
Artie Lange can play some fucking poor.

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,660
Oh yeah man.

19
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,280
You got a pool table out there.

20
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,230
I don't get this body
running 10 miles a day,

21
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,070
but then now we played a couple of games.

22
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,371
Uber.

23
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:38,971
Do you a,

24
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,200
you kick some ass too.

25
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,830
It was fine.

26
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,663
It's fine.

27
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,920
Did you play in a pool
hall as a kid or something?

28
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,430
Yeah,

29
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,260
well I tore my ACL 21 and a,

30
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,230
I couldn't work out until I got it fixed.

31
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,360
My friend Jon Tobin,

32
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,370
who was a standup comic from New York,

33
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,210
uh,

34
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,043
he,

35
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,470
he and I used to meet at this pool
hall and just shit away our days,

36
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,070
you know,

37
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,220
comics and I just started
playing an obsessive.

38
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,610
I got,

39
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,480
I got hooked on playing in tournaments
and I went through a nutty time where I

40
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,650
couldn't stop playing pool.

41
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,670
I had all these delusions of grand jury.

42
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,000
I was never to have to
work again because yeah,

43
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,701
I like,

44
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,170
like Jackie Gleason and the hustler,

45
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,280
the chubby fingers going h on the corner
and so class go to when Paul Newman

46
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,070
goes,

47
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,760
look at that little Chubby guy walking
around like a Chubby Ballerina.

48
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,960
What did the way he moves?

49
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,794
I go eight answer.

50
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,990
That's playing the violin and stick
stuck between this chubby little finger.

51
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,201
Yeah,

52
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,640
that is amazing movie.

53
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,470
That's one of my all time favorite movies.

54
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,641
Absolutely.

55
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:35,761
I,

56
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,560
Jackie Gleason is a hell of an actor man.

57
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,100
And we were saying Jackie Gleason,

58
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:41,760
he might've been like the best
celebrity pool player ever.

59
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,800
Like Jackie Gleason could
run a hundred balls.

60
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,300
It's hard to find somebody.

61
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,720
Uh,

62
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,700
he almost beat Moscone once,

63
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,140
I think in straight pool didn't,

64
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,400
but almost it didn't.

65
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,690
But almost all of them about that.

66
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:54,150
That sounds like some bullshit
for the Italian say over the fire.

67
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,600
Well,

68
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,381
it was this one time,

69
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,071
Jackie Gleason,

70
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,210
you got him on the fucking ropes.

71
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,173
Ropes.

72
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,580
Fucking Moscone didn't,

73
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,660
he was shitting himself and believe that
this guy is going to be better than me

74
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,340
at everything.

75
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,330
I also have an uncle who told him
he struck out Dominick Dimaio.

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,310
Oh,

77
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,240
Dominic Dimaggio.

78
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:09,850
Joe Dimaggio.

79
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,683
Retarded brother

80
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,230
retarded it was it a real
Dominic Dominic and Joe.

81
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,810
I didn't know.

82
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,490
I didn't know.

83
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,340
I was just making that up.

84
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,301
They all died,

85
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,000
broke really pretty
much where it's pretty.

86
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,120
After the 1989 San Francisco earthquake,

87
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,580
that's where Joe Dimaggio live.

88
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,210
Cops found him walking around the city
in the days with a suitcase full of a

89
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,180
$600,000 in cash.

90
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,970
So it was all from baseball
card signings and shit.

91
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,804
And

92
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,320
how weird was he?

93
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,150
Was he just getting crazy as it got?

94
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,530
Who was,

95
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,560
who was Donald Lotion?

96
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,483
It was silos.

97
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,470
Marilyn Monroe plus he was that strong.

98
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,411
I bet it was.

99
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,310
It sounds like her and Rita
Hayworth and magical fucking twats

100
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,080
like apparently to his girl.

101
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,250
Like he used to leave flowers,

102
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,380
her grave and Sinatra and Ava
Gardner some checks on a slang.

103
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,550
It was Richard Richard Price.

104
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,850
I don't know why business
is always complaining.

105
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,350
I got half the money in all the pussy.

106
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,300
What the fuck it cause it'd be a much
shorter statement made about life.

107
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:19,871
Yeah.

108
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,460
And there's some women that just have the,

109
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,470
their currency.

110
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,850
Like there's social currency.

111
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,160
Is it worth just so much more
than you can ever afford?

112
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,050
I am so happy just to be with them.

113
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,900
And Marilyn Monroe was just so powerful.

114
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,010
She was trying to hold onto a tornado
or something like good luck keeping her.

115
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,790
Well that's exactly why they were trying
to yeah cause they drive you crazy.

116
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,361
Yeah.

117
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,770
Who's the other guy was a Ginsberg.

118
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,360
Who did she live with as well?

119
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,350
So Arthur Miller.

120
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,460
Arthur Miller and the rd show.

121
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,623
Yeah.

122
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,503
Three I guess.

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:50,980
Uh,

124
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,170
yeah,

125
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,351
I'm a,

126
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:51,611
I'm a,

127
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,870
I'm a film historian.

128
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,793
Are you really?

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,290
I'm going to store in a lot of ways
that like especially in sports,

130
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,740
I think,

131
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,920
well,

132
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,150
I don't know how I notice.

133
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,220
I have no idea how I remember this,

134
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:05,221
but you gave me the year between
1949 and the year 2000 so what?

135
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,183
51 years.

136
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll give you the two teams who were
in the world series and who won.

137
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,660
Holy Shit.

138
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,591
I don't know why.

139
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,090
I know if you want to do a couple of,

140
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,290
I'll do it and then we'll get out of it.

141
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,460
I wouldn't even know.

142
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,120
Does anyone know who won a world series?

143
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,390
These two guys,

144
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,980
they don't pick and pay
attention to sports.

145
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:21,880
What am I am a view.

146
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,660
You're on males series title.

147
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,940
I'd literally have no
idea who won this year.

148
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,800
Oh,

149
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,340
who's the world series champion this year?

150
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,980
I don't know who won last year.

151
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,160
I don't know.

152
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,940
I really don't know.

153
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,773
I know it sounds,

154
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,640
it sounds ridiculous.

155
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:35,770
Oh,

156
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,131
it doesn't.

157
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,340
I guess if you don't like
baseball DWG like football,

158
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:39,880
right?

159
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,050
I don't even watch football.

160
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
Would he just likes that MMA shit.

161
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,010
I was kickboxing.

162
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,580
I watch MMA.

163
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,690
I watched those things.

164
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,411
Same Shit.

165
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,750
I watch boxing and that's all
I pay attention to boxing.

166
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,200
I love Mayweather and a,

167
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,610
yeah.

168
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,443
What he's thing.

169
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,400
I think Mayweather is a very clever man.

170
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
Very clever man.

171
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,070
And setting the fight now is a good time.

172
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,940
It's a very good time.

173
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,340
I think so financially though time,

174
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:06,971
financially,

175
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:11,220
but it's also a good time for him as far
as like success wise come manic Pacbio

176
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:14,260
was extremely dangerous
just a few years ago,

177
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,180
like maybe even more so than he is now.

178
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,610
Some straps though,

179
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,090
there's a thought and it may not be
correct because his last fight against

180
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:22,661
Brenda Reos,

181
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,820
he looked really fucking
good and then Chris Algieri,

182
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,020
he looked really fucking good.

183
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,130
I mean he looks good dude.

184
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,431
He's a,

185
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,264
he's a beast.

186
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,700
Okay.

187
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,860
Manny Pacquiao was a beast.

188
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,131
I know,

189
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,050
I understand that.

190
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,490
I've seen the mark has
knocked out when men will.

191
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,570
Mark has knocked him out,

192
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,141
knocked him out.

193
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,000
Dead cold one right hand,

194
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:37,331
Bam.

195
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:40,180
And the thought is when a guy
gets turned off like that,

196
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
like maybe there's a little
something that he lost.

197
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,230
Maybe there's a little step it Mike.

198
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,130
It's not always correct.

199
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,830
Sometimes guys bounce back from
a knockout and they're fine.

200
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,900
It totally varies on the individual,

201
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,943
but

202
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,900
he always says they have to.

203
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,120
Frazier hit him with that
first left and the first fight,

204
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,840
he was more apprehensive than ever,

205
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,441
wasn't his life.

206
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,980
You said it cost him the fight against
Spinks and form him because all he saw

207
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,730
was that fucking,

208
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,563
I'm gonna fucking

209
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,690
but man.

210
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,760
And it affected the rest of his life.

211
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,380
It was a launching left towards guys
throw himself feet were off the ground.

212
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,100
Man.

213
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,040
Did you ever watch the fight but
change George Foreman and Joe Frazier?

214
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,933
Yes.

215
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,890
I like Frazier too,

216
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,630
but it's classic Howard Koh.

217
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,540
Sally Fallon was just
something different back then,

218
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:23,961
man.

219
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,070
He was just something different.

220
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,700
He was hitting guys like 20% 30%
harder than anybody ever seen.

221
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,370
Fight night back in the 70s was fun,

222
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:31,670
man.

223
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,270
It was,

224
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,100
I remember being a kid
really getting like,

225
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:34,700
wow,

226
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,750
you know there's going to be fun.

227
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,201
Yeah.

228
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,690
I remember watching those
ABC wide world of sports.

229
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:42,050
Alexis Arguayo would fight Arguayo prior.

230
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,940
Remember the two are glial prior fights.

231
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,043
Incredible.

232
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,770
The one they thought a,

233
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:47,710
uh,

234
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,960
priors fucking manager put us put
schnapps and as to got them going,

235
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:54,140
well they thought it was coke.

236
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,651
Oh,

237
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,100
okay.

238
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,850
I thought it was,

239
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,050
but then he said it was liquor.

240
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,850
Maybe that doesn't make any sense.

241
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,230
More likely it was COPD.

242
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,360
If someone gave me a bunch
of peppermint Schnapps,

243
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,380
I would not want to fight.

244
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:03,970
Now.

245
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,070
Well,

246
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,551
not only that,

247
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,560
I don't think you could
just tell me if I'm wrong.

248
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,030
I don't think you could just drink coke.

249
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,970
Like if somebody puts cocaine in
a glass and mixes it with waters,

250
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,610
the liquid cook that
you shoot in your nose,

251
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,770
can you just rank it could pick up
Stevie Ray Vaughan Warren's book about

252
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,080
drinking coke for about,

253
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,240
uh,

254
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,951
two years.

255
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,910
You woke up every morning and dissolve
cocaine into a glass of Jack Daniels and

256
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,560
drank it like rocky drank Diego

257
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,170
dummies.

258
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,630
When you're done with doing the line,

259
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,850
you always put the number
on your tongue or on your,

260
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,140
makes your whole mouth numb.

261
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,771
Said drinking.

262
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,920
It must make your whole body
and specially in whiskey.

263
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:40,730
So it's like,

264
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,990
it's an upper and a downer,

265
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:42,560
you know?

266
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,730
Wow.

267
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,130
That's basically basically a living hell.

268
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:46,881
We'll the,

269
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,320
he was just apparently,

270
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,250
I mean Richard,

271
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,541
uh,

272
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:49,801
our,

273
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:50,120
uh,

274
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,300
Aaron Pryor rather later in his career
he had a real problem with trucks and

275
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:57,470
every problem with cocaine and so it was
very likely that he might've had that

276
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,440
problem even while he was
like an elite athlete.

277
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,410
And if you gave them just a little bit
in the corner like there was no drug,

278
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,180
I'll give you another fight as a,

279
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,020
as a boxing fan.

280
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,730
I ran Barkley and Duran.

281
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,310
Fuck yeah.

282
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,530
Holy Shit.

283
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,080
Roberto Duran showed that
even though he was like,

284
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,960
he was in his thirties at the
time I ran a bar who's bigger?

285
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,770
Stronger.

286
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,450
I ran back to the,

287
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:16,851
knocked out.

288
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,190
Tommy Hearns did knock out
turns before that or after that.

289
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,910
Uh,

290
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,750
before,

291
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,230
before I ran bark.

292
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:23,064
It was terrifying.

293
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,850
And Roberta around boxes
face off the same way.

294
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,693
Did a Davey Moore,

295
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,350
I just,

296
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,801
exactly.

297
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,340
I just wish you would've
done it to Leonard.

298
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,641
I just,

299
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,160
I guess maybe he couldn't find them,

300
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:31,491
whatever.

301
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,080
Go grab them and just beat him up.

302
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,040
Who knows what happened.

303
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,251
Man,

304
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,084
that second fight,

305
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,560
Frank Sinatra got paid.

306
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,394
That's what happened.

307
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,000
It could it be that a lot of people
thought that he was paid to take a dive.

308
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,230
The DRN took a dive.

309
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,760
A lot of people thought that they didn't
train and just partied like a fucking

310
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,410
wild animal.

311
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,650
Actually beat Leonard the first time.

312
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
He was one of those guys are one,

313
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,620
$4 million in a fight and then two
months later after a bunch of booze and

314
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,200
cocaine,

315
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,921
a new shoes,

316
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,060
he needs to fight again.

317
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,860
He gets like these big white gold shoes
and he gets heavy and then it needs to

318
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:02,820
box again.

319
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,500
He's a classic story man.

320
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,510
He's a classic style over Berto around.

321
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:06,841
Oh,

322
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,980
he's one of my all time favorites.

323
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,960
Joey Dee has gotten his book many,

324
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:13,380
many years ago because we would always
sit around and talk about Roberto Duran.

325
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,100
Right?

326
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,660
She always a huge Roberto Duran fan,

327
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,494
so it gave me his book.

328
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,170
It's amazing.

329
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,360
Guy had an incredible life.

330
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm sure he did a lot of boxes.

331
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,151
If you think about it,

332
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,440
probably have,

333
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,060
you know,

334
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,510
because they're brought up knots.

335
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,343
I think,

336
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,771
yeah,

337
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:29,340
it's hard to be at the highest
level without being a little nuts.

338
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,240
You got to nurture the physicality and
then the anger and then before you know

339
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,010
you've got a pit bull
at attack your neighbor.

340
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,780
That's what you want.

341
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,930
I was watching a video of Mike Tyson from
87 training with Kevin Rooney and they

342
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,210
were hitting mitts and you see
young Mike Tyson who was like,

343
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:45,301
no,

344
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,820
I don't think he was like
20 or something at the time.

345
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
I don't know how old he was,

346
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,530
but he was just fucking these myths up.

347
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,400
Just just move so fast for heavyweight
and all that Bob and weave and shit that

348
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:56,821
he used to do,

349
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,890
like he bumped and weaved
after every combination,

350
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,390
every combination she would
throw in the past and going down.

351
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,260
It was short and he would,

352
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,830
yeah,

353
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,481
they'd mentioned him.

354
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:03,960
Yeah,

355
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,440
dude,

356
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,540
but even in the pants,

357
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,230
like that's how he did it when
he was working in the past.

358
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,561
He's just,

359
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:07,691
well,

360
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,000
it's constantly in motion.

361
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,530
Something else.

362
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,140
Again,

363
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,911
I met a mental,

364
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,260
a mental thing that happened.

365
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,200
That's what I think emotionally,

366
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,240
you got to stay tough a long time,

367
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,074
man.

368
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,740
We,

369
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,261
even Ali,

370
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:20,820
he went,

371
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,680
but he lasted long enough.

372
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,150
But Tyson,

373
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:24,391
you know,

374
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,130
a couple of years and then he went crazy.

375
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,023
And I don't blame him for,

376
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,190
I'm not saying I don't
blame a guy for going crazy.

377
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,670
Yeah.

378
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,911
I mean,

379
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,230
look at the,

380
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,180
look at the men who live
in that car dash in house.

381
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:35,430
They all eventually go nudge that.

382
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,540
That's atmosphere.

383
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,180
Like Lamar Odom starts smoking crack.

384
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,340
And of course we're a,

385
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,750
Bruce Jenner has a pushy,

386
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,613
you know,

387
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,480
he's getting one.

388
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,380
Yeah.

389
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,540
And it's really difficult to believe,

390
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,840
well to be at the level that a Mike Tyson
was at his point in life at a really

391
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,020
young age,

392
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,790
20 year old champion of the world.

393
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,421
You know,

394
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:57,691
he's,

395
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,000
he's out there doing
whatever he wants to do.

396
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,030
Basically buying Bentleys crashed them,

397
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,090
giving them the cops.

398
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,511
I mean,

399
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,190
he was just off the chain,

400
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,630
crazy owned the lion.

401
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:06,991
I mean,

402
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:07,824
he was just crazy.

403
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,680
You can't get any crazier
and you can't keep that up.

404
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,570
It's like this and that's
not a sustainable life.

405
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,520
And now I listen.

406
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,060
I don't live a sustainable
life so much less that I,

407
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,790
uh,

408
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,390
I have decided that
something's got to change.

409
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,721
I mean,

410
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:22,830
I'm pushing 50.

411
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,010
What's got to change career?

412
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,830
Certainly not the careers.

413
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,890
Y'All gonna make me money.

414
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,100
I'd love to shoot pool with sweat.

415
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,980
I'm not that good.

416
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,890
It's making it happen.

417
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,631
Just train.

418
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:33,960
We get,

419
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,561
that's the show.

420
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,520
That's the reality show.

421
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,530
[inaudible] joins the pro tour.

422
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,260
Joe,

423
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,420
we've known each other a long time.

424
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,110
I gotta I gotta I gotta stop.

425
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,023
I gotta have that.

426
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,290
I'll have a party or something.

427
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,690
You're going to have a party and stop.

428
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,440
What working.

429
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,274
Just done.

430
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm just going to,

431
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm going to buy a huge chair
and eat myself until I fit it.

432
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,334
Then

433
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,090
I dunno.

434
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,331
I,

435
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:56,801
I uh,

436
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,000
I got road coming up.

437
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,540
You like doing the road.

438
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,680
So I liked doing the road because I
go with my friends or brain comics.

439
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,450
I like to open for me and we have fun.

440
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,910
How many guys you burned?

441
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:06,461
It depends.

442
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,241
Sometimes two,

443
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,074
sometimes one.

444
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,800
I like,

445
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,090
I like going on the road with a friend.

446
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,571
See,

447
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,291
I've tried that.

448
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,280
I've tried bringing friends of mine
to open for me and I still miserable.

449
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:15,940
Really?

450
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,181
Yeah.

451
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:16,600
I don't know.

452
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,550
Mostly because I don't
let them in my room.

453
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,820
Oh yeah.

454
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,600
I like a lot of them,

455
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,111
but I,

456
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:24,550
it doesn't get me over the,

457
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,093
the lady,

458
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,940
the multiple shows him one night where
you got to reboot and then get the

459
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,570
multiple shows.

460
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,490
A tricky if you a free ball,

461
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,830
your material a lot because he
gets to that second show you like,

462
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,690
I'm not exactly sure if I did this.

463
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,150
This show are less shy and
I'm just going to tape it.

464
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,570
Yeah.

465
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:40,961
Oh No.

466
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,670
That's happened a bunch of times.

467
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,990
Why repeat a joke.

468
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,403
Holy Shit.

469
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,050
I was drunk once in Pittsburgh.

470
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,801
Okay.

471
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,521
It's like midnight.

472
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,360
There's a 400 pound guy sitting in the
corner and I start to tell the same joke

473
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,230
I told him about 20
minutes before the forger.

474
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,070
Palak guys got like khaki shorts on.

475
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,660
He's got his hands close like this.

476
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,980
And as I started to joke,

477
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,814
he just goes,

478
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,760
he just did it with a real,

479
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,100
real mad look on his face and stop me.

480
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:09,934
And I said,

481
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,863
thank you.

482
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,480
I appreciate you coming to rehearsal.

483
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,380
They get hostile goes all right man.

484
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,300
I'm gonna try to fuck well yeah,

485
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,660
I made a mistake.

486
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,290
Some people just demand perfection.

487
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,740
Yeah.

488
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,180
Well this guy didn't
look like one of them.

489
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,850
We get very angry if there's
any mistakes going on.

490
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,870
Live performance by an
intoxicated man who you love.

491
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,763
Well you know,

492
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,000
guy comes all the way to see ya.

493
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,350
He's got a fucking treat you like that.

494
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,070
How dare he,

495
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,510
he lived across the street.

496
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,710
He looked like David Beckham.

497
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,450
It was a beautiful,

498
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,970
do you think is gay that I feel Chad
Ochocinco is David Beckham dipped and

499
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:46,804
fudge?

500
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,123
Um,

501
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,121
first of all,

502
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,290
I think it's a huge insult.

503
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:55,180
The Chat Osho Sinco cause
he's far more beautiful.

504
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,220
You like him while he's just looks wise.

505
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,303
I mean his,

506
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,760
if you looked at both of them naked,

507
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,040
you would definitely be able to
tell if it was in black and white.

508
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:03,874
Who's who?

509
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,290
They're both the same color shadow just
and goes a different kind of athlete I

510
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:08,590
guess.

511
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,990
So that guy's a fucking freak athlete,

512
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,950
but he's fucking up.

513
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,731
He's not around.

514
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,570
He's not throwing her son.

515
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,220
It's hard to keep that going.

516
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,300
Like we talked about earlier,

517
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,960
we were talking about
him so we know who he is,

518
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,691
we know who he has.

519
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,830
A lot of people know who he is,

520
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,060
which means he probably,

521
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,230
at least for a short period of time,

522
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,560
he got fucked a lot of money and before
that probably didn't have any money.

523
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:26,801
She,

524
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,330
I think I,

525
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,900
I don't think you're giving,

526
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,560
you know,

527
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,150
his problems and merit.

528
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,751
I mean,

529
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,770
I agree with everything,

530
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,850
but the man did change his name
to Otros Cinco it's 85 in Spanish.

531
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,830
If you're normal,

532
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:39,850
you don't do that.

533
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,350
But we are talking about them.

534
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,391
Yes,

535
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:42,850
sure.

536
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,410
I mean we can talk about Hitler to what,

537
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:44,531
what,

538
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:44,710
what,

539
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,161
what is it,

540
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,270
what's the criteria?

541
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,901
What do you want to talk about?

542
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:47,291
I think for,

543
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:47,471
no,

544
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,050
but I think for those guys is
what I'm saying to those guys.

545
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,100
Like it's important to get your movies,

546
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,731
stars,

547
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:53,241
whatever,

548
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:53,810
you know.

549
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,180
I think that's a good
move to call yourself.

550
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,090
Otros Sinco we're,

551
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,033
I mean otherwise,

552
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,651
I don't know.

553
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,570
I don't follow sports so
we really wouldn't know.

554
00:14:59,630 --> 00:14:59,780
Well,

555
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,650
I don't have a Jersey number,

556
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,180
so I'm like,

557
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,420
you don't,

558
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm going to change my last,

559
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,750
my last name to my
cholesterol level in Spanish,

560
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,840
which is of course rd clock,

561
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,080
trow,

562
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,913
Dojo crow.

563
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,310
That's going to get any,

564
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,263
a lot of pushing.

565
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,370
That's hilarious.

566
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,550
What else are you been up to?

567
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,380
You just do this on the
road basically in the UFC.

568
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:22,930
A dude's,

569
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,250
it's still the VFC scheduled.

570
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,870
You're like so busy.

571
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,681
I'm pretty busy,

572
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,350
but it's all stuff I like doing so
it doesn't bother me this weekend.

573
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,870
It's at the staple center and every,

574
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,800
every man.

575
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,011
No,

576
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,700
I don't do everyone.

577
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,870
There's a lot that I don't do.

578
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,850
There's a lot that are,

579
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,240
uh,

580
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,220
like the Fox sports night ones.

581
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,210
Most of those I don't do,

582
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,230
some of them I do do,

583
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,010
but uh,

584
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,700
what we do,

585
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,030
what we do in recently is we have a
bunch of guys in here and we watched the

586
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,270
fights and do a podcast podcast
while we're watching the fights.

587
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,081
That's really fun.

588
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:51,320
Yeah.

589
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,920
I did that with the super bowl because
I have a $30,000 bet on it and it was

590
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,120
kind of weird to see what happened.

591
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,140
I won five grand.

592
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,340
Jesus Christ son,

593
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,001
I want to fly,

594
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,260
washed on the fucking coin,

595
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,400
toss to a grand.

596
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,750
Did you really immediately,

597
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:03,290
you know,

598
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,450
pissed off a few thousand
dollar coin toss.

599
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,090
I was down two grand
before the game started.

600
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,710
Terrible.

601
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,940
But I ended up up five g's.

602
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:13,700
I had to patch and had
the patriots in the over.

603
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,930
Did you like gambling?

604
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,010
That's one thing I could tell.

605
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,690
As soon as we moved to gambling tonight,

606
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
Brian Regan wanted to hustle us.

607
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,880
We had to play a $20 game at nine bucks.

608
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,970
I ended up walking away
with a double Savak.

609
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,490
Yeah,

610
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:25,971
he won't.

611
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:29,330
Fives and mine and he got out
like four or five balls in a row,

612
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,080
like not,

613
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,913
not an easy out.

614
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,753
You got out.

615
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,020
Oh,

616
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,940
I appreciate your one game and already
cleaned it up and know you won the first

617
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,070
day.

618
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,900
You're in bed on the first til you one,

619
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,090
but we're just playing and then
Reagan wanted to hustle us.

620
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,530
I thought he was going to
pull out the real game.

621
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:42,771
Yeah.

622
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,341
Ree and lipstick.

623
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:44,260
Maybe he grew up in my list,

624
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,290
you know Irish name,

625
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,170
but you want a pint night pool game.

626
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,290
All of a sudden he's a fucking pirate.

627
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,623
That's hilarious.

628
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,160
I was trying to do Charles Dickens.

629
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,491
Oh,

630
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:56,270
I got confused.

631
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,650
I never know what that guy sounded like.

632
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,484
Me Too.

633
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,410
That was a fun time.

634
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,090
Are you enjoying doing podcasting now?

635
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,953
No.

636
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,050
Why didn't you like it?

637
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,651
It wasn't an I,

638
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,021
I'm not,

639
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,250
I'm not an ambitious guy.

640
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,061
My point is like,

641
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:08,930
you know the rob Lowe,

642
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:09,890
like the audio line.

643
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,620
I'm more like the Stop Caring Rob Lowe.

644
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:13,060
You know,

645
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm that guy like in the contract.

646
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:15,250
Oh,

647
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,471
right.

648
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,040
That commercial with the caveman level.

649
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:17,301
Oh,

650
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:17,501
I'm,

651
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:17,711
I'm,

652
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:18,740
I'm the other guy.

653
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,521
So,

654
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:20,354
uh,

655
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,680
you know the podcast,

656
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,310
I mean,

657
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,630
I do it in my kitchen.

658
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,040
I've been late eight times.

659
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,390
Well,

660
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,490
what don't you like about it?

661
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,630
You were so good on the radio.

662
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,340
What would you like on the radio?

663
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,641
I like,

664
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,121
I like to,

665
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,580
I like talking like this and
saying stuff on the radio.

666
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,630
You don't like organizing it.

667
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,464
And doing anything.

668
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,850
I just let everybody else do it,

669
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:41,990
but then eventually I need something
done properly and it's a mess.

670
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:42,320
Man.

671
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,320
That just seems like a logistics thing
that seems like that could be handled,

672
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,920
but you're a really fucking funny guy
and you did not have a podcast and be

673
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,610
ridiculous.

674
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:49,960
You know,

675
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,180
you've been a couple,

676
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,240
there's a couple problems that you've
had over the last few months about tweets

677
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:54,541
and shit.

678
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,220
Like we read those tweets off.

679
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:57,470
We were fucking howling.

680
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,333
Oh,

681
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,580
I think there was anything wrong with it.

682
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,391
I get on Twitter,

683
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:00,691
I said,

684
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:00,901
look,

685
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,010
this is hilarious.

686
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:02,461
Like you think.

687
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,020
Do you think he really
means what he's saying?

688
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,681
Of course.

689
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,210
That's what you're so stupid.

690
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,044
So stupid.

691
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,380
He took Joe not,

692
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,761
you know,

693
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,020
it really is a,

694
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,710
it really is growth in either one of
those things you said was mean spirited.

695
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,850
It was funny shit.

696
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,200
No,

697
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,871
it's funny.

698
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:20,740
Self deprecating and in the one where
I'm Thomas Jefferson and the black guys

699
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,110
all carry champions of Shah,

700
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,170
the slave where Carrie
champion is my slave and I'm,

701
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,210
I'm her master.

702
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,420
I point out that I,

703
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,980
I do not a Jack Hewlett until she escaped.

704
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,150
You're saying that you would have her
beat you and you'd come all of these and

705
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,650
I'll just say,

706
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,321
I'll go one further.

707
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,950
I'm saying when I be seeing,

708
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,260
when I see an African American woman
get her freedom and break free from the

709
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,094
chains,

710
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,110
I just blow a load over the Blair.

711
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,591
Oh,

712
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,350
so you have to see the freedom
happen in order for you to come.

713
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,120
You're a freedom of justice
warrior led Jizzum ring.

714
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,610
How dare you see,

715
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,460
I don't think there's anything wrong
with you being incredibly excited and

716
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:04,470
sexually aroused at a
woman achieving freedom.

717
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,330
I think that we should
all be another owner.

718
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,050
Can you think,

719
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,320
do you think you are capable of coming
equally from a man achieving freedom or

720
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,330
maybe a game and though

721
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,080
you got to come across the board
and everybody will be happy.

722
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,640
Oh,

723
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,940
I'll come when people get free.

724
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,560
Don't think I could come for a man.

725
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,570
I really don't.

726
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:24,360
I don't think it's possible and that
then I'm going against the man getting

727
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:25,194
free.

728
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,150
Oh a man getting through,

729
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:27,310
man.

730
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,751
Getting free,

731
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,920
like the same way for of us slave mail.

732
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,620
I'd be more happy about it,

733
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,880
but I just moved clapping.

734
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,320
But it's just your outlook.

735
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,600
Yeah,

736
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,730
as a controversial of course.

737
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,870
That's what comedy is about.

738
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,111
You know,

739
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:37,860
and I look,

740
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,960
I know you're trying to be funny.

741
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,770
It's funny.

742
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,371
It's what it is.

743
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,950
It's not like you're
some fucking politician.

744
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:47,730
It says some nutty shit that nobody
expected out of nowhere off camera.

745
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,950
And you catch them like
this is his real beliefs,

746
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,641
but whoa,

747
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,530
we just found out that
already loves slaves.

748
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,251
Like no,

749
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,810
you're a fucking comic.

750
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,560
Yeah,

751
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:55,951
exactly.

752
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,030
Like I'd really hire,

753
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,940
they get a slave in my house.

754
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
It made me angry and I made me angry.

755
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,691
Very angry.

756
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:03,524
It was terrible.

757
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,640
It's just so silly and
it cost me something.

758
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,740
Of course we an appearance on a
talk show was trying to care about,

759
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:08,370
but still they,

760
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,970
they took something from me and that's
when her happy we got in front of me,

761
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:12,301
boom.

762
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,050
Now go fuck off.

763
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,830
We win.

764
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,640
But they don't,

765
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,790
they don't see what happened.

766
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,110
Got a lot of people on
your side with that.

767
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,270
You've got a lot of people
who enjoy that kind of comedy.

768
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,270
I always talk about Brian
Holtzman like hell he has,

769
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,770
he says ridiculous,

770
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,970
cruel shit,

771
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,310
but I think it's hilarious
cause I know him.

772
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,810
He's a sweetheart of a guy.

773
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,700
He used to do this joke about Susan
Smith or the chicken drowned her kids.

774
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:34,901
He goes,

775
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,370
sure.

776
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,120
He goes,

777
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,170
I heard those kids were bad.

778
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,590
I sat back,

779
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,423
close it,

780
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,591
put away their blocks.

781
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,640
Those tests will not be missed.

782
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,540
You got to see him doing it to understand
that you can't take it out of context.

783
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,770
You got to see his whole act.

784
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:47,650
It's ridiculous.

785
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,130
He says

786
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,560
a bunch of really and
then he laughs at himself.

787
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,990
He's being funny and it's,

788
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,020
it's an art form.

789
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,030
Just like a violent movies and art forum.

790
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,950
You don't really killing people.

791
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,570
Whoa mate.

792
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:57,881
When,

793
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,450
uh,

794
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,960
just to prove your point where I went
to match.com after I broke up and they

795
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,720
give you a form thing you have to
fill out and have to be honest in the

796
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,440
questions is I could,

797
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,940
I could never be honest
in those questions.

798
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,600
I've got a girl who
looks like she's an isis.

799
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,473
So I did that.

800
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,951
So I,

801
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:10,784
I uh,

802
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,000
I got to the part where it said what's
the worst thing we've ever done?

803
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,470
And I put,

804
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,260
I actually put that down to see
what kind of reaction I get.

805
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,050
And uh,

806
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,760
the worst I,

807
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,210
one time I had sex with a retarded
girl and to get rid of her,

808
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,410
I put her on a bus.

809
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,703
How did that work?

810
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,131
Well,

811
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:27,461
I don't know.

812
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,570
I haven't seen her since,

813
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,350
but do you know what I mean?

814
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,400
It's for mass.com.

815
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,303
Did you put that on?

816
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,350
I didn't get the date.

817
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,120
So you know,

818
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,610
I,

819
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,270
I'm not even gonna get into that either.

820
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,931
That's shocking.

821
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:41,241
I bet.

822
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,760
Just people didn't
think it was really you.

823
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,560
I bet they didn't want to get catfished.

824
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,790
Who would these take it is someone
pretended to be you writing retarded shit.

825
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,740
They probably didn't think it was here.

826
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,940
That's the only reason why it didn't work.

827
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,980
Now that people know to
check that page later,

828
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,221
I,

829
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:54,491
you know,

830
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:54,671
yeah,

831
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,271
I don't have,

832
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,104
I don't have time.

833
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,580
So you like doing this,

834
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:04,190
you just don't like the hassle
that comes with like organizing it.

835
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,870
Yeah.

836
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,860
I'm not an organizer.

837
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,050
I'm not a prepare or not prepare,

838
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,090
but so you just want to show
up and be already weighing.

839
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,901
Yeah.

840
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,640
Now they're letting me
do that pretty much.

841
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,760
But you know who cares about that or I,

842
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,710
it's got people got to start listening
and otherwise you're just do something

843
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,011
else.

844
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,350
I thank God I got my
stand up and you know,

845
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,380
well you don't think people
listen to your podcasts?

846
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,223
Like what do you mean?

847
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,131
Well,

848
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,870
I mean there's not a ton
of people listening to it.

849
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,170
No.

850
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,500
Well you're doing this
subscription based thing,

851
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:29,980
right?

852
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah.

853
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Yeah.

854
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,140
But I can't get sponsors.

855
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,070
I called people.

856
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,360
What do you mean you can't get sponsors?

857
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,830
Because I said a couple of things.

858
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,933
Listen,

859
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,780
just say,

860
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,590
sorry.

861
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,210
Say you're sorry uncle
already I refuse Jesus.

862
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,790
I think you can get sponsors.

863
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,640
I don't think there's a fucking
question in the world that you,

864
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:47,880
you,

865
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,171
you,

866
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:49,150
you could get sponsors.

867
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,610
They only offer I had was
sphincter during the Ashman.

868
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,350
It's an [inaudible] and
he put it in your ass.

869
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,001
If it's a fleet,

870
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,710
everything up before someone eats it out.

871
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,460
Yeah.

872
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,300
That might kill people.

873
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,500
You be careful about that.

874
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,070
That stuff that's like give you
toxic shock of the asshole July them.

875
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,363
Uh,

876
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,750
I dunno.

877
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,241
Job Ellis.

878
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,080
I appreciate it buddy.

879
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:08,920
You're a good man.

880
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,230
I think you're a good friend.

881
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:11,400
I,

882
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,340
I've just given up.

883
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,413
Don't give up.

884
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,310
I don't care.

885
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:15,701
Look at me.

886
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,511
This is what I looked like.

887
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,344
I don't care.

888
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,530
Yeah,

889
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,850
but you do care enough.

890
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,930
You care enough to be funny.

891
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,370
You care enough to make
those funny tweets.

892
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:21,750
My,

893
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,860
and I keep making you son of a bitch.

894
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,190
Oh,

895
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,960
I gotta make money from my mother.

896
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,963
Does that what you're doing?

897
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,631
Yeah.

898
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,111
My mother is,

899
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,390
she's only way she'll be on
welfare if it wasn't for me.

900
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:31,661
It was I,

901
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,860
this is crazy.

902
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,600
I got to get out of this.

903
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,260
Wow.

904
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,771
Not this.

905
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,030
I'll stay here as being comedy,

906
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,640
doing comedy or podcasting.

907
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,030
I could do black hair thing,

908
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,351
you know?

909
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:44,020
I don't know.

910
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,853
You could do,

911
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,160
I don't

912
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,490
do it.

913
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,450
But You keep going.

914
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,320
Yeah.

915
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,730
If someone like sets it up for you.

916
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,564
It makes it nice.

917
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,280
I haven't shut up,

918
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,870
but it's not a studio.

919
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,890
I think the were a lot of people were
doing wrong is they're trying to get paid

920
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:59,510
from podcasts right off the bat.

921
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,350
And I think it's,

922
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,860
it's,

923
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,760
it's kind of hard to do that.

924
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,740
I know Anthony has been pretty successful.

925
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:04,574
Anthony Kumiai,

926
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,150
you know,

927
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,901
he's got a very,

928
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,570
very devoted following already on his,

929
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,020
like he had that video podcast set
up right before we ever did it.

930
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,910
That's one of the reasons
why I wanted to do this.

931
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,670
Anthony has a fucking full studio
in his base with a green screen.

932
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,270
Wow.

933
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,830
He's had that since like 2006 or
something fucking crazy like that.

934
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:25,020
He's always experimented online and
he's just kind of a tech genius.

935
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,410
Right,

936
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:25,730
right,

937
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,563
right.

938
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,130
So he built up this following
and then he started hiring,

939
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,420
you know,

940
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,960
having people do subscriptions
when he left Opie and Anthony.

941
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,850
But I think that if you start off,

942
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:35,180
look,

943
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,530
I've listened to some of your podcasts.

944
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,364
They're hilarious.

945
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,870
You're funny fucking dude man.

946
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:40,060
Always thank your.

947
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,933
Always funny.

948
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,050
I enjoyed you on that,

949
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,231
nick.

950
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:42,771
Depaulo shall,

951
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,604
we couldn't swear.

952
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,553
That was fun.

953
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,071
It was fun.

954
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:46,904
We're with nick.

955
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,800
A little suit.

956
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:49,161
What happened?

957
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:49,994
I'm tired.

958
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,511
You know what I mean?

959
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:52,030
Like I went through a lot of shit.

960
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,880
We need to pump you up.

961
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,020
We need to get you
interested in my friends.

962
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,740
Orange juice.

963
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,610
Fresh squeezed.

964
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,070
We're going to gallery Kale.

965
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:57,920
Are you ticklish?

966
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I tried a new trouble and I put a lot of
Kale and onion rings every time I took

967
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,650
a dump and sound like
James Caan getting shot.

968
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:05,981
My God.

969
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:06,590
Yeah.

970
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,423
Yeah,

971
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,980
the chicken.

972
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,510
The end.

973
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,343
Oh,

974
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll figure it out,

975
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:16,611
man.

976
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:17,444
I'll let you know.

977
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:17,870
Well,

978
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,880
what do you want to go?

979
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,400
Bike riding the mark.

980
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,700
You don't have to do that.

981
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:23,760
You don't have to go bike riding.

982
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,040
And what do you want to go?

983
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:25,360
Let's just,

984
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,720
you need to,

985
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,830
you a slide like talking to and hanging.

986
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:30,170
But I want to do like an
elliptical machine went.

987
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:30,500
Yeah,

988
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,651
well,

989
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:31,440
you know what you need to do.

990
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,720
You just need to get motivated.

991
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,330
We need.

992
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:33,500
Uh,

993
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:33,951
are you,

994
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:34,460
uh,

995
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,570
if you're not in a relationship,

996
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,270
that's what you need is a
super hot personal trainer.

997
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,290
Motivate you.

998
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,520
You got some of those numbers.

999
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,230
We know they're all over Los Angeles.

1000
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:42,880
Couple,

1001
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,070
I don't know for you.

1002
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,591
One line,

1003
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,161
we'll find some.

1004
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,380
We're going to use the power of
the Internet to find Artie Lange,

1005
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:52,420
a beautiful fitness trainer who's
going to motivate him to get in shape.

1006
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,220
He's just going to see her just
glistening in the sun telling you,

1007
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,540
come on already up the hill.

1008
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,680
Can I pick what color?

1009
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,131
Well,

1010
00:25:58,131 --> 00:25:58,371
yeah,

1011
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,900
you want a black shirt or
white checker for Chinese?

1012
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,910
I'd like a nice Taiwan.

1013
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,950
I like a nice Mocha,

1014
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,970
Mulatto type.

1015
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,570
Ooh.

1016
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,980
I don't think you're allowed
to say Mulatto anymore.

1017
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:07,830
I think they took that from,

1018
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,001
well,

1019
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,050
I'm going to win the Mulatto.

1020
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,233
Oh,

1021
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,800
describe why you should do a podcast.

1022
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,823
How could you not do it?

1023
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,590
Now you know what I,

1024
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,091
you know what?

1025
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:24,901
I'm going to get your number.

1026
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm going to text you about this.

1027
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:26,730
I need some advice.

1028
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,061
I need,

1029
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:28,740
I use it and a couple
of minutes of your time.

1030
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:29,460
I need some advice.

1031
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,180
I think we could,

1032
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,810
we could get you a 10 times increase
in how many people are listening to it.

1033
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:34,644
Right?

1034
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,230
It's not about my health at all.

1035
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,490
All your health to you and I.

1036
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,990
There are a lot of people listen to that.

1037
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,271
I got,

1038
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:40,104
I need more,

1039
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,880
but my health is what I'm talking about.

1040
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,151
Well,

1041
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:42,450
it's,

1042
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,283
it's you.

1043
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,940
It's real simple.

1044
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,043
I mean,

1045
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,390
it's not,

1046
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,520
it's not simple psychologically
and it's not simple emotionally.

1047
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,750
That's the hard part,

1048
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,530
but it's real simple.

1049
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,880
Eat really healthy foods.

1050
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,080
Your body will get leaner,

1051
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,190
you'll lose weight.

1052
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,180
It's really that simple.

1053
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,661
You just got it.

1054
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:58,350
That should be all.

1055
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,940
How the fuck am I going to hard to do?

1056
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:00,774
It's hard to do.

1057
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,943
It's hard to avoid.

1058
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,201
I mean,

1059
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,410
he came in with a cheeseburger.

1060
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:04,244
I do know.

1061
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,303
Did I?

1062
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,313
Yeah,

1063
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,470
he came in with a cheeseburger.

1064
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,150
You were joking about
it being gluten free.

1065
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,700
Can I really?

1066
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:11,941
Yeah.

1067
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:13,170
I was very with that.

1068
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,070
I eat them all the time,

1069
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:14,401
man.

1070
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,720
I eat cheeseburgers all the time.

1071
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,771
I eat two of them.

1072
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,560
The other day I was at a
fucking food truck in Portland.

1073
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:20,370
It was so good.

1074
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,151
I had a tie.

1075
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,320
Bacon cheeseburger.

1076
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,341
God Damn,

1077
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:23,971
it was good.

1078
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:25,200
That sounds unbelievable.

1079
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:25,921
It was insane.

1080
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:29,640
He'd had grilled Jalapenos in
it and that peanut Thai sauce,

1081
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,350
like saute sauce or whatever it is.

1082
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,100
Fuck.

1083
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Holy Shit.

1084
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:33,811
It was so good.

1085
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:34,920
I had to go back and have another one.

1086
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:35,071
It's a,

1087
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,830
it's a place called the brunch box
and Portland was a little food.

1088
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,050
Trucks get it and they
give it to us for free.

1089
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,100
They wouldn't even talk about money,

1090
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:43,030
so it gives them good for you.

1091
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,150
Good street food,

1092
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:45,480
cod,

1093
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,801
Tam.

1094
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:46,634
It was good.

1095
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,840
There's nothing wrong with a little
bit of that every now and then,

1096
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:52,500
but what you need to do is just figure
out a way to discipline yourself,

1097
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,430
but I don't see that happening
unless you're like a long shot,

1098
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:57,780
but I'd like your support.

1099
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,011
It's a long arch,

1100
00:27:59,011 --> 00:27:59,731
a long shot,

1101
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:02,070
and I would just accept you
just putting one down like,

1102
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:02,221
yeah,

1103
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,210
I think are just going to do it.

1104
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,180
You could definitely do it well
before you were being sarcastic.

1105
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,691
No,

1106
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:07,351
you could do it,

1107
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,670
but you keep saying like,

1108
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,391
ah,

1109
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:09,931
what am I going to do?

1110
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:10,890
How's that going to happen?

1111
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,490
Like you gotta like the side that you're
going to make some sort of a gigantic

1112
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:14,800
change,

1113
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,440
but it's fucking very difficult to do.

1114
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,370
You know they won't take,

1115
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,570
they say one day at a time.

1116
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,730
That's really bullshit cause
it's every 10 seconds at a time.

1117
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,683
You're right.

1118
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,950
The timing 12 I have had the
stop in the last six months.

1119
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:26,371
It's literally,

1120
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,300
it's not a short list.

1121
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:28,051
It's like a,

1122
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:28,741
it's booze,

1123
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,371
it's heroin,

1124
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:29,941
it's coke,

1125
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,774
it's pills,

1126
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,310
it's sugar itch,

1127
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,031
gluten.

1128
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:33,864
It shakes.

1129
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,980
Don't have a cherry.

1130
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,120
If you have an orange,

1131
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,160
peel it this way and if you drink water,

1132
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:39,120
only drink it cold.

1133
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:39,954
All right.

1134
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,581
What does,

1135
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:42,280
how the fuck am I going to live to you?

1136
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,230
Everything I know I can't do anymore.

1137
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,940
How much of the life pleasure that you
get out of life revolves around food?

1138
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,250
It's just below the heroin pleasure.

1139
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,660
Not Food is a sensuous thing,

1140
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:00,931
man.

1141
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:01,340
Come on.

1142
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,220
It just central which thing
it is and it's very difficult,

1143
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,610
very difficult to you're off
especially really good food.

1144
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,473
Yeah.

1145
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,873
I love,

1146
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
I love a nice male,

1147
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,721
Oh,

1148
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:13,500
who doesn't?

1149
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,333
Who doesn't?

1150
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,780
But what you can do if you really want
to like restructure the way the whole

1151
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:19,411
thing works,

1152
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:23,100
but he's just earned those meals and
it means even more when he got it.

1153
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,551
I do.

1154
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,181
I go to work,

1155
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,830
I make money and I pay for is he do,

1156
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,570
but I mean earned.

1157
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,190
I'm like psychologically by
trying to take care of your body.

1158
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,050
Those other meals reward my shelf.

1159
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,910
Like give yourself like five,

1160
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,110
six days of eating good.

1161
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,440
One day you're allowed to go off like a
rocket one day where it's just fucking

1162
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:44,901
linguine with sauce and fucking Lasagna
and steaks and milkshakes and whatever

1163
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,320
the fuck you want one day.

1164
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,750
But all the other days really healthy.

1165
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:50,201
Really.

1166
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,580
Lyrics like real foods,

1167
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,920
vegetables,

1168
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,180
not six days.

1169
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,014
One healthy one night.

1170
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,950
If you just did that,

1171
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,530
you'd have a radical
change and cut out soda.

1172
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,480
If you're going to have to drink soda,

1173
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:02,320
if you really have to.

1174
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:05,290
It sounds gross because
Diet soda has aspartame,

1175
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,370
which probably gets brain cancer,

1176
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,710
but it will definitely be better.

1177
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,120
Story gets better and better.

1178
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,003
It'll definitely be bad,

1179
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,350
allegedly gives you as,

1180
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,660
I appreciate that.

1181
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,531
I'm gonna try.

1182
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:14,981
Believe me.

1183
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:15,070
Yeah.

1184
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,821
You think I'm bullshitting?

1185
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm going to try to live like that.

1186
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:17,620
I have though.

1187
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,191
I have though.

1188
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,450
Otherwise I'm not gonna be around.

1189
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:19,721
Yeah,

1190
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:20,051
listen,

1191
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,640
you too talented till it slip away.

1192
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,650
W we needed just someone to come along,

1193
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,040
some professional to come along and
deal with that aspect of your life.

1194
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,700
Deal with you.

1195
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,390
You know who did it?

1196
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,050
Kevin James.

1197
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,651
I know you're having,

1198
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:34,651
James hired a professional chef and
some sort of a whole foods like um,

1199
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,460
this woman,

1200
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,460
like she specialized in like
green vegetable shakes and
she had this crazy diet.

1201
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,520
I forget what the Diet was,

1202
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,480
but she was like,

1203
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,810
Kevin hired her and this woman
would cook for him every day.

1204
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,480
She would cook all these like
really lean vegetable based diets.

1205
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,240
This fucking dude lost 70 pounds.

1206
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:52,900
He would.

1207
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,200
He's where I got the Kale shakes idea
from all now from when he hired her,

1208
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,890
he was what?

1209
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,450
Your six of kings queens.

1210
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,300
I think he had retired,

1211
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,180
I think two campaigns in loaning me.

1212
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:09,181
There's money for the higher the the queen
of vegetable and he's just rolling in

1213
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:09,641
cash.

1214
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,331
Like this year.

1215
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,910
He's just got his arms open and
just rolls around in his bed,

1216
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,803
right?

1217
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,190
Yeah.

1218
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,770
He has like a shoot pulls on the top
of his bed and money comes out of the

1219
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:18,604
ceiling.

1220
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,020
How many bays in it?

1221
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,130
Like that scene in decent proposal with
Demi Moore and the cash in the bank.

1222
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,340
I had to me my friend chef at
least lane and from kill Tony,

1223
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:27,550
I,

1224
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,090
Russell Peters just hired her because
he gained a bunch of weight and all she

1225
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:31,990
does is like cooker,

1226
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,670
cook him a healthy meals.

1227
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,080
So he has it in his house.

1228
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,130
So when he gets hungry he's like,

1229
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:36,891
I'm going to go to Mcdonald's.

1230
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:37,151
He goes,

1231
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:37,511
oh wait,

1232
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:37,751
here's,

1233
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:38,051
you know,

1234
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,580
a healthy meal that's already made.

1235
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,510
Wow.

1236
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,050
Yeah.

1237
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,351
Yeah.

1238
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:43,090
If you could get someone
to do that in Hoboken,

1239
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,660
I bet.

1240
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,470
If you got,

1241
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,470
I bet you would be able to get someone
to do that just based on your podcast and

1242
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,820
based on the results that
they think they can get you,

1243
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:53,770
how much good that would
do them in advertising.

1244
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,341
I mean,

1245
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:55,174
could you imagine?

1246
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,340
But we can't just wait
for the food and you know,

1247
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,180
their services,

1248
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:00,910
like they donate their services
so that you can promote them.

1249
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,750
Well Ho boogers closed this year
cause Sinatra's hundredth birthday.

1250
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,180
You can't do anything in town.

1251
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:06,740
Really?

1252
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:06,861
Yeah.

1253
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,080
So I got to go somewhere else.

1254
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,033
Wow.

1255
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,540
The hall for place closed down.

1256
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,580
They just play Sinatra songs really,

1257
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,970
uh,

1258
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,140
up until December,

1259
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,150
2015.

1260
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,940
So the whole year they play Sinatra
Song pretty much every other night.

1261
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,700
But then the week he dies
it's going to be insane.

1262
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,560
Oh my God.

1263
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,770
[inaudible] is,

1264
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,300
April is a,

1265
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:25,751
you know,

1266
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:26,870
a Pepperoni scone,

1267
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,230
chill,

1268
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,031
Super Pershad,

1269
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:29,530
Gaba gold freshman wizard dot weapon,

1270
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,730
which dials roasted pepper,

1271
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,541
fuck the thing.

1272
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,170
And you go right into
the food bucket shake.

1273
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,093
So

1274
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,880
I'll go to the gym first.

1275
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,110
I love Frank Sinatra.

1276
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,980
I had a dog named Frank Sinatra.

1277
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,740
Did you really?

1278
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,573
Yeah,

1279
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,640
I uh,

1280
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,220
I uh,

1281
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,480
you gotta like the Francis,

1282
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,490
you gotta like the Chairman of the board.

1283
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:46,971
Yeah,

1284
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:47,720
I'd love to songs,

1285
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,590
especially when I was younger,

1286
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,550
but I didn't know that they had
that much of a following for him.

1287
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,840
You didn't know,

1288
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,060
you didn't know Sinatra
had a following you?

1289
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,281
No,

1290
00:32:56,281 --> 00:32:56,411
no,

1291
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:56,690
no.

1292
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,480
I mean like where they would have like
a whole year of nothing for knowledge.

1293
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,780
It's actually at hall Bulger,

1294
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:01,971
man,

1295
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:02,770
that's some rays.

1296
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,261
It's amazing.

1297
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,094
I mean it made sense.

1298
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,030
It's where it came from.

1299
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,241
You know,

1300
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,410
you'll appreciate this Joe.

1301
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:09,290
I said somebody had 60 minutes or some
of the talk show was talking to him in

1302
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,530
the mid seventies and the,

1303
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,730
the interviewers said the Sinatra Frank.

1304
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,210
How do you feel when you
hear that the criminals,

1305
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,280
like Charles Manson say if
they ever break out of prison,

1306
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:22,220
they're going to kill people
like you Shirley Maclaine,

1307
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,091
Dean Martin,

1308
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:23,871
what do you say to that?

1309
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,700
And without missing a beat
and actual look to the,

1310
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
what did the guy and said let him out.

1311
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,580
He just said let them out into nothing.

1312
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,670
And then the guy got scared when?

1313
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,760
I don't know,

1314
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,060
basically let them out.

1315
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:38,894
I'll kill.

1316
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,313
Wow.

1317
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,260
He wasn't bullshitting either.

1318
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,060
I don't think so.

1319
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,700
I mean I,

1320
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,970
if I would find that out,

1321
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,700
you know how many people's
in Nacho must've known.

1322
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:53,210
I mean he was the god
of the Italian world.

1323
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,010
I live around a block
from where I grew up.

1324
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,903
Really?

1325
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,751
It's nuts.

1326
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:57,710
Who's got his house?

1327
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:58,071
Who owns?

1328
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:58,221
Well,

1329
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,120
it's an empty lot.

1330
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,710
Of course out of respect.

1331
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:03,760
It's a social club right next
to it that they play a poker at.

1332
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,480
Why I was $38,000 or one night,

1333
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,600
you know,

1334
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,980
allowed to talk about this on the air.

1335
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,810
Like where are they play as years ago.

1336
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,291
Oh,

1337
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,010
they're not there anymore,

1338
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,843
man.

1339
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,690
Ben Doesn't,

1340
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,610
no cop is going to tell him to stop.

1341
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,710
That's just that spot and that spot.

1342
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,010
Yeah.

1343
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,740
Wow.

1344
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,600
You like Hoboken.

1345
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,673
Love it.

1346
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,760
You got a beautiful view,

1347
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,720
right view.

1348
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:27,200
I look at the whole city and the view
of the city from outside the city is

1349
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:28,770
actually better than the view inside.

1350
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:29,241
I agree.

1351
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:29,751
I agree.

1352
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,520
It's good to look at the
city but not be in it.

1353
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,130
I have a friend who
lives in Brooklyn and he,

1354
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:35,150
he's got a um,

1355
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,230
a high floor,

1356
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:39,980
like he's a like on the 10th or
11th floor and it's above the river.

1357
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,680
Like just looking out across and
you see the bridge to the right.

1358
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,670
It looks like framed.

1359
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:44,890
It doesn't even look real really.

1360
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,771
You look out his window,

1361
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:47,300
you're like dude your
view isn't even real.

1362
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,650
That's the kind of view I have.

1363
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,700
I got lucky.

1364
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:52,940
I have these single best view of
Manhattan from the Hudson River side.

1365
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,360
It's like a painting to me there's
like three great views in the world.

1366
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,890
It was a lot but there's three,

1367
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,020
three of like three archetypes.

1368
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,330
One of them is the nature of you like
mountains to me a number one with that

1369
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,570
like mountains in a lake cause he,

1370
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,410
those two of them together.

1371
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,570
That to me is like the most
spectacular thing to look at.

1372
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,150
But the other two are two
different types of city views.

1373
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,940
There's The New York one
from across the river.

1374
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,620
We had it and you realize like,

1375
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:15,921
wow,

1376
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,420
this is an amazing place.

1377
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,560
Like we've got the size of this,

1378
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,870
this hub of life and humanity.

1379
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,090
But with the weirdest one is above doe.

1380
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,310
Heeney a lot of people don't
even know about this one.

1381
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,210
You go into Hollywood,

1382
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:30,100
you go into the hills above doe Heaney
and you're looking down over the city and

1383
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,450
when you're looking down over
the city it looks like blade.

1384
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,650
I know what you're talking about it,

1385
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,450
it doesn't look real.

1386
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,241
I do those though.

1387
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:35,661
He anyone.

1388
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:36,110
Yeah,

1389
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,321
it's,

1390
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:40,350
it's not my friend Larry used to have a
house up there and it didn't look real.

1391
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,770
Like you would look out as Yardi
go Pauler you're such a ball.

1392
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,240
Yeah and it's scary.

1393
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,960
Oh my God,

1394
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,793
it's scary.

1395
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,910
Alien like you're looking
down at a space ship.

1396
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,620
Like it doesn't look like any
other view I've ever seen.

1397
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,700
I've taken photos of it.

1398
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,590
When you're flying in you
kind of sort of get it,

1399
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,551
but you don't get it.

1400
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,770
Like you get it when you're
looking at someone's back porch.

1401
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,520
Cause he had like one of those infinity
pools and like you would sit by the pool

1402
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:04,170
and you'd look out off the balcony like,

1403
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:04,891
oh my God,

1404
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:06,240
look at this fucking view.

1405
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,260
This is insane.

1406
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,810
He's like living in a
science fiction movie,

1407
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,580
but that helps you get up in the morning.

1408
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:11,851
It was like,

1409
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:12,270
wow,

1410
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,560
there's going to nature.

1411
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,850
You can't be in a bad mood.

1412
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,750
Yeah.

1413
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,440
It's like art,

1414
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,681
right?

1415
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:16,980
You're like,

1416
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,540
it's like you're looking at natural art.

1417
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,530
That's how I was like me.

1418
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:20,190
I look at Shawn,

1419
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,790
I have route three and she cook.

1420
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,624
It switches.

1421
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,090
There's usually no trouble.

1422
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,321
No trouble.

1423
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:26,910
You look at the atmosphere,

1424
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:27,360
forget it.

1425
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,470
You can't be in a bad mood.

1426
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,011
Yeah,

1427
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,701
well you can,

1428
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,900
but you're silly.

1429
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,183
Yeah.

1430
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,380
I avoid it and that's saying a lot.

1431
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,873
You avoid nature.

1432
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,013
No bad mood.

1433
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,883
Oh,

1434
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,470
do you see yourself becoming
a man of the woods someday?

1435
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,160
No.

1436
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,760
Packing up.

1437
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,550
I would just lay down just like that.

1438
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,000
I would lay down,

1439
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:45,301
I would go,

1440
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:45,601
listen,

1441
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm just going to wait to a road.

1442
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,510
I see a theme here.

1443
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,800
There's nothing I offer.

1444
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,990
You need to be motivated
because you're obviously very,

1445
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:52,824
very funny.

1446
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,530
You get somebody to come
along a little comedy.

1447
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,400
I drive like get up.

1448
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:56,941
I got a check.

1449
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:57,660
I come back.

1450
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,381
I mean what the fuck?

1451
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:58,890
I'm not,

1452
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,480
I'm not a bump on a log here.

1453
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:00,821
No,

1454
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:01,110
you're,

1455
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,560
you're in.

1456
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,360
You're in action,

1457
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,360
but you look like you're maybe not
enjoying some of the action but you shit.

1458
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,820
Mitch called withdrawals
is maybe a little,

1459
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,900
how long does that last for?

1460
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,240
22 days.

1461
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,320
Now when you go to a doctor and
you get like your blood work done,

1462
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,460
they check out all your vitamin
levels are the worst stuff.

1463
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,861
Sure,

1464
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:23,190
sure.

1465
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,940
Everything.

1466
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,541
Diabetes.

1467
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:25,530
I'm diabetic too.

1468
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,970
So what do you have to do for that?

1469
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,900
You got to take a pen.

1470
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,430
Boom right there.

1471
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,900
How often he takes two seconds.

1472
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:31,734
Once a day.

1473
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,780
Is that a recent thing and 25 units?

1474
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:34,590
Two years.

1475
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,423
Last two years.

1476
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,290
Last two years I've had
to take the insulin.

1477
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,000
Before that I just had to take the pills.

1478
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,400
And is that related to like diet?

1479
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,740
Is there a way to turn it on my show?

1480
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,760
It's very much related.

1481
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,670
It's much almost a hereditary
and diet are the two things,

1482
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:48,504
you know.

1483
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,973
Damn Dude.

1484
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,620
Um,

1485
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,650
well I could see how that
would weigh you down.

1486
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,030
I can see where that would weigh down.

1487
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:55,830
That would fuck with you
and make you feel like,

1488
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:56,340
you know,

1489
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,420
the pen thing isn't bad.

1490
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,231
But I mean,

1491
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,000
just the fact that you've got diabetes.

1492
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,211
I mean,

1493
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,110
that's a mind fuck.

1494
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,543
I had finished,

1495
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,260
I'd forgotten about it
for a couple of days,

1496
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:04,501
but yeah,

1497
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,334
you're right.

1498
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,540
I'll be all right man.

1499
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,900
I hope you'll be all right.

1500
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,570
I'll be good.

1501
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,360
I'm not going.

1502
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,600
No,

1503
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,190
I don't want to.

1504
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,611
I know.

1505
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:15,444
You know,

1506
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,520
I want you to like podcasts.

1507
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:17,791
He too,

1508
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,200
because I got excited
when you were doing it.

1509
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,371
I,

1510
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:20,204
there's like a sky.

1511
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,810
I like it a lot.

1512
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:23,670
I got about as much or like anything else.

1513
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,930
So everything's kind of,

1514
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,783
Eh,

1515
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,860
well where's that coming from?

1516
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,703
I didn't say that.

1517
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,670
I like it as much as get anything
else because things like,

1518
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,683
hey,

1519
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,770
just too good at it,

1520
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,020
man.

1521
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,780
You're too funny.

1522
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,613
Yeah.

1523
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,940
Do you think it's like
a defense mechanism?

1524
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,461
I don't know.

1525
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,294
Problem.

1526
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,610
I'm pretty good at that.

1527
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,700
I'm pretty good at spotting sparknotes.

1528
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,570
Listen,

1529
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:44,840
if,

1530
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,750
if I've noticed nothing else in life.

1531
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,380
It's that.

1532
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,740
Yeah,

1533
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,200
that Joe Rogan is very
perceptive when it comes to

1534
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,000
getting a laser and getting
right to the heart of a comedian

1535
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,450
and getting to your ability to play pool.

1536
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,650
As soon as you start stroking the,

1537
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,240
as I look at this motherfucker,

1538
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,100
you would,

1539
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,330
you're,

1540
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,540
you're a great shooter too,

1541
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,690
but I have a table here.

1542
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,371
I have,

1543
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:05,521
you know,

1544
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:07,920
I'll tell you one thing that is a
little impression of about that.

1545
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:10,410
I have not shot pool
and eight months easy.

1546
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,460
I haven't picked up stick.

1547
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,280
Well it makes sense because like it
took you a couple shots to get loose.

1548
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,810
Well here comes in,

1549
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,890
there comes a negative.

1550
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,933
A negative at all.

1551
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,110
Well you said it was great shooting.

1552
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:20,551
Listen,

1553
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:21,390
I suck at first too.

1554
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,700
When Regan and I first day.

1555
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,130
No,

1556
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,650
you're,

1557
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,680
you just kept playing.

1558
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,630
You walked in after I'd already wow.

1559
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,121
Okay.

1560
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:27,640
Well that's nice.

1561
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,320
You did a minute.

1562
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,550
No,

1563
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,681
no.

1564
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,210
I was knocking bald in the rail.

1565
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm sure online it takes a
while to loosen the arm up,

1566
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,420
you know,

1567
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,020
I'm sure,

1568
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,730
especially if you have a play date months,

1569
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,810
I haven't played in two days.

1570
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,830
So there you go.

1571
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,410
In one week I won 22
g's hustling line ball.

1572
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,020
Jesus.

1573
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,000
Best Week of my life has a as a place,

1574
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,223
a place,

1575
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,930
but I was 19.

1576
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,131
Oh,

1577
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:51,080
I got me and my mouth.

1578
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,830
Maybe my buddy makes up this other kid up.

1579
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,270
Beat him every time.

1580
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:54,811
Oh,

1581
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,310
so you got a mark.

1582
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,671
Here's what,

1583
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:57,504
what happened.

1584
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:57,720
Uh,

1585
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,610
me and Deidre pretend we
didn't know each other.

1586
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,960
We get getting a game with a third guy.

1587
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,560
Okay.

1588
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,221
We don't know each other.

1589
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:02,731
We're not friends.

1590
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:03,461
Let's play three way,

1591
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:03,810
whatever.

1592
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,643
It's like a movie.

1593
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,470
20 bucks on a five $50 on a nine.

1594
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,393
Okay.

1595
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,650
I made sure I went before deach.

1596
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,300
Uh,

1597
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,080
no [inaudible] made
sure he went before me.

1598
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:14,490
So every time deeds would go,

1599
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:15,900
he'd miss on purpose,

1600
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,900
but set me up for a perfect
shot first on the five,

1601
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,763
then on the ninth,

1602
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,310
that's a little area.

1603
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,130
So you guys just kept
robbing this one dude?

1604
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,341
Yeah,

1605
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:23,651
we want,

1606
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:24,900
we want about 11 games in a row.

1607
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,490
Wow.

1608
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,990
Poor bastard.

1609
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,903
I proud of it.

1610
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,540
Now the guy seemed like
a bit of an Asshole,

1611
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,290
but we've,

1612
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:34,580
we thought,

1613
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:34,851
my God,

1614
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,780
we got the greatest
fucking system of all time.

1615
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,460
And then there's a couple
of times he would set me up,

1616
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:38,941
but I'd miss,

1617
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:39,571
and he'd look at me like,

1618
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,680
what the fucking door.

1619
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:41,790
And then one guy,

1620
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:42,270
Tommy,

1621
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,021
I'll never forget this.

1622
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:43,681
We call them red hair,

1623
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:44,101
Tommy,

1624
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:46,200
because he had red hair and a,

1625
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,460
and he had like a big,

1626
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:49,080
big curly red hair and red hair.

1627
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:49,340
Tom.

1628
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,400
We found that what we were doing,

1629
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:51,031
he just wants to make it like,

1630
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,560
I like,

1631
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:51,990
you know,

1632
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,250
you mother fuckers know each other.

1633
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:56,590
You've got his brother who's
brother came back with a snowblower.

1634
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,950
He tried to run us over
fucking snowblower and,

1635
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,031
and pool cues.

1636
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:01,310
He threw me over the table.

1637
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,533
Uh,

1638
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,211
my one buddy,

1639
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:03,820
his friend was,

1640
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,670
was a cop and he just flipped.

1641
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,340
He flashed the guy's base.

1642
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:10,790
That guy got the really scared
and those days were fun.

1643
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,250
When I first started making money,

1644
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:19,540
I got a development deal with Disney
and a part of the money I use to back my

1645
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:20,500
friend Johnny B.

1646
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,560
My friend Johnny B was like a
professional level pool player.

1647
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,990
A hair off with a pro speed.

1648
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,651
No kidding.

1649
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:26,891
Yeah.

1650
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:27,490
But he could,

1651
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,960
he could win tournaments.

1652
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:29,650
It would win turn.

1653
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,750
He could beat a lot of guys like
to write the average person.

1654
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:32,270
They would play him.

1655
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,103
He'd beat the average,

1656
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,370
who couldn't be like,

1657
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,990
it's very rare that ever beat like,

1658
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,060
like a real top pro.

1659
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,920
But he beat some like lower level pros.

1660
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,060
He was a really good pool player,

1661
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:42,350
but he was a slick motherfucker.

1662
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,770
Right.

1663
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,700
And I would take them on the road.

1664
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,040
We would,

1665
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,290
we would go all around,

1666
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,880
like we'd go to jersey,

1667
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,010
we'd go to western billiards,

1668
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:48,844
we're talking about the APP.

1669
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,720
I put him in the tournament,

1670
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,070
we'd see if we could get a game.

1671
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,260
And then we play at
executive leaders in Chelsea,

1672
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:54,651
Chelsea,

1673
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:55,371
which was downtown,

1674
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,160
which is to know exactly
where you're talking about,

1675
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:57,300
you know,

1676
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,010
Chelsea billiards.

1677
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:58,300
Yeah,

1678
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,133
true.

1679
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,641
I know.

1680
00:41:59,641 --> 00:41:59,960
Yeah.

1681
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,291
Yeah.

1682
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,180
So that was my addiction phase.

1683
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
Like I was badly,

1684
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,800
badly addicted as eight
hours a day for like a bunch.

1685
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,870
I went through uh,

1686
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,430
a good long phase of pools
who absolutely so fun.

1687
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,210
So fun.

1688
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,050
It's a blast.

1689
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:15,590
It's a real short of hand
eye coordination get slow.

1690
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,180
Like the best thing about the hustlers,

1691
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:21,440
they can play for 18 hours in and misses
a shot and he just looks over at the

1692
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:22,031
shade and said,

1693
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:23,330
well you cut out that white.

1694
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,360
It's Kinda depressing,

1695
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:27,320
but you're like a dark,

1696
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,420
easy Pang and then you leave,

1697
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,030
you know?

1698
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:30,240
Yeah.

1699
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,150
They're guys who do
play those kind of long,

1700
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:34,550
24 and 38 hour gambling session.

1701
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,830
[inaudible] has happened.

1702
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:36,411
I know that.

1703
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,244
I have that in me.

1704
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:37,770
Nope.

1705
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,410
I like a few hours to pool.

1706
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,520
Those are brutal.

1707
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,430
That's a young man's game and
it's fucking super healthy.

1708
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,340
Like to stay up that late trying to
concentrate and drink coffee at the pen,

1709
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,240
which see the great thing about the
hustler is the whole premise was Gleason

1710
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:50,841
could shoot,

1711
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:52,010
no matter how much booze you had,

1712
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:53,060
he handled his booze.

1713
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:53,900
That was a skill.

1714
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,370
Whereas Paul Newman,

1715
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,220
that's George Scott to handle his booze.

1716
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,690
Picture those three guys in a movie.

1717
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,680
How could that be bad?

1718
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:04,910
That'd be bad.

1719
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,760
And Piper Laurie too.

1720
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,061
Yeah,

1721
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:08,894
she just cute bag.

1722
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,773
Oh yeah,

1723
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,153
yeah,

1724
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,820
yeah.

1725
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,200
That's a great fucking movie.

1726
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,190
Those,

1727
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,140
those places just was so interesting.

1728
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,430
That was what I got addicted to.

1729
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:22,100
It's where all the people that
didn't follow the rules went well.

1730
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,480
That was aims billiard,

1731
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:28,100
you know that that was a legendary place
on 14th street that shot a closed in

1732
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:28,934
the mid seventies.

1733
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,051
But aims was where,

1734
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:30,261
you know,

1735
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:31,130
name is played there.

1736
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:32,510
People had Gleason.

1737
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,670
I love to have seen that
if it's stuck around,

1738
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:35,504
but they uh,

1739
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,410
but they knocked it down,

1740
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:39,710
but aims was where they shot it and he
dealt with the turn of the century in the

1741
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:43,070
19 hundreds there was something like a
thousand pool halls in New York City.

1742
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,270
Wow.

1743
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,080
Wow.

1744
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,340
That was a thing to do,

1745
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,223
man.

1746
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,910
Before video and all the
shit you shot a in the pool.

1747
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,531
That's what they do.

1748
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:51,020
I mean,

1749
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,530
people,

1750
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,640
it's lost favor.

1751
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:56,150
People don't understand what video games
came along and other Games of leisure.

1752
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:57,830
And not the same thing because it's,

1753
00:43:57,831 --> 00:43:58,250
it's,

1754
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,160
it's really not on a lot of levels.

1755
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,220
Human contact.

1756
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,440
It's not even indirectly.

1757
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,000
At least pool is indirectly.

1758
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:05,750
It's,

1759
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,680
it's not even close to human contact.

1760
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:08,091
As a matter of fact,

1761
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,500
it's light years away from it.

1762
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,110
You know what the pool
players blame it on a lot.

1763
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:13,330
They blame it on casinos,

1764
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,750
like card casinos opening up.

1765
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,470
Right.

1766
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,303
You're right.

1767
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,500
Because then people who were,

1768
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,970
who loved to gamble on things,

1769
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,230
they didn't have to execute.

1770
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,501
They're like,

1771
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:22,520
if you're playing cards,

1772
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,050
you have to pick the right cards.

1773
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:24,920
You have to make the right choices,

1774
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:27,860
but you don't have to physically execute
like stroking the ball and missing a

1775
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:28,640
shot.

1776
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,770
All that pressure on nerves
fucks with some people.

1777
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:31,980
So I like it and they're like,

1778
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,890
that's what killed the pool
game or the pressure on nerves,

1779
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,530
pressure and nerves and
it's a lot of face up to,

1780
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:38,630
there are a lot of them on.

1781
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,391
There are a lot of them.

1782
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:39,581
Yeah.

1783
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:43,350
So like attendance and pool halls
dropped down and attendance and his card

1784
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:43,711
places.

1785
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,460
These guys that didn't,

1786
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,960
they didn't have to
gamble on pool anymore.

1787
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:48,000
Now they go play legal cards.

1788
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:48,760
I,

1789
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,310
and then of course that cuts into a pool,

1790
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,820
but yeah,

1791
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,073
yeah.

1792
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:53,790
Some of that.

1793
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,200
Watching a guy shoot a game of pool,

1794
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,210
like just dancing around a table,

1795
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,070
keeping the stick on there,

1796
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,550
looking around,

1797
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,331
looking at the angle,

1798
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:00,890
Bam,

1799
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:01,311
Bam,

1800
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,731
Bam.

1801
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:02,070
You know,

1802
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,210
one of my good friends is this guy,

1803
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:04,730
Max Eberly Max several.

1804
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:07,030
He's like one of the best
players in the world and I,

1805
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:08,250
I played with him all the time.

1806
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,001
It's always frustrating,

1807
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,230
but just watching them,

1808
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:12,630
I could just pick up like little
slight things that he does.

1809
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:13,830
Just watching them move.

1810
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,080
Like he always hits the
ball the right speed.

1811
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,100
It's always always dead on the
next ball at the perfect angle.

1812
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,170
It's like it's artwork and
what English you put on.

1813
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,510
Yeah,

1814
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,343
it's an artwork.

1815
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,750
You watch a guy who's
just so good at that game,

1816
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,620
then you appreciate it.

1817
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,090
But I think it's one of those art forms.

1818
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,160
It's only appreciated
by people practice it,

1819
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,150
but well,

1820
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:30,980
it's like rap.

1821
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,920
I didn't think rap music was a talent
until I heard someone who couldn't rap.

1822
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,381
I said,

1823
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:38,061
okay man,

1824
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:38,431
that's new.

1825
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,264
It must be good,

1826
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,850
but it's not on the level of pool.

1827
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,010
I mean pool is a true sort of,

1828
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,970
you know,

1829
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,010
a less sophisticated version of chess.

1830
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:47,371
You know,

1831
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:47,760
it's,

1832
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,210
it's,

1833
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:48,601
it's a,

1834
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:52,590
it's American Jess and a lot of ways
and it's perfect for a barge burglary.

1835
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,720
Young guys that get
together and bond on it's,

1836
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:55,080
yeah,

1837
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,480
a setup perfectly game.

1838
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:58,590
And you get to use your
hand eye coordination.

1839
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,360
It's my favorite in the world.

1840
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,320
I love it.

1841
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,153
I love it too.

1842
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,851
I wish it would.

1843
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:03,270
Uh,

1844
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,991
we need to make it,

1845
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,920
make it come back already
and come back as shoes.

1846
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,910
And the next time I was shooting
pool on TV or something,

1847
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,551
I'm saying we need them.

1848
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:08,731
Yeah,

1849
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:09,421
we need to make it.

1850
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:10,254
And you'd have a comeback.

1851
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,190
Why don't we have a tournament?

1852
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,113
Let's do it.

1853
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:12,660
Joe.

1854
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,050
Get in.

1855
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:13,980
Don't even fuck with me.

1856
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,680
I will do.

1857
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,533
I know.

1858
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,810
I know.

1859
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,260
You will love it and be fine
with two I'm talking to.

1860
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:20,701
Yeah.

1861
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:20,960
All right,

1862
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,180
well I'm in you.

1863
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,810
You absolutely let me know
when I would play in to pull.

1864
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,440
Joe wrote,

1865
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,330
you want to call it Rogan's?

1866
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,170
No,

1867
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,930
let's come home talking
about how to do it,

1868
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,260
how to do it and we can
get some other comics.

1869
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:32,820
A polite Fitzsimmons plays down.

1870
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:33,654
My Rep,

1871
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,643
I know the pilot.

1872
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,480
The pilot's was a pretty
good game of pool.

1873
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:36,781
Yeah,

1874
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:37,171
sure.

1875
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:37,411
Yeah.

1876
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:37,831
He didn't know.

1877
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:39,960
He didn't tell me he held
the acquity he was here.

1878
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:42,030
He didn't talk Janeane Garofalo was great.

1879
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,390
I heard but I heard she is a true,

1880
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,410
how she gets rid of the ball.

1881
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,140
She shoots it like one
of those tie ladies.

1882
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,780
Those things that tug Stan Ho talks about

1883
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,250
match.

1884
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,051
If that was the handicap,

1885
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:59,430
you know people are
always making crazy bets.

1886
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:03,610
Like you know you have to shoot every
shot with the plastic bridge would.

1887
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,040
If it was like you can,

1888
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,990
you can play but you have to shoot
with your poster stuffed up all over.

1889
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,830
That's called America.

1890
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,070
There's a woman out there somewhere
in the world that can knock,

1891
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,350
pull balls in where her pussy for sure.

1892
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,000
Alright.

1893
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,250
Yeah.

1894
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,480
Her name was Mrs. Lang.

1895
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,513
I'd like that.

1896
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,200
It must be right.

1897
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,950
Don't you think?

1898
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,420
I mean someone's figured that out.

1899
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,740
Some of this has to be a genre of
porn thousand videos dedicated to like

1900
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,560
billiards coming to the girl's vagina
so we can only help that happen.

1901
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,050
But by the time you think
of something like that,

1902
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:36,130
for sure that's already been done.

1903
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,430
I mean they've think of them own the
most deprived shit in porn these days.

1904
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,730
I would imagine there'll be playing pool
with pool balls coming out of growth.

1905
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,770
That's kind of rough.

1906
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,630
Maybe the smaller balls like maybe snuck
her sneaker as my English friends would

1907
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:49,810
say.

1908
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,450
That's an interesting article
that might not be of the dungeon.

1909
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,291
Yeah.

1910
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,090
Have you ever watched a game of sneaker?

1911
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,860
Do you know drive in him?

1912
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:57,920
He played snare.

1913
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,763
Yeah.

1914
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,520
No note how I'm saying it correctly.

1915
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,020
She knew very difficult.

1916
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,860
Very difficult.

1917
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:04,631
Well,

1918
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:08,230
those guys become a pool players and they
always do really well and almost right

1919
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:08,650
away,

1920
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,120
but no pool players go over to snooker
and start winning big time tournaments.

1921
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,890
They've had some sneaker players
from Europe come over and clean up.

1922
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,580
We had the world 10 ball
championships Guy Tony Draco.

1923
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,340
Yeah.

1924
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,390
Killer snooker player.

1925
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,170
Yeah.

1926
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,570
I'd like to watch a whole game,

1927
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:26,950
but he gets a little boring without the,

1928
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:27,920
without the pockets.

1929
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,390
I really am excited about a Pacquiao.

1930
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,080
Mayweather though.

1931
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,910
That's the first big boxing match.

1932
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,200
I just like boxing so much.

1933
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,340
It's a fascinating fight.

1934
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:36,730
Yeah.

1935
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,330
I can't wait.

1936
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:37,960
I would,

1937
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,830
I would wonder,

1938
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,221
you know,

1939
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:39,421
it's,

1940
00:48:39,421 --> 00:48:43,830
it's really interesting to
see what strategy pack our
employees like whether it

1941
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:47,440
just goes at may weather the way it
goes that everybody else just fast.

1942
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,910
A lot of movement and a
lot of rapid combinations.

1943
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:50,744
A lot of angles.

1944
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:51,790
You know,

1945
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,160
him and Freddie Roach been
preparing for this guy forever.

1946
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,230
They're both going to be prepared.

1947
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:56,801
I like Mayweather.

1948
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,320
There's a little bigger and I think
he watched it more than I think it's

1949
00:48:59,321 --> 00:48:59,770
quicker.

1950
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,041
I didn't,

1951
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:01,530
may words are quicker than back.

1952
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:01,900
Yeah.

1953
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,190
Well he's a very clever,

1954
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:03,851
very,

1955
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:05,590
very hard to the play head games,

1956
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:06,580
especially in this country.

1957
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,533
What are you showing me?

1958
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,430
This woman shoots a pool ball out of her
vagina and hits him eight ball into the

1959
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,900
corner pocket so we can't
show her movie play.

1960
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,530
It's real quick.

1961
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,051
Real quick.

1962
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:18,430
You and we'll get upset at us.

1963
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,480
I knew it was going to happen.

1964
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,190
Here we go and it's coming.

1965
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,390
Good Lord.

1966
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,540
Yeah.

1967
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:23,980
See,

1968
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,700
there you go.

1969
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,160
That's the pitching pitching
machine from my movie.

1970
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,010
I love the fact that that's real.

1971
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,580
You know we were right.

1972
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,230
Easy to figure out.

1973
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:33,610
You're right.

1974
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,443
I'm stretching,

1975
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,530
stretching.

1976
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,861
By the way,

1977
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:36,910
this church is way more comfortable.

1978
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,840
Don't like that chair.

1979
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,674
Is that what it is?

1980
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,390
I'm just ergonomics stretching.

1981
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:42,090
Oh,

1982
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:42,923
it feels good.

1983
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,940
How do people sign up for your buck?

1984
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,311
I'm like,

1985
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,511
good.

1986
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:51,940
You already quit or.com one word.

1987
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:53,680
A.

1988
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,680
R.

1989
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,680
T.

1990
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,680
I.

1991
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,680
E.

1992
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,770
A quitter.

1993
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,270
And how many times this
is you guys right here?

1994
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,550
How many times do you guys do it?

1995
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:57,880
A week before.

1996
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,541
Oh really?

1997
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,720
Monday through Thursday.

1998
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:00,130
Yeah.

1999
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,390
And there's a special code.

2000
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:02,260
If you punch in the code,

2001
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,260
you get a month of the podcast for free.

2002
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,190
Unless of course,

2003
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,950
you know an eight year old who would
get on youtube and you can get it for

2004
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:10,090
nothing all the time.

2005
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:10,661
Nothing.

2006
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:11,030
All the time.

2007
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,380
Was it.

2008
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,570
Here's the code to get the free month.

2009
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,433
It's a

2010
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,660
limit.

2011
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,340
14 is that it?

2012
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,860
Atlantic 14 Atlantic 14 okay.

2013
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:21,700
For a free month,

2014
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,760
a free month of a Ardys podcasts go to
Atlantic 14 and how much does it cross a

2015
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:27,040
monk?

2016
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,480
699 six 95 well,

2017
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,130
I guarantee you're going
to get people to subscribe,

2018
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:35,000
but I guarantee you would also get a shit
load of people to listen to you online

2019
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,850
if just if it was free and
then you just get ad for it.

2020
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,660
It's just needs.

2021
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,250
Just need to be connected
with the right people.

2022
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,113
All right.

2023
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,940
Why six 95 and seven why not?

2024
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,280
It sounds better like movies.

2025
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,140
I didn't come up with any of shift.

2026
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,030
I know that is a weird thing.

2027
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:54,890
These uneven numbers for trickery to make
you sound like 70 to fool people are,

2028
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,320
oh well it's not seven crazy.

2029
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,530
Who is in charge of picking your number?

2030
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:01,041
Who picked that?

2031
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:01,320
Nah,

2032
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:01,821
I don't know.

2033
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:02,510
Some guy,

2034
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,160
I hired a couple of guys and he's like,

2035
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,650
I'm going to fool them all already.

2036
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:08,780
I'm like,

2037
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:08,931
yeah,

2038
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:09,621
that's fine.

2039
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:10,190
Whatever.

2040
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:10,581
Oh,

2041
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:14,510
it's one of those situations I'm looking
to see some test studies where they

2042
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:16,220
actually got like 200 people and say,

2043
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:16,371
hey,

2044
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:20,030
it's either $7 or 695 and see how
many people actually that was like the

2045
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:20,930
deciding factor.

2046
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:23,090
Like you know what that sounds
do I hit his show right?

2047
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:23,924
I'm telling you.

2048
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,950
People have said that.

2049
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,371
Yeah,

2050
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:26,770
I'm sure like psychological.

2051
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,470
Yeah.

2052
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,200
I mean it's not a coincidence
that they do it all the time.

2053
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,750
We can get a feed her
hamster sign up for me.

2054
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,340
Well,

2055
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,400
a lot of being broke,

2056
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:37,850
especially when you're worried about
how much this cost or that cost and like

2057
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:38,481
really money,

2058
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:38,961
your pennies.

2059
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,880
A lot of it is psychological.

2060
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,391
You're like,

2061
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:41,661
man,

2062
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:43,730
I want to get that fucking thing but shit,

2063
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,761
can I afford it?

2064
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,081
Fuck it.

2065
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:45,770
I'm just going to go for it.

2066
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,180
It's only six 95 you know?

2067
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,800
That's why you should just do like four
95 plus two maybe because at first you'd

2068
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:51,951
be like,

2069
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:53,500
for that sounds way better shoes.

2070
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,633
Cute.

2071
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,250
Confused the fuck out of that to
small numbers equal the same number.

2072
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,670
Four 95 plus $2 only.

2073
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:01,640
Get already laying.com.

2074
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,153
Trying to find,

2075
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,420
what are you looking for?

2076
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:05,751
Oh,

2077
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:07,670
do you get unplugged east?

2078
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,100
Getting crazy here ladies
and gentlemen already laying.

2079
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:14,840
It's just moving about like a
wild man knocking cords out.

2080
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,520
Think about going on the
road with his nine ball game.

2081
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,210
There we go.

2082
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,043
Beautiful.

2083
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:21,891
We got it.

2084
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:22,390
We're back.

2085
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,840
Alright,

2086
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,673
we're back.

2087
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,530
Yeah,

2088
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,530
I'm thinking you me Fitzsimmons and
Dom Irrera we'll do a God damn pool

2089
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:30,710
tournament.

2090
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,090
We'd do it live on the Internet.

2091
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,470
We'll get a sponsor.

2092
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,521
We have some fun.

2093
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:35,390
We talk some shit.

2094
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,470
It's safe to say I would without question.

2095
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,251
Say Yes to that.

2096
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:39,380
There's,

2097
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,340
that would be a lot of fun.

2098
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,720
There's no doubt about it.

2099
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:42,980
That's totally a good thing to do.

2100
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,530
Now that I know you play really
good and I had them for our,

2101
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,010
like I said,

2102
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,140
he plays really good to Fitz.

2103
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:49,460
Simmons plays really good and dom can play

2104
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,103
on.

2105
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,063
I'm ready.

2106
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:53,691
All right,

2107
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:54,201
we're going to do that.

2108
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,700
We'll do a comedy slash,

2109
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,110
uh,

2110
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:57,800
you know,

2111
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,660
pool podcasts with not many of us.

2112
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,643
We do it right out here.

2113
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,420
You could even do shows at pool halls,

2114
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:03,201
like I've been to pool halls.

2115
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:04,580
Were there stages too loud?

2116
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,331
What do you mean?

2117
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:07,550
Like how many shows do a
comedy show and then play pool?

2118
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,240
No,

2119
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,550
because then you're doing a
comedy show to a pool hall.

2120
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,920
Like don't you want to do a
comedy show at a comedy club?

2121
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:14,000
Like that's where you want to do comedy.

2122
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,730
You don't want to do comedy at a pool
hall with a bunch of people watching

2123
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:20,690
various games at the bar and talking
shit mad that they missed the eight.

2124
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:21,524
Like,

2125
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,520
oh,

2126
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,660
fucking cunt,

2127
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,820
middle of your set and then
have to deal with that.

2128
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,683
I like that.

2129
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:27,961
Yeah.

2130
00:53:27,961 --> 00:53:29,040
I think like this place,

2131
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,570
like where it's nice and quiet private,

2132
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,404
that's where you want to do it.

2133
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,460
Don't want to do without a pool.

2134
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:32,760
I'm in.

2135
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,593
You let me know.

2136
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,080
Rd Langley's Jen can play
better than you're saying.

2137
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,880
So he played good.

2138
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,740
I could tell.

2139
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,160
I mean Ping Pong.

2140
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,180
Ping Pong.

2141
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,690
Yeah.

2142
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,590
I Dunno how to play that.

2143
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,050
It looks the same thing as pulls
his hand eye coordination before,

2144
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,000
but you have to practice it.

2145
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,121
Oh,

2146
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:48,780
you'll be fine.

2147
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,860
I see what you practice here.

2148
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:51,450
But I could see how
much you love gambling.

2149
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:52,590
When we started playing for money,

2150
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,530
I can tell the little fire
and that's when I bring it on.

2151
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:55,810
Yeah,

2152
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,260
I though life since an excitement.

2153
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,900
But the double your net
worth on a Virginia Tech game
on a Tuesday and you watch

2154
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:04,920
the fireworks fly.

2155
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,873
Have you done that?

2156
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah.

2157
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,110
And what's the biggest bet you've placed?

2158
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:09,540
I,

2159
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,540
one time I went $140,000
on the super bowl.

2160
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,050
2007

2161
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,200
but after everything will hooker,

2162
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,910
the commission,

2163
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:23,130
the Yam and I got back on the plane.

2164
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:23,731
I did the math,

2165
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,020
I was down five grand

2166
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,320
fucker.

2167
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,153
Was that

2168
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,053
Larry?

2169
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,660
This mother Fucker,

2170
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,583
you pop it out again.

2171
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,020
That must've been one fucking w.

2172
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,100
How many days did that take?

2173
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:42,683
Three.

2174
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,220
Jesus Christ.

2175
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,300
So you were,

2176
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,970
you were burned through going nuts.

2177
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:48,530
Forget it.

2178
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,290
Just whatever,

2179
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,780
just burning through
whatever bed is came about.

2180
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,763
Wow.

2181
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,193
I love the,

2182
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,000
you should write a book
about just that weekend.

2183
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:57,903
I wrote two of them.

2184
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,240
They're both best sellers.

2185
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,680
That one particular weekend.

2186
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,031
Oh,

2187
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:03,660
that'll go.

2188
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:03,851
Yeah,

2189
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:04,750
that's actually a whole book.

2190
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,940
The third one,

2191
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,650
that's hilarious.

2192
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,330
That is fucking hilarious.

2193
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:10,530
Like God damn dude.

2194
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,940
So that's the most you've ever
won in some most or ever lost.

2195
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,640
That's the most you've ever lost
to same around the same area.

2196
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,340
Yeah.

2197
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,601
Right.

2198
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:19,081
Exactly.

2199
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:20,640
Cause the night I ended up down,

2200
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,690
well if you're betting that
Haim and if you go bad,

2201
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,370
if you have a weird week
shifting your real ugly.

2202
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,220
Yeah.

2203
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,620
Is the worst part is the window a couple
of times man it looks you get fired up

2204
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:32,031
again,

2205
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,930
it hooks you and then
boom before you know it,

2206
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:34,501
what is it?

2207
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:38,520
It's just that is just playing that
chemical brush game of like knowing you

2208
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:43,521
could lose a hundred grand
and not question the physical
rush without question

2209
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:45,240
is so does it get,

2210
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,620
does it like pull you,

2211
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,650
do you like you feel like if you haven't
bet in a while and you feel like you

2212
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:50,580
need to place a bet,

2213
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,650
is it like to start and
know enough from me?

2214
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,520
I'm not like that.

2215
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,800
But when I go somewhere and
something reminds me of it,

2216
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:59,250
I can put one down and then that
could start like a binge going.

2217
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,990
I never sit at home craving.

2218
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,610
I got a better sampling.

2219
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,900
So let's say she's aligned in the
paper and I think saying to me what I'm

2220
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:09,270
getting out of Artie Lange
cause cause I love you.

2221
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,550
You say you're a talented
guy that loves pleasure,

2222
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,273
pleasure.

2223
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:15,750
I like something.

2224
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,010
I feeling something.

2225
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,641
Yeah.

2226
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:17,960
And this,

2227
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,310
it doesn't have to be pleasure
and his gambling thing,

2228
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:20,640
you got to,

2229
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,170
that's like cotton deco
deep down to the nerves,

2230
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,460
first

2231
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,211
thing in the world.

2232
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:27,270
It's just like me and him,

2233
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,120
me and uh,

2234
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,990
me and Norm Mcdonald,

2235
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:30,820
he's do this thing called lightening bet,

2236
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,100
which is literally heroin for gamblers.

2237
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:33,951
Uh,

2238
00:56:33,951 --> 00:56:36,110
you know the under over is no,

2239
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:36,760
you ever hear that?

2240
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,270
What is like,

2241
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,421
yeah,

2242
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:37,781
I know what the,

2243
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,130
anybody here know what the under overs.

2244
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:40,863
Like I say a,

2245
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,930
you've been a basketball game and the
under over for the basketball game as 180

2246
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:46,661
points,

2247
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:51,661
which that means is the total amount of
points that each team scores has to come

2248
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:56,500
out a total over 180 then you win.

2249
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:02,190
If the total number that they score is
below one 80 you lose hence over under,

2250
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:07,840
so a lightening bet is
you assign a number,

2251
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,640
an amount of money to each point
that the bet goes over or under.

2252
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,450
Which means if you lightening bet $1,000
on an over at one 80 once you hit the

2253
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:20,974
over,

2254
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,410
I get the chills saying,

2255
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:29,070
once you hit the over every single
basket that gets hit in the game,

2256
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,980
you win $1,000 every from both teams,

2257
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,090
both teams.

2258
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:39,830
A basket from the field is to grant
a 3.3 grams every single bed housing.

2259
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,850
So like the shakes you start to get
while you're watching her literally like

2260
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,270
they're,

2261
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,110
they're visible.

2262
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:51,250
It's almost like you know,

2263
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,750
you're having a connection,

2264
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,781
have drinks.

2265
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:57,750
Maybe coax calm down and every
time a shot goes up it's like Eh.

2266
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:04,850
And to me it's the purest form of
degenerate gambling I've ever seen,

2267
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,953
I've ever seen.

2268
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,390
I wasn't even aware that existed.

2269
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:08,811
Norman,

2270
00:58:08,811 --> 00:58:10,970
I was on the road once was six
months I was opening for him.

2271
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:13,160
We was the one of the basketball players.

2272
00:58:13,161 --> 00:58:15,380
We had a bout 40 g's on every game.

2273
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,593
What's it gonna hot,

2274
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,340
what's it normally when we
just talked about the head,

2275
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:22,160
that famous story where he threw the
money in the ocean cause he knew he was

2276
00:58:22,161 --> 00:58:23,210
going to lose.

2277
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:26,660
It was that norm either side of the
throw it out because she thought it would

2278
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:31,661
just make them lose more but might
have very well been urban legend oil.

2279
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,610
You're a lot of this could
be urban legend or no,

2280
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:33,821
no,

2281
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:34,431
not from you.

2282
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:35,264
I'm saying from,

2283
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,590
I didn't hear it from norm.

2284
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,520
I agree that that could be a no and
I agree that could be urban legend.

2285
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:41,354
Absolutely.

2286
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,730
Well everyone knows
he's just a wild maniac.

2287
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,920
He's the one of the funniest,

2288
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,450
smartest human beings I've ever met.

2289
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:48,530
But he's got a true edge.

2290
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:49,520
And a true danger.

2291
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:51,020
And that's what happens.

2292
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:51,740
I love him.

2293
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,060
He's a rock star man.

2294
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,140
He's a bad motherfucker.

2295
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:54,860
The Rock Star.

2296
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,970
He's hilarious.

2297
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,990
He's hilarious.

2298
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,760
And he's also like,

2299
00:58:58,761 --> 00:58:59,594
that's really him.

2300
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,940
It's not putting on an act.

2301
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:03,101
You know when,

2302
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:03,171
uh,

2303
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:05,630
he hosted the espys in 2001,

2304
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:10,790
Oj Simpson was just forced to give his
Heisman trophy back to Fred Goldman

2305
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,560
because Oj lost the civil suit.

2306
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,280
So he had to give money reparations
back to Fred Goldman and Nicole.

2307
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,391
So he didn't have any money,

2308
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,000
so he should take my Heisman
trophy for whatever that's worth.

2309
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,670
So Fred Golbin takes
it and now he owns it.

2310
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,030
So the next week or the SBS inform a host,

2311
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:27,290
the Assamese Charles Woodson,

2312
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,730
the guy who won the Heisman trophy,

2313
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,950
the first offensive guy ever
sitting in the front row.

2314
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,091
First joke,

2315
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:32,781
norm tells,

2316
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,130
he looks in the front row and he says,

2317
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:34,731
Hey,

2318
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:35,570
Charles Woodson,

2319
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:37,700
the man you won the Heisman trophy.

2320
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,290
No one can ever take that away from you.

2321
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,290
First Defensive Guy to
win the Heisman trophy.

2322
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,760
No one can ever take that away from it.

2323
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,780
And everybody applause.

2324
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,210
It's like a real nice thing and it
settles down on the normal clothes.

2325
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,010
No one can ever take that Heisman
trophy away and then he pauses and said,

2326
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,470
unless of course you kill
your wife in a waiter.

2327
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,120
As I go or,

2328
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,760
and Bob did it really well.

2329
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:02,600
It was uh,

2330
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:03,530
yeah,

2331
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,510
it was at radio city.

2332
01:00:04,511 --> 01:00:05,170
Oh,

2333
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,140
it was a Ken Griffey.

2334
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:06,974
Jr was like,

2335
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,080
oh my God.

2336
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,640
Oh my God.

2337
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,020
What did they expect?

2338
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,380
It's norm fucking Mcdonald.

2339
01:00:13,381 --> 01:00:14,214
Maybe not that.

2340
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
It makes me love him even more.

2341
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,800
Norm and I talked,

2342
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,080
we sat next to each other
randomly on an airplane,

2343
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,480
talked the whole way back,

2344
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,570
just shot the shit,

2345
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:24,500
talk about all kinds of stuff.

2346
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,071
I was like,

2347
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:25,371
yeah,

2348
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,870
I quit smoking while ago.

2349
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,830
Just done with it and for whatever
reason the plane lands and he goes,

2350
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:31,131
man,

2351
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,180
I just want a cigarette.

2352
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,450
He just walks in this day that he hadn't
smoked in like x amount of months,

2353
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,630
but just decided to talking
about it on the airplane,

2354
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,890
how he quit smoking,

2355
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:40,970
that he just wanted another cigarette,

2356
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,980
grabbed it,

2357
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,770
went outside and he's just smoking it.

2358
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,141
I go,

2359
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:45,974
what happened?

2360
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:46,281
I go,

2361
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:47,031
I thought you quit smoking.

2362
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:47,210
He goes,

2363
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,043
I did.

2364
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,670
I did until just now.

2365
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:50,090
I just,

2366
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,110
I just wanted a cigarette.

2367
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:52,641
The movie,

2368
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:53,270
me and him die.

2369
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,730
I did a buddy comedy with
him and it got bad reviews.

2370
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,310
So the reviewer of my hometown paper said,

2371
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,350
Artie Lange has all the charm of a date,

2372
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:01,184
rapists,

2373
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,203
true line.

2374
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,400
So norm looks at it and he
calls me up and he goes,

2375
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,541
hey man,

2376
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,100
that's fucking great.

2377
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,900
A date rape is tasked to have way
more charm than a regular rapist.

2378
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,433
Oh,

2379
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,813
oh

2380
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:21,720
God bless.

2381
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,980
That made me feel better.

2382
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,350
Norm is the coolest
motherfucker on the planet.

2383
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,560
I love him and he's funny and I
hope you know he doesn't die broke.

2384
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,281
No,

2385
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:30,060
he's,

2386
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,210
he's just a real special dude
and he's a very unusual guy.

2387
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:34,260
I got to get them on this podcast.

2388
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:35,094
I just never seen him.

2389
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,990
You'd have a blessed,

2390
01:01:36,991 --> 01:01:37,590
of course,

2391
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,490
when I was on a plane with him,

2392
01:01:38,491 --> 01:01:39,840
he didn't even have cell phone back then.

2393
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:41,130
I got an answering machine.

2394
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:42,901
They can give me there,

2395
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:43,230
you know,

2396
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:44,190
call him back when I want to.

2397
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,870
Man,

2398
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:45,810
that's how it should be.

2399
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:46,351
Anyway.

2400
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:47,184
Who Care?

2401
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,790
They can call you back if they want.

2402
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:50,941
Yeah.

2403
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:52,020
I mean it is how it should be,

2404
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:52,641
I guess.

2405
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:54,960
Unless someone needs to get
ahold of you right now and then,

2406
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,980
well for doctors,

2407
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:56,431
lawyers,

2408
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:56,941
kids,

2409
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:57,661
I guess it's good.

2410
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:58,260
Everything else.

2411
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,093
Who Cares?

2412
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,940
Gambling Naughty little line is I and I.

2413
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,560
I'd rather not know for a while.

2414
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,060
You had genuine disdain for me in your
eyes when I told you that I didn't watch

2415
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:08,880
sports.

2416
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,930
I really saw it in your eyes.

2417
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,331
Well,

2418
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:10,441
no,

2419
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:11,670
cause I thought you did what?

2420
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,470
You were disappointed
when you play sports.

2421
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:14,820
I don't,

2422
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,710
I just martial arts.

2423
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:16,460
Okay.

2424
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,180
Actual Sport,

2425
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,520
right?

2426
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:17,641
Yeah,

2427
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:18,230
I guess so.

2428
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,100
I mean to use the I played sport.

2429
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:20,740
Yeah.

2430
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,490
When me and you first met
at mad TV a long time ago,

2431
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:27,390
I thought you told me that he played
second base or you play baseball?

2432
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:29,430
I did before I started martial arts,

2433
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,030
but that was one.

2434
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,700
I was like 15 I have to stay and I'm like,

2435
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:32,911
all right,

2436
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:36,300
what do you want to put on when you
and I had a conversation about boxing

2437
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:38,250
because you played my boxing manager.

2438
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,380
I imagine is actually a very good sketch.

2439
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,260
It's shot in black and white,

2440
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,550
but we um,

2441
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,980
and we worked a lot of boxing.

2442
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,320
Yeah,

2443
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:46,960
I know we're,

2444
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,190
we,

2445
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,540
cause we bonded on a chair.

2446
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,400
I love bugs and that was,

2447
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,570
I enjoyed,

2448
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,340
I became friends with you and
Cowan from that show accounts.

2449
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,820
One of my best friends
is Brian's a good man,

2450
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:58,640
but he's a great guy and he loves you too.

2451
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,310
You don't always say Brian and Brian
and I have a very special friendship.

2452
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,300
I love that motherfucker.

2453
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,640
He's a good guy and I
hope he's doing well.

2454
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,980
Tell him I said hello.

2455
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,680
You know,

2456
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,730
I will for sure.

2457
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,990
But it was one of those things.

2458
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:12,320
It was like you two guys were like,

2459
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,403
you were like,

2460
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,610
when I got on that shows like I saw a
lot of competition and a lot of like

2461
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:18,540
competitive angst.

2462
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,040
But there was youtube guys,

2463
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,690
they were like regular guys to work with.

2464
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:23,670
Cool to hang with and
it was like real normal,

2465
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,533
uncomfortable,

2466
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,640
no Hollywood bullshit.

2467
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,750
Well it's a fun place to work and it
was good to have somebody like you.

2468
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,170
Come on,

2469
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,500
we'll get just really fuck around.

2470
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:31,170
Uh,

2471
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,300
but that show lasted 14 years.

2472
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:34,080
Complicit.

2473
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,741
That's amazing.

2474
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:35,820
I still get checks.

2475
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,773
That's amazing.

2476
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,201
Well,

2477
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,490
you know that mad magazine,

2478
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,021
I mean that's,

2479
01:03:39,021 --> 01:03:42,170
it's about is the a or
now on the drug or not?

2480
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,013
Absolutely.

2481
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,500
But that shit was around in like the
sixties or seventies or something.

2482
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,373
Fifties.

2483
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,563
Yeah.

2484
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,620
Yeah.

2485
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,930
I think it was Billy Corbin was saying
that he used to have all the mad

2486
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:52,351
magazines.

2487
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:53,041
You went away to college.

2488
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:57,040
His mom threw him out and he had like
every episode I'm cleaning all the clutter

2489
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,010
tossed out.

2490
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:02,340
That's fucking icons of American history.

2491
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,700
I'm mad magazines.

2492
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,240
Like I used to read that shit.

2493
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:09,780
My parents used to buy that when I was
a little kid that's been around forever.

2494
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,070
And I was big with puns.

2495
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:11,904
You know,

2496
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,840
we'd always have to pitch puns
and I would pitch them as a,

2497
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:15,930
as a joke,

2498
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,310
not thinking they never do it.

2499
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,480
And sometimes they would do it.

2500
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:18,820
And I'm like,

2501
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,090
Oh man,

2502
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,070
I wish I was kidding.

2503
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,680
Like I would pitch stuff like,

2504
01:04:21,681 --> 01:04:22,080
uh,

2505
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,640
Andre Dawson's creek.

2506
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,353
Uh,

2507
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:26,870
he was a baseball player.

2508
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,463
Uh,

2509
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,660
rush Limbaugh sings rush songs,

2510
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:31,500
they wouldn't do that.

2511
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,663
That's hilarious.

2512
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,163
Um,

2513
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:34,830
uh,

2514
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,160
Tory Amish and Amie,

2515
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,010
they do that.

2516
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:40,411
I mean,

2517
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:41,460
just make it easier.

2518
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,920
Did you ever see yourself doing a sketch
show again or was it just too much?

2519
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,510
Carl Young Man's game.

2520
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,463
It is.

2521
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,810
I look back at those sketches
are merit to be and I'm like,

2522
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:49,410
oh my God,

2523
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,490
how did I do that?

2524
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,560
Did you like doing that sports show?

2525
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,970
It's like this show with you and nick
was mostly sports comedy as well.

2526
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,360
Nick and I had a lot of fun.

2527
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:02,340
We got to talking about sports be
funny and everything and of course the

2528
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:04,260
corporate people tried to
make it something it wasn't,

2529
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:07,920
they wanted to a more conservative
show and I can't blame him,

2530
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:10,650
but you know that you don't
hire me to do sports center.

2531
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:11,160
Did you,

2532
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,140
why did they hire you to
do a conservative show?

2533
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:17,590
That's probably one of the long line of
bad business decisions that they've guys

2534
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:19,120
weren't that outrageous.

2535
01:05:19,121 --> 01:05:21,420
It wasn't so off the charts,

2536
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:22,301
we weren't,

2537
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:22,991
I think they just,

2538
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:24,760
the certain little things we said,

2539
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:25,100
you know,

2540
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,360
they might not be
considered proper English.

2541
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:29,194
They got mad.

2542
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:31,803
Really.

2543
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,950
That's the beauty.

2544
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,870
That's where the beauty
of podcasting comes in.

2545
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:35,651
Like you said,

2546
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:38,620
we sat down just fantastic and I love it.

2547
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:38,861
Look,

2548
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:42,400
everybody who signed up are
familiar already is God bless you.

2549
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:43,350
I appreciate it.

2550
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,400
Hope people will more about the,

2551
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,040
this is the first time I am uncensored,

2552
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,460
completely and utter nonsense and
I got nobody telling me what to do.

2553
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:52,361
Nobody.

2554
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:53,260
So it'll be fun.

2555
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,400
100%.

2556
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,310
And you like look because of your tweets,

2557
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:57,791
you know,

2558
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,230
cause of the funny shit
that you've been saying.

2559
01:05:59,231 --> 01:05:59,771
Like you're,

2560
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,540
you're in a good place comedically.

2561
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,730
Right now you're hitting notes.

2562
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,870
I just did a special,

2563
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:05,171
I did.

2564
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:05,980
Uh,

2565
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,420
yeah,

2566
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,290
everything I've done in
the last year I liked.

2567
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,183
So yeah.

2568
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,830
So is that what's like bringing you
the most joy like at this stage?

2569
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,600
Like the stand up I guess.

2570
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:14,200
Yeah.

2571
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,033
Yeah,

2572
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,170
it seems like it's like the most pure,

2573
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:17,470
right?

2574
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,360
You get that burst of one hour,

2575
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:19,841
you know,

2576
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:22,450
you'd get it out like stand up man.

2577
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:25,300
It's just like grabbing a mic and
change something and it might get,

2578
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:26,810
you get the immediate reaction.

2579
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,900
You get a check and you
get the hell out of there.

2580
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,370
Everything else takes forever.

2581
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,860
Have you ever thought about
doing like a Vegas residency?

2582
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,120
Uh,

2583
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,350
not for a long time.

2584
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:36,070
No.

2585
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:37,390
I've been there for two weeks.

2586
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,740
Not longer than two weeks.

2587
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,633
You wouldn't do it.

2588
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,440
It's better than a cash man.

2589
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:46,441
That's how I'm seeing you and Jay gambling
in Vegas and someone putting you up

2590
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:47,591
in a casino.

2591
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:47,951
Dude,

2592
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:48,641
I'm telling you that.

2593
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:49,450
Give me a price.

2594
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,770
Wild fucking ride.

2595
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,840
Any price period.

2596
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:55,600
If you really want to call
out like one of those July,

2597
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,340
those fireworks shows at Disney and July
when they really go off right around

2598
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:01,120
the fourth.

2599
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,510
Just,

2600
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,751
just,

2601
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:02,890
just give me a number.

2602
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,741
Brian Regan,

2603
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:06,580
who was in here earlier,

2604
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:07,570
he lives in Vegas,

2605
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:08,560
but he doesn't work at Vegas.

2606
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:09,394
He works on the road.

2607
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,263
Oh yeah.

2608
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,740
He uh,

2609
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,410
lives but does technically live in Vegas.

2610
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,960
He lives like just outside of Vegas,

2611
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,361
you know.

2612
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:18,550
And one of those suburban towns.

2613
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:18,820
Right.

2614
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,410
But he doesn't perform in Vegas at all.

2615
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,753
Wow.

2616
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,220
Wait,

2617
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:22,461
what?

2618
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:23,294
Really?

2619
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:24,250
What?

2620
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,050
That's not what kids live there,

2621
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,410
so he doesn't want to perform
near where his kids live at.

2622
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,060
Brian Reagan,

2623
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,940
one of the best comedians
ever was just in there.

2624
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:31,810
It was a pleasure to meet you,

2625
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:32,644
Brian.

2626
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,330
I can't believe you'd
never met him before.

2627
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:35,380
That's never met Brian.

2628
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,170
He is one of my absolute fucking heroes.

2629
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,860
Yeah.

2630
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,041
Yeah.

2631
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:39,870
He's a great guy.

2632
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,810
A real clean and good and original.

2633
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,360
Unreal.

2634
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:43,930
Yeah.

2635
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:44,651
He reminds me,

2636
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:48,610
Gaffigan in that sense where
they're completely squeaky clean,

2637
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,820
but undeniably two of the
best comics in the world.

2638
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:52,781
Like it,

2639
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:55,780
Gaffigan doesn't lose anything
for being squeaky clean.

2640
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,460
His comedy is just,

2641
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:58,600
it just,

2642
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,860
he just smashes it every time.

2643
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:00,970
Like it doesn't have to be dirty.

2644
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:01,661
Yeah.

2645
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,040
They're the same types of guys.

2646
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:03,551
Yeah.

2647
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:03,790
There's,

2648
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:04,840
that's what they do.

2649
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:05,021
You know?

2650
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:08,260
That's why the beauty of comedy
and with a lot of these guys,

2651
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:08,621
it's like,

2652
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:09,161
it just like,

2653
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:11,190
you have to find out who
the fuck they are and what,

2654
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,290
what did Mitch Hedberg perfect
example that guy like that.

2655
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,530
That's not like a model.

2656
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:16,550
You can't like say like,

2657
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,800
oh a Hedberg type before he existed,

2658
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:20,210
you couldn't like nail that down.

2659
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,940
The closest you would get like
maybe Steven Wright kind of,

2660
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:24,320
but not really.

2661
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,640
My Bergh had his own thing.

2662
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,650
I know.

2663
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:27,830
I didn't watch to look around,

2664
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,843
see what happened,

2665
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:30,690
you know,

2666
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,020
I,

2667
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:31,370
you know,

2668
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,670
I don't think he was uh,

2669
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,840
it was that much of an accident with him,

2670
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,600
unfortunately.

2671
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,051
No,

2672
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:36,884
unfortunately.

2673
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:37,881
Well after he,

2674
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:38,091
you know,

2675
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:41,330
he'd had one health scare from,

2676
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:41,540
uh,

2677
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:46,010
from the heroin and then
wipe proves couldn't gang
green or something crazy from

2678
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:47,010
shooting at the Samsung.

2679
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,601
What happens?

2680
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:50,000
You could smell it to get on a plane.

2681
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,130
Yeah,

2682
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,190
but what's it smell like?

2683
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:53,893
Oh,

2684
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:54,890
I'm not sure.

2685
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,420
I've never smelled it.

2686
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,940
I would imagine not good.

2687
01:08:58,970 --> 01:08:59,840
Like any sort of,

2688
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:00,231
well,

2689
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,550
you're dealing with rotting tissue.

2690
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,420
It gotta be like a dead mouse under
the couch or something like that.

2691
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,260
I'm probably along those lines.

2692
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,330
Dead Tissue.

2693
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,220
Yeah.

2694
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,090
Too Bad man.

2695
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,710
What a funny fucking guy.

2696
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:13,161
He was.

2697
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:14,050
Jesus Christ.

2698
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,200
Uniquely funny.

2699
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,070
A lot of funny people.

2700
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:16,880
Gum.

2701
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,031
Yeah.

2702
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:17,331
That one.

2703
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:19,790
That guy that just a over d dos last week.

2704
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,050
I didn't know that kid.

2705
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:21,820
Did you know that kid?

2706
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:22,180
No,

2707
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,013
I never met him.

2708
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,620
I met him through a Taylor
vixen back in the day.

2709
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:25,690
Yeah.

2710
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:25,890
Yeah.

2711
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:26,723
And uh,

2712
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,621
he followed me.

2713
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:30,770
I followed him type thing to talk to a
few times and then I saw him at the clubs

2714
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,604
a few times.

2715
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,160
Then I use a little,

2716
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,003
uh,

2717
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:36,883
what was that?

2718
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:37,960
Uh,

2719
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,240
yes.

2720
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,620
Widows,

2721
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:39,740
Harris Widows,

2722
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,573
Harris Wheels,

2723
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,810
poor bastard.

2724
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,591
He was a nice guy.

2725
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:42,810
He said,

2726
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,150
I mean it seemed like a really nice guy.

2727
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:45,800
I was actually going to
have him on a podcast,

2728
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:49,580
but then he like became like a executive
producer of that parks and rec show and

2729
01:09:49,581 --> 01:09:49,791
I was like,

2730
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:49,941
oh,

2731
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:51,650
this guy has never heard.

2732
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:52,940
It was a really good comic too.

2733
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,410
That's where I heard it was very funny.

2734
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,280
Very funny writer.

2735
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,810
I heard that from everybody.

2736
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,510
That's fucking those God damn pills,

2737
01:09:59,511 --> 01:09:59,970
man.

2738
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,540
Is that how it was that was it pills?

2739
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,060
Yeah.

2740
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,760
How old was he?

2741
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,470
I heard,

2742
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,460
I heard it was,

2743
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:04,700
it,

2744
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,331
was it pills?

2745
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:05,781
Because I was,

2746
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,490
I was told that he was into heroin.

2747
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:08,391
Oh,

2748
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:09,000
really?

2749
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,833
Same thing.

2750
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:11,300
One leads to the other,

2751
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:11,841
you know what I mean?

2752
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:12,441
You might be right,

2753
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:12,880
but I had heard of,

2754
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,713
I heard it was pills,

2755
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:14,330
bolts,

2756
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:14,571
you know,

2757
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:16,370
that's what you're getting when you're,

2758
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,510
you're taking opiates,

2759
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,790
you're basically getting the same stuff.

2760
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,091
I mean,

2761
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:20,241
it's,

2762
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,200
it's hillbilly heroin.

2763
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:22,070
That's why they call it that.

2764
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,960
The scary part of it is the,

2765
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:24,794
uh,

2766
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,521
the ingredient.

2767
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,950
They put it in the flux where your liver,

2768
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,010
not everything does that.

2769
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:29,000
Tylenol has it.

2770
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,500
Percocet has it.

2771
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:31,371
Uh,

2772
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:31,750
but,

2773
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,480
uh,

2774
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,820
stuff like Xanax and stuff
don't have it for some reason.

2775
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:35,960
I have no idea why.

2776
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:39,070
But your liver goes away quicker
if you take Percocet or something.

2777
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:39,904
Bell.

2778
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,890
When did you have your first
experience with opiates?

2779
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:46,970
Uh,

2780
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,630
match?

2781
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,680
Probably 14.

2782
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:49,663
Whoa.

2783
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,353
Whoa.

2784
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,450
What was that feeling like?

2785
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,740
It's all right.

2786
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,610
It felt good.

2787
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,930
The threw up a little bit,

2788
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,764
you know.

2789
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,753
Wow.

2790
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,511
And then,

2791
01:10:59,511 --> 01:10:59,651
uh,

2792
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:00,660
I was on an ACD.

2793
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:04,340
She concert in 1981 back in black.

2794
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:04,981
Uh,

2795
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:05,360
and,

2796
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:05,690
uh,

2797
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:06,400
I,

2798
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,233
I took a little,

2799
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,233
and it was great.

2800
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,540
Sniff content.

2801
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,000
Never felt that good in my life.

2802
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,020
Uh,

2803
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,100
no sniffing.

2804
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,160
I wasn't sniffing anything.

2805
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,293
How'd you take it?

2806
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,390
I just took it on my tongue.

2807
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,380
Really?

2808
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,870
That's all you're doing
is putting any jobs?

2809
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,260
14 wow.

2810
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,123
Yeah.

2811
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,473
Wow.

2812
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,491
Dissolve them.

2813
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:27,324
Was like Whoa.

2814
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,400
That's what need my friend Johnny,

2815
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,520
he started out with a lot of,

2816
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,354
it was upper,

2817
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,530
a lot of coke started out with a lot of
coke and crack and things along those

2818
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:38,160
lines.

2819
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,770
And then somewhere along the
line it shifted to heroin.

2820
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:41,880
Well,

2821
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,590
I sort of happens is heroin's cheaper?

2822
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,120
It's better for your laborer,

2823
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,590
the natural thing.

2824
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:47,424
And then Bam,

2825
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,400
that fucks your toe and better
for your liver then coke.

2826
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:51,990
Yes.

2827
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:52,800
No,

2828
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,800
no pills at worth for your liver that any
powder patterns and have to go through

2829
01:11:58,861 --> 01:11:59,694
your liver

2830
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,400
14 man.

2831
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,243
That's insane.

2832
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,030
When did it become like a regular thing?

2833
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:08,130
Like how old did you
become irregular thing?

2834
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,410
18 something like that.

2835
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:15,770
That's 17 1717 so you'd have like periods
where you stopped and then periods got

2836
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:17,641
back on.

2837
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:17,971
But yeah,

2838
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:22,950
I could never have done in my career
what I did early on if I was on no way.

2839
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,761
Didn't make sense.

2840
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:24,594
You can't function.

2841
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,340
Yeah.

2842
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,173
Yeah.

2843
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,653
Wow.

2844
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,760
So when you see like this,

2845
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,420
uh,

2846
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,880
this how many people
get prescribed it today,

2847
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,580
and you know how much of a pullet
has on people when you see me now,

2848
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,100
they prescribing it to people all
the time when people have injuries.

2849
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,670
And let me up until the
rubber bands on the injury,

2850
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,500
if you really broke your back,

2851
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,161
you know,

2852
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:45,270
and your loved ones there yet,

2853
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,510
they don't want you to sit in there with
a broken back if they really need it,

2854
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:49,141
they really need it.

2855
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:53,500
The problem is you got to go to a great
doctor who knows how to Wean you off it,

2856
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:53,791
right?

2857
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:54,840
Because if they don't do it,

2858
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:58,550
you'll be in withdrawals when you get out
and then you're physically addicted to

2859
01:12:58,551 --> 01:12:58,770
it.

2860
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,371
That's the problem.

2861
01:12:59,371 --> 01:13:01,260
You're physically trolley poverty,

2862
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,220
old saxophone.

2863
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:02,791
I said something.

2864
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:03,250
He said,

2865
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:03,970
uh,

2866
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:05,160
they can get it out of your blood,

2867
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:06,720
but they can't get it out of your brain.

2868
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,171
You know,

2869
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:09,480
you keep remembering what it felt like.

2870
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,633
That's a problem.

2871
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:14,400
My friend Brendan Chavs
fights in the UFC and he,

2872
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:14,880
uh,

2873
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,990
was on the podcast recently talking
about how he got his nose reconstructed,

2874
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,080
broke his nose in a fight,

2875
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,990
couldn't fight for awhile
and got hooked on pain pills.

2876
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,610
It's like they prescribed to him.

2877
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:26,010
He started taking them and he's taken
before he knew what he was taking six a

2878
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:28,620
day and he's taking them every day
and after the reconstruction is done,

2879
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:29,760
he just can't stop taking them.

2880
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,893
It was from months.

2881
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,141
Yeah.

2882
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:35,460
It's a shame and he's not that he's not
that guy and that destroys your liver.

2883
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:38,650
You might as well get a fungo bat and
just hit your liver with it and really

2884
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:39,841
that many pills,

2885
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:40,261
Bam,

2886
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:40,621
Bam,

2887
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:41,220
Bam.

2888
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,720
Especially if you have
some booze with them.

2889
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:43,470
Fuck it.

2890
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:43,911
Fuck it.

2891
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:44,610
Right.

2892
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:46,390
Is that the only way to
party though the booze?

2893
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,000
You got to mix it with the pills.

2894
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,160
Why is that more dangerous?

2895
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,100
Wasn't wearing dangerous
to mix the combination.

2896
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:55,741
It's like Bam,

2897
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:56,071
Bam.

2898
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:56,581
It's like a one,

2899
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:57,180
two punch.

2900
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,710
Like an overdose as a one,

2901
01:13:58,711 --> 01:13:59,400
two punch man,

2902
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,110
little water,

2903
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,020
little wine.

2904
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,660
You marinate your liver,

2905
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,080
Jesus Christ that have plenty of time.

2906
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,990
Did you ever do it and make bets that
you forgot about and wake up in the

2907
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,440
morning with like a stub in your going?

2908
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,340
What the fuck

2909
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,020
did I buys?

2910
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:13,640
We'll do that with,

2911
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,770
I told their story before.

2912
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:16,810
I should do that with a
Monday night football.

2913
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,370
I would bet at five o'clock and then I
go drinking and I would be drunk and I

2914
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:24,700
would call it a bookie again at seven 30
show drunk and all I would do is bet on

2915
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:25,534
the other.

2916
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,411
Oh,

2917
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:31,030
so all I could do is lose the vague,

2918
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:31,990
the tax for a loser.

2919
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:32,981
Shiloh was the big,

2920
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:34,010
the next day I called a Buckeye,

2921
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:34,750
but I go,

2922
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,500
dude,

2923
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,030
what the fuck did you might
lead her to have Ford?

2924
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:38,290
And he actually said this to me.

2925
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:38,950
He said,

2926
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:41,020
you got to learn a life lesson.

2927
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,800
Ah,

2928
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,310
I did.

2929
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:43,671
Thanks.

2930
01:14:43,671 --> 01:14:44,510
Where's their book?

2931
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,920
Your bookies giving you life lesson.

2932
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,140
The actress say Gambia.

2933
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,310
That's hilarious.

2934
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:50,690
That's fucking hilarious.

2935
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,790
Unbelievable already lying.

2936
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,200
You've had a goddamn colorful life.

2937
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,740
Don't make it dude like you.

2938
01:14:57,741 --> 01:14:58,574
The easy way.

2939
01:14:59,010 --> 01:14:59,843
Easy.

2940
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:02,830
That's why you man,

2941
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,390
you know,

2942
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,000
that's the beautiful thing about life.

2943
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:05,900
A little bit.

2944
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,180
What I was saying earlier about
hanging out in pool halls,

2945
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:10,670
like you meet so many crazy
interesting character.

2946
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,740
Do you know?

2947
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,830
And it's fun.

2948
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,720
That's why it makes sense
that you could play pool.

2949
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:15,990
Well,

2950
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,670
I promise you your balance.

2951
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:18,290
Yeah.

2952
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,300
And uh,

2953
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,500
I could win a lot of money
with those other people too.

2954
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,750
Well though I'm still ones or bear.

2955
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:25,310
Well that that hustle that you
guys have is pretty strong,

2956
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,731
but that's it.

2957
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:26,121
That was,

2958
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,330
that never failed except
the one time I came,

2959
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,390
I never feel,

2960
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:29,931
think about it.

2961
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:30,890
Your buddy sets it up.

2962
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:31,850
It's like boom.

2963
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,303
Yeah.

2964
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:37,310
He just babbles it just hits the point
of the pocket and leaves it there.

2965
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:38,950
He's like Pete Carroll
on the fucking seat.

2966
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,784
Hello.

2967
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,300
Oh Man.

2968
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,700
That's hilarious that you
were doing that for so long.

2969
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,730
How many times do you guys
think you played that played,

2970
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:47,990
what did that Hustle

2971
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,850
and seven years?

2972
01:15:52,851 --> 01:15:54,120
Probably 3000.

2973
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:54,954
Okay.

2974
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,810
You're just robbing

2975
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,640
people that,

2976
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:01,941
oh,

2977
01:16:01,941 --> 01:16:04,680
we're just gambling
that if you'd check it,

2978
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:05,514
tricking them.

2979
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,460
I use it for the right thing.

2980
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,420
It's smart though.

2981
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:08,811
Look,

2982
01:16:08,811 --> 01:16:09,051
it's a,

2983
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:10,040
it's a clever move.

2984
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:11,060
It's America.

2985
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,260
It's America.

2986
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,621
It is.

2987
01:16:12,621 --> 01:16:14,120
It's a free enterprise.

2988
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:15,080
Come on sweetie.

2989
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,943
Give me a break.

2990
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,470
Have you ever gotten in trouble for
gambling and is there a way like the,

2991
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:20,480
they ever tried to get you
to tell who your book is?

2992
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:25,490
Your I got arrested for gambling once
and my buddy that too and we both kind of

2993
01:16:25,521 --> 01:16:26,660
dummied up when they let us go.

2994
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,060
You dummied up lean mean you didn't know?

2995
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:29,670
No.

2996
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:32,600
Well I don't know what to say and they
have eventually have to let you go.

2997
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,840
Monkey and Makino.

2998
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,380
How long do they keep you for three hours.

2999
01:16:36,381 --> 01:16:37,250
I mean three days.

3000
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,170
Three days for gambling.

3001
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,120
That's hilarious.

3002
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,220
This faction of gambling,

3003
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,110
they should have gambling three
days in a country like Yakov.

3004
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:49,840
Smirnoff says they want that.

3005
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,390
They want to be at
somebody's beggar and I,

3006
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,520
I just saw Biagio as much more
afraid of the other person.

3007
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:55,041
Then the cops,

3008
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:55,671
I just was,

3009
01:16:55,671 --> 01:16:56,121
I didn't know.

3010
01:16:56,121 --> 01:16:56,954
So I said,

3011
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,320
yeah,

3012
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,550
they have nothing on me.

3013
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,960
The lawyer said they have nothing.

3014
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,290
Might get three days just
shit here and shut up.

3015
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:04,910
So every time that
somebody asked me to go,

3016
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,541
uh,

3017
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:06,530
you know what's going on?

3018
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:06,710
Yeah.

3019
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,090
You gamble with this guy like Nah.

3020
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:09,090
Gamma howling gale.

3021
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:13,680
I mean big cat.

3022
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,593
I don't know.

3023
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,790
So how did you get caught?

3024
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,010
Like what was the circumstances?

3025
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,220
The place got raided.

3026
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:20,054
The pool.

3027
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,190
So you guys are playing cards?

3028
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:22,641
No.

3029
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:23,570
Pool Pool.

3030
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,290
Gambling Pool.

3031
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:27,650
Shooting Pool.

3032
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,483
Wow.

3033
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,570
Three days.

3034
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,740
The major ring.

3035
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:31,730
This happened in other words,

3036
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:32,930
card tables in the back.

3037
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:34,373
Oh,

3038
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,210
okay.

3039
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:36,170
So it was a sweep.

3040
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:38,600
They were trying to get all
of the connected folk in the,

3041
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:39,434
in the neighborhood.

3042
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,880
You could smoke that if you want.

3043
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:41,450
Let's face it.

3044
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,283
Joe's shut up.

3045
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,610
You think so?

3046
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:45,510
Someone in inside rash.

3047
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:48,720
So I still don't trust a
couple of people who not man.

3048
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,630
Tell me more.

3049
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:50,463
Mother fucker.

3050
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:54,560
This mother fucker's judges have a guy
who announced all the games on the radio.

3051
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:58,520
His name was Jim Gordon and she would
have a bet on the game and if you made

3052
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,354
mistake.

3053
01:17:59,450 --> 01:17:59,670
Yeah.

3054
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:02,690
If you had a ton of a bet on the
game and he was on the radio,

3055
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:03,530
if you've made mistakes,

3056
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:06,530
you didn't know what the
fuck was going on and uh,

3057
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,100
you know,

3058
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:07,880
it would get,

3059
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,930
it would get nerve wracking.

3060
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,821
So you know,

3061
01:18:09,821 --> 01:18:10,940
you'd have all this money on the game.

3062
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:12,140
And here's what Jim Gordon would shame.

3063
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,010
Sims drops back looking for receiver.

3064
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:15,750
He's going way deep,

3065
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,120
long,

3066
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,100
long way down for beggar,

3067
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,570
baby touchdown giants.

3068
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,523
We drop it,

3069
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,930
get physical pain.

3070
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,670
And then he got the mega,

3071
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:33,120
takes the ball in his own
32 he crossed with fields.

3072
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:33,491
45,

3073
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:34,600
40 35 30.

3074
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,830
He's go man to beat the kicker.

3075
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,693
He's buying the kicker.

3076
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:37,563
Comscore.

3077
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,120
No,

3078
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,240
he stepped out of the five.

3079
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,590
Oh

3080
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,321
one time.

3081
01:18:44,321 --> 01:18:46,540
One time I had $500 to my name.

3082
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,820
I put $1,000 on a giant game.

3083
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,760
And here's what this cock
sucker shut on the fucking fuck.

3084
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:52,594
Radio

3085
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,550
giants have the ball
fourth and goal from a one,

3086
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,190
two of them alone.

3087
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,330
Jetpack handoff to,

3088
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:01,603
okay,

3089
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,343
maybe,

3090
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,303
Hey,

3091
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:08,510
wait,

3092
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,320
no,

3093
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,970
I can't see it now.

3094
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:11,900
Work from Toyota.

3095
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,460
Oh,

3096
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,720
that's what that mother fucker done.

3097
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:29,260
Listening to sports on the radio while
you're gambling is God craziest fucking

3098
01:19:29,261 --> 01:19:29,951
thing ever.

3099
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:31,200
It's very difficult to do.

3100
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:32,861
Well,

3101
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:34,840
that's how people did
it back in the old days.

3102
01:19:34,841 --> 01:19:37,090
They had to Joe Frazier
fights on the radio Frazier.

3103
01:19:37,091 --> 01:19:39,970
When the right hand down goes Frazier.

3104
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,210
Yeah.

3105
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,043
There on the rainy

3106
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:46,620
Joe Louis and Max Schmeling
at the garden and drag.

3107
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,290
Exactly.

3108
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:47,531
Yeah.

3109
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:50,650
They used to have those events where
people would huddle over the radio and

3110
01:19:50,651 --> 01:19:51,880
listened to sporting events.

3111
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,280
I used to do that with baseball.

3112
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:58,390
They used to hover over the right field
fence with their legs waiting her charge

3113
01:19:58,391 --> 01:19:58,841
of field,

3114
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:02,080
but for the last that was made
that there their leg was in play.

3115
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:03,970
That's certainly not allowed.

3116
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,720
Yeah,

3117
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,553
certainly not alone.

3118
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,880
My grandfather used to do,

3119
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,970
especially games that
weren't on television.

3120
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,500
He would listen to him on the radio,

3121
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,000
sit in front of his fucking couch,

3122
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:13,800
listen to the radio on a Yankee game.

3123
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,670
Wow.

3124
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,350
Be Very connected to what happened.

3125
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:17,640
They're very excited about it.

3126
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:18,683
Thank you fam.

3127
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:19,680
Yeah.

3128
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,940
There was some gambling and my family,

3129
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,960
my grandmother was involved in running
the numbers and she got arrested and she

3130
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:25,830
wouldn't wrap them out.

3131
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:28,260
So they put her in jail for
six months and she was like,

3132
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:28,640
kidding.

3133
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:28,900
Yeah.

3134
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,020
She would make sweaters
for the guards and Shaman.

3135
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,883
That's a woman.

3136
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,300
She was fresh off the boat.

3137
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:36,811
You know,

3138
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:38,040
she came here when she was,

3139
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,570
God bless young girl.

3140
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,551
When you come here,

3141
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:45,360
when you're a young girl and you grow
up with that like first generation

3142
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:46,260
immigrant family,

3143
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:48,060
but that's a different kind of animal.

3144
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:48,920
She was the blood sugar.

3145
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,700
So you don't wrap people out back then.

3146
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,350
You don't,

3147
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,000
that's what I'm saying.

3148
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,661
I'm not talking to you.

3149
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:55,410
I'm sorry.

3150
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,450
I think you have another
show that you have to get to.

3151
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,100
I don't want you to leave though.

3152
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,260
Tell you everything's a big,

3153
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:03,300
a big fucking arrangement.

3154
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,433
Is that what it is?

3155
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,970
If you've got a bunch of
people telling you what to do,

3156
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,220
you could smoke that just smokey.

3157
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,270
You don't have to stuff it smoking.

3158
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:10,150
I got fucking,

3159
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,810
there's a lighter a or a lighter show.

3160
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,653
Not now.

3161
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:12,841
Oh,

3162
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:13,674
sorry.

3163
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,030
Here's,

3164
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,863
here's the,

3165
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,370
there's one beside you.

3166
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,413
There's a little

3167
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,220
more like we have an air
cleaner on right now.

3168
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,300
Probably is not that good.

3169
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,010
I'm going to watch the smoke drift.

3170
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:26,350
Well,

3171
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,070
we'll see if it goes towards the
gutter cleaner at all towards me.

3172
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:30,990
The fuck you shut the hump.

3173
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:31,480
Sorry.

3174
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,313
You Go.

3175
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,590
Where are you supposed
to go after this and,

3176
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:34,711
well,

3177
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:35,880
this has been something else.

3178
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:36,691
It's been faxed.

3179
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,070
You have a dinner with somebody,

3180
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,550
especially a specialist.

3181
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,360
Let's just say it's a very special,

3182
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:45,900
let's just name that I'm having
dinner with someone who is named,

3183
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:46,530
uh,

3184
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,770
well his name rhymes with shmedium.

3185
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,613
Nishan.

3186
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:50,810
Wow,

3187
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:51,300
that's cool.

3188
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,210
I'm playing a vigilante sting at a film.

3189
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:54,550
You,

3190
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:58,200
the mastermind of the organization that
leads him to his daughter that's been

3191
01:21:58,201 --> 01:21:58,650
kidnapped.

3192
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,760
All I play a Cabbie.

3193
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,200
He kills him the first three seconds.

3194
01:22:01,201 --> 01:22:02,034
You snapchat.

3195
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:02,983
Wow.

3196
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:05,550
He's kicking people's asses at 80 a lot.

3197
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:05,851
I mean,

3198
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:08,500
it's like he's really cashing
them each kitchen and all this,

3199
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,710
but it wouldn't an unlikely scenario.

3200
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,800
The guy becomes an action
star deep into his fifties,

3201
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:14,160
I think,

3202
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,690
or 60 yeah.

3203
01:22:15,691 --> 01:22:16,800
After his wife dies.

3204
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,400
Yeah.

3205
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,233
How weird.

3206
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:18,751
Every,

3207
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:20,190
all of a sudden he's
kicking everybody's ass.

3208
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,810
Like all these taken movies.

3209
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,820
I have a very special set of skills.

3210
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,860
Know where was all that before this,

3211
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,210
before he was like,

3212
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:27,421
you know,

3213
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:28,650
a reasonable man in movies.

3214
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
It took about obnoxious people,

3215
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:32,221
Rob Schneider.

3216
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:35,910
So Rob Schneider was going to
do a movie with Steven Seagal.

3217
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,170
He told this story on stern and
he goes into the sick calls,

3218
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:41,550
a dressing room.

3219
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:46,350
So God comes out of the back
and he says to Rob Schneider,

3220
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:52,940
I just read the greatest script
ever written and rob some.

3221
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:55,711
And my God,

3222
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:56,131
that's great.

3223
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:56,641
Who wrote it?

3224
01:22:56,641 --> 01:22:57,474
And he said,

3225
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,033
I did.

3226
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:04,980
You never know who you're gonna run into.

3227
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,190
Those guys exist.

3228
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:06,420
Yeah,

3229
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:06,870
they know.

3230
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:09,760
And they exist out here
more than anywhere.

3231
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:10,570
More than any guys.

3232
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,910
50 of the 50% of this town works.

3233
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,610
The other 50% function,

3234
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,330
the 50% town that works.

3235
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,164
Wives.

3236
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,393
Whoa.

3237
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,180
Strong words.

3238
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,013
Thank you so much.

3239
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,140
I think there's definitely a lot of
people out here that are like that though.

3240
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,700
There's a lot of boards in the world.

3241
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:25,480
They are.

3242
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,313
How do you stop that?

3243
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:27,850
How do we prevent that rd.

3244
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,130
You try to hang out with
the right click of people,

3245
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:30,730
right?

3246
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:31,840
And if someone gives you shit,

3247
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:32,890
you repeat the mantra.

3248
01:23:32,891 --> 01:23:35,260
My therapist told me
in the late seventies,

3249
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:40,120
which is of course your verbal bullets
are nothing against my arm or of shelf

3250
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:40,954
confidence.

3251
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:42,071
Wow.

3252
01:23:42,071 --> 01:23:42,830
Strong words.

3253
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:43,570
I remember that one.

3254
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:44,710
That should be like on Instagram.

3255
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,590
The time you're feeling
down just a member though,

3256
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,680
there will be a photo of you.

3257
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:51,460
I predict someone will put up on Instagram
with those words and you smile and

3258
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:52,294
holding a cigarette.

3259
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:54,700
I told the,

3260
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,533
I told my mother,

3261
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,470
I told my mother,

3262
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:56,591
uh,

3263
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:57,550
if she ever died,

3264
01:23:57,551 --> 01:23:58,360
I'm but three,

3265
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,660
three words on her tombstone.

3266
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,151
Just said what?

3267
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:01,960
I said bitch could cook.

3268
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,070
That's all your name.

3269
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,480
Grandma had a photo of
her with some of the,

3270
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,810
some of the food she cooked
for your Super Bowl party.

3271
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,790
A big aluminum tray was that if
you're ever anywhere near my house,

3272
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:22,220
you have to composure
with sausage and peppers,

3273
01:24:22,221 --> 01:24:24,860
meatballs with fried green peppers,

3274
01:24:24,861 --> 01:24:27,050
gala mod and the Rigatoni would meet.

3275
01:24:27,051 --> 01:24:28,760
So let's go a little salad

3276
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,270
bread.

3277
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,440
A little lot of salon.

3278
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:33,270
I'm getting excited.

3279
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,010
I got a quick fucking shoot.

3280
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:35,950
I got you.

3281
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:37,370
I would a lot of things and drink it out.

3282
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:41,063
Come on Henry.

3283
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:42,140
I'm worried about you.

3284
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,920
You may fall down the questioning

3285
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:47,611
dude,

3286
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:48,630
I'll fly in for that.

3287
01:24:48,631 --> 01:24:49,740
What do you want to lay it away?

3288
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:52,540
I'll tell you what you've planned
for that I have laying for the,

3289
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:53,090
uh,

3290
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,640
the front of the tournament tournament
to deal the pool tournament.

3291
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:58,140
I'm showing you ever no idea.

3292
01:24:58,141 --> 01:24:59,310
I know you're in no idea.

3293
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,900
I could see him after
watching you play today.

3294
01:25:00,901 --> 01:25:01,190
You please,

3295
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,820
I need you to be and you'll be in a flash.

3296
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:03,571
We'll shoot some pool.

3297
01:25:03,571 --> 01:25:05,480
I'll say that the dom and table,

3298
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,330
they might fucking,

3299
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,163
are they good?

3300
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:07,870
Are they good?

3301
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:08,703
Are you guys back down?

3302
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:09,710
No.

3303
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,900
Dom and dom is the dom is good though.

3304
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:12,793
Not these guys.

3305
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,610
Dom's good and uh,

3306
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:17,030
Adam Ferrari is pretty good
and Greg for Tim is good,

3307
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,620
