00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,300
Hello dirty freaks,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,681
Jess,

3
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,540
you are shut up.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,070
Stop.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,420
Get over it.

6
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,710
It's just a label.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,070
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience is brought to you by ting.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,241
What's Tang?

9
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:23,241
Joe Ting is a cell phone service that
cuts out all the bullshit that you have to

10
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:30,420
deal with with most cell
phone services like contracts.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,070
There's no contracts with Tang Tang
sets it up smoothly and easily.

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,540
So if you want to fucking bail,

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,070
you just bail sun.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,620
Most of the time when
you get a phone from a,

15
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,280
um,

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,320
a major provider,

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,780
what you're doing when you buy
a phone for like 200 bucks,

18
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,300
the phone really probably
costs like 500 bucks or more.

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,070
But what you're doing is
you're paying for the phone,

20
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,510
sort of like on layaway.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,590
So if you go home,

22
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:59,340
quit and your phone service sucks
or can't make calls from my house.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,720
When you cancel your,

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,201
I'm sorry,

25
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,220
I made you sound so dumb.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,590
Just figurative.

27
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,550
It's not really you.

28
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,961
That's only me.

29
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,460
That's actually how I speak off there.

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:08,911
Yeah.

31
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,860
He has a weird voice
off the year on the air.

32
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,820
He's so smooth,

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,870
but off the year just judge
duper going home down.

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,750
I'm tired of fucking
assholes tweeting at me.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Um,

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,191
the,

37
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,024
uh,

38
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,790
the,

39
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,690
the anyway point is if you
try to leave your contract,

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,553
you have to pay money.

41
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,420
That's not our Tang has it?

42
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,230
Tango has it set up where they
rent time on the sprint backbone,

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,570
which sounds really fucking weird,

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,620
but just the term renting
time on a backbone.

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,290
Yeah.

46
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,123
Um,

47
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,870
back points.

48
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,840
They'd probably come up with
a new name for backbones.

49
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,320
Is it a sweaty backbone or is
it an LTE vacuum and backbone?

50
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,651
It's a,

51
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,590
it's a computer network sort of a thing.

52
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,210
I don't understand it.

53
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,050
You know,

54
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,351
why,

55
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,220
why call it background?

56
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,170
Did you run out of words
you can make with your face?

57
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,150
It's not a backbone.

58
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,170
I know what a backbone is.

59
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,750
Network network doesn't
sound as cool or grid.

60
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,603
It does sound though.

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,513
Grid.

62
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,190
The sprint network is a,

63
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,730
uh,

64
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,031
you know,

65
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:06,990
major provider.

66
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:11,991
So you get major cell phone service
with a company like tank with no early

67
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,160
termination fees,

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,720
no nonsense,

69
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,890
no contracts.

70
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,690
And here's the best part.

71
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,420
You pay for what you use.

72
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,283
That's it.

73
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,460
Like say if you pay,

74
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,770
if your cell phone costs x amount per
month and you're allotted 120 minutes,

75
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,510
if you use less of those minutes,

76
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,370
you don't get any money back.

77
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,290
I mean you pay every month.

79
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:38,010
The same with with 10 you
only pay for what you use.

80
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,571
It's beautiful.

81
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,820
So there's no overage fees,

82
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,721
there's no like,

83
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:42,901
you know,

84
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,450
you don't get charged like a penalty.

85
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,700
He does pay for what you use.

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,350
It's very simple.

87
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,390
It's not confusing.

88
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,480
And they have the latest and
greatest in android cell phones,

89
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,481
including the Samsung Galaxy s five which
just came out this week and it's quite

90
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,460
dope malicious.

91
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,881
In fact,

92
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,714
it's waterproof.

93
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,890
It has a fucking fingerprint sensor
and it has a heart rate monitor on it.

94
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,230
Yeah,

95
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,500
that's pretty bad as well.

96
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:07,810
I,

97
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,780
I w I did a good read or read or good
review about it and it said it's an

98
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,351
amazing phone.

99
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:11,501
You know,

100
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,030
it's better than the last one and stuff.

101
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,864
The waterproof things,

102
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,890
probably the best thing about it,

103
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,940
but they're also through so many options
on this phone that it's ridiculous.

104
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,140
Like the fingerprint sensor.

105
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,800
And stuff like that.

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,300
There's so many things on this phone.

107
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,040
What they're doing is they're leaving
apple so far behind that apple would have

108
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,160
to be a big fat copycat in order to catch
up when they start putting things like

109
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,040
heart rate monitors on phones
and making phones waterproof.

110
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,720
This isn't the only waterproof phone.

111
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,350
Yeah,

112
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,490
there's another android phone,

113
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,750
the Sony Xperia,

114
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,370
which looks pretty fucking bad ass.

115
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,940
That phone is also
waterproof and that phone,

116
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,750
um,

117
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,380
has some red donkey Dulles
Mega Pixel camera two.

118
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:47,970
I don't what the fuck?

119
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,640
How's the,

120
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
how's the price of the Sony?

121
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,070
Cause I've liked Sony stuff,

122
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,800
but I feel like it's always like one
and a half times more expensive than,

123
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,960
I haven't looked into it quite honestly.

124
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,853
But uh,

125
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,251
you know,

126
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,840
there's what the point of,

127
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,220
just to get through this commercial,

128
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,521
it's just,

129
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,370
there's so many high quality
android cell phones now.

130
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,610
There's,

131
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,030
there's,

132
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,930
there's quite a bit,

133
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,113
um,

134
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,800
including the Samsungs,

135
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,030
the LGS.

136
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,890
Motorola is now owned by Google and
they're making pretty bad ass cell phones

137
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,880
and they have the,

138
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,380
the moto x,

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,250
um,

140
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,330
they have that at Tang.

141
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,223
All the best ones.

142
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,320

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,310
That's Rogan dot Tang
or bring your iPhone.

145
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:30,821
Oh,

146
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,151
that's right.

147
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,130
You can bring your iPhone to your iPhone,

148
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,840
especially if it's
coming over from sprint.

149
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,883
Right.

150
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,743
And um,

151
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,140
the care of the iPhone,

152
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,840
you can get an iPhone five
now to get it to work on Ting.

153
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,790
Any way.

154
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,500
That's the commercial,

155
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,060
the end Rogan,

156
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,930
ducting.com.

157
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,570
We're also brought to
you by dollar shave club.

158
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,170
Dollar Shave Club is look my thoughts
on anything that you can get shipped to

159
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,310
you where you don't have to go to a store.

160
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,641
Like,

161
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,130
do you know you're going to use x
amount of toilet paper per month?

162
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,850
Yeah.

163
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,490
Well if you to figure out a way
to get that shit shipped to you,

164
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,060
that's probably better than forcing
yourself to go to the store all the time.

165
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,540
And what dollar Shave Club does is gives
you a four pack for six bucks and just

166
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,300
sends them to you.

167
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,760
They have a ton of other cool
things for your bathroom.

168
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
You could check out their Dr Carver's
easy shave butter and a one wipe Charlies.

169
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,510
It's the best there.

170
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,380
But wives for men,

171
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,214
ladies and gentlemen,

172
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,503
and they're amazing.

173
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
It feels good.

174
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,620
It tingles lets you know that
your butt is nice and clean.

175
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,840
It has aloe in it like you don't panic.

176
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,790
You don't panic about what
your underwear look like.

177
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,940
Like if you're out with a chick and you
decide to get freaky and you have white

178
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,570
underwear on,

179
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:40,991
whoa,

180
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,790
what a fucking crazy risk it is.

181
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,290
When you're pulling
those bad boys out here,

182
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,920
you have very little idea
of what you're dealing with.

183
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,110
Especially if you took a
shit and then you sweated,

184
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,381
Oh,

185
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,280
who knows?

186
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,940
Who knows what kind of look.

187
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,070
Wiping your ass is a very inefficient
way to go about your business.

188
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,510
It's toilet paper,

189
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,720
smushing shit.

190
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,830
All of your butthole.

191
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,560
That has nothing to do with
dollar shave club though.

192
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,180
We're talking about shaving folks.

193
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,230
That's what's really important.

194
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,340
They sell other stuff,

195
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,740
but wipe Charlies is a really good idea,

196
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,230
but what's really
important is saving money.

197
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,950
Six bucks for a four pack
and get it sent to you.

198
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,680
That's a delicious way to
go about your business.

199
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
Ladies and gentlemen,

200
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,590
just take care of it.

201
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,300
Join the thousands of guys
who have upgraded the smarter
way to Shave and dollar

202
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,840
shave club.com doesn't waste their
money on ridiculous shave tech.

203
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,930
That's just regular four blade razors.

204
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
It's all you need.

205
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,440
All these nonsense fucking,

206
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,040
you know,

207
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,940
lubricated strips and special.

208
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,020
This relieves tension while
you shapes shut the fuck up.

209
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,890
It does not.

210
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,270
It doesn't do any of those things.

211
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,570
There's no one throwing a glass of
water on my face after I shave either.

212
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,650
What is that nonsense?

213
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,750
Why is this called the lover's blade?

214
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,150
Because he wants shave your
ball sack with that sun.

215
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,463
What do you think?

216
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,450
If you leave the jungle down there,

217
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,410
you don't get as much love.

218
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,490
So it's a lover's blade.

219
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,280
It's not confusing.

220
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,413
Jesus Christ.

221
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,660

Rogen.

225
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,940
Did they show one of
those straight blades?

226
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,110
They don't sell those fucking things,

227
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:15,830
do they?

228
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,750
Cause people are just going to
cut people with those pictures.

229
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,270
People love those things for like images,

231
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:20,961
look,

232
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:25,220
here we are the old barber shop
with a straight blade and a frothy.

233
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,290
We'll fucking whisk broom.

234
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,150
Let them put in the shaving cream on.

235
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,970
How about you just use a razor that
scientists figured out you [inaudible]

236
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
and they're not that fun to get.

237
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,530
If you go to a barbershop and
you ask to the Royal Shave,

238
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,180
the few times I've gotten it,

239
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm in a cold sweat by the end to scared.

240
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,481
Just scared.

241
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,750
Cause it's like it's some old guy
with Harry hands and he's like,

242
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,770
yeah.

243
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,640
And you hear that noise of
like skin against the sharpest
blade you've ever seen

244
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,950
and it's completely up to
him to not take your life.

245
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,181
Right.

246
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,190
It's like as long as his cell phone
doesn't vibrate and he's not distracted,

247
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,810
then you'll live to see another day or
just seizes up his brain as a fucking

computer failure.

249
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,270
Yeah,

250
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,400
it just seizes up and starts
doing a lot of horizontal

251
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,460
quantum movements with his hands slice.

252
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,511
Anyway,

253
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,030
he's getting a Shitty Yelp
review if that's what happens.

And what we are is essentially
a human optimization website.

269
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,870
Um,

270
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,860
it's a weird word,

271
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,230
weird phrase to say because
it doesn't really exist.

272
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,570
We had to make it up to
describe what on it is,

273
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,441
but that's what it is.

274

about yourself.

281
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,710
Like this new warrior bar that we just
started carrying made by the same people

282
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,200
that made the Tonka bar just delicious.

283

gluten free,

287
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:14,970
no nitrates,

288
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,510
14 grams of protein per serving.

289
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,420
And only four grams of
fat and it's healthy fat,

290
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,650
organic buffalo meat
bitch with cranberries.

291
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,910
It's really yummy too.

292
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,953
And um,

293
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,341
it's,

294
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,000
um,

295
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
it's an ancient recipe.

296
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:31,861
Apparently.

297
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,960
This is what they used
to do with buffalo meat,

298
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,710
way back in the dizzy when they
hadn't figured out refrigerators yet.

299
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,781
We're also,

300
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:40,200
uh,

301
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,980
caring,

302
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,813
um,

303
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,240
align of hemp force protein force
protein powders and hemp force,

304
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:52,650
a protein bars and there bars that are
made out of the finest hemp protein.

305
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,491
We A,

306
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,410
we buy all of our hemp
protein from Canada,

307
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:56,310
unfortunately for now.

308
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,720
But as these laws change,

309
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,130
we'll talk to David Simon about this.

310
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,890
It seems like we're going
to probably be able to,

311
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,640
um,

312
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,890
get a farm going in America,

313
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:08,250
which will drop the cost down on all
of our hemp products substantially.

314
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,730
It's very expensive to get
the highest quality hemp.

315
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:10,941
We,

316
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:11,460
we,

317
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,140
there's several grades that you can get.

318
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,560
We get the very highest grade
because we doing everything online.

319
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,040
Uh,

320
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,430
we don't have a store that we send to
that takes a cut out of everything.

321
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,264
So we can,

322
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,330
we can give you things in,

323
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,250
in the qualities and in the purity that
it's like very difficult to get anywhere

324
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,084
else.

325
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,860
The combinations of ingredients,

326
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:35,220
like things like Alpha brain and people
have found when they tried to do it by

327
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:35,831
themselves,

328
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:37,500
like if you want to get the same purity,

329
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:41,010
like you realize like how much it
actually cost to make these things.

330
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,030
There's a lot of supplements that
cut corners on the ingredients,

331
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,440
quality of ingredients.

332
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:51,180
And what we tried to do it on it is
just get the very best shit available.

333
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,350
By default,

334
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,360
we don't have any economy models,

335
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,410
we don't have anything.

336
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,310
I mean the only thing that you can get
cheaper than we have it with kettle

337
00:10:59,311 --> 00:10:59,880
bells,

338
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,620
you have regular kettle bells and then
the Zombie bells and the prime bells cost

339
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,170
more.

340
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,960
But that's because they're works of art
and they're very difficult to recreate

341
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,011
everything.

342
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:08,844
Other than that,

343
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,340
we just go for the greatest
shit that they have.

344
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,120
And that philosophy is sort of,

345
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,900
that's,

346
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,580
that's what I tried to do
with everything in life.

347
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,830
I mean just what's the
best air conditioner?

348
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,030
Get that fucking thing.

349
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,290
Why are you playing games?

350
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,801
You know,

351
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,720
what's the food that's the best for you?

352
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,830
You should probably eat that.

353
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,551
You know,

354
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:26,941
what is,

355
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,510
uh,

356
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,051
what's the,

357
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,240
what's the healthiest way to
live your life go that way.

358
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,410
And what we sell it on it is just
the best shit that we can find.

359
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,170
Whether it's the best organic coconut oil,

360
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,730
the best Himalayan salt,

361
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,450
the purest nutrients that we can get
our hands on and the best strength and

362
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,290
conditioning equipment.

363
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,590
And if you go to [inaudible] dot
com and use the code word Rogan,

364
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:51,591
you will save 10% off any and all
supplements that o n n I t.com and he gigs

365
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,680
coming up.

366
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:53,861
Yeah,

367
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,550
this Friday

368
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,211
a Portland,

369
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,511
Oregon.

370
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,410
So Google,

371
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,770
we Mowgli's Saturday,

372
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:00,970
Seattle and in Vancouver for
four 20 with Tony Hinchcliffe,

373
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,350
Tiffany Haddish test squad dot TV's on.

374
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,510
It is a god Damn Northwest
Territory invasion.

375
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,111
I can't wait.

376
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:09,640
Those are three dope ass cities too.

377
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,000
You're going to Seattle,

378
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,251
Vancouver,

379
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:12,911
and Portland.

380
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,410
It doesn't get any better
than those three places.

381
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah,

382
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,510
those are three of the best
places on earth to perform.

383
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,010
Vancouver is where,

384
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,700
uh,

385
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,391
what's his name?

386
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,041
Eckhart Tolle.

387
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,740
He is from,

388
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,710
and that's where he sat on the
park bench for a couple of years.

389
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,620
Really formulating all
of his positive thoughts.

390
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,161
Yeah.

391
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,620
It after two years he realized that
he should be in the present moment,

392
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,543
which is a,

393
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,110
I mean there's more to it than that,

394
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,350
but like it really took him years to
fully embody like this is all I have is

395
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,120
this exact moment and nothing else.

396
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,751
Wow.

397
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,970
And he figured it out in
Vancouver and Vancouver.

398
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,270
Yep.

399
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,710
Probably would have
figured it out in Kansas.

400
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,870
It's bad mother fucker.

401
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,440
Yeah,

402
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,100
totally.

403
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,281
I mean,

404
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:44,460
I'm,

405
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm thinking you can give Vancouver any
credit for that even though Vancouver is

406
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,684
awesome.

407
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,890
I am at the Ice House
tonight with a Ari Shaffir,

408
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,620
Duncan Trussell and Tony Hinchcliffe and
this weekend in Orlando with Joey Dia

409
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,620
sold the fuck out,

410
00:12:58,621 --> 00:12:58,891
bitch.

411
00:12:58,891 --> 00:12:59,341
Sorry.

412
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,031
You snooze,

413
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,864
you lose.

414
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,220
And a next week in Baltimore with
Joey Diaz probably sold out too.

415
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:05,820
If not,

416
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,230
there's very few tickets left.

417
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,250
Um,

418
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,970
so that's it.

419
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,510
Boom.

420
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,530
David Seaman's here.

421
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,240
Boom,

422
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,061
Sherlock log.

423
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:12,471
Boom.

424
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,021
All right,

425
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,380
now cue the music sun.

426
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,453
Okay.

427
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,020
The Joe Rogan experience

428
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,310
young David.

429
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,550
See Man is fighting crime.

430
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,533
That's your new song.

431
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,001
Yeah,

432
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:29,570
I like that.

433
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,403
That's great.

434
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,590
That's a great intro for my podcast from
now and I'm just going to sample that.

435
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,970
Maybe a couple other things.

436
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,281
We were talking on the,

437
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,050
during the commercials about these um,

438
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,430
new laws that are slowly being worked in
where people got allow them hemp farms

439
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,260
and it's,

440
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,230
I'm really curious to see how
they handle that and woo hoo.

441
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,670
Who starts getting arrested were you know,

442
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,820
this Bundy ranch thing that's going
on in Nevada and the blow back.

443
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,500
I know,

444
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,450
I know absolutely nothing
about Bundy ranch.

445
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,060
The only thing I know about it is
somebody tweeted me and said like,

446
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,490
why have you been silent on this?

447
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:01,740
And it's like I've been solid nine cause
it's the first I've fucking heard of it

448
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,420
is like the other day somebody asks me,

449
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,200
broach the righteous indignation
for you ignoring topics.

450
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:09,300
If there is a man gotten to David Seaman,

451
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,610
you don't want to talk
about ranchers rights.

452
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,541
Oh,

453
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,710
I see where you draw the line.

454
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:15,590
It's all fine if it's drones and bitcoin.

455
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,763
Yeah.

456
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,920
I was so confused about it because I
thought it was the bunny ranch the whole

457
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:20,131
time.

458
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:20,401
And I'm like,

459
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,390
why do they have cattle there?

460
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:21,961
That's so funny.

461
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,241
I saw it.

462
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,020
The same thing.

463
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,520
I,

464
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,610
when I saw that there was a
protest at the bunny ranch,

465
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:27,061
I was like,

466
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:27,751
what happened?

467
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:31,710
I thought like maybe someone killed a
prostitute or something or some horrible

468
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:32,790
thing happened or,

469
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,160
or they were trying to shut them down.

470
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,010
Someone did not get their money's worth.

471
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,780
So if you didn't get
the price of protestors,

472
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,051
I was like,

473
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:40,650
leave this guy,

474
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,580
these guys alone,

475
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,660
let them just get whacked off.

476
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,060
Apparently it has something to do with,

477
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,780
um,

478
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,780
using land to graze cattle on and that
this guy's been doing this forever and

479
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,150
he says that,

480
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:53,481
you know,

481
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,110
he's just using the land the
way God intended and is all,

482
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,800
you know,

483
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,540
private or it's all public land.

484
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,110
And um,

485
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,970
the government wants grazing fees from
this guy and they say that he owes the

486
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,270
American tax payers millions
of dollars for grazing fees.

487
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,480
So I don't know who's
right or who's wrong,

488
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,530
but what I do know is what they're
trying to do is not handling court.

489
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,220
They're trying,

490
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,510
they're not trying to even like make a
public plea for why this guy owes money.

491
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,200
They,

492
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,970
they're going there with guns and dogs
and tasers and people are freaking out

493
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,770
and people rising up and they're saying,

494
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:28,550
hey listen,

495
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,151
you assholes.

496
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,730
When you wonder why we want
to keep the second amendment,

497
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,050
when you wonder why we're worried about
hostile takeovers and police dates.

498
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,190
It's shit like this.

499
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,750
You're talking about grass,

500
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,890
you fuck heads.

501
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,750
You're talking about cows eating
grass and how you're responding.

502
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,270
You're responding with
snipers and dogs and tasers.

503
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,890
Well last night I had to pick my mom
up at lax cause she's visiting and uh,

504
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,000
on the way out the woman would not let
me out of the parking lot where you'd

505
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,330
like pay the fee and leave
and the little gate goes up.

506
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,741
And I was like,

507
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:00,401
what's going on here?

508
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:00,851
Like I was like,

509
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:01,840
I'll pay with cash.

510
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,890
Like it doesn't have to be credit card.

511
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:03,501
I'll pay with cash.

512
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:03,670
Like,

513
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,690
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

514
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:05,171
I'm tired.

515
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:06,700
My mom just got off a five hour flight,

516
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,370
she's tired and it's
cause I have a new car.

517
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:10,001
I got a new,

518
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:10,600
uh,

519
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,141
it doesn't really matter.

520
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,270
I got a new Corolla and uh,

521
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,231
she's like,

522
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,120
says new and you don't
have plates on the back.

523
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,850
I've got take photos of your
car and get your vin number.

524
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,181
And I was like,

525
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:19,930
are you fucking serious?

526
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,120
Like how long it's going to take
to write down my vin number?

527
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,080
Like it's dark.

528
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,610
You can barely see through the windshield.

529
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,211
It was like,

530
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,050
just let me go.

531
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:26,950
And here's the funny thing,

532
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:27,160
like,

533
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,993
I'm not,

534
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,260
I'm not a racist,

535
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm not an Islamophobe,

536
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,900
but she was wearing one of the,

537
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:32,111
uh,

538
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:32,944
the headscarves,

539
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,480
the fucking Burka things.

540
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,381
And I'm like,

541
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:35,740
all right,

542
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,370
if we're going to,

543
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,370
if we're going to be very
crass as a civilization and
very cold and calculating,

544
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,820
how many young white guys driving Toyota
Corollas with their fucking mom in the

545
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:46,510
car,

546
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,540
how many of them have been responsible
for terrorist attacks over the last 10,

547
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:49,901
20,

548
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,830
or a hundred years?

549
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,813
Zero.

550
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,211
You know,

551
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,361
like,

552
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:56,470
this is ridiculous white guys with
their mom and Toyota Corollas.

553
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,640
And I was like,

554
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,181
what is this?

555
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:58,481
And she's like,

556
00:16:58,481 --> 00:16:58,601
oh,

557
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,890
it's homeland security policy.

558
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:00,101
I was like,

559
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:00,221
well,

560
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:00,880
it's bullshit.

561
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
Like I think we have to,

562
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,190
we don't want to go overboard with
being too adversarial or to uh,

563
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,840
like unaccepting of the fact that
nothing is going to be perfect ever.

564
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,190
We have to acknowledge that.

565
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,920
But I think if we don't put our foot
down at some point and see like enough of

566
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,150
this bureaucratic bullshit,

567
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,770
then it's only a matter of time before.

568
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,050
That's the situation in a
grocery store parking lot,

569
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:20,761
you know?

570
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,210
And like people say that's ridiculous.

571
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,640
But that is how mission
creep happens is big.

572
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,950
Oh well the TSA needs to keep our grocery
store parking lot safe because can,

573
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,480
you could be shot by a psychopath
and you don't want that.

574
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:31,811
And it's like,

575
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:32,531
where do we draw the line?

576
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,940
Like life is unsafe,

577
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,650
everybody dies guaranteed.

578
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,941
And that's that.

579
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,331
And then like,

580
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:38,770
we should try to keep airports safe.

581
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,560
We should try to profile
people beforehand,

582
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,453
you know,

583
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,070
kind of filter out the threats
before they even get there.

584
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,630
All that stuff I'm in favor of,

585
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,940
but we got to have common
sense and we're lacking that.

586
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:49,741
Yeah,

587
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:49,951
no,

588
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,280
I

589
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,941
agree with you.

590
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:51,540
I think,

591
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,340
uh,

592
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,680
you're,

593
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,520
you're totally right.

594
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:57,720
And I think that that's the thing about
that people don't recognize about,

595
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,360
it's slowly creeping into new places.

596
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,090
It's like all it would take is one event,

597
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,630
whether it's at a great forum parking lot,

598
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,991
you know,

599
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:07,830
whether it's sad,

600
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,700
you know,

601
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,851
well,

602
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:09,560
they already,

603
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,970
the TSA wants to start arming their agent,

604
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,200
arming their whatever they are.

605
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,390
They're people because
of the shooting at lax.

606
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
So now we're going to go from a situation
where there's pretty much nobody with

607
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:23,160
guns at every airport to 20 dumb asses
with guns at every airport and you're

608
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:28,020
just creating an exponentially
higher risk of something going wrong.

609
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,291
You know,

610
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,820
somebody is going to
make the wrong decision.

611
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:30,960
Somebody who's going to be jumpy,

612
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,090
you don't need to arm
a bunch of people who,

613
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:33,871
uh,

614
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,201
you know,

615
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,240
are barely able to do their jobs as it is.

616
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:36,911
Yeah.

617
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:37,241
That's,

618
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,074
um,

619
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,820
it's definitely a slippery slope.

620
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,410
It's definitely a slippery slope.

621
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,303
And it's like,

622
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,220
what kind of qualifications are these
people going to have to decide whether or

623
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:46,270
not they should pull the trigger?

624
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,600
You heard about what happened to
the PA that worked for tosh point?

625
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,200
Oh,

626
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
they've got accidentally shot by the cops.

627
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,630
Holy Shit.

628
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,781
No,

629
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:56,770
I didn't hear responded to
someone they knew got stabbed.

630
00:18:56,771 --> 00:19:01,771
He went to help and the cops showed up
and he was running out of the place with

631
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,930
the guy who had gotten stabbed.

632
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:05,651
The guy ran out,

633
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,990
he ran out behind him and
the cops unloaded on him.

634
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,410
Wow.

635
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,030
They just start firing
on him and you know,

636
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,660
the cops had no idea he was running
towards them and they just made a bad

637
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:14,170
decision.

638
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,190
Now these are cops train
police officers that made a,

639
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,420
a slippery decision and
they were incorrect.

640
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,711
Right.

641
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,770
And they go to a firing range and
they have to pass certain tests.

642
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:24,930
TSA officers are like rent a cops

643
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,590
basically.

644
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,861
Yeah.

645
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:29,670
Who knows what kind of stringent safety
standards they have to go through.

646
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,760
But um,

647
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm not comfortable with
all those fucking dudes.

648
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:33,030
Can.

649
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,360
I've,

650
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,220
I've seen too many of them that it just,

651
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,960
it,

652
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,540
it,

653
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,910
some of them are really cool for sure,

654
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,040
but I've seen too many
of them where I'm like,

655
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,340
this guy did not go through
a tight filter to get here.

656
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,060
He just didn't,

657
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,960
he's not that bright.

658
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,150
The way they're interacting
with people's clunky,

659
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,350
it's rude.

660
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:49,651
You know?

661
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,980
You see a lot of people that have this
authoritative way of talking where they

662
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,210
don't recognize the fact that,

663
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:54,841
hey man,

664
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:55,860
you're just a person.

665
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,791
You're a person.

666
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,340
I'm a person.

667
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,541
You,

668
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,800
you don't own me.

669
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,510
You're not better than me.

670
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,811
You know,

671
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,590
you don't get to talk down to me
because I forgot to take my belt off.

672
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,180
You know?

673
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,720
Why don't you lighten the fuck up?

674
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,650
I'm not a terrorist.

675
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm a human being who is
going through your job.

676
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:11,911
You know?

677
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,450
Just because you have power doesn't
mean you should exercise it.

678
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,841
You know?

679
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:16,650
In all fairness,

680
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,020
most of the people I run into a
TSA are very pleasant and very nice

681
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,310
too.

682
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,020
Especially when I get
in the preapproved line.

683
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:22,501
It's awesome.

684
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,334
It's almost like,

685
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,641
oh,

686
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:24,391
this is what it should be.

687
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:24,931
All the time.

688
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,220
It shouldn't be a special treat.

689
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:26,940
It should be,

690
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,190
you know that just prescreen
the shit out of me.

691
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,320
You're already reading my emails.

692
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,470
Like let's figure this out.

693
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,890
I got on the list where I can be
preapproved and can leave my shoes on and

694
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:35,341
that's fine.

695
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,210
Like I'm okay with that.

696
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,651
Yeah.

697
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:37,700
That's how it should be.

698
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,660
100% I remember when you used to
not have to take a driver's license.

699
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,670
He could give somebody else your ticket.

700
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,670
You could give Brian your ticket
and he can go on a fucking plane.

701
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,220
Like don't have to have

702
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,730
a ticket that says David Seaman.

703
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:50,770
Show your passport.

704
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,060
Do you have any other forms of ID,

705
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:52,600
sir?

706
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,560
Let me read your DNA.

707
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:54,640
Can I check your fingerprints?

708
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,620
What's the scar in your hand?

709
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,210
You've ruined your fingerprint.

710
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,640
You know mean.

711
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,640
It's just unbelievably ridiculous
that it's still escalating in this.

712
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,683
By the way,

713
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,153
where's the terrorism?

714
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:07,541
Well,

715
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,374
don't give them,

716
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,430
don't give them any ideas.

717
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,780
I know I'm not saying,

718
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,550
but what I am saying is Boston police
arrest man for bringing hoax explosive

719
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,170
device to Boston marathon finish line.

720
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,610
They should eat that guy.

721
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,910
They should cut him up into
pieces and serve him to prisoners.

722
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,740
There was a pressure cooker and it too,

723
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,603
like he just made,

724
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,820
oh what a fucking idiot.

725
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,461
Really.

726
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,690
Not a smart God.

727
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,010
What a fucking idiot.

728
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,560
But you know what,

729
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,960
what would have prevented
that guy from doing that?

730
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,160
I mean maybe,

731
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,230
maybe if they had more security at the
Boston airport or at the Boston marathon.

732
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,950
But really what would have prevented
it is if they followed up on all the

733
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:46,170
creepers like that.

734
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,310
They had been looking at
that guy for a long time.

735
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:48,760
The,

736
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,580
the CIA had been investigating
that guy for awhile.

737
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,770
Yeah.

738
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,860
Important piece of shit.

739
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,540
We're a country of 300 million people.

740
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,110
So unless we put everybody
under house arrest and like,

741
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,570
you know,

742
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,780
padded bubble wrapped
rooms to keep us safe,

743
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,880
some people are going to do crazy shit.

744
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,670
And that's what happens when you have
a society where people have rights and

745
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:08,980
people can have guns and
people can drive cars.

746
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:10,450
Like you're going to have car accidents,

747
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,830
you're gonna have people shooting people.

748
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,090
And if you don't have that,

749
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,380
you'll still have crazy people.

750
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,960
The other day there was
a headline story on CNN.

751
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:17,794
Some school,

752
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,030
I forget where it was,

753
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,691
Wisconsin,

754
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,860
maybe there was a fucking knife thing
where this guy went in and a rampage and

755
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:23,170
knife.

756
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,880
Like a crazy amount of people.

757
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:25,571
He didn't have a gun.

758
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:26,560
He was like five people.

759
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,770
Yeah,

760
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,603
it's insane.

761
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,870
Yeah.

762
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,201
Yeah,

763
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,750
and we got a lot of
problems in this country.

764
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,110
We definitely have a lot of problems
but I think are behavioral problems.

765
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,830
It's what would cause a person
to do any of those things.

766
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,580
It's the same thing that what would
cause a person have no environmentally

767
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,180
concerned,

768
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,410
no environmental concerns.

769
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,640
If they could profit from it,

770
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,630
what could cause a person to release
something on the market that may have

771
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,300
potential horrific side effects without,

772
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,930
you know,

773
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,540
doing the kind of screening
that they should do every time.

774
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,550
Something like Vioxx slips through.

775
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,830
Are these pharmaceutical
drugs give you strokes?

776
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,930
They find out years
later like I know dude,

777
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:02,800
it's like 30 years old.

778
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:06,010
He's an MMA fighter and a
fucking stroke from taking Vioxx.

779
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,300
I mean that stuff,

780
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,163
they pulled it,

781
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,100
they yanked it.

782
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,500
But there's been a bunch of those
things where they just said fuck it,

783
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,430
let it roll.

784
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,263
Let's find out later.

785
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,700
You know maybe weird shit
will happen to people,

786
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,740
but we've got to have
data run makes him money.

787
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,000
I had a family member have a heart
attack from a adverse reaction to a drug

788
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,780
that's relatively new last couple of
years it came on the market and it's still

789
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:26,261
on the market.

790
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:27,850
Even though this is a known side effect,

791
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:28,930
like you'll see a,

792
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,764
if you Google it,

793
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,570
you'll see like a law firm's
soliciting victims of this,

794
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,330
this issue and I guess whatever bean
counter there decided that it would be

795
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:41,380
massively expensive to to reign in
the drug and admit the word fault.

796
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,150
So instead we're just going to say,

797
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:43,361
you know,

798
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,500
this is the risk of
using this medication is,

799
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,190
it's

800
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,270
insane to me that I still see commercials
for this drug on TV and like know that

801
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,460
it's responsible for giving a
family member or a heart attack.

802
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,720
That's so crazy.

803
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:53,970
Yeah.

804
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,470
And is it just a weird one?

805
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,450
1 million people freak out and blow a
gasket on this stuff or is it a real

806
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,710
common side effect?

807
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,870
It's not super common,

808
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,530
but it's also,

809
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,100
from what I,

810
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,461
again,

811
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:06,580
I'm not a doctor or anything
since it just googling around.

812
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,910
It's not super uncommon either.

813
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:08,720
It's not like,

814
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:08,931
you know,

815
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,140
you saw the ads from Mesothelioma
and nobody actually has it.

816
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,350
This is something where like you get
prescribed this instead of the one that's

817
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,790
tried and true and that,

818
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,240
uh,

819
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
hospitals have been
using for decades with,

820
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,550
you know,

821
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,830
very known a risk profile.

822
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,240
This one replaces that.

823
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,350
And because it's under patent,

824
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,660
they make more money and they
claim it's more efficient,

825
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,494
which it may be,

826
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,650
but it also has this small chance
of really fucking you over.

827
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,290
What is Mesothelioma?

828
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,610
Cause I see those ads,

829
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,560
they're on all the time on television.

830
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,210
Do you have Mesothelioma?

831
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:37,820
Yeah,

832
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,780
I honestly don't know.

833
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,670
I think it might be some
kind of lung disorder.

834
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,690
And it was from what?

835
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,810
No idea is a,

836
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,610
looks like a cancer that
develops from cells.

837
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,723
Oh,

838
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,990
here it is from exposure to asbestos.

839
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,983
Huh?

840
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,890
It's a cancer only from Express's.

841
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,530
Yeah.

842
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,100
Hmm.

843
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,130
So I guess what they're trying to do
with those ads is target people that used

844
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:03,170
to work in offices that
have asbestos in them.

845
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,100
So there's,

846
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,080
that has nothing to do with
what we're talking about,

847
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,500
but,

848
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:07,651
no,

849
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:08,401
but my point is like,

850
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:10,080
you see those ads online,

851
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:10,840
like have you,

852
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,530
are you suffering from
Mesothelioma contact our law firm?

853
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,200
And I've never met anybody
who's suffered from that.

854
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,700
But this is something
where if you Google it,

855
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,110
there actually are cases of people having
adverse side effects and it's because

856
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,160
it's a new drug.

857
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,240
They're trying to make money and push
aside this extremely cheap drug drug that

858
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,320
costs like nothing,

859
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:32,160
like a dollar and has been
used in hospitals for a
hundred years and they want

860
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:34,260
to replace that blood
thinner with this new one,

861
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,330
which is not all that tried and true.

862
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:36,691
And it's just,

863
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:36,871
you know,

864
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:39,510
it's gone through the FDA
process but then shit happens.

865
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,853
And uh,

866
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,530
I dunno how I got off on this tangent,

867
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:43,820
but I think,

868
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,150
no.

869
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,421
Yeah.

870
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:48,100
Well we got off talking about people
that are just behavior problems.

871
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,610
It's an uh,

872
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:54,611
thinking and behavior problem that people
are willing to put money over humanity

873
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,790
or the people were willing to
commit horrific crimes like I,

874
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,410
what is it that causes someone to be
able to run through a school and stab a

875
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,071
bunch of kids?

876
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:04,251
I mean,

877
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:04,910
what is it?

878
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,240
Oh,

879
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,200
is he on drugs?

880
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,880
Is it an antidepressant?

881
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,650
Is it a childhood abuse?

882
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,090
Is it trauma?

883
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:14,330
When he was young and
just ruined his mind,

884
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:16,130
ruined the connections at his mind.

885
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,150
Makes forever.

886
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,140
What are those?

887
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,040
What are those answers?

888
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,360
Because that's not what we ever hear.

889
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:24,220
All we ever hear is tightened down and
security take away the guns but locked

890
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:26,240
the gates installed guards.

891
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,070
But is that really the answer?

892
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:31,790
It shouldn't we be trying to figure out
at least making an attempt because I

893
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:36,791
don't hear a fucking peep out of anybody
to examine the motivations and the

894
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:38,510
possibilities.

895
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,720
Like what are the possibilities that
could cause someone to become a monster?

896
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,823
What is it,

897
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,231
you know,

898
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,310
what are the variables?

899
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,140
I don't think that when they add more
security guards and more checkpoints,

900
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,180
I really don't think it's
about making us safer.

901
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,090
And it's not that they
don't want us to be safer.

902
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,090
I'm not like super,

903
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:54,780
uh,

904
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,980
super cynical about this.

905
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,060
But what it is,

906
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:58,440
is pretty much a jobs program.

907
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:02,370
It's like this is a way to give people
jobs and keep the employment rate right

908
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,330
at decent range.

909
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,390
And if we don't give people these jobs
that basically they're just standing

910
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,260
around like what is the abbreviation for
Tsa that people use thousand standing

911
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,630
around there.

912
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,080
It's a fucking jobs program.

913
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:15,930
And so I would much rather see us,

914
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,261
uh,

915
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:16,621
you know,

916
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:19,830
why don't those people do something
that actually helps the community plant

917
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:23,700
trees instead of harassing
people at an airport or a,

918
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,121
you know,

919
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:27,210
we don't want to militarize our schools
because then every day you're going into

920
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,370
school and subconsciously you're like,

921
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,540
am I a fucking prisoner?

922
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,340
Like why are there guards around here?

923
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:35,590
It's supposed to be a voluntary thing
where like I'm coming for knowledge and to

924
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,120
interact with other people my age and
learn something about the world and then

925
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,830
go home and it's not a prison.

926
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:41,664
So,

927
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,141
yeah,

928
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:45,980
it is a weird thing that you have to even
think about that they even worry about

929
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:48,260
going to a school and there's guards,

930
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,750
they're like protecting what it's like.

931
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,210
Is it going to get to a
point where it's just,

932
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:56,240
the only thing that's different is that
people haven't figured out that they can

933
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,620
attack people at stadiums or figured
out that they can attack people at the

934
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:00,951
mall.

935
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:01,161
I mean,

936
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,500
once those things start
happening on a regular basis,

937
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,590
there really will be some sort
of a lock down the parking lot.

938
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,900
We're going to have to show your vin
number and they're going to have to read

939
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:09,621
your DNA.

940
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,454
And

941
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,381
yeah,

942
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:12,400
it was really a,

943
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,810
when somebody says,

944
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,920
I need your vin number,

945
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,530
it just feels so invasive
because they're like,

946
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,131
we own you.

947
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,480
That's like the message that I get.

948
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,030
I realize that they need to do it cause
they don't want somebody putting a

949
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,710
explosive device in a car that
doesn't have a license plate.

950
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,230
I totally understand the logic.

951
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,330
But just as an individual who,

952
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,290
uh,

953
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,670
goes to airports fairly often,

954
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,970
it's dehumanizing and there's no
proof that this makes us safer.

955
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,650
Yeah.

956
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,300
There's no proof that this makes us safer.

957
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:36,960
And the,

958
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,420
the actual numbers of terrorist attacks,

959
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:43,740
like not taking anything away from the
horrific nature of nine 11 or the Boston

960
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:44,640
bombings or anything,

961
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,130
the,

962
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,350
the numbers of those things taking place
in comparison to the numbers of human

963
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,180
beings is quite staggering.

964
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,261
I mean,

965
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,620
there are very few terrorists
attacks and God damn,

966
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:56,580
there's a lot of people,

967
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,730
there's 300 million fucking
people in this country.

968
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,990
Not including transients,

969
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,630
not including vacationers
from other countries,

970
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,370
not including illegal aliens.

971
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,210
We really don't know the full
number is because when I'm actually,

972
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,430
homes are good at crossing that border.

973
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,930
La is a joke,

974
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:18,120
like when they try to figure
out like the sense of Ella.

975
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:18,601
Yeah.

976
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,141
You get it.

977
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:19,411
Yeah.

978
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:24,411
It's 20 million people
in La and approximately a
hundred thousand undocumented

979
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:25,974
workers.

980
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,210
Do you have any,

981
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,710
you don't know how many,

982
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,510
you have no idea how
many Mexicans they are.

983
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:30,891
They aren't,

984
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:33,600
you're not talking to you
about how they're undocumented.

985
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:34,434
They're hiding.

986
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,621
Yeah.

987
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,440
Go to work,

988
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,880
go to one TACO truck next to a car wash.

989
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,040
It was like a thousand,

990
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,610
uh,

991
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,600
Mexican people there.

992
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,860
But um,

993
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,540
speaking of Mexican immigrants,

994
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:47,080
this is one of my issues with the media
is right now they would have us believe

995
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,360
that the two biggest
problems facing all of us,

996
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,020
gay marriage and illegal immigration,

997
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,221
well,

998
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,230
the right about one thing.

999
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:57,220
It's fucking queers kitchen up on the way,

1000
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,210
on the way over here,

1001
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:00,970
the freeway was backed up because there
was a wedding right in the middle of the

1002
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:01,331
freeway.

1003
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,740
All these gays just getting married,

1004
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,960
right and left destroying our way of life.

1005
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,170
Yeah,

1006
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,230
they're sucking each other off
right before they got married.

1007
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,740
They don't even believe in the sanctity
of marriage in a gay household.

1008
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,750
They don't abstain
before they get married.

1009
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,280
They're not like regular people.

1010
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,080
They have sex all the time.

1011
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,270
And then we know that the
wedding ring goes on your cock.

1012
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm not sure if they do that where
it's how it keeps your Dick hard.

1013
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,340
None of 'em abstain ever.

1014
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,271
It never abstained.

1015
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,940
Did you never going to
find a single gay version?

1016
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,930
They come out of the
gate thing in their own,

1017
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,764
but

1018
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,240
they really had a wedding in
the middle of a fuck head.

1019
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,220
Jesus Christ.

1020
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,420
Oh,

1021
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,350
so you have an eight
year old on the podcast.

1022
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:39,760
We have to explain things to him.

1023
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:40,810
That should be obvious.

1024
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,700
I thought you really said
there was and I'm like,

1025
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:42,941
wait,

1026
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,721
that's ridiculous.

1027
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:44,620
That's a good idea though.

1028
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,120
Everyone I know about your wedding.

1029
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm so deadpan about everything that
people can't even tell when I'm joking

1030
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:49,320
about shit,

1031
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,950
but the other,

1032
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,740
it'd be 99.9% of the people listening.

1033
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,290
Brian's half awake,

1034
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,580
he woke up 15 minutes.

1035
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,980
He hasn't had his bulletproof coffee.

1036
00:30:58,981 --> 00:30:59,814
It worked out.

1037
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,930
So that's what it is.

1038
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:02,764
You're tired.

1039
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,000
The illegal immigration thing,

1040
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,170
it's like if we want to solve this,

1041
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:08,350
like instead of putting all these judge
Dredd border patrol people along the

1042
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:08,950
border,

1043
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,290
which I don't think it's a terrible
idea because we do need some border

1044
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:11,950
protection,

1045
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,240
but it's enormously expensive.

1046
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,190
It's dehumanizing.

1047
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:15,640
We're rounding these
people up like animals.

1048
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,240
Why don't we start by making it so
that American corporations stop fucking

1049
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,770
promoting them coming over here.

1050
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,810
If we are not giving
them any kind of jobs,

1051
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,100
the immigration with,

1052
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:24,821
to a large extent,

1053
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:25,601
stop it.

1054
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:29,020
They're coming over here cause it sucks
in Mexico and they can get jobs here and

1055
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:29,560
send money.

1056
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:29,651
Yeah.

1057
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:30,610
But I don't think the,

1058
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,970
the rational response is stop giving
them jobs once they get here because it's

1059
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,500
never going to happen.

1060
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,890
There's always going to be landscapers
and there's always going to be

1061
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:42,650
construction.

1062
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,300
Agriculture.

1063
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,770
Like any vegetables you bought in the
supermarket have probably been picked by a

1064
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:47,771
legal day.

1065
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:48,760
Laborers sure.

1066
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,260
Go to AWC star and get a strawberry.

1067
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,094
Who are you getting from?

1068
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,550
You're getting that shit from someone
who probably came to America to find a

1069
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:55,660
better life for their family.

1070
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,630
So I don't think you can say
the corporations are at fault.

1071
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,750
The human being should be
allowed to go to a better place.

1072
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,180
You should be allowed to take your
fucking family to a better place.

1073
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,320
And everybody over here that's got a
good is scared that these poor people are

1074
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:10,060
going to come over here
and fuck everything up.

1075
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,110
And that's what the,

1076
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,520
the real fear is.

1077
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:13,420
What about passports?

1078
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:16,450
What an antiquated idea that is because
I think as long as you're not on the

1079
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,760
Interpol list and you're
not wanted for something,

1080
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,470
you should just be able
to go wherever you want.

1081
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,820
As long as it's an allied country,

1082
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:22,960
you shouldn't need a passport.

1083
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,290
That's valid because it's like they know
how to you find out if someone's on the

1084
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,790
Interpol list without a passport.

1085
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:28,811
Yeah.

1086
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:30,640
I mean I guess you need
some kind of system,

1087
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,710
but I think it can be done
with what they have already.

1088
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,870
Like they know what you're doing
at every second of the day.

1089
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,850
This is what's so Orwellian and fucked up.

1090
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:40,010
It's like yesterday was tax
day and we saw all this stuff

1091
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,750
like make sure you file
your taxes on time.

1092
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,800
And it's like,

1093
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,670
what is this?

1094
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:43,791
Like?

1095
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,370
What kind of mind benders?

1096
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,730
We know that the NSA is sharing data
with agencies like the IRS giving them,

1097
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,061
you know,

1098
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,690
we know that they're sharing financial
data with those kinds of agencies and IRS

1099
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:57,800
knows exactly how much you owe because
they get the 10 90 nines every year from

1100
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,710
the people who pay you more than
$600 so they know everything.

1101
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,440
Why don't they just send you a fucking
bill and then if there's a problem you

1102
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,290
can dispute it the same as a
credit card bill instead of like,

1103
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,500
I've got a guest to make sure that I'm
paying the right amount and if I don't

1104
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,880
match their number,

1105
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
they are,

1106
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,160
we have right here.

1107
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,300
Even Donald Rumsfeld who I consider to
be the closest thing to like the man

1108
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,870
that's out there tweeted out the other
day about how the IRS is just out of

1109
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:21,230
control.

1110
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,700
Like it makes no sense anymore.

1111
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,140
It's not a logical thing.

1112
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,910
Like there's some Democrat Foreign Office.

1113
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,201
It's true,

1114
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:27,921
it's partisan,

1115
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,390
it's just attacking the other side.

1116
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,840
But I think in general like why
don't you just send me a bill,

1117
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,501
just send me a bill.

1118
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,150
And like in most cases I
think most people are like,

1119
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,691
oh this is what I,

1120
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:36,170
oh cool.

1121
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,030
20% 25% what are the fuck it is?

1122
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,400
People can pay it cause
that's how it works for cable.

1123
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,720
It's what?

1124
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,810
How it works for your credit card,

1125
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,770
for your car payment.

1126
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,630
Why isn't your tax bill the same one?

1127
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,150
Because they don't want people
to pay or get money back.

1128
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,260
Most people get money back.

1129
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:48,980
That I know of.

1130
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,460
You know,

1131
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,710
unless you're making over
a certain amount of money,

1132
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,120
you actually get money back.

1133
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:53,511
Everyone's like,

1134
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:53,601
oh,

1135
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:53,910
it's time.

1136
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,980
I get my tax check yet.

1137
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,541
Well here's,

1138
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,374
here's a fucker.

1139
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,341
Here's a fucker.

1140
00:33:57,341 --> 00:33:58,450
State taxes.

1141
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,040
You don't always have to pay him.

1142
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,113
That's the fucker.

1143
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,460
Like if we lived in Washington
state or if we have done,

1144
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,770
we lived in Vegas or la,

1145
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,160
I think Texas as well.

1146
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:06,671
Florida,

1147
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,090
Florida.

1148
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,790
Few places don't have
to pay the state taxes.

1149
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,070
That's 10% so if you live,

1150
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,480
if say if you make a nice living,

1151
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:14,480
you know you make a,

1152
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,420
let's go to a hundred grand
a year because it's easy.

1153
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,010
You make $100,000 a year,

1154
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,770
you're given $10,000
to state of California.

1155
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,470
So you're paying $10,000
just to live here.

1156
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,220
So you imagine if you rent was 1000
bucks and then on top of that you pay

1157
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:29,110
another thousand bucks to the state.

1158
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,910
That is what your doing.

1159
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:34,660
If you live in California or if you
live in a place that has state taxes,

1160
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:37,570
like how does Washington state survive?

1161
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,640
How come they don't
have to steal my money?

1162
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,380
Like what?

1163
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,500
What's going on here?

1164
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:45,910
That Vegas doesn't need that 10% what's
going on here that Texas has figured out

1165
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,900
how to fucking stay afloat without
stealing money from the people that live

1166
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:50,081
there?

1167
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:52,030
Like what does that state tax,

1168
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,250
why wouldn't everybody
gets a piece of what?

1169
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:59,090
So you can hire more people to do a
shitty job of running things and you and

1170
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,370
just keep putting jobs on the
books to eat up tax revenue.

1171
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,160
We got it.

1172
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,410
100,000 jobs,

1173
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,030
you should be fired.

1174
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,240
The government should be
fired for creating any jobs.

1175
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,490
If you creating more jobs
and you already have,

1176
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,720
that means there's more government,

1177
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,880
more government should mean you're fired.

1178
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,840
You're fucking up.

1179
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,100
We don't need more government.

1180
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,820
Need less people telling you what
to do and less shit that's illegal.

1181
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,180
That would smooth things out for so
many people and let drugs be legal.

1182
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:28,771
Boom.

1183
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:29,860
I balance your economy.

1184
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,270
It's done so over.

1185
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,840
I still,

1186
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,910
I

1187
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,810
think Obama,

1188
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,770
uh,

1189
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,730
the other day I was,

1190
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,760
I was in Venice beach getting lunch and
I got a beer and a burger and enjoyed

1191
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,970
something that's known to the state of
California to have medicinal benefit.

1192
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,260
And I looked up in the,

1193
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:43,650
uh,

1194
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,461
whenever this place was,

1195
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:48,280
this restaurant and right over the door
was the picture of Obama from his Hawaii

1196
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:48,631
days.

1197
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:53,310
He had the hat on and he was smoking
a Doobie and for like a half a second,

1198
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:53,581
I thought,

1199
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,600
that's my guy right there.

1200
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:56,760
That's 2008 campaign trail Obama.

1201
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,230
And then of course,

1202
00:35:58,231 --> 00:35:58,951
that's not what we got.

1203
00:35:58,951 --> 00:35:59,970
We got smart Bush.

1204
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,421
Instead,

1205
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:05,190
we got somebody who can like come onto
the tonight show or the view or something

1206
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,610
and just have the host eating out of
his hand by the end of the interview.

1207
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,370
So he's much smarter and more eloquent,

1208
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,920
but it's still doing a lot of the
crazy shit that Bush was doing.

1209
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,530
And I think that he could still,

1210
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:17,520
uh,

1211
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,180
kind of like,

1212
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,140
what's the word I'm looking for?

1213
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:19,411
Like,

1214
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,244
uh,

1215
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,030
uh,

1216
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,120
come out ahead and like still
come across as a good president.

1217
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:26,700
If you were to just legalize
weed at the federal level,

1218
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,780
I think most people be like,

1219
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:27,961
oh,

1220
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:28,201
okay.

1221
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:31,980
He actually did something meaningful
that will be around 50 years from now.

1222
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,001
And it's not just like,

1223
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:33,601
I'm going to tax,

1224
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:36,070
I'm going to find the shit out of you
if you don't sign up for my healthcare

1225
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,661
website.

1226
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,470
And,

1227
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:37,771
uh,

1228
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,590
I've done more drone strikes than
any other president in history.

1229
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
I've allowed NSA programs to expand and
set almost nothing in response if you

1230
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:45,820
are,

1231
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,920
even with all that shit,

1232
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:47,940
which I think is awful.

1233
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,740
Legalize weed at the federal level and
I would rate him as a good president.

1234
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,023
You're hilarious.

1235
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,771
First of all,

1236
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,150
I don't think that that's a joint.

1237
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,530
I think that picture is a cigarette.

1238
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,880
I've looked at it many times.

1239
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,530
I've studied it like
this approved or film.

1240
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,440
Let's look at it quite closely.

1241
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,040
Have you ever noticed
this when you're high,

1242
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:07,930
like everything seems to be
a reminder that your high no,

1243
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,640
because I've been getting
high longer than you son.

1244
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,360
I never hold a cigarette like that.

1245
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:15,360
He's really enjoying it.

1246
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,840
It made them slow closing on that bitch.

1247
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,820
Let's get a CSI on this one.

1248
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,340
Look how closer.

1249
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,740
Look how it's not like,

1250
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,720
like it's looks squished and
stuff and was a roll joints.

1251
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,970
Get the smoke signature and know what?

1252
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,450
Here's a,

1253
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,283
here's another,

1254
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,640
here's another uh,

1255
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,420
point.

1256
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,080
Um,

1257
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,140
look how far down he's already smoking it.

1258
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,640
He would basically be in the filter.

1259
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:38,510
If it was a cigarette.

1260
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,900
You're right.

1261
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,550
100%.

1262
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,020
Unless he wrote his own cigarette.

1263
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,100
He's a cowboy.

1264
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,980
I know dudes who do that rolled menthols.

1265
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,600
Oh wait,

1266
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,560
a black joke.

1267
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:49,394
You fuck.

1268
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,740
How dare you?

1269
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:53,510
He's the commander in chief.

1270
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,250
You're a man.

1271
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:56,084
Boy.

1272
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,800
He was the commander in chief.

1273
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,360
You son of a bitch.

1274
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,440
What is wrong?

1275
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,011
Does he smoke?

1276
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,110
Menthols cause he used to smoke.

1277
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:03,320
Right.

1278
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,300
I think Michelle made him quit cigarettes.

1279
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,960
When you're the goddamn president you
can't smoke anymore cause it's the

1280
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,810
stupidest thing people
do you think he does?

1281
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,351
Fuck yeah,

1282
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,030
he was smoking in office.

1283
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,301
His,

1284
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:17,450
at least his first term and
that job is so stressful.

1285
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:19,400
There's no way you're quitting
smoking while you're a precedent.

1286
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,821
Yeah,

1287
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:20,511
you could quit.

1288
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:23,510
You can quit if you really want it to
seem funny to think about him having a

1289
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,500
window open in the Oval
Office just puffing.

1290
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,550
Let me think of just the amount of
stress that he's going through anyway.

1291
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,230
Your cigarettes are not
going to relieve that.

1292
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,400
We kind of stress you must be going
through be the goddamn president mean your

1293
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,240
hair goes white.

1294
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,630
Yeah,

1295
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,070
well that's why I try not to be super
anti Obama because once he's gone in two

1296
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:46,360
years it's going to be somebody else and
like 98% of the shit we're complaining

1297
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:46,731
about right now,

1298
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:47,710
it will still exist.

1299
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,980
I quit smoking because
of Michelle Sweetie,

1300
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,940
six years.

1301
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,560
They do seem like a nice Kabul,

1302
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,390
like they're really do seem
like they're like each other.

1303
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:55,631
I mean,

1304
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:55,930
I don't know.

1305
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,250
People were good at bullshitting,

1306
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,700
but well it conservatives
attack her for uh,

1307
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,250
promoting eating like
healthy eating habits.

1308
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:03,521
And I'm like,

1309
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,400
of all the things of all the things
for a first lady to be doing,

1310
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,030
I think this is the best
use of big government.

1311
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,890
Like let's encourage
people to eat healthy.

1312
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,600
It's much better than spying on everybody.

1313
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,434
I don't think we should.

1314
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:14,920
Yeah.

1315
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,350
She grew a garden at the White
House growing vegetables and shit.

1316
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,541
Yeah.

1317
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,450
Sustainability and making your own food.

1318
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,284
That's good stuff.

1319
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:20,800
Yeah.

1320
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,540
I don't think anybody
can be a good president.

1321
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,900
I think the machine behind
government is too fucking big.

1322
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,460
It's like what we were talking about
about corporations and you know,

1323
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:29,840
the,

1324
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,220
the,

1325
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,320
the constant need for,

1326
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,720
we were actually talking about
it before the podcast about the,

1327
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,290
the infinite growth paradigm.

1328
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,250
The Peter Joseph always talks about these
corporations need to constantly keep

1329
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,380
growing and that's really not possible.

1330
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,790
It's really not possible.

1331
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,900
And that they,

1332
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,261
when,

1333
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:49,261
when a corporation starts acting like
that sort of money generating machine,

1334
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,880
and that's the bottom line is it always
has to continue to generate money no

1335
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,050
matter what they come up with.

1336
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:54,340
All sorts of compromises,

1337
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,600
compromise of ethics,

1338
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,920
compromises of morals,

1339
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,160
just so that they can figure out a way
to continue to raise that bottom line,

1340
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:03,430
keep that money coming in.

1341
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,740
And I think essentially
the government at one,

1342
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,110
at a certain point becomes that,

1343
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,840
I mean it's what Eisenhower warned
about when he was leaving office,

1344
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,850
the military industrial
complex taking over.

1345
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,040
And even if it's not the direct
reason why something happens,

1346
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,980
even if it wasn't a financial
reason why something,

1347
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:21,671
uh,

1348
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:21,971
why,

1349
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,650
why there is an a military action,

1350
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:28,651
why we go to war once we're there
and the money is pouring in to these

1351
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:29,740
contractors,

1352
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,250
the money is pouring into
weapons manufacturers,

1353
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:37,870
the money is pouring in the cutting
that money off and to having a

1354
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,980
justification,

1355
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,880
you're going to get resistance and they
get resistance from incredibly powerful

1356
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:47,881
people with incredibly influential
ties that have a lot of fucking money.

1357
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,690
And that is a fact.

1358
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:50,890
And that's unavoidable.

1359
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:52,630
And that's just mathematics,

1360
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,370
human nature one oh one.

1361
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,660
It's real simple.

1362
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,830
We're greedy bitches.

1363
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,510
And that's why I'm excited
about digital money because I,

1364
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,110
I honestly agree with you that this
structure like is not going to change.

1365
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,430
It's because of what you just said,

1366
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,210
that these powerful people want their
budgets to remain at least where they are

1367
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:14,410
and probably much larger in the future
because they have people on their payroll

1368
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:16,090
and they want to keep those TSA jobs.

1369
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:19,180
They want to keep those NSA analyst
job and want to buy a weekend home.

1370
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,470
So it's all,

1371
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,980
I think it's like 80% about money and uh,

1372
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,790
all this shit is funded because the
government is printing it's own money and

1373
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,860
then that's what we use as currency.

1374
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,980
And I really don't think that so that
if the issue is structural and not

1375
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,671
personality,

1376
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:35,061
in other words,

1377
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,420
like Obama's not responsible for all the
problems in this country because a lot

1378
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:39,500
of this shit started in a bush.

1379
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,030
A lot of it started under Clinton.

1380
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,380
A lot of it started under Reagan.

1381
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:43,760
A lot of it started 30 years ago.

1382
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,713
So,

1383
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,350
uh,

1384
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,850
if it's not personality driven,

1385
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,380
the problem and it's just structured,

1386
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:48,920
driven,

1387
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,100
the only way you'll see change is
to change the structure itself.

1388
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,610
And as new people come into government
that that same structure is going to keep

1389
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,720
it staying the same form.

1390
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,490
It's going to destroy
them as well because,

1391
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,210
uh,

1392
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,930
who did I,

1393
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,741
they get sucked into it.

1394
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:04,970
Like the wolf of Wall Street guy.

1395
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,331
Yeah.

1396
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:06,530
We'll just become a part of it.

1397
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:07,790
Even if you become a congressman,

1398
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,620
like you're not getting on
the important committees,

1399
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,070
you're just sitting in the back and you
have one vote out of like 450 fucking

1400
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:13,430
people.

1401
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,910
So you get on TV and you
get to have a moral voice.

1402
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,790
But in terms of changing the
direction the government goes,

1403
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,690
you don't have much say and how many
people in Congress are actually like legit

1404
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,130
young people that we can relate to?

1405
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,660
I can name two and then there's Ron Wyden
who's older but still to me seems like

1406
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,950
he's an honest guy.

1407
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,090
So I can think of three people between
the Congress and Senate who I would trust

1408
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:36,050
to actually represent,

1409
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,820
uh,

1410
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,300
like everyday people's interests.

1411
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,930
Do you think that it's even necessary to
have a government that established and

1412
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:45,440
set up the way we have it today with
representatives when there's the,

1413
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,530
the access to communication
is so instantaneous.

1414
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,120
It's like the whole idea of having a
senator or having a congress from having a

1415
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:54,290
representative is like,

1416
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:59,410
there was no way for the people to just
go and individually talk and give their

1417
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,680
opinions on things.

1418
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,640
There was no way.

1419
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:03,140
There's too many fucking people.

1420
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,980
Well,

1421
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,720
and they're too far apart from each other.

1422
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:06,380
It would take,

1423
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,561
you know,

1424
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,690
when the country was established,

1425
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:09,800
you got to literally ride an
animal across the country.

1426
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:10,070
Yeah.

1427
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,960
I mean that's the dumbest fucking idea.

1428
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,990
Could you imagine if today
everyone outlawed cars?

1429
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:15,950
We ought to ride horses.

1430
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:16,240
How,

1431
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,740
how would,

1432
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,690
and there was no more internet.

1433
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,390
How the fuck would you ever pass a law?

1434
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:20,900
How the,

1435
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,651
how would you ever,

1436
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:21,891
you know,

1437
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,940
state laws,

1438
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,500
how would you ever deal with the federal
government's influence on it would be

1439
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,520
so baffling.

1440
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,770
But I think the founding fathers,

1441
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,040
uh,

1442
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,600
we always assumed that I representative
democracy was put in a place because of

1443
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:37,940
the technical limitations that
is just like you just said,

1444
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,570
it's impossible to get everybody to d
DC to tally up where their votes would

1445
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:41,810
lie.

1446
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,000
So instead we use
representatives and we send them,

1447
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,510
right.

1448
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,650
And we assume that that's the only
reason why they chose this structure.

1449
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:49,551
And I don't think it is,

1450
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:52,220
I think part of it is that they
were terrified of dumb people.

1451
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,010
They were actually worried about mob
rule because they'd seen that happen in

1452
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:55,844
other governments.

1453
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,990
And you see it happened today,

1454
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:57,620
like Reddit,

1455
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,880
95% of the time is on top of it's shit
and is a great source of information.

1456
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,730
What about the 5% of the time where they,

1457
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,610
they find the wrong fucking suspect for
the Boston bombing and that shit goes to

1458
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,150
the front page and some guy's life is
ruined for the next six months or possibly

1459
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:11,571
forever.

1460
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:11,721
You know,

1461
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:14,030
he's never going to able to get a
job because you Google that name.

1462
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,640
First thing you see is
Boston bombing suspect.

1463
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:17,540
Even if he's cleared,

1464
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,730
you don't want to hire that person.

1465
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,140
And that's a case where like the crowd
mind fucks up and if we give everybody

1466
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,870
instant access to that to
real say in government,

1467
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,360
first of all I think it's a
good idea cause I think overall,

1468
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,110
uh,

1469
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,860
like the good wins out over the bullshit.

1470
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,820
But I'm just trying to give an example
of I think why they chose that.

1471
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,410
A representative system.

1472
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
I think you're probably right.

1473
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,940
I think that's definitely a valid point
is that there are dumb people and they

1474
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:45,410
can gather together and it gets fucking
terrifying when you're just dealing with

1475
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:46,410
the one person,

1476
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:47,244
one vote.

1477
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,330
Sort of a paradigm.

1478
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:48,750
Yeah.

1479
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,140
Um,

1480
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,430
did you see what's going on in reddit
where people are being outed as a being

1481
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:58,230
paid posters and paid shills to post
in these conspiracy theories sites?

1482
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,161
I didn't see that.

1483
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:02,370
What I saw recently is that
the technology subreddit,

1484
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:03,630
which is one of the most popular,

1485
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,890
is using a bot to
automatically filter out posts.

1486
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,330
And somebody did research and posted the
keywords that this Bot is filtering and

1487
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:13,830
it's like serious thought control.

1488
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:16,830
Like you're not allowed to publish a
headline that has the word Tesla in it.

1489
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:16,961
You know,

1490
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:20,940
like the electric car company not allowed
to have the word bitcoin not allowed

1491
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:21,660
to have the word.

1492
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:21,790
Uh,

1493
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,680
NSA,

1494
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,360
Keith Alexander,

1495
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,880
you got to look this thing up like it's,

1496
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,641
wait a minute,

1497
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,600
that's crazy.

1498
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,580
This is read it.

1499
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,100
This is the technology subright it's this
big controversy now because people are

1500
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:32,310
like,

1501
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,510
well this is fucking retarded.

1502
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,410
How could they stop that?

1503
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:36,390
Are they trying to prevent advertising?

1504
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:37,410
Like what are they trying to do?

1505
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,480
I think the original intent was to not
have the whole page filled with like

1506
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:43,650
basically the same story.

1507
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,630
I think if there's a big NSA revelation,

1508
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:48,300
you have 10 articles and
it's all the same content,

1509
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:50,880
but just like different
people saying the same thing.

1510
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,620
I think that was the original template.

1511
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,380
It's also like why don't you let read it?

1512
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,071
Do read it.

1513
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,440
Like the whole point is a
good content gets upvoted.

1514
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,820
If people aren't interested,

1515
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:00,930
they'll get rid of it on their own.

1516
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:01,710
So you don't have,

1517
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,700
it really strikes me.

1518
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:03,151
Is that Brian,

1519
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:03,984
what do you got there?

1520
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,120
Just showing why shown desk quads read it.

1521
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:06,610
I want to know who,

1522
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,200
see what he's talking about it and knowing
what the technology subreddit type in

1523
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,030
type in reddit and daily dot.

1524
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,200
And the article should come up.

1525
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,123
Yeah.

1526
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,093
Wow.

1527
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,461
That's,

1528
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:18,294
um,

1529
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,600
but it's troubling because I use very try
use that as a major source of news and

1530
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,030
I'm sure a lot of people do now.

1531
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,150
The is,

1532
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:29,280
is Tesla such a popular subject
that they had to do that.

1533
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:29,971
I mean,

1534
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:33,780
how many different articles are written
about Tesla is that they had to use that

1535
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:34,500
word.

1536
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,800
Well,

1537
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,380
the other issue is like if that's the
people are interested in this week,

1538
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,850
why don't you let that rise to the top?

1539
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,090
Like who the fuck are you to
create this false structure?

1540
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,530
Like you're not allowed
to talk about the NSA.

1541
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:46,410
Well that affects every facet of
people's technology right now.

1542
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,251
And you know,

1543
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:47,581
like it's,

1544
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:48,240
it's huge.

1545
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,470
That's insane mood.

1546
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,210
If some new news comes out,

1547
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,510
it has to do with the
Teslin NSA and you can't,

1548
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,640
you literally can't make the post.

1549
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,080
I want people to see this article.

1550
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,870
So they just know that
I'm not like making it up,

1551
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,650
but to call,

1552
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,570
they give me the title of what it is.

1553
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,080
Uh,

1554
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,550
it was an article in the daily dot.

1555
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,820
And it was like reddit
technology subreddit something.

1556
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,220
Okay.

1557
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,370
I'm just googling daily.

1558
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:14,820
Dot.

1559
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,051
Red.

1560
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:18,800
It's mods or censoring dozens
of words from our technology.

1561
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:19,330
That's,

1562
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:19,691
that's the,

1563
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:20,040
uh,

1564
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,140
say what you want about
Reddit's technology.

1565
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,561
Uh,

1566
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:25,110
one of the popular forums,

1567
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:25,430
blah,

1568
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,571
blah,

1569
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:25,870
blah.

1570
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,150
One of its most popular forums.

1571
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,340
Just don't say Nsa net neutrality,

1572
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:31,330
Comcast,

1573
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,261
bitcoin,

1574
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:37,261
or any of the roughly 50 other words
that will secretly get your post deleted.

1575
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,710
Holy Shit.

1576
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,910
Isn't that crazy?

1577
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,740
There's a bot in our slash technology
ready to delete any so called

1578
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,630
controversial headline.

1579
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,920
You try to submit.

1580
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,000
That's unbelievable.

1581
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,270
A headline about net
neutrality gets deleted.

1582
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,410
That's insane.

1583
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,581
And July read it.

1584
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,001
Dropped too.

1585
00:47:55,001 --> 00:48:00,001
Controversial subreddits are atheism
and our politics from being automatic

1586
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,730
automatic subscriptions
for new users to see that.

1587
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:04,900
So it kind of Orwellian too.

1588
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:05,320
It's like,

1589
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,390
why is politics controversial?

1590
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,900
That's a big part of why people visit
sites like Reddit is to see what's

1591
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:12,580
happening in the political world.

1592
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,541
And,

1593
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:14,020
uh,

1594
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,130
you just had Alexis on,

1595
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:15,964
right?

1596
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,690
Yes.

1597
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,210
Maybe you could email him and
try to get him to fix technology.

1598
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,991
Maybe I could.

1599
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,531
I will try,

1600
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,530
but I don't think he's involved
in the day to day anymore.

1601
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,250
What I understand this is not like
Reddit's staff doing this since these mods

1602
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,180
who are volunteers.

1603
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:29,350
And once you become a mod,

1604
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,940
it's very hard to get rid of you.

1605
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,230
And there's like no accountability.

1606
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:32,351
Like,

1607
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:33,820
we don't know who these
fucking people are.

1608
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:35,500
All we know is the actions they take.

1609
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,190
Right?

1610
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:36,761
We don't like,

1611
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:37,121
honestly,

1612
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:41,260
like how do we know that a technology
mod is not some shill for the fossil fuel

1613
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,600
industry who just doesn't want
to see Tesla rise to the top?

1614
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,434
We don't know that.

1615
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,310
Yeah.

1616
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:45,701
Yeah.

1617
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:46,300
I'm uh,

1618
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,000
emailing him right now to ask
him what the hell this is.

1619
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:49,841
It's,

1620
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:50,590
um,

1621
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,910
it doesn't make any sense.

1622
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,040
It doesn't make any sense
why they would do that.

1623
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,221
Like,

1624
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:57,070
why would you have knit net neutrality?

1625
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,791
What are you doing,

1626
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,410
dude?

1627
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,390
It's going to have to type all the
keywords into it post and try to make a

1628
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,350
thread and see what happens.

1629
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,010
Um,

1630
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:03,461
can you like,

1631
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,330
can you buy a new Tesla with bitcoin?

1632
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,693
Yeah.

1633
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,970
With the coins tower seven

1634
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,373
tower stuff.

1635
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,420
That's how you make sure that your
conversation is always logged by the NSA.

1636
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:23,040
Just close it with tower seven.

1637
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:25,763
Yeah,

1638
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,061
that's the big one,

1639
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:27,894
right?

1640
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,440
People love that one tower staff.

1641
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,160
It's a juicy one.

1642
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,940
Any conspiracy theorists that doesn't
have an opinion about tower seven,

1643
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:34,050
it's not worth his salt.

1644
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,030
You got to have an opinion.

1645
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,021
But Eddie Bravo.

1646
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:40,680
We'll fucking hold you down until you
tell him that that tower seven was a

1647
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:42,960
demolition and we'll
fucking hold you down.

1648
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,220
He doesn't,

1649
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,881
you can't say,

1650
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:45,391
I don't know.

1651
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:46,680
You would if you had to guess.

1652
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,641
I don't know.

1653
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:48,950
But if your life depended on it,

1654
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,890
does it?

1655
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,723
I don't know.

1656
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,110
I don't know.

1657
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,003
Yeah.

1658
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,180
All right.

1659
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,013
I made the threat.

1660
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,483
Did it work?

1661
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,593
It seems like it worked.

1662
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,480
It went up.

1663
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,771
We'll see.

1664
00:49:58,771 --> 00:50:00,240
How long till the Reddit Swat team,

1665
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,401
uh,

1666
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:00,920
deletes here,

1667
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,930
but it's not,

1668
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,630
it can't have is a Bot.

1669
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,973
It won't do it.

1670
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,053
What does it say?

1671
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,160
Try to submit it again.

1672
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,080
It said you're already submitted it.

1673
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,670
I don't think it's already been submitted.

1674
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,960
What did you double summit?

1675
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,201
No,

1676
00:50:13,201 --> 00:50:14,300
I just put it in cause they ask,

1677
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:14,581
you know,

1678
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:16,830
you have to put a link down so I
didn't know what to link it to.

1679
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:18,350
I'll put it link to your
website and see what,

1680
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,770
don't do that again.

1681
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,650
Trouble look into your own websites.

1682
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:24,690
Do or are you looking at Lincoln,

1683
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,800
your shit to my shit or you'll
get the podcast from reddit

1684
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
and not doing it anymore.

1685
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,220
I don't think I would email and
Alexis or onion and get to the bar.

1686
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:34,820
He was cool.

1687
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,090
Yeah.

1688
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,020
Interesting story.

1689
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,123
Cool Dude.

1690
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,660
It's funny because he's um,

1691
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,510
I think it's important to have guys like
that who are willing to speak out for

1692
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:44,510
things that are really important instead
of just taking the money and being

1693
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:44,691
like,

1694
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,360
I'm just going to go fuck
hot models and live on,

1695
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,011
you know,

1696
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:52,930
like he definitely doesn't have to be
the one telling us about SISPA and soap

1697
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:55,550
and all this stuff and
fight for the future.

1698
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:56,630
I think that's his organization.

1699
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,170
He's a young idealist who's really
smart and he figured out a way to make a

1700
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:02,090
shitload of money,

1701
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,920
came up with a cool thing and you know,

1702
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:07,220
he's kind of continuing
along that same trajectory.

1703
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:07,761
And people,

1704
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:09,350
people like me definitely noticed that.

1705
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:09,891
Like if he,

1706
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:12,950
I'm sure in 10 years he's going
to be doing even bigger stuff.

1707
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,870
And I think will respect the fact that
he spoke out when a lot of cowards that

1708
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:18,704
companies like,

1709
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,970
well,

1710
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,920
I don't need to alienate myself with
companies like big tech companies.

1711
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,990
They're are not saying shit
and we know this is wrong,

1712
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:24,980
so why don't you say something?

1713
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,631
Not only that,

1714
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:29,110
and we find out that they cooperated
with the NSA and gave him back doors to

1715
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:31,150
technology and software and it's,

1716
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:31,691
it's very,

1717
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,760
very frustrating because
you want to think about,

1718
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,650
I think that one of the unique aspects
of technology is the morality that sort

1719
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:41,410
of inherently goes with
superintelligent people.

1720
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,400
That there's so much goddamn
money in technology that people,

1721
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:45,790
well,

1722
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:45,941
Whoa,

1723
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:46,121
Whoa,

1724
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:46,301
Whoa,

1725
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:46,451
Whoa,

1726
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:46,691
Whoa,

1727
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:48,400
let's not be as greedy.

1728
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:49,510
We don't have to be as greedy.

1729
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,310
We make so much goddamn money.

1730
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,080
But think about how
much money Google makes.

1731
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,250
What's their motto?

1732
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,390
Don't be evil.

1733
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,500
I mean that's,

1734
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,500
that's like a really good model for a
giant multibillion dollar corporation and

1735
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:04,900
that's not something that
existed anywhere else.

1736
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:06,880
Like it didn't exist with clothing.

1737
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,780
It didn't exist with giant corporations
that were involved in natural resources.

1738
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,010
You never hear that.

1739
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:16,420
You never hear that kind of a model
motto attached to a gas company.

1740
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,350
Meanwhile,

1741
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,390
gas companies make more
money than anybody.

1742
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,090
This new technology and the new,

1743
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,120
the new money that's coming
out of technology is generated
by intensely creative

1744
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:32,110
and intelligent people and I think
what we're seeing from those people as

1745
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:36,490
opposed to just money grubbers people
that tried to like something that's not as

1746
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:41,491
complex as technology sort of doesn't
have the same thought process behind it.

1747
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:43,360
There's not,

1748
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,360
there's not as much
introspective thinking,

1749
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:49,120
there's not as much ethical calculations.

1750
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:54,070
It's a different way of looking at the
world that I think is being presented by

1751
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:59,071
tech companies that in my opinion is
it's very promising because I think it

1752
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:01,600
gives you a lot of hope for the future.

1753
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:05,800
When you see like this is a trend is
a very obvious trend in my opinion,

1754
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:06,730
that these,

1755
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,450
these guys are more ethical and
more moral and more conscious.

1756
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,800
It's more globally conscious.

1757
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,760
It's a more optimistic view of the world.

1758
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:18,820
And I think if you're a recent person
entering the workforce for the first time

1759
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:20,330
and you're looking at jobs online,

1760
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:25,290
really hold out and don't go for the
shitty defense contractor that you know is

1761
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,220
doing evil stuff.

1762
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,060
Go instead for the company that
is creating cool apps or you know,

1763
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,390
creating new efficiencies and payments
or whatever it is that you're interested

1764
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:33,990
in.

1765
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,480
Do that instead because technology,

1766
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,420
um,

1767
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,730
can go on so many different directions.

1768
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,760
You don't want to be the person creating
the marketing for the next like fucking

1769
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,660
range of drones.

1770
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:44,880
You want to be the person
working at Google or uh,

1771
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,680
or even Microsoft and just creating better
search because even things like that

1772
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,090
create more of a positive
impact on humanity than I
think almost anything else.

1773
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,160
And I think that the rest of the world
is slowly but surely forcing America to

1774
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:02,880
catch the fuck up on a lot of
our archaic shit like Canada,

1775
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,380
Canada just released all
limitations on prostitution.

1776
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,251
They just said,

1777
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:09,084
stop.

1778
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,320
Who Cares?

1779
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,900
Is that like the Rob Ford
Act of 2014 you know,

1780
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:13,734
that's crap.

1781
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,150
The cracks now,

1782
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,550
legal American smoke at an
office and still stay there.

1783
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,810
He's a phenomenal being.

1784
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:21,450
I was watching some of his
fat guy that does blow.

1785
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:22,830
What's phenomenal about that?

1786
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:24,660
And he became mayor of Toronto.

1787
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,200
I,

1788
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,070
it's crazy.

1789
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:26,581
Yeah,

1790
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:28,110
it's amazing that he's still mayor.

1791
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:28,771
That's don't,

1792
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:32,580
don't you have to do debates or something
like they don't realize that he's

1793
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,020
crazy right away.

1794
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,171
Well,

1795
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,730
how the fuck that Bush get in office?

1796
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,211
You know what I mean?

1797
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:37,740
People like people that are like them.

1798
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,320
There's a lot of fat coke
heads out there in Toronto,

1799
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:40,540
I guess.

1800
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,310
So they're there,

1801
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,001
but there's not,

1802
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:42,520
you know,

1803
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,830
Toronto's an amazing spot.

1804
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:44,910
It's really powerful.

1805
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:45,511
A financial,

1806
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:47,460
I don't that up to get us
pulled down from youtube.

1807
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,580
Every time we put a
youtube clip up these days,

1808
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:51,780
we're getting fucking pulled down.

1809
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,430
But the other thing that's cool about the,

1810
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:53,641
uh,

1811
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:55,290
the tech world is that they're very,

1812
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,124
um,

1813
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,140
they hold nothing sacred.

1814
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,610
So in the 90s,

1815
00:54:59,611 --> 00:54:59,821
they're like,

1816
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,410
we're gonna reinvent communication.

1817
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:05,400
And they did that with email and
instant messenger and then all the more

1818
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:09,270
advanced shit that came after like
social media and now they've turned their

1819
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,560
eyes to money and they're like,

1820
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,430
we're going to reinvent money,

1821
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:15,450
were no longer happy with a massaging
the balls of these credit card companies

1822
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,340
and getting a small fee in return.

1823
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:20,220
We want to own the whole
process from start to finish.

1824
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,840
And we want it to be faster.

1825
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,470
We don't want to get clearance from
credit card companies before we change our

1826
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:28,800
marketing or our design and we
just wouldn't have total freedom.

1827
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:29,041
You know,

1828
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:29,880
it's the same with like,

1829
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,163
um,

1830
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,340
with what Google does,

1831
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:35,490
they don't really ask for permission
before indexing your site.

1832
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,640
They just do it right.

1833
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,390
And I think that's a really
positive force in the world.

1834
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,050
Like a who is,

1835
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,140
it says like do it and
then ask permission later.

1836
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,260
Like obviously that um,

1837
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,850
it's some like business guru,

1838
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:49,140
I forget who it was,

1839
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,750
but it's either like Branson
or somebody like that.

1840
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:52,740
I just read it recently.

1841
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,053
Uh,

1842
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,030
but I think that's a great mindset and
it's so much better than the government

1843
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,700
mindset of are you following
all the regulations?

1844
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:03,360
Like it was never supposed
to be the American way that
the first thing you think

1845
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,190
about is what is the
government going to think.

1846
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,880
It's better to ask for forgiveness or
beg for forgiveness than to ask for

1847
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:09,714
permission.

1848
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,673
That's it.

1849
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:11,430
Um,

1850
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,390
I think that that's all well and good
except for environmental concerns.

1851
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:15,601
Oh,

1852
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:15,990
I,

1853
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,800
I totally,

1854
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,850
the real issue is,

1855
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:18,630
you know,

1856
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,530
when people do things and they don't
ask and then you deal with the cleanup.

1857
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,461
We,

1858
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:23,980
we agree

1859
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,550
as a society to play this game where
the individual can be enriched if you're

1860
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,150
smart.

1861
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,910
And that game is capitalism and we
continue to play it because it's more

1862
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:32,110
efficient than anything else.

1863
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,530
But I think you do need
to have referees who say,

1864
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:35,831
okay,

1865
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:38,530
so we're playing this game where you can
make a lot of money if you do something

1866
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:39,970
that's more efficient than anybody else.

1867
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:40,840
So you do it cooler,

1868
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:41,710
you do it faster.

1869
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,530
But if you're fucking
up a shared resource,

1870
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,780
then that's what the government
steps in and tells you,

1871
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:50,290
you can't do this and you have to pay
this and you have to fix this because,

1872
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,453
uh,

1873
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:51,910
the,

1874
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,920
the environment is not
owned by corporations.

1875
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,860
It's actually owned by citizens of the
United States and it's owned by citizens

1876
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:57,530
of,

1877
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,290
of a whatever country you happen to be in,

1878
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,670
like your land is your land.

1879
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,800
And we all have the shared air.

1880
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:03,940
We all have shared oceans.

1881
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:07,660
Like what happens in Japan with their
fucked up nuclear reactors affects the

1882
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:08,920
Sushi here in Los Angeles,

1883
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:09,790
at least in theory.

1884
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,710
So we have to have a more global mindset.

1885
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:13,750
I know net right now just
by saying global mindset,

1886
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,570
they're at least 10 people saying
that I'm like a Bilderberg,

1887
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,030
a one world order shill or something,

1888
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:22,840
but really like it's fucking stupid
to not go more global when everything

1889
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:23,674
already is.

1890
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,720
It's like right now we're
already global society,

1891
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,350
but we allow corporations
to take advantage of the
loopholes and pretend like

1892
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:30,220
we're not global.

1893
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,240
Why don't we get rid of that?

1894
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,471
Well,

1895
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:32,771
uh,

1896
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:37,771
I think that if the Internet
continues its path right now,

1897
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:42,420
the path that we're on right now
of the distribution of information,

1898
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,960
of connecting everybody together,

1899
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,650
it's going to see more and more
ridiculous that there's nations.

1900
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:51,220
It's going to see more and more ridiculous
that there's places that are lines in

1901
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,660
the dirt that you can't cross through.

1902
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:53,231
I mean,

1903
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:54,070
it's just weird.

1904
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,000
It's weird.

1905
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:56,020
It's a weird concept.

1906
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:56,891
It's weird.

1907
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,140
If there was fences over each state,

1908
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,460
that would be intolerable.

1909
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:00,820
Right.

1910
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,790
But that's not much different
than fences over countries.

1911
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:07,720
We just decide that it's different and
I think that as we connect with each

1912
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,800
other more and more in the idea of
nations become more and more ridiculous,

1913
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:12,670
then the ideas of,

1914
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,910
oh like this place owns the resources.

1915
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:16,960
Like if Ohio,

1916
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,140
we had all pay Ohio because that's
where all the water came from.

1917
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:20,974
But like what?

1918
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,430
Like [inaudible] just cause
you're in the right patch of dirt,

1919
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,810
you don't want the water from Ohio.

1920
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,700
He probably gets Badwater herpes water.

1921
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,513
Sure.

1922
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,511
Yeah.

1923
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:32,350
You've done tests.

1924
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,713
Um,

1925
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,690
but you know,

1926
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,190
I think that what we're,

1927
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:38,170
we're saying makes sense.

1928
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,560
Ultimately like from an
objective standpoint,

1929
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:44,830
it's just that the system that's in
place is not an objective system.

1930
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:46,540
It's not a rational system.

1931
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,190
It's a system that runs on momentum.

1932
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:52,680
Well that that's again why the digital
money thing I think is the first step and

1933
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:56,460
actually changing this system because
the structure will stay the same.

1934
00:58:56,461 --> 00:58:59,070
If we continue to do all the
same stuff 100 years from now,

1935
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:03,470
we'll still have countries and passports
and drones and all the rest of this

1936
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:03,691
shit.

1937
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:07,350
The only way is to like rethink really
fundamental parts of what we're doing.

1938
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,170
And if we do that it,

1939
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,170
it just changes where the money comes
from and it reallocates it to better

1940
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:13,561
things.

1941
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:17,940
I think that individuals are better
deciders of how to spend money then a

1942
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:18,840
government agency.

1943
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:19,711
No,

1944
00:59:19,711 --> 00:59:20,544
I think you're right.

1945
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:20,990
Um,

1946
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,520
I think the government agencies,

1947
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,850
the problem with them is that
it's just a bunch of people,

1948
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,240
right?

1949
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,451
You know,

1950
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:28,940
the prop calling something to
government then giving it power.

1951
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:33,170
You just giving power to people over
people and there are certain point time

1952
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:37,580
people need kind of figure out what they
want to give other people power over.

1953
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,031
You know,

1954
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:40,280
do you want to give people
power over your sex life?

1955
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,560
Do you want to give people
power over your diet?

1956
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,120
When New York comes along and says,

1957
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:45,860
you can't have big gulps anymore,

1958
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,060
and everybody just goes,

1959
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:47,721
okay,

1960
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:48,171
well hey,

1961
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,010
fuck you.

1962
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,761
No,

1963
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:52,490
you can't tell me what kind
of soda I can drink dummy.

1964
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,820
If I want to drink a 35 ounce
soda or whatever the hell it is.

1965
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:56,990
Why do you care?

1966
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,550
I buy a 30 ounce soda.

1967
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,070
How about I go to the store
and I get a one leader?

1968
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,130
I get a big giant one liter
bottle and I drank it.

1969
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:04,964
Fuck you.

1970
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,090
You can't tell me what
to eat or what to drink.

1971
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:07,420
What,

1972
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,870
what kind of nonsense is that?

1973
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,010
Have you covered all the bases?

1974
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:12,050
If you solved all the burglaries,

1975
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,970
have you solved all the rape cases?

1976
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:14,241
If it didn't,

1977
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:16,730
then shut the fuck up
and leave the soda alone.

1978
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:16,950
Well,

1979
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,810
that's my issue with the whole
healthcare.gov thing too,

1980
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:20,380
is like,

1981
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:20,741
okay,

1982
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:21,760
so if it's so good,

1983
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:24,820
people should want to sign up for
it and you should incentivize them.

1984
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,070
You should advertise it as you're doing,

1985
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,500
but you shouldn't make
it a requirement in the,

1986
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,041
it shouldn't be like,

1987
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:32,080
we're going to find the shit
out of you if you don't sign up.

1988
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:32,920
And by the way,

1989
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,660
every year the fine gets bigger.

1990
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,100
That's like some kind of harassment,

1991
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:37,030
psychological shit,

1992
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:37,181
right?

1993
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:38,440
Like 1% this year,

1994
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:39,460
2% next year.

1995
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,300
Like are you a child?

1996
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:40,481
You know,

1997
01:00:40,481 --> 01:00:41,231
like what is that?

1998
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:42,760
It should be totally voluntary.

1999
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:43,571
And,

2000
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:44,290
uh,

2001
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:44,811
I got my,

2002
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:45,340
um,

2003
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,900
I got my foot infected recently.

2004
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,850
I had a blister and got infected.

2005
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,901
And uh,

2006
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:54,901
I went to one of those walking clinics
and it was $79 for the visit and I didn't

2007
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:55,961
see a doctor.

2008
01:00:55,961 --> 01:00:57,070
It was like an RN or something.

2009
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,350
Cause for just the gross for some dudes,

2010
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,460
gross foot blister,

2011
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,950
you don't need a neurosurgeon,

2012
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:02,890
you don't have to pay a lot of money.

2013
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:05,020
She looked at it and
about 30 seconds she goes,

2014
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:05,291
Oh yeah,

2015
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,550
I'm going to prescribe you Catholics.

2016
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:07,571
She prescribes it.

2017
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:08,950
I'm taking it every six hours.

2018
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:12,460
My infection has gone now and just
have to take for the next few days as a

2019
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,294
preventative thing.

2020
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,313
And uh,

2021
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,350
that prescription with
no insurance was $20.

2022
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,450
So my whole visit was $100.

2023
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,640
I didn't cost taxpayers anything.

2024
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,780
I didn't cost,

2025
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,673
uh,

2026
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,461
myself,

2027
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:26,020
anything beyond that hundred dollar visit.

2028
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,041
Why can't we do that?

2029
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,420
Why can't it just be a product you buy?

2030
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:29,200
Like anything else?

2031
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,321
Well,

2032
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:32,320
don't you think that what happens is
exactly what we're talking about before

2033
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,110
you're dealing with a corporation is
trying to make a shitload of money.

2034
01:01:35,111 --> 01:01:37,570
They pay a lot of money to
get a politician into office.

2035
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:38,410
The lobby,

2036
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:39,880
the special interest groups,

2037
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:41,080
finance campaigns,

2038
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:41,920
they get them in,

2039
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,401
okay,

2040
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:43,450
he's our guy now.

2041
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:44,560
He wants to do Obamacare.

2042
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:45,040
Okay,

2043
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,730
let's attach this fucking compassionate
care act or whatever the hell you want

2044
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:49,350
to call it.

2045
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,183
Name it name.

2046
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:50,650
We're gonna.

2047
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,300
We're gonna make more money this way.

2048
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,010
This way we're going to
force people to buy way.

2049
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:54,221
Hey,

2050
01:01:54,221 --> 01:01:56,340
we're going to have more of a
subscription in my more of this

2051
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,041
dumb people out there.

2052
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:01,430
Wonder why the insurance companies were
so supportive of what was supposed to be

2053
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,080
a huge reform of their industry.

2054
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,160
It's because in exchange,

2055
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:04,731
Obama is like,

2056
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:08,300
you're going to have a captive audience
of every single citizen is now required

2057
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:09,200
to buy your product.

2058
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:09,411
It's like,

2059
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:12,980
what do you think would happen to the
price of iPhones if you were required by

2060
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,870
law to have one on you at all times?

2061
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,330
The opposite is socialized medicine.

2062
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:19,160
It's is it's like a disgusting,

2063
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,780
like sort of a twist on that system.

2064
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,230
Like the idea that the government
or that the people's taxes,

2065
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,060
like all the money that
we pay in California,

2066
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:28,410
this 10% tax thing,

2067
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,393
state tax,

2068
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,490
if that went to pre health care,

2069
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:35,400
I would be super supportive of it if we
found out that the reason why California

2070
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:39,120
pay state taxes is that everybody who
lives in state tax in California rather

2071
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,170
has free health care.

2072
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:40,891
I'd be like,

2073
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,060
that's fantastic.

2074
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,590
I'd be happy to give up a sizeable chunk
of my income if I knew that people were

2075
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,230
being taken

2076
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:47,771
are on every,

2077
01:02:47,771 --> 01:02:48,070
everybody,

2078
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,680
everybody graduates from high
school and they're not a retard.

2079
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:51,341
When they graduate,

2080
01:02:51,341 --> 01:02:53,110
they know something about
the political world.

2081
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:54,010
They know something about,

2082
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:55,030
uh,

2083
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,350
they take a psychology class.

2084
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,940
They don't become some psycho shooter.

2085
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,190
They understand things
about their own psychology.

2086
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,570
I would be in favor of that.

2087
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:02,890
I'd be in favor of school system.

2088
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,120
It's not completely broken.

2089
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:04,481
Well,

2090
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,314
it's also

2091
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,170
cool system that's manageable
as far as the numbers.

2092
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,020
When you're a teacher and you've
got 40 kids in your class,

2093
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,570
there's no way you can give
them individual attention.

2094
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:14,470
There's no way.

2095
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,513
Our class

2096
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,170
rethink keeping 40,

2097
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:17,920
uh,

2098
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,360
hormonally charged kids in a room for
eight hours a day sitting in chairs.

2099
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:24,910
We've got to rethink that whole paradigm
cause you could do is everybody has an

2100
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:25,600
Ipad,

2101
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,750
you read that day's assignment and once
a week you all meet up at a fucking

2102
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:29,584
Starbucks.

2103
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:33,490
And if you have any questions than
the person who's like your ra or ta or

2104
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:34,030
whatever,

2105
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:34,241
it's like,

2106
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:34,601
okay,

2107
01:03:34,601 --> 01:03:34,811
yeah,

2108
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,950
here's how you solve this one.

2109
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,120
And then a lot of it could
be collaborative online
and not have a school where

2110
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:41,140
they show up at school,

2111
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,400
basically just not have a school.

2112
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:42,751
And then you,

2113
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:43,270
you,

2114
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,930
you limit the risk of some psycho coming
to the school and blowing people away.

2115
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,640
You limit the cost and you
could still have like a school,

2116
01:03:49,641 --> 01:03:52,930
you can still have like a gym and a
shared area for people to hang out and

2117
01:03:52,931 --> 01:03:53,764
discuss stuff.

2118
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:56,440
But why do you need to trap people
in a building eight hours a day?

2119
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,371
Well,

2120
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:57,850
I

2121
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:58,930
point in some ways,

2122
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:02,440
but in other ways that's like a really
valuable time for learning human

2123
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:03,240
interaction.

2124
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,541
No.

2125
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:03,901
Yeah.

2126
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,030
I mean I think people are already like,

2127
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:06,864
uh,

2128
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,500
Asperger's as burglary enough without,

2129
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:10,861
yeah,

2130
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:12,720
with x boxes and internet connections.

2131
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,730
You'd never have to go outside
and interact with people.

2132
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,630
Amazon prime,

2133
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:16,620
you just shit delivered.

2134
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:19,590
We kind of want to keep people
as connected as possible.

2135
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,420
Now that that's a valid point and a,

2136
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:22,140
I'm just kind of,

2137
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:22,920
when they're young,

2138
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,820
we're thinking out loud,

2139
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,840
but there's,

2140
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,720
there's some validation to it too.

2141
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:27,440
I mean,

2142
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,440
I think the idea isn't that it would
necessarily keep people from interacting

2143
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:34,160
with each other.

2144
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,160
What it would do is keep people from being
forced to be slaves to a system stuck

2145
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:42,080
in a box learning 50 in a class,

2146
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:43,850
one unmotivated teacher.

2147
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,830
Totally ineffective way of going about it.

2148
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,120
But the,

2149
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:47,361
the,

2150
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:50,540
the big thing about school
is that social interaction.

2151
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,250
It's where you learn how to talk to girls.

2152
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,140
It's where you weren't learning clicks.

2153
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,430
It's where you learn,

2154
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:55,970
you know,

2155
01:04:55,970 --> 01:05:00,050
how to deal with negative
and positive influences.

2156
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,790
There's a lot to be learned in school
other than just the stuff that they cheat

2157
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,620
you just interacting with each other.

2158
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:06,690
Uh,

2159
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:07,580
forms the basis,

2160
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:11,120
like the framework of how we interact
when we get into the workplace.

2161
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:11,601
Yeah.

2162
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:11,931
And you need,

2163
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:13,760
your brain needs that development.

2164
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,310
Well,

2165
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:14,681
I think that,

2166
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:15,260
you know,

2167
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,380
otherwise you're dealing with wild people.

2168
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,370
Just wild

2169
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,330
people that have never,

2170
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:23,140
and then you're going to have to try to
hire those people and get them to be in

2171
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:24,310
your cubicle all day.

2172
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,170
It's like a cat that
hasn't been domesticated.

2173
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:26,951
Exactly.

2174
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:28,300
You ever have a feral cat?

2175
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,440
You ever have a feral cat?

2176
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,161
I've never had one,

2177
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:33,040
but I've interacted with them before
and they just do whatever they want.

2178
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:33,290
Yeah.

2179
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,720
I had a feral cat I couldn't eat.

2180
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,720
I was the only one who could pick him up
if anybody else tried to pick them up.

2181
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,920
Even if I picked on beat.

2182
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:39,763
Yes.

2183
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,821
And then I pick him up.

2184
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:42,190
But he would relax once I,

2185
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:43,870
once I started petting me per like crazy,

2186
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,460
like you're not trying to kill him,

2187
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,600
but he was a constant freak out.

2188
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:47,980
Yeah.

2189
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,070
You're going to get a little bit
of that mingling and there's that.

2190
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:54,850
It also not gonna be able to pick out
the psychosis is easy if you're not

2191
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,940
constantly like looking at like
Billy's bringing skin cats to school.

2192
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,640
Like I'm maybe we should sit down with
his fucking parents and find out what's

2193
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:01,474
going on with Billy.

2194
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,410
Yeah,

2195
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,970
see it common well here,

2196
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:09,030
there was this story recently of some
guy who shot up a synagogue I think and

2197
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:11,370
the most recent guy and I said,

2198
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:11,860
yeah,

2199
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,670
I read the,

2200
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:16,990
I read the article and it was like he
had been saying for awhile like I want to

2201
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:21,280
kill Jews and if somebody is literally
thinking the same things as Hitler,

2202
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,540
like maybe,

2203
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,330
maybe somebody should take note of
that and bring that guy in for a

2204
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:26,590
psychological evaluation.

2205
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,590
You have a little sit down with homeboy
and find out how serious he is about

2206
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:30,424
this project.

2207
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,760
Yeah.

2208
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,860
And since the NSA has already
logging in large stuff,

2209
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:35,800
maybe you check his credit card records
that he just bide gone last week.

2210
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:38,560
You know like then you have correlation
and that's where I think this stuff

2211
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,560
could actually be useful instead
of just expensive bullshit.

2212
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:42,161
Let's see here.

2213
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:42,911
He's maxed out.

2214
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:45,160
He bought 300 copies of mine count.

2215
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,290
Yeah.

2216
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,430
Might want to pay him a visit.

2217
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,860
Might want to sit down and talk
about why it needs all that ammo.

2218
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,053
Hello.

2219
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,950
Oh there's no way they can keep track.

2220
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:57,610
That's the thing about people monitoring
people's cell phones and shit and all

2221
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:58,390
that stuff.

2222
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,830
The idea that they're all there.

2223
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,650
There's someone assigned to David
Seaman listening to every call.

2224
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,820
It's hilarious.

2225
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,170
Yeah,

2226
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,880
it's truly hilarious cause the
amount of data you're talking about,

2227
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:09,040
it's fucking staggering for one person.

2228
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,200
Even how fast we browse the Internet now.

2229
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,000
Like I'll be on a website
for about eight seconds,

2230
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:15,130
like click like seven other tabs.

2231
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:15,600
You know,

2232
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,060
it's,

2233
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:16,990
it's a lot of data.

2234
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:17,980
It's too much.

2235
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,080
If you look at your own history and
you're trying to look at your own history

2236
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,920
cause you're trying to look for a website
that you saw that you forgot to book

2237
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,500
mark,

2238
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,710
you go through your own history like Ah,

2239
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,570
so much the amount of shit that we're
exposed to today as opposed to our

2240
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:34,270
grandparents is just unbelievable.

2241
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,980
It's unbelievable for the mind.

2242
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,570
I would love to see if they could go
back in time and take a a guy from the 19

2243
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:45,571
hundreds like 1919 take him and put
electrodes on his brain and find out like

2244
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:47,110
what kind of,

2245
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,690
what gets stimulated during a regular day,

2246
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,670
regular eight hour day.

2247
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,820
And then take a guy
from 2014 in Manhattan,

2248
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,720
same,

2249
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,051
you know,

2250
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:59,950
same program running on his brain and
find out what's going on in his brain.

2251
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:05,220
I bet one of them looks like a firefly
buzzing around a campfire and the other

2252
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:07,000
one looks like a fireworks display,

2253
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,960
like the grand finale at Disneyland.

2254
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,730
Just don't judge,

2255
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,070
don't judge on the amount of information,

2256
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,800
just slamming into your fucking synapses.

2257
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,830
It's just we're not designed
for this man were not designed.

2258
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:23,090
So I think part of what we're doing when
we're trying to manage civilization is

2259
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:23,350
we're,

2260
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:28,350
we're trying to catch up to all this
shit that's happened that's been erupting

2261
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:30,110
all around us.

2262
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:30,381
We were like,

2263
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:34,940
give that and then then there's
this and then fuck and ha ha ha.

2264
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,580
Well the,

2265
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,990
that's how the government's been
responding to bitcoin recently.

2266
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,824
It's like a,

2267
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,170
if you look at an Internet
meme of a dumb dog,

2268
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:47,230
like some dumb oblivious dog governments
and like some of these big vested banks

2269
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:50,810
that have been around forever
are on the railroad tracks.

2270
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,950
This dumb ass dog looking
at a train coming in their
direction and they're like,

2271
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,690
is this something that's
going to affect me?

2272
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,070
It's like,

2273
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,010
and it's not just any train.

2274
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,350
It's fucking bullet train
moving at 350 miles an hour.

2275
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:02,420
And whenever that train hits the dog,

2276
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,770
it's not even going to feel it.

2277
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:07,340
It's going to be just an explosion
of disgusting flesh and for,

2278
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,130
but that's what they're at right
now is a combination of curiosity,

2279
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,290
a bit of animosity and like,

2280
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,910
how is this going to affect us?

2281
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:14,380
It's,

2282
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:17,240
it's like it'd be like record
companies looking at Napster and going,

2283
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,470
this is interesting.

2284
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,450
Is this going to affect
our bottom line at all?

2285
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,240
What's also the,

2286
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,880
the just the sheer amount of different
things that you would have to pay

2287
01:09:24,881 --> 01:09:25,451
attention to,

2288
01:09:25,451 --> 01:09:26,650
to truly manage.

2289
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,070
Yeah.

2290
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:32,070
I like the idea of being a president in
1919 was a really rational idea that you

2291
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:36,450
could have a guy who had managed our
budget and the military and this guy

2292
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,320
assigned to defense,

2293
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,220
and this is,

2294
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:39,940
you know,

2295
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:44,860
but in 2014 good God damn luck.

2296
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,240
There's too many things.

2297
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:50,860
There's no way any one person has their
finger on the pulse of all these things.

2298
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,120
It's like someone says to you,

2299
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,040
hey man,

2300
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,110
what do you think about what's
going on at the Bundy ranch?

2301
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:55,360
Like,

2302
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,530
I don't fucking know,

2303
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,150
like what's going on at the Bundy ranch?

2304
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,110
I can't know.

2305
01:09:59,260 --> 01:09:59,740
It doesn't,

2306
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,251
ah,

2307
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:01,240
you fucking Shill,

2308
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:01,611
you know,

2309
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:04,340
like you can't know everything there.

2310
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,360
Every day there's a hundred new stories
that have huge implications to our

2311
01:10:10,811 --> 01:10:11,441
society,

2312
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,251
to our world,

2313
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,840
to the way we progress.

2314
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,430
Like where are we going in the future?

2315
01:10:15,431 --> 01:10:17,290
Is it going to be
affected by these events,

2316
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,220
by these decisions,

2317
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:19,210
by these technologies?

2318
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,710
Every day there's a hundred of them.

2319
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,580
And every day everyone has to try to
pay attention to as many of them as you

2320
01:10:24,581 --> 01:10:25,210
can.

2321
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,590
And there's a new hundred tomorrow.

2322
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:27,543
Good luck.

2323
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,090
Yeah.

2324
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:28,570
And it's,

2325
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:29,680
and it's exponential.

2326
01:10:29,681 --> 01:10:31,510
So a year from now,

2327
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,740
10 years from now,

2328
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,360
it's going to be unrecognizable.

2329
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:38,170
There's going to be so much information
coming at you on a daily basis and the

2330
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:40,060
changes will be so rapid.

2331
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,610
It's almost unpredictable when you,

2332
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,310
when we try to look at the
idea of exponential growth.

2333
01:10:45,311 --> 01:10:48,460
Like I talked to Ray Kurzweil about
that and he was talking to me about the

2334
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:50,080
criticisms that he's,

2335
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:50,800
um,

2336
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,860
he's been given about this
idea of the singularity,

2337
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:54,431
about,

2338
01:10:54,431 --> 01:10:54,760
um,

2339
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,960
technological singularity that there's
going to be some sort of a technology

2340
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:03,670
that's so groundbreaking that it changes
humanity in reality as we know it and

2341
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,020
it's probably right around the corner.

2342
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,130
I agree with that actually.

2343
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,340
I agree with it too and I'm too
stupid to understand all of it.

2344
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,230
But when he describes it,

2345
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,880
when he describes exponential,

2346
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:15,600
then you really wrap your
head around it like that.

2347
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,250
It doesn't matter that it
took a hundred years to make,

2348
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:20,910
you know,

2349
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,340
this machine after that machine was made.

2350
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,930
What matters is once a technology is born,

2351
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:33,150
then technology's branch off of
that at an incredibly rapid rate.

2352
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,910
And as new technologies come in,

2353
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:39,840
it makes it easier for new
innovation to be established as well.

2354
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,850
And then it just swarms and it gets
this incredible frenzy where it's

2355
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:48,390
unpredictable as far as like
how fast it's going to go.

2356
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,950
And he thinks it's like 20,

2357
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:50,784
49.

2358
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,320
That's what his opinion is.

2359
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,670
His opinion and his studying all of
these different graphs and looking at the

2360
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,570
exponential growth of technology is
trying to figure out like when it's all

2361
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:01,590
going to come to a head.

2362
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,060
But even he's his guessing.

2363
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:03,961
No one really knows.

2364
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:07,590
There might be some new thing that comes
out next month at of Finland that no

2365
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:08,401
one saw coming.

2366
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:10,500
That changes a whole fucking ball of wax.

2367
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:11,850
And it's,

2368
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,040
it's really weird

2369
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,760
I think about too because it's like
if you have this truly artificially

2370
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:17,660
intelligent thing,

2371
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:20,750
they can access all the world's
information like we can with Google,

2372
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:21,920
uh,

2373
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,740
and it can make its own decisions
and has its own kind of sovereignty,

2374
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,740
then it doesn't have sexual motivation.

2375
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:30,950
So it's not even necessarily interested
in looking good or making money.

2376
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,440
It doesn't have like
mortality motivation cause it,

2377
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:35,990
if it backs up it's intelligence,

2378
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:37,160
I could probably live forever.

2379
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:37,880
Right.

2380
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,830
So what motivates it to do anything?

2381
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:40,591
Yeah,

2382
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:41,730
there's no motivation.

2383
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,630
That's an interesting thing.

2384
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:46,440
People are worried that robots will take
over and artificial intelligence will

2385
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:46,860
dominate it.

2386
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,660
It might just be a command line and like
you type anything into it and it tells

2387
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:51,490
you the answer or how it helps you out,

2388
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:55,660
but it has just no interest in
either harming humanity or helping us

2389
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,190
unless it's a program that way.

2390
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,331
The problem,

2391
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:04,331
the real issue with
artificial intelligence is
if someone is so compelled to

2392
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:09,260
create an artificial human being and gives
us all of the components that a human

2393
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:09,801
being has,

2394
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,090
all the flaws as well,

2395
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,500
emotions,

2396
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:13,880
all the jealousy,

2397
01:13:13,881 --> 01:13:15,050
all the nonsense,

2398
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:15,913
that'd be very bad.

2399
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:16,221
Well,

2400
01:13:16,221 --> 01:13:17,480
if they don't have that,

2401
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,250
then are they not a psychopath?

2402
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,450
That's the problem.

2403
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:20,811
I mean,

2404
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:24,770
are you creating a complete psycho
with no remorse and no compassion?

2405
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:28,100
If you create an artificial person
that's ruthlessly intelligent,

2406
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:32,360
but it's not concerned whatsoever about
pain and suffering and what if it's so

2407
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:33,770
smart that it recognizes,

2408
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:33,981
hey,

2409
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:34,670
look,

2410
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,210
people don't live forever anyway.

2411
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,910
Like this is a moot point.

2412
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:39,980
Like they're gonna die of old age,

2413
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:41,810
which is one of the worst ways to go.

2414
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,790
The last few years of your life,

2415
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:48,100
your body's going to break down to the
point you were ready to die because it's

2416
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:49,550
sucks to be alive.

2417
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,890
Like what's better that or we just eat
them and use them for fuel to make a much

2418
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:56,420
better race of robot,

2419
01:13:56,421 --> 01:13:58,790
artificial intelligent things
that don't get jealous.

2420
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,940
The matrix basically if that,

2421
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:02,803
I mean,

2422
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,711
you know,

2423
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:08,711
I think that we're probably at least on
the verge of a new member of our that

2424
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:16,120
we're going to have to consider
at the least if not our overlords.

2425
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,553
I think this,

2426
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,820
this idea of artificial intelligence
is completely unavoidable.

2427
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:25,360
It's just as unavoidable as the moment
that the guy figured out a wagon wheel

2428
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:27,640
and the other guy figured out
an engine and he started going,

2429
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:28,474
Huh,

2430
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,493
Huh,

2431
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:30,603
Huh.

2432
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,850
If we put that in there and get
something to make those things,

2433
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,260
how would you get the wheels to spin?

2434
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:35,980
Um,

2435
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,200
we need like a thing they're
like connects to the,

2436
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:40,960
and the injury was the engine making fire.

2437
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:41,390
Yeah.

2438
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,131
Burns shit.

2439
01:14:42,131 --> 01:14:42,800
We've got to get it bro.

2440
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,633
Cause Burns gas.

2441
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:45,820
So we got to get a tank
that holds the gas.

2442
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,690
It's inevitable.

2443
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,600
It was just a matter of time before
someone pieced all those things together.

2444
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,820
When you're dealing with
artificial intelligence,

2445
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,960
like you know,

2446
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,030
I mean even as simplistic form of it,

2447
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:55,864
like Siri,

2448
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,970
Siri's a form of artificial intelligence.

2449
01:14:57,971 --> 01:14:58,810
It's a database.

2450
01:14:58,811 --> 01:14:59,120
It's a,

2451
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
it asks you ask it questions,

2452
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,380
it provides you with the answers.

2453
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,390
That's a form of something.

2454
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,100
Doing some calculations.

2455
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,170
When that starts becoming more and
more complex and then they decide,

2456
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:11,920
hey,

2457
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,810
we want to recreate a human being.

2458
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,370
Let's recreate memories.

2459
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:16,960
We're going to program memories.

2460
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,640
We're going to take someone's,

2461
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,121
you know,

2462
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:19,870
we're going to take.

2463
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,270
What we did is we
decided to take memories,

2464
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,300
generic memories from happy people,

2465
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,660
ages one through 60 and just
create a 60 year old professor,

2466
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:36,040
an artificial guy who's lived a long life
of wisdom and we're going to have him

2467
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,840
interact with people just
to blow their fucking minds.

2468
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,711
And meanwhile,

2469
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:38,951
you know,

2470
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,641
someone tells him,

2471
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:42,640
you know that they made you just
a week ago and he starts crying.

2472
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:43,480
What about my children?

2473
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,351
They don't exist.

2474
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:45,184
Whoa.

2475
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:47,170
Where'd my daughter was at her wedding.

2476
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:47,921
It didn't happen.

2477
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:48,641
It never happened.

2478
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:49,480
You're a week old.

2479
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,680
Oh,

2480
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:54,070
we watched some fake 60 year
old cry and then cut his throat.

2481
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:54,911
He reaches in,

2482
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:57,780
grabs on those straight
razors from dollar shave done.

2483
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,160
Fucking pointless because he realizes
it sparks come flying out and then he

2484
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:04,780
really freaks out and somebody goes,

2485
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,651
there's no blood.

2486
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:07,830
Somebody posts that article
of the technology subreddit,

2487
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,590
but it's instantly a removed and someone
comes in and kicks his head off and

2488
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:12,071
yells out.

2489
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:15,430
Worldstar Worldstar in technology,

2490
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:15,760
uh,

2491
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,750
shows that as well.

2492
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:20,020
And it becomes the number one
video the internet ever sees ever.

2493
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,160
And then he goes into porn
robot porn with a sliced neck.

2494
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,490
Cause this is Dick never
goes soft as a fucking robot.

2495
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,780
Once he learns he's a robot,

2496
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:31,540
he just presses the dick
hard button and it just goes,

2497
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,840
I think that there's a real,

2498
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:39,640
real concern at a certain point in time
that we're going to create an artificial

2499
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:41,020
thing that thanks for retarded.

2500
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,073
Yeah.

2501
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,640
If it's really doing your calculations
and realizing like how ridiculous we are.

2502
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:48,560
And it also might eliminate
us because it goes,

2503
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:49,394
okay,

2504
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:52,760
if humans are allowed
to continue surviving,

2505
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,030
there's a nonzero chance that
they will eventually wipe us out.

2506
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,940
They'll either destroy the earth
where they will for some reason,

2507
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,980
decided to turn us off at some point.

2508
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,850
And so because there's that non zero
chance that they will eliminate us,

2509
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:08,180
we have to eliminate them first and
then you get like a Battlestar Galactica

2510
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:10,070
kind of thing where they actually want

2511
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,580
to kill humans just because
they essentially live forever.

2512
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,000
You know,

2513
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,130
there's no time constraints,

2514
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:18,710
so they don't want a
situation where an 500 years,

2515
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:21,680
we're so advanced that we were advanced,

2516
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:24,270
that we decided that artificial
intelligence is evil for some reason,

2517
01:17:24,271 --> 01:17:26,930
that we have some new religious
leader and we turned it off.

2518
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,101
Well,

2519
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:29,930
the followers of Ted Kaczynski,

2520
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,280
that's what it's going to be.

2521
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:34,310
It's going to be the unibomber followers
who said he's ahead of his time.

2522
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:34,761
I mean,

2523
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:36,020
that's what [inaudible] thought.

2524
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,000
He thought that technology was our enemy.

2525
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:39,410
It was the enemy of the human race.

2526
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:44,411
And he was trying to actively stop
technology by attacking and killing the

2527
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:47,300
people that were
responsible for innovation.

2528
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:47,961
I mean,

2529
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:52,961
it's a really crazy thought that may
be in his wacky LSD mind that he had a

2530
01:17:55,041 --> 01:18:00,041
point that he really saw it all common
and he saw he extrapolated the future and

2531
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:00,441
he said,

2532
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:01,274
oh my God,

2533
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,200
we keep going along at this same rate.

2534
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,420
There's not going to be any apple pie.

2535
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,400
That's not going to be any
Norman Rockwell paintings.

2536
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,900
I think he was just a crazy person.

2537
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:10,340
And I think a lot of crazy people,

2538
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:10,851
uh,

2539
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:13,070
can see like a very small
part of the picture.

2540
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,000
And that's why they're crazy.

2541
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:15,080
They can see the little bit,

2542
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,910
they can't see the whole fucking thing.

2543
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,870
If they could see that,

2544
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,100
they would be much less worried.

2545
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,200
Do you know he was a part
of the Harvard Lsd Studies,

2546
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:22,010
right?

2547
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:22,260
Um,

2548
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,093
I did not know that.

2549
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,580
You should look into it.

2550
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,413
It's a fascinating,

2551
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,080
there's a documentary called the net.

2552
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,780
It's a foreign documentary in subtitles,

2553
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,261
the net.

2554
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:30,950
It's all,

2555
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,280
uh,

2556
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,030
documenting Ted Kaczynski.

2557
01:18:33,031 --> 01:18:37,670
He's part in the Harvard LSD studies
where they just dose the shit out of kids

2558
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:39,410
and found out what it did for them.

2559
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,690
He went to Berkeley after that,

2560
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,670
taught at Berkeley and used all of his
money to fucking build this cabin in the

2561
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,860
woods and then plot his war
against civilization and,

2562
01:18:49,861 --> 01:18:50,694
and uh,

2563
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:51,620
and,

2564
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,250
and innovation.

2565
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:52,880
Don't put that up.

2566
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,713
Don't put that up.

2567
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,201
We,

2568
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:54,760
you can't,

2569
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,160
don't put any more videos up unless
I ask you to because these videos are

2570
01:18:58,161 --> 01:18:59,420
getting us pulled off of Youtube.

2571
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,470
Movie preview won't do it.

2572
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,440
I don't know about that man.

2573
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,651
It's,

2574
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:03,590
it's really annoying.

2575
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:07,370
Lately we're getting like
half of the videos we put up,

2576
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:09,230
we get a something on youtube.

2577
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:10,400
It says we shouldn't have it up.

2578
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:14,060
It's the dispute if to
do a fair use thing.

2579
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:16,580
And we were talking about before,

2580
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:18,920
you were talking about trolls
that do that to videos.

2581
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:19,161
Yeah.

2582
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:19,701
Contents,

2583
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:20,240
roles.

2584
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,020
Uh,

2585
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,800
they go through youtube videos and they'll
tag stuff is being their copyright,

2586
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,634
their property.

2587
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,600
Even if it's just the video that I made
in my apartment where the background is

2588
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:30,434
my couch.

2589
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,310
All of the words are my own words coming
out of my own mouth for courted by me,

2590
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,780
and this is what I sent to youtube.

2591
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,660
Every time I get one of these
complaints from these uh,

2592
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,930
content troll companies,

2593
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:39,560
I go,

2594
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,740
how is it physically possible
that they own any of this content?

2595
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:43,520
Right.

2596
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,550
And what do they respond to you?

2597
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,010
They always end up reversing it,

2598
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:47,660
but it takes me time to do that.

2599
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,480
And what they're hoping is that a certain
percentage of people won't take the

2600
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:53,090
time and then they make a small
amount of money off your videos.

2601
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,200
That's fascinating.

2602
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:54,680
Yeah.

2603
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,610
That's really fascinating that someone's
decided to be that much of a cunt,

2604
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,370
that they're going to pretend
that you and your in your,

2605
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,230
your office or wherever you're doing
this thing that you somehow or another or

2606
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:07,500
stealing their work.

2607
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,393
Yeah.

2608
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,380
That's amazing.

2609
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,420
Well,

2610
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,550
I'm using English words and I think
they probably use English words,

2611
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:16,710
so it must be a copyright infringement.

2612
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:16,981
Oh,

2613
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:17,820
that's amazing.

2614
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,330
It's amazing that they think that they
can do that or that they think that

2615
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:22,560
somehow or another that's justified.

2616
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,890
Do you think they're randomly selecting
people or they're purposely finding

2617
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,600
people that have high number of videos?

2618
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:29,340
High number of use.

2619
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,070
If I were to say anything and
just be complete speculation,

2620
01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:33,450
I don't know what they're going for,

2621
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:35,430
but maybe it's like an algorithm,

2622
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,120
like maybe it's a Bot that searches
out things and it's a moneymaking Bot.

2623
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,570
Yeah.

2624
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,180
I'm always fascinated by when you go
to a website and you're entering in

2625
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:42,761
information,

2626
01:20:42,761 --> 01:20:45,990
they give you that weird scrambled
letter thing that you have to decipher,

2627
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,480
oh the capture scan.

2628
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,740
This is the best way you have to do this.

2629
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:50,760
And My,

2630
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,241
by the way,

2631
01:20:51,241 --> 01:20:54,390
sometimes it's like tests
that test the whole bunch.

2632
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:58,020
Like when they crammed the letters
together and I guess I'm not human cause I

2633
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,430
didn't pass your fucking test.

2634
01:20:59,431 --> 01:20:59,700
You know?

2635
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,990
Sometimes it's a real,

2636
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,880
it's a real calculation.

2637
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,230
I think it's a cue.

2638
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,840
What that is that a g or a fucking Q?

2639
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:11,100
What is that weird ass thing
that doesn't look like a font?

2640
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,593
You know?

2641
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,340
I think when they just ask questions like,

2642
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:14,611
you know,

2643
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:17,300
what was the first president of the
United States or something like that that,

2644
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:17,810
that,

2645
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,030
yeah,

2646
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:18,360
that's,

2647
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,290
that's a lot smarter.

2648
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,010
Yeah.

2649
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:24,960
But if you're a Google type database or
you can have the algorithm go to Google

2650
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,310
and answer the question,

2651
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:28,170
like if you say something into Google,

2652
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:30,150
it has it in a 10th of a second.

2653
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:33,930
So if you have a direct
connection and so it could get,

2654
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,910
just get the answer and answer for,

2655
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:38,580
you would look at the text
and then have former response.

2656
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,420
You can,

2657
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:39,631
you know,

2658
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:42,780
you could ask a Google
search engine a question,

2659
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,450
it'll take you to wiki
answers and then boom.

2660
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,540
So all we'd have to do is just print that.

2661
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:48,750
Yeah.

2662
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,070
But then it would be like,

2663
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,570
it wouldn't be a one word answer.

2664
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,051
You know what I mean?

2665
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:52,510
Like,

2666
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:52,880
like,

2667
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,430
uh,

2668
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,240
like it would be,

2669
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,590
would it be who was the first president?

2670
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:56,101
United States.

2671
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:56,934
George Washington.

2672
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,210
Yeah.

2673
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,330
But if we're were to search,

2674
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:01,260
Google would probably be like,

2675
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:02,690
George Washington is a,

2676
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:02,911
like,

2677
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,980
it wouldn't know to just stop,

2678
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:05,460
I guess.

2679
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,293
Maybe,

2680
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,320
you know what I mean?

2681
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,220
Do you remember that thing?

2682
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:13,170
Wolfram Alpha that they were doing a long
time ago at any math search engine or

2683
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:13,650
something?

2684
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:13,980
Yeah,

2685
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:14,191
well,

2686
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:15,300
it was a search engine,

2687
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,100
like an academic search search engine,

2688
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:20,970
and I think the idea was to have
a total complete human database.

2689
01:22:20,971 --> 01:22:21,804
Siri,

2690
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,530
that's what it is.

2691
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:23,420
It becomes Siri.

2692
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:23,641
Yeah.

2693
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:28,641
They use the technology for Siri
works eight out of 10 times only.

2694
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:29,910
Right?

2695
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:30,743
It doesn't it?

2696
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,261
I find,

2697
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:32,190
I don't use it that often,

2698
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:33,390
but I find it to be pretty accurate,

2699
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,050
but I mean even good now
is eight out of 10 right?

2700
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,520
Two out of 10 it depends.

2701
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,363
[inaudible].

2702
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:38,660
Okay,

2703
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,301
let's find out.

2704
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:39,961
Let's Google this.

2705
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:41,550
How often does Siri work?

2706
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:42,171
Let's just say that.

2707
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:42,811
And they remember when,

2708
01:22:42,811 --> 01:22:43,621
they don't want to say Siri,

2709
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:44,260
the porn star,

2710
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,540
because he's a porn star name.

2711
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:46,110
Siri.

2712
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:49,710
Do you remember when they were like
cheesy infomercials on about that software

2713
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:54,090
product where you'd put on the microphone
and instead of typing it would read

2714
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:56,670
your words and you'd be able
to type a document that way?

2715
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:57,780
Say that again.

2716
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,230
What is it?

2717
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:00,900
There used to be infomercials for
this software where you'd put on the

2718
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:02,460
microphone and instead of typing,

2719
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,390
dragging,

2720
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:06,370
dragging like speech recognition
and then it was so clunky

2721
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:10,480
that what we have now is ridiculously
better than like anything that I think

2722
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:11,314
they expect it.

2723
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:11,861
Yeah.

2724
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:12,611
Well I'm,

2725
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:15,310
I have a friend who used to
write all of his books with that.

2726
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,130
He used to,

2727
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:16,341
yeah,

2728
01:23:16,341 --> 01:23:19,810
he's put headphones on and walk around
his apartment years ago and he actually

2729
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:23,860
used windows because the windows version
of dragon was way better than the Mac

2730
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:24,251
version.

2731
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,390
That was a very reason why he did it.

2732
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:29,470
He did all of his writing through rants
and then he would go back over it and

2733
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,940
then edit it and try to figure it out.

2734
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:31,331
But it was like,

2735
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:33,950
to capture my words is,

2736
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,890
is accurately with my fingers.

2737
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:36,460
Like I just,

2738
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,570
I can't type that fast.

2739
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:40,900
There's no way it felt like there was
something missing in the flow of his

2740
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:41,734
ideas.

2741
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,900
I've always had the opposite opinion.

2742
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:46,810
I think that I write better because,

2743
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:47,703
um,

2744
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,900
when I actually physically
use the keyboard,

2745
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:53,770
because I am giving a lot of thought
and consideration to each one of these

2746
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:58,771
words because it takes me a lot longer
to type out the word consideration than

2747
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,810
it does to have that concept in my mind.

2748
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:05,350
That concept in my mind
goes in and out and there's,

2749
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:08,500
there's both like the rants that
you would come up with an a podcast,

2750
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:09,460
you probably would never,

2751
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:15,150
you'd never write that way because you're
in sort of this frantic flowing thing

2752
01:24:15,531 --> 01:24:19,210
where one idea feeds into the
next and this steam behind them.

2753
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:23,320
But when you're writing and you're really
considering every single sentence and

2754
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:26,110
going back over it and
going back over the is,

2755
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:27,290
that's the best way to phrase this.

2756
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,124
Like a Hemingway,

2757
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,040
is this as concise as possible?

2758
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,000
Could I go shorter?

2759
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:31,241
Yeah.

2760
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:31,550
Is it,

2761
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:33,790
there's a way to put more flare to it.

2762
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:34,720
There's a way to,

2763
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:35,080
you know,

2764
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,420
give it a better feeling.

2765
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:39,580
Like what's the impact that
I'm going to get from reading?

2766
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:43,300
This is a way to enhance that in some way,

2767
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,710
that extra consideration.

2768
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:45,610
I think is good.

2769
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,250
It's not that you can't do that
in the editing process though,

2770
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,790
but for me it's silence
is how I write best.

2771
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:53,260
I don't want to even hear my own voice.

2772
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:55,270
I don't want to hear
shit most of the time.

2773
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:58,360
Don't listen to music unless
there's are a rare moment.

2774
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:04,200
But the idea that you could just talk
a whole email and absolutely have it be

2775
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:05,884
perfect,

2776
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,480
that's really compelling.

2777
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:11,170
Like it was like day to day
tasks that weren't like creative.

2778
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:12,100
It's so good.

2779
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:13,990
You don't have to check it
before you send it to your boss.

2780
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:14,140
Like,

2781
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:14,321
Hey,

2782
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:16,780
Dave is 1230 on Wednesday.

2783
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:18,790
Okay for a podcast question mark,

2784
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,510
send,

2785
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:19,901
boom,

2786
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:20,480
done.

2787
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,360
Takes five seconds.

2788
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,220
I do that all the time
with text messaging.

2789
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:24,880
By the way,

2790
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,040
one of the things about androids is,

2791
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:27,460
um,

2792
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:27,911
they're,

2793
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:28,390
uh,

2794
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,870
they're,

2795
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:33,430
they're Google voice software
that they use for analyzing,

2796
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,264
um,

2797
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,141
uh,

2798
01:25:35,141 --> 01:25:36,190
analyzing your texts.

2799
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,330
Like if I send you a text,

2800
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:38,380
it's fucking incredible.

2801
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,191
It's really,

2802
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,024
really accurate.

2803
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,450
Cool.

2804
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:41,680
It's really accurate.

2805
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:42,820
It's really fast.

2806
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:45,520
It picks it up as you're
talking and you could see the,

2807
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,660
the letters for me.

2808
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:47,950
And that's just on a cell phone.

2809
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,250
They're also not shitheads about
accepting stuff into their APP store.

2810
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,560
So much more open environment.

2811
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:54,071
Yeah.

2812
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:55,600
Despite what everybody's been telling me,

2813
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:55,991
no,

2814
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:59,410
there are no bitcoin applications
available for the iPhone.

2815
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,410
You may have a bitcoin
application for the iPhone,

2816
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:03,890
but you cannot new ones.

2817
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,180
That's what people are saying,

2818
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:05,280
like,

2819
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:05,381
oh,

2820
01:26:05,381 --> 01:26:06,160
I have a big coin.

2821
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,100
If you don't know what
you're talking about.

2822
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:07,271
Well,

2823
01:26:07,271 --> 01:26:07,761
and then two,

2824
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:09,150
because you already downloaded,

2825
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,270
they're trying to download one right now.

2826
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,260
You're not gonna be able to get it.

2827
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,120
There are apps that will
show you the price and stuff,

2828
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:17,090
but there aren't apps that will allow
you to send or receive bitcoins.

2829
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,020
That's fascinating.

2830
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,913
Yeah,

2831
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,481
that's a weird thing.

2832
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:20,750
Well,

2833
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:24,980
is there any rational explanation
for why apple is chosen to do that?

2834
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,090
I think,

2835
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:28,130
I mean there are two reasons.

2836
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:31,520
One is that they make a tremendous amount
of money from saving your credit card

2837
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:35,630
info and then every time you decide you
want to buy a song or you want to buy an

2838
01:26:35,631 --> 01:26:35,841
APP,

2839
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,010
it goes through their system.

2840
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:40,230
And I think they're worried that if
they open up the flood gates to Bitcoin,

2841
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,230
they lose that 30% that they're making.

2842
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,790
That's a very good point.

2843
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,530
So that even think of
that because apple is,

2844
01:26:45,531 --> 01:26:47,830
that's a huge part of their
businesses that I didn't get store.

2845
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:47,990
Yeah.

2846
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:52,310
They give APP developers I believe 70%
and they take 30 and with bitcoin they be

2847
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:53,144
getting like nothing.

2848
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:57,650
That is a very good point
in a very likely reason.

2849
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,910
That's a very likely motivation.

2850
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,200
The other reason is just they're
worried about legal shit.

2851
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,160
Uh,

2852
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,280
but that's not so much concerned because
if a company like apple wants to do

2853
01:27:05,281 --> 01:27:05,701
something,

2854
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:06,360
they do it.

2855
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,260
They always have,

2856
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:07,590
you know,

2857
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,730
the ability to,

2858
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:09,690
yeah.

2859
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,400
Remain compliant and
that's what they would do.

2860
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:12,900
That's a really good point,

2861
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:13,081
man.

2862
01:27:13,081 --> 01:27:13,861
I didn't even think of that,

2863
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,060
but I bet you're dead right.

2864
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,310
With their iTunes store for movies,

2865
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:19,080
the iTunes store for music,

2866
01:27:19,081 --> 01:27:23,250
that's probably a considerable chunk of
revenue that could very well be swept

2867
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:24,150
away with bitcoin.

2868
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:28,530
If someone came up with an application
that allowed artists to sell their music

2869
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:30,210
directly with bit coin,

2870
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:35,690
no iTunes and then someone ma manages a
another application that ports it into

2871
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:38,010
into iTunes.

2872
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,040
Well we're going to,

2873
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,300
we're going to see some really weird
stuff in the next couple of years.

2874
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:45,440
We're going to see banks where it's just
a bunch of bitcoin users funding the

2875
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:49,100
bank and then the bank decides who to
loan money to and so then like you'll have

2876
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:51,440
a situation where instead of
going to chase or wells Fargo,

2877
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:55,370
you'll just go to like the guide on the
street who owns his own community bank

2878
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:59,240
and there'll be run by bitcoin so you
know that the money he claims he has is

2879
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:00,800
actually there because you can verify it.

2880
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:05,120
It's getting the picture in five years
is going to look so weird compared to

2881
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:05,954
today.

2882
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,220
The idea of driving up to an ATM machine
in five years is going to be the same

2883
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:12,590
as walking into a blockbuster
and picking up a VHS tape.

2884
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:14,060
It's just not going to be
something people need to do.

2885
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:18,230
So you think that all money will be
digital currency in a certain amount of

2886
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:19,064
time?

2887
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:19,993
Yeah.

2888
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,530
God,

2889
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,270
I realize it's a kind
of a bold prediction,

2890
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:25,660
but you get to a point where there's
no turning back and it's the same with,

2891
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:26,380
uh,

2892
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,700
how many people own analogue TV still
for a while it was kind of like 20% owned

2893
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:35,050
flat screen HDTV is 80%
still had the old tubes.

2894
01:28:35,051 --> 01:28:35,650
Yeah.

2895
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,300
And then slowly over time,

2896
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:37,781
more and more,

2897
01:28:37,781 --> 01:28:40,420
your friends got the flat
screens until eventually,

2898
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:44,410
even your friends who don't have any
money and are not up on tech trends,

2899
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:46,420
you walk into their house
and it's a brand new Samsung.

2900
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,283
What happened there?

2901
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,570
Analog always loses out to digital.

2902
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,190
That seems to be the trend in anything.

2903
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:51,661
Well,

2904
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:54,660
innovation always stumps
out the old stupid shit.

2905
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:54,931
Yeah.

2906
01:28:54,931 --> 01:28:55,471
I mean,

2907
01:28:55,471 --> 01:28:57,490
I can't guarantee the bitcoin
will be the first one.

2908
01:28:57,491 --> 01:29:01,530
And in fact it's possible that it won't
be the one that that takes off finally,

2909
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:02,364
because

2910
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,810
if you look at operating systems,

2911
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:08,811
it was xerox labs created one of the
first visual operating systems and Steve

2912
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:12,950
jobs was taking a tour of the Xerox
Park because they had told him like,

2913
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,621
you get to check this out,

2914
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:14,191
it's really cool.

2915
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:15,024
It's up your alley.

2916
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,910
He saw that took one look
at it and it was like,

2917
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,590
this is what I should be doing at apple.

2918
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:20,850
Took that idea,

2919
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:23,280
made the visual Apple Macintosh,

2920
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:24,040
whatever the fuck it was,

2921
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,830
the opera graphic user interface,

2922
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,360
that's what they invented,

2923
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:32,070
invented the point and click the trash
bin and dragging files instead of a

2924
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:32,904
command line.

2925
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:33,241
So,

2926
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:34,410
but even apple wasn't.

2927
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:35,760
So that was the second generation.

2928
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,790
Even that wasn't the one that took off
because apple for a long time was only

2929
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:42,240
used by a subset of designers
and writers and stuff.

2930
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,500
It was actually windows.

2931
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:46,380
It was the third one where Bill Gates saw,

2932
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:46,711
uh,

2933
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:49,230
with Steve jobs had done and he goes,

2934
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,280
we got to make windows,

2935
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:52,500
we'll make it a little bit cheaper and
make it a little bit simpler for people

2936
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:52,800
to use.

2937
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,030
Doesn't have to be as beautiful,

2938
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,530
but we're going for the mass market.

2939
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,550
And that's the one that took off and I
think be the same situation with this,

2940
01:29:59,551 --> 01:30:03,240
where bitcoin blazed the trail and maybe
it'll always have a place in the same

2941
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:06,660
way that apple is always had a
place and now it's a very big place.

2942
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,590
So we'll have like multiple
alternative currencies to choose from.

2943
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:10,951
Yeah,

2944
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:11,910
it's going to be really weird.

2945
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:14,400
You're going to have like three or four
currencies and you're going to use them

2946
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:15,150
for different things.

2947
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,260
Like if you're tipping,

2948
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:17,970
if you're tipping a podcast,

2949
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:20,910
you might use a bitcoin,

2950
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,080
but if you're at a strip club,

2951
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:24,480
you might use some other
coin for some other reason.

2952
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,130
And you know what
someone's got to do though.

2953
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:28,110
Someone's got to make it treason.

2954
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,270
If you interfere with this,

2955
01:30:30,271 --> 01:30:34,470
like if you try to sabotage these digital
currencies and stop innovation because

2956
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:34,890
you're,

2957
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:37,650
you're worried that your
whatever company you're doing,

2958
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:41,320
whatever thing you're doing is going
to somehow or another be impacted by it

2959
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,290
should be treasonous.

2960
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,000
They like the idea that you
could come in like they're,

2961
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:49,410
and I've government agents that are coming
in and sabotaging bitcoin buying and

2962
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:51,660
selling and stealing the IRS.

2963
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:53,460
The IRS has already
ruled that it's property.

2964
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:57,510
So if you have any government
agency that tries to damage the,

2965
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,260
um,

2966
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,093
the network,

2967
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,590
then you're damaging your
own citizens property.

2968
01:31:01,591 --> 01:31:02,311
And that is illegal.

2969
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:06,570
That's one of the most basic tenants
of American capitalism is we protect

2970
01:31:06,571 --> 01:31:07,470
property rights here.

2971
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:10,080
Like it might not happen in countries
in South America that you get a new

2972
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:10,914
dictator,

2973
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:12,540
everybody's property gets taken over.

2974
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:13,860
That's not what America does.

2975
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:15,570
We actually respect property rights.

2976
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,530
So it's very strange to me that we
would have people even think about

2977
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,723
challenging that.

2978
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:21,031
Well,

2979
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:21,721
if that's the case,

2980
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:25,380
then what's going on with this mount Gox
thing and that means is a giant grand

2981
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:28,560
theft took place for $300
million in property was stolen.

2982
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:28,971
That was a,

2983
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:33,540
that was a fat dumb ass who programmed
his site and the wrong language and got a

2984
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,210
lot of market share because he
was one of the first people there.

2985
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,430
And uh,

2986
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,290
if you look at just traditional money,

2987
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,640
US dollars in euros,

2988
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,050
it attracts a lot of criminals,

2989
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,380
you know,

2990
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,600
surprise when you're dealing
with billions of dollars.

2991
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:47,340
The kinds of people who
are attracted to that,

2992
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:48,660
some of them are honest,

2993
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:49,560
some of them are not.

2994
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,290
And how many failures have
we had within the dollar?

2995
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:53,220
We had a,

2996
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:53,571
what was it,

2997
01:31:53,571 --> 01:31:54,780
Lehman Brothers went under,

2998
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,860
bear Stearns had to be bought out by
chase for like pennies on the dollar or

2999
01:31:58,861 --> 01:32:00,310
like two bucks a share or something.

3000
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,390
And uh,

3001
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,590
we had Bernie made off like scams related
to money or nothing new and that's not

3002
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:06,550
going to go away with bitcoin.

3003
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:09,040
It's just that now we're going to
have a little bit more accountability.

3004
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:14,400
And I personally just like to
see these old fucks in Davos.

3005
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,150
I like to see them sweat a little bit for
the first time because they have given

3006
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:22,510
my generation more than a trillion
dollars of student loan debt that we can't

3007
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:23,170
pay off.

3008
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:23,831
And when I say we,

3009
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:25,480
I'm just talking about everybody.

3010
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:26,530
I don't have any student loan debt,

3011
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,630
but they've done that.

3012
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,810
We're all pretty much indentured
servants to the Zombie banks,

3013
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:35,590
which if you look into them as people
like Matt Taibbi had done their semi

3014
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,211
insolvent,

3015
01:32:36,211 --> 01:32:37,570
they are corrupt to the core,

3016
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,970
they are politically entrenched
and they're not efficient.

3017
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:40,691
That's what bothers me.

3018
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:42,400
Like all the other shit
is all well and good.

3019
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,900
It's just not efficient.

3020
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:45,640
Like I used to be in credit cards,

3021
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:49,540
I had a credit card website where it
would rank deals for people and I honestly

3022
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:52,810
believe that the time that plastic is
the best way to buy things more efficient

3023
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:53,291
than cash.

3024
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:54,130
You have a record of it.

3025
01:32:54,131 --> 01:32:54,551
So you know,

3026
01:32:54,551 --> 01:32:57,460
come tax time what you
spent on business stuff.

3027
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,780
When this came around,

3028
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,520
I instantly realized,

3029
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:00,911
Oh okay,

3030
01:33:00,911 --> 01:33:02,110
credit cards days are numbered.

3031
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:03,350
It might not be an,

3032
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:03,761
you know,

3033
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:04,451
it might take a year,

3034
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:05,290
it might take five years,

3035
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,124
but they're done.

3036
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:07,490
So

3037
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:07,791
yeah,

3038
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:08,250
I think,

3039
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:08,870
um,

3040
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,970
digital currency without a doubt,

3041
01:33:10,971 --> 01:33:12,200
threatens the paradigm.

3042
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:12,401
It,

3043
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:13,440
it threatens the,

3044
01:33:13,441 --> 01:33:14,960
the situation that they have,

3045
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:15,091
the,

3046
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:16,220
the strangle hold they have.

3047
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:20,360
And once you see companies like tiger
direct starting to sell computers and

3048
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,140
different Vegas casinos
are starting to accept it,

3049
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,280
overstocks a huge company
and they accept it.

3050
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:25,520
Yeah.

3051
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,420
It's going to get weird.

3052
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,590
It's going to get real weird.

3053
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:27,911
I'm,

3054
01:33:27,911 --> 01:33:32,090
I'm really curious to see what happens
and really curious to see what the blow

3055
01:33:32,091 --> 01:33:33,140
back is going to be.

3056
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:38,170
What sort of federal attack on a bitcoin
and you have a really good point that

3057
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:42,740
there's always been corruption
as far as regular money goes,

3058
01:33:42,741 --> 01:33:43,640
far as accepted,

3059
01:33:43,641 --> 01:33:44,720
conventional money goes.

3060
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,830
There's always been massive
amounts of corruption.

3061
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:49,550
There's always been massive amounts
of theft was always been problems,

3062
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,950
but no one has said we
can't have money anymore.

3063
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,180
Everybody's corrupt.

3064
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:54,380
Bernie Madoff fucked it up.

3065
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:55,030
No more money.

3066
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,181
Yeah.

3067
01:33:55,181 --> 01:33:55,751
How many people,

3068
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:56,021
right?

3069
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:56,741
Rubber checks.

3070
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:58,620
That's something that
never happens with bitcoin.

3071
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,520
I can't send you a rubber Bitcoin,

3072
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,680
I can't send you a fake bitcoin.

3073
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:03,760
That's a real good point.

3074
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:04,600
And so like just,

3075
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:08,590
if you ignore all the political
implications and that's all you focus on,

3076
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:11,680
like do you want to have a technology
where there's a really good chance of

3077
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:12,730
chargeback fraud,

3078
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,670
which is the case with credit cards
or a rubber check with checks.

3079
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:16,360
Uh,

3080
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,360
do you want that or do you want the
thing where there's zero chance of that

3081
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,650
consumers eventually,

3082
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:21,700
I don't know when it's going to happen.

3083
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:22,840
It might not even be this year.

3084
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,100
Consumers over time,

3085
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:27,880
once they tire of the
propaganda they're seeing on TV,

3086
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:28,331
we'll go,

3087
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:28,721
well yeah,

3088
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:30,370
I want the one where it's 100% certain,

3089
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:32,200
I don't want the one where I don't
know what the fuck's happening

3090
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:32,971
three days.

3091
01:34:32,971 --> 01:34:33,601
So this is Mt.

3092
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:38,400
Gox guy fucked up and courted coded
his site and a shitty way when all that

3093
01:34:38,401 --> 01:34:39,420
money's gone,

3094
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:41,640
all that $300 million in Bitcoin is gone.

3095
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,520
Our people investigating
that like it's a crime.

3096
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:46,050
I mean are they should be.

3097
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:46,741
I'm sure they are.

3098
01:34:46,741 --> 01:34:49,230
I think the US wants to
drag his ass over here.

3099
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,280
Is he an American?

3100
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:51,360
Uh,

3101
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:51,840
I dunno.

3102
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,441
I Dunno what he is.

3103
01:34:52,441 --> 01:34:54,090
I know his company was based in Japan.

3104
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,040
It looks like he's an American.

3105
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:56,330
He doesn't,

3106
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:57,180
he doesn't look Asian.

3107
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:57,770
Um,

3108
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:58,280
the,

3109
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,830
the Mt Gox thing though is if,

3110
01:35:00,831 --> 01:35:01,131
if,

3111
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:02,480
if that is property,

3112
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,000
that's a huge piece of theft.

3113
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:07,520
I mean it should be something
that prosecutors go after.

3114
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,070
Is it one of those gray areas
where he's looking around going,

3115
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,780
what's a crime taking place here?

3116
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:12,041
Oh,

3117
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,180
I think they're going to go after him.

3118
01:35:13,181 --> 01:35:18,181
I think that he's going to be one of the
examples that the government makes is

3119
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:19,031
like,

3120
01:35:19,031 --> 01:35:19,811
you can't do this.

3121
01:35:19,811 --> 01:35:20,561
This is fucked up.

3122
01:35:20,561 --> 01:35:23,230
You can't do it because there's
actually a lot of money,

3123
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,083
uh,

3124
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,380
that's supposed to go into
bitcoin over the summer.

3125
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:27,550
Institutional money.

3126
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,850
When a second market comes online,

3127
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:35,620
which is supposed to be like the first
really credible exchange that big banks

3128
01:35:35,621 --> 01:35:36,850
would be comfortable using.

3129
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:38,020
But here's a big,

3130
01:35:38,021 --> 01:35:38,351
fat,

3131
01:35:38,351 --> 01:35:39,184
stupid head.

3132
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:42,490
It looks like he ate some
bitcoins and all the big crazy

3133
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,980
$300 million in bitcoins.

3134
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,610
Mt.

3135
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:50,080
Gox is set to liquidate as
court denies rehabilitation,

3136
01:35:50,081 --> 01:35:51,070
so they're going to liquidate.

3137
01:35:51,071 --> 01:35:52,210
Now what does that mean?

3138
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:53,900
Once the world's biggest beer?

3139
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:54,880
This is seven hours ago.

3140
01:35:54,881 --> 01:35:58,300
This came out once the world's
biggest bitcoin exchange.

3141
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,170
Mt.

3142
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:03,550
Gox is likely to be liquidated after a
Tokyo court dismissed the companies bid

3143
01:36:03,551 --> 01:36:05,140
to resuscitate it's business.

3144
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,740
The court appointed administrator
court appointed administrative set on

3145
01:36:08,741 --> 01:36:13,741
Wednesday Mark Carr pile less
Karpeles cyclists is also likely to be

3146
01:36:15,581 --> 01:36:19,450
investigated for liability and the
collapse of the Tokyo based from the

3147
01:36:19,451 --> 01:36:21,040
provisional administrator.

3148
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,200
Lawyer no bull.

3149
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:26,770
Aki Kobiashi said in a settlement,

3150
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,080
a statement published on the Mt.

3151
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:29,710
Gox Whiteside.

3152
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:31,150
Look at that big fat stupid head.

3153
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,040
He looks so dumb too.

3154
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,380
He doesn't just look
like a an overweight guy.

3155
01:36:35,381 --> 01:36:36,490
He looks like a dunce.

3156
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:37,383
Nice hair.

3157
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:38,950
Bad.

3158
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,091
Well,

3159
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:43,380
I mean he'd racy jumped from what magic
the gathering to managing one of the

3160
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:46,440
most high traffic exchanges in the world.

3161
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:46,781
Yeah.

3162
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:48,660
What does that guy going
to do for a job after this?

3163
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:48,991
I mean,

3164
01:36:48,991 --> 01:36:49,950
if he has any money at all,

3165
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:51,810
people are gonna find it
and go give me that pitch.

3166
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,130
Fucking my bitcoins.

3167
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:53,973
Smack him in the head.

3168
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:54,181
Oh,

3169
01:36:54,181 --> 01:36:56,100
I'm sure he has a lot of people
who are not happy with them.

3170
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,020
You better stay over there man.

3171
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:58,591
By the way,

3172
01:36:58,591 --> 01:37:02,430
a all my kind of political rabble
rousing about how bitcoin will change the

3173
01:37:02,431 --> 01:37:03,001
landscape.

3174
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:06,010
I just want to put in a um,

3175
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:11,100
kind of disclaimer that in five years
you might still see chase and bank of

3176
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:13,980
America because there's a chance that
if they see it taking off fast enough,

3177
01:37:13,981 --> 01:37:17,850
they'll adopt it because for them it's
just the new payment technology like they

3178
01:37:17,851 --> 01:37:19,140
use visa and mastercard.

3179
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:23,790
They could just as easily issue a bitcoin
debit card and base it off of that

3180
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:26,940
network and find a way to make
money off of it by providing people,

3181
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:27,121
you know,

3182
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:29,220
the security of your not
dealing with some fat ass.

3183
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:29,731
In Japan,

3184
01:37:29,731 --> 01:37:31,440
you're dealing with Bank of America,

3185
01:37:31,441 --> 01:37:32,400
you're dealing with chase.

3186
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,450
That's possible.

3187
01:37:33,451 --> 01:37:37,830
But one thing that's very clear is that
it's going to be completely different

3188
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:38,020
print

3189
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:38,853
and a couple of years.

3190
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:39,851
Yeah,

3191
01:37:39,851 --> 01:37:41,140
I think you're absolutely right.

3192
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:42,880
Fascinating stuff,

3193
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:43,181
man.

3194
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:47,740
This is such an interesting time to be
alive because there's so much going on

3195
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,580
and there's so much change and there's
so many people that are wondering like,

3196
01:37:51,581 --> 01:37:52,840
which way is it going to go?

3197
01:37:52,841 --> 01:37:55,030
And people that are looking
at it in a negative way,

3198
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,150
people that are looking at it,

3199
01:37:56,151 --> 01:37:56,984
it promising,

3200
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:57,961
you know,

3201
01:37:57,961 --> 01:37:58,330
um,

3202
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,190
well what's really cool to
think about if you look at,

3203
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:00,700
uh,

3204
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:04,480
where a lot of the money came from in
Silicon Valley for these really innovative

3205
01:38:04,481 --> 01:38:05,710
companies we're seeing today,

3206
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:10,960
it started with paypal where
Peter Teal and a Ilan mosque,

3207
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,340
I think a couple of other guys,

3208
01:38:12,341 --> 01:38:17,080
Max something made billions of dollars
off of their paypal venture because

3209
01:38:17,081 --> 01:38:20,680
paypal was at the time a
challenge to the status quo.

3210
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:21,311
It was,

3211
01:38:21,311 --> 01:38:23,260
you don't need an expensive merchant.

3212
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:23,980
Uh,

3213
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:24,221
uh,

3214
01:38:24,221 --> 01:38:26,200
whatever that thing was
that merchants had to have,

3215
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,010
um,

3216
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,330
to process credit cards,

3217
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,600
a merchant account,

3218
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,433
you don't need that.

3219
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:33,340
All you need is an email address
and we verify some stuff,

3220
01:38:33,341 --> 01:38:34,360
link it to your bank account,

3221
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,640
and now you have a form of digital money.

3222
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,451
And,

3223
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:37,540
uh,

3224
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,920
that was 15 years ago.

3225
01:38:38,921 --> 01:38:40,840
So we're overdue for kind of a new,

3226
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:43,240
a challenge to the status quo.

3227
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,550
And my point is that when paypal happened,

3228
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:49,090
it made a lot of people rich and that
money ended up getting invested in things

3229
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:50,500
that have nothing to do with currency.

3230
01:38:50,501 --> 01:38:55,501
It was invested in a Tesla and space x
and all these next generation companies.

3231
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,850
And we will probably see the same thing.

3232
01:38:57,851 --> 01:39:00,430
Now we'll see people get rich
off of this and then that money,

3233
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:05,080
since they're young and not compromise
old people will go into really bizarre

3234
01:39:05,081 --> 01:39:07,690
things where the dividend
is just going to be massive.

3235
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:08,650
Um,

3236
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:10,120
what I was getting at is that

3237
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:13,910
there's a lot of folks that look at the
possibilities in the future and look at

3238
01:39:13,911 --> 01:39:14,251
all and they,

3239
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:15,620
they see only negative.

3240
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,450
And as a very unfortunate,

3241
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,313
and um,

3242
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,180
that was our friend Michael Rupert,

3243
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,020
um,

3244
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:23,000
who he,

3245
01:39:23,001 --> 01:39:23,834
uh,

3246
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:27,680
somehow or another a couple
of days ago committed suicide,

3247
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,310
uh,

3248
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:29,180
by a gunshot.

3249
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:30,223
Allegedly.

3250
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:30,440
There's,

3251
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,930
I'm sure there's a lot of people
out there think he was murdered.

3252
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:33,560
Uh,

3253
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,450
there always is going
to be on those things.

3254
01:39:35,451 --> 01:39:36,980
But I know he wasn't a happy guy.

3255
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:37,731
And,

3256
01:39:37,731 --> 01:39:38,150
uh,

3257
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:40,220
if you look at the way
he looked at the world,

3258
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,870
I mean everything he saw,

3259
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,220
he saw that movie collapse.

3260
01:39:43,221 --> 01:39:44,090
It's him sitting there,

3261
01:39:44,091 --> 01:39:44,930
chain smoking,

3262
01:39:44,931 --> 01:39:45,980
talking about the end.

3263
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:49,610
And it's incredibly compelling
cause he was a very articulate guy.

3264
01:39:49,611 --> 01:39:50,480
He was very,

3265
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,100
he was very believable.

3266
01:39:52,101 --> 01:39:53,150
He was charismatic,

3267
01:39:53,151 --> 01:39:56,090
he was passionate and
he knew a lot of things.

3268
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,990
Um,

3269
01:39:56,990 --> 01:40:00,920
his version was the sky
is falling and you know,

3270
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:02,060
he's wrong about a lot of things.

3271
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:03,530
He was wrong about a lot of predictions.

3272
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:07,910
He was wrong about a lot of his thoughts
on peak oil and a lot of other things

3273
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:09,980
that he thought were going to
come to a conclusion in our,

3274
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,551
you know,

3275
01:40:10,551 --> 01:40:13,580
in just the last decade and
just fuck everything up.

3276
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:14,414
And it didn't happen.

3277
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:15,080
Um,

3278
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,500
I found out about him from
a book that he had put out.

3279
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,040
Oh,

3280
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:24,040
crossing the Rubicon is a long time ago
and it was all about same sort of thing.

3281
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:24,860
Just,

3282
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:25,521
it's always,

3283
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:26,480
it was always negative.

3284
01:40:26,481 --> 01:40:31,481
It was always doom and it was always gloom
and he wasn't well the last few years

3285
01:40:31,761 --> 01:40:36,050
of his life and apparently decided
to end it on his own terms.

3286
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:37,041
So,

3287
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:37,874
um,

3288
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:39,080
it's unfortunate.

3289
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,190
I really liked that guy.

3290
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,420
He was a sweetie.

3291
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,300
He was a really cool guy to be
around who's fun and it was warm.

3292
01:40:44,301 --> 01:40:45,134
It's friendly,

3293
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,820
like the hug people.

3294
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,181
It was just,

3295
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:48,950
it was a real nice guy to be around.

3296
01:40:48,951 --> 01:40:49,401
It was unfair.

3297
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:49,641
I mean,

3298
01:40:49,641 --> 01:40:51,320
I enjoyed doing podcasts with him too.

3299
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,453
He was a,

3300
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,800
I enjoy to him,

3301
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,840
I didn't see the doom and gloom.

3302
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:59,560
I didn't see that side of the way he did
and I didn't agree with them on things,

3303
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:03,250
but he was a very pleasant guy to
be around and I'm going to miss him.

3304
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,433
Sucks.

3305
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:07,120
Sorry to hear about that.

3306
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:07,570
It's a,

3307
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:07,841
you know,

3308
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:09,520
it sucks when people look,

3309
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:10,661
I mean,

3310
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:11,110
look,

3311
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:15,910
I don't know what sucks more going on
when you're miserable as fuck or ending it

3312
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:16,950
and your own shirt,

3313
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:19,770
you should always go on because
the circumstances always change.

3314
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:20,821
So Ab,

3315
01:41:20,821 --> 01:41:22,380
but hunter s Thompson was done.

3316
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,030
Well that's the thing about that guy.

3317
01:41:24,031 --> 01:41:25,020
A lot of his issue,

3318
01:41:25,021 --> 01:41:26,790
I think it was physical
pain and that's different.

3319
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:27,624
That's one of the,

3320
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:28,853
um,

3321
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:32,340
not that I have any say of what
people do or really even care,

3322
01:41:32,341 --> 01:41:33,620
but that's one of the,

3323
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:34,560
for me morally,

3324
01:41:34,561 --> 01:41:36,810
it's where I think that suicide is okay.

3325
01:41:36,811 --> 01:41:40,860
Like if you're in so much pain and
you've pursued every avenue and modern

3326
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:44,580
medicine can't help you reduce that pain
and it's physical pain rather than just

3327
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:45,414
mental pain,

3328
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:47,820
then I don't really have a problem with.

3329
01:41:47,821 --> 01:41:48,151
And I think,

3330
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:49,170
and even in Switzerland now,

3331
01:41:49,171 --> 01:41:53,070
there some kind of assisted suicide
program and I think we gotta be humane.

3332
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:55,560
Like if we put down an animal
because it's in a lot of pain,

3333
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,840
why can't we let an old
guy do the same thing?

3334
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:58,491
Yeah.

3335
01:41:58,491 --> 01:41:59,600
There's no doubt about it.

3336
01:41:59,601 --> 01:42:03,680
There's definitely a time where you should
be able to end it on your own terms.

3337
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:09,040
Why should someone have to like choke on
their own blood until their lungs fill

3338
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:10,130
up.

3339
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:11,330
Let people die with dignity.

3340
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:11,541
You know,

3341
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:14,840
like at a certain point like if the
cancer treatment failed or whatever it is,

3342
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:16,730
give that person a choice.

3343
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,660
I agree and it's another thing we're,

3344
01:42:18,661 --> 01:42:20,820
why should someone be able
to tell you what to do?

3345
01:42:20,821 --> 01:42:22,740
Y I mean the idea that it's illegal.

3346
01:42:22,741 --> 01:42:23,580
It's hilarious anyway.

3347
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:25,500
You're going gonna lock him in
jail after he kills himself.

3348
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:26,790
I mean it's stupid.

3349
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,890
It's stupid to make suicide illegal.

3350
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:33,720
We need way more mental
health counseling everywhere.

3351
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:38,870
We need a lot more thought
into whatever it is.

3352
01:42:39,211 --> 01:42:42,660
It's wrong with people that causes
them to be massively depressed.

3353
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:45,900
A lot more thought into is it
just the way we live our lives?

3354
01:42:45,901 --> 01:42:50,901
Is it just the idea of s sitting in some
fucking office doing some mundane job

3355
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:57,291
that you hate being stuck in this
traffic where you feel completely out of

3356
01:42:57,451 --> 01:42:57,871
control.

3357
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:59,910
You don't have any control
over your environment.

3358
01:42:59,911 --> 01:43:03,390
Just stuck and this massive people
who are also doing the same thing.

3359
01:43:03,391 --> 01:43:05,430
And you look around and
no one seems to be happy.

3360
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,510
Is it just that,

3361
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:07,020
I mean,

3362
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:08,280
is that something we need to fix?

3363
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:09,600
Is the idea of cities are,

3364
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:14,601
these are these ridiculous ideas that
we should abandon condensed humans to a

3365
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,800
neatly packed area?

3366
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,240
Does that make us crazy?

3367
01:43:18,241 --> 01:43:19,800
Are we even designed for it?

3368
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,960
There's all these things
it needs to be considered.

3369
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:26,550
There's a lot of what we're
doing is not well thought out.

3370
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:29,070
It was a lot of what we're
doing in society that's not,

3371
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,200
not the most intelligent,

3372
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,191
innovative,

3373
01:43:32,191 --> 01:43:33,660
creative way to go about it.

3374
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:35,710
Yeah,

3375
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:35,981
I,

3376
01:43:35,981 --> 01:43:36,700
uh,

3377
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,241
I agree,

3378
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:40,390
but I think that a lot of these problems
have always been a part of the human

3379
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:44,410
experience and we just have to learn
how to deal with it and get each other

3380
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:44,950
through it.

3381
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:45,391
Because I don't,

3382
01:43:45,391 --> 01:43:46,030
I don't think the Pr,

3383
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:46,750
I used to think like,

3384
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:47,260
Oh,

3385
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,190
if I want to be happier,

3386
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:50,200
I have to just reduce the
amount of stress in my life,

3387
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,180
but things I'm doing I enjoy doing.

3388
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,410
And as a byproduct,

3389
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:55,041
they're stress.

3390
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:55,230
Like,

3391
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:55,581
you know,

3392
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:58,760
like I enjoy putting out controversial
articles that make people think about

3393
01:43:58,761 --> 01:43:59,360
things.

3394
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,270
The result of that is somebody in the
comments section calls me up cock sucker,

3395
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:02,541
you know,

3396
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,920
like that's how it goes.

3397
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:06,740
And I'm not willing to not write
the article because of the stress.

3398
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,431
So,

3399
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:07,761
uh,

3400
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:09,800
I think that instead of
eliminating all the problems,

3401
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:13,430
we just have to be there for each other
and a lot of people feel isolated.

3402
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:14,360
And that's where you get these,

3403
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,320
um,

3404
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:19,700
tragedies is people no longer have anybody
else to do the feedback loop because

3405
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:20,361
a lot of shit is like,

3406
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:20,940
if that,

3407
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,250
I don't know anything about that guy,

3408
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:24,230
so I don't want to speak as if I do.

3409
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:26,810
But if he had somebody who could tell him,

3410
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:26,991
you know,

3411
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:27,231
yeah,

3412
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:28,700
that's terrible what you're
saying about the government.

3413
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:33,920
But 2000 years ago they were crucifying
people and now they just drag activists

3414
01:44:33,921 --> 01:44:34,790
through the court system.

3415
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:36,470
And I'm not saying that's a good thing.

3416
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:38,540
You don't want to put people
in jail and bullshit charges.

3417
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,060
It's a little bit better than
crucifying people you don't like.

3418
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:43,910
And if you look at the
trend that humanities on,

3419
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,290
it's an improving trend.

3420
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:49,790
It's impossible not to see that like the
mouth and model of human behavior and

3421
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,250
human existence has been proven false.

3422
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,810
Like when you get higher population,

3423
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:56,600
you don't get people
starving and destruction.

3424
01:44:56,601 --> 01:45:00,140
You get more innovation because there are
more minds coming together and you get

3425
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:02,990
things that you didn't
even think were possible.

3426
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:03,824
Like right now,

3427
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:08,570
we don't have a serious food crisis in
the first world anyways because we've

3428
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,610
always been able to scale the technology.

3429
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:13,970
We have more people and then we get
better at farming and then we have more

3430
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:17,030
people and they create more innovation
which leads to better farming and so on.

3431
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:18,141
No,

3432
01:45:18,141 --> 01:45:18,341
I,

3433
01:45:18,341 --> 01:45:19,550
I completely agree.

3434
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:22,970
I hate that Malthusian
that's great word by the way.

3435
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,081
I hate,

3436
01:45:24,081 --> 01:45:25,370
I hate that approach.

3437
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:26,570
It's lazy.

3438
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:26,990
Yeah.

3439
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:28,970
I think if you really do objective,

3440
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:29,661
we look at it,

3441
01:45:29,661 --> 01:45:32,690
there's a lot of good shit
about human beings today.

3442
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:32,901
I mean,

3443
01:45:32,901 --> 01:45:34,850
it's one of the best
times ever to be alive.

3444
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,320
It's certainly scary.

3445
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,690
There's certainly we're,

3446
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:40,520
there's a lot of potential for disaster.

3447
01:45:40,521 --> 01:45:44,060
There's a lot of potential for
catastrophe that's manmade man created,

3448
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:48,140
whether it's nuclear or
war or whatever it is.

3449
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,400
It could be po

3450
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,060
terror.

3451
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:53,930
I think it was on one of your podcasts
recently where you said that the

3452
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,130
Fukushima response,

3453
01:45:55,131 --> 01:45:56,660
they covered it up like a little child.

3454
01:45:56,661 --> 01:45:57,500
He had done something wrong.

3455
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:57,981
Yeah,

3456
01:45:57,981 --> 01:45:59,000
they swept it under the rug.

3457
01:45:59,001 --> 01:45:59,620
That's really,

3458
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,710
that's what they do.

3459
01:46:00,711 --> 01:46:02,810
And it's the same thing
with the BP oil spill.

3460
01:46:02,811 --> 01:46:03,980
Like when that happened,

3461
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:08,420
we just watched it like a kid watching
the milk falling off of a table after you

3462
01:46:08,421 --> 01:46:09,320
spill your cereal,

3463
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,400
how long do we fucking watch that thing
on CNN and nobody really did anything.

3464
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:17,240
And then finally they came in and like
tried to clamp it and took days and

3465
01:46:17,241 --> 01:46:18,380
you're just watching it spill out.

3466
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:20,720
They should have imploded
that thing on day one,

3467
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:22,790
which they didn't want to do cause
they would have lost a lot of revenue.

3468
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:23,401
Yeah,

3469
01:46:23,401 --> 01:46:24,710
they probably should have fit.

3470
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,340
Well they wanted to launch on nuke at it.

3471
01:46:26,341 --> 01:46:26,611
Right.

3472
01:46:26,611 --> 01:46:27,960
And just blow the whole thing up.

3473
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:32,430
Another bad idea because the idea wasn't
that one of the ideas of blowing it up

3474
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:34,950
that way it would seal the
well somehow or another.

3475
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:35,181
Well,

3476
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:38,450
there's also like there are all these
beautiful parts of the world that have

3477
01:46:38,451 --> 01:46:41,690
been radiated from our nuclear tests.

3478
01:46:41,691 --> 01:46:42,980
Back when we didn't
know what we were doing,

3479
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,800
it was like the French
military in the u s military.

3480
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,840
We're just picking
beautiful deserted islands,

3481
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:50,010
which today would be worth know today

3482
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,080
would be the places that
Richard Branson hangs out in.

3483
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,410
But instead they're just
these desolate test sites.

3484
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,410
It's so gross and dumb that we
did that in the first place.

3485
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,610
Have you ever seen that animated Gif of
all of the nuclear explosions that have

3486
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:04,200
gone off in the world?

3487
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:05,100
Uh,

3488
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,461
no.

3489
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:06,720
Last time you showed me,

3490
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:08,940
I think population population,

3491
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:10,410
all the numbers coming in.

3492
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:11,340
That's pretty crazy.

3493
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,570
That's a crazy thing to see like,

3494
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,160
and the little flags behind them.

3495
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:15,690
How many people being born?

3496
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:15,991
Britain,

3497
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:16,500
Japan,

3498
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,333
China,

3499
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:22,860
the bombs being blown up since
the 1940s to the present.

3500
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,570
All the nuclear test.

3501
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,970
It's fucking crazy.

3502
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:29,760
I was thought there was like four or five,

3503
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:32,880
like how many times do we need to blow
these fucking things up before we realize

3504
01:47:32,881 --> 01:47:35,120
what they do now there's a lot.

3505
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,180
What are they learning?

3506
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:37,830
Can you just model this on a computer?

3507
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:39,960
Even 50 years ago they had
computers and you can go,

3508
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:40,111
oh,

3509
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:40,350
okay,

3510
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,060
so this rocket's moving at this speed.

3511
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,220
You know like we can plug the
rest in and figure it out.

3512
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:46,860
We don't actually have to launch the
rocket to figure out if it's gonna work or

3513
01:47:46,861 --> 01:47:47,160
not.

3514
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,550
Tell you what day would see
him and I'm from Missouri.

3515
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,550
Missouri is the show.

3516
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:51,810
May state you want,

3517
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,690
you want to sell me one
of your nuclear weapons.

3518
01:47:54,691 --> 01:47:57,540
Look up at the big screen
here we see the first one.

3519
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,990
This is like 1945 there it says up there,

3520
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:01,770
boom,

3521
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:02,221
that's it.

3522
01:48:02,221 --> 01:48:03,300
Manhattan project.

3523
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:04,920
Here we go,

3524
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:05,754
bitches.

3525
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,570
Boom.

3526
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:09,270
1945 again,

3527
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,590
drop another one.

3528
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:13,860
1945 Nagasaki,

3529
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,790
boom.

3530
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:15,893
One more.

3531
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,320
Then you see all of the nuclear tests
and that's when it gets really squirly.

3532
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:27,350
The two that were used in war combined
with the one that was used to figure out

3533
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:29,430
if it fucking works and
look at these in the ocean.

3534
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:34,430
They just let a couple up because a film
in the ocean and 47 and then in the the

3535
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:37,440
19th and 48 like the 50s like that one,

3536
01:48:37,441 --> 01:48:37,591
two,

3537
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:38,161
three boom,

3538
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:38,281
boom,

3539
01:48:38,281 --> 01:48:39,000
boom.

3540
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,130
I mean it was so far we're up to how many?

3541
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:42,091
Boom,

3542
01:48:42,091 --> 01:48:42,391
boom,

3543
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:42,750
boom,

3544
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,051
boom,

3545
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:43,380
boom.

3546
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:44,400
Eight for United States,

3547
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:45,180
one for Russia.

3548
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,700
So the u s is winning us
is winning is still good?

3549
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:48,361
Yeah,

3550
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:49,680
we're way with Russia.

3551
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,120
Russia's like that crazy.

3552
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,871
Look at this.

3553
01:48:51,871 --> 01:48:52,111
Boom,

3554
01:48:52,111 --> 01:48:52,261
boom,

3555
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:52,471
boom.

3556
01:48:52,471 --> 01:48:52,800
We just,

3557
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:57,800
now we have 17 by 1951
24 we have 32 33 boom,

3558
01:48:58,571 --> 01:48:58,731
boom,

3559
01:48:58,731 --> 01:48:58,851
boom,

3560
01:48:58,851 --> 01:48:59,011
boom,

3561
01:48:59,011 --> 01:48:59,580
boom cannon.

3562
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:00,530
A bunch go off in the [inaudible]

3563
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,091
desert.

3564
01:49:01,091 --> 01:49:01,310
Look at,

3565
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:03,950
look at how many would blow up in Nevada.

3566
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,030
The reason why gambling

3567
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:05,861
legal right there.

3568
01:49:05,861 --> 01:49:06,400
By the way,

3569
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,990
I liked the one random one in Australia.

3570
01:49:07,991 --> 01:49:08,201
They're like,

3571
01:49:08,201 --> 01:49:08,411
yeah,

3572
01:49:08,411 --> 01:49:08,980
we're good.

3573
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:09,813
Let me figure it.

3574
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,573
Australia.

3575
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:14,060
Russia just blows off a couple more.

3576
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:14,301
Boom,

3577
01:49:14,301 --> 01:49:14,451
boom,

3578
01:49:14,451 --> 01:49:14,591
boom,

3579
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:14,741
boom,

3580
01:49:14,741 --> 01:49:15,130
boom.

3581
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:15,760
So we're up

3582
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,760
the United States up to 70 87 by 1956
we're up to 87 nuclear blasts on hundred

3583
01:49:23,851 --> 01:49:25,800
and 17 by 58

3584
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,213
yeah,

3585
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,700
mutated or the people in that little area.

3586
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:35,290
By the end of 58 we get
up to 196 by the end of 58

3587
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:36,910
damn.

3588
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,020
There's a lot in California.

3589
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,930
Is that California or is that Nevada?

3590
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,030
It looked like California and at the end,

3591
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:44,740
I didn't know there
were any in California.

3592
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:44,981
Yeah,

3593
01:49:44,981 --> 01:49:46,000
it does look very California,

3594
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:46,420
doesn't it?

3595
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:46,800
Yeah,

3596
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,633
it's like million.

3597
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:49,740
Look at all of them.

3598
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,580
Three Oh to look at this.

3599
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:56,730
331 nuclear explosions by 63 there's
no way those are nukes that's got it.

3600
01:49:57,261 --> 01:49:57,750
Wow,

3601
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,810
you're wrong.

3602
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,460
They gotta be testing out some kind
of technology that they're blown up.

3603
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:04,230
Nukes.

3604
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:05,030
That is insane.

3605
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:08,950
They're lightened them bitches up like
a Christmas tree and that's why you can

3606
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:13,540
get that $4 steak and
eggs breakfast in Vegas.

3607
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:16,413
We wonder,

3608
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,520
we wonder why everybody has cancer.

3609
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:24,390
They're up to 580590600 blast by 69

3610
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:28,930
by 1969 bro,

3611
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:32,200
by the end of 69 it's up to 663 blacks.

3612
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:33,310
Nixon gets in there and he's like,

3613
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:34,640
we've got to really accelerate things.

3614
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:36,023
Pick up pump.

3615
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:38,770
The Russians are on our tail.

3616
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:39,550
Damn.

3617
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:40,480
Look at Britain.

3618
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:41,261
Britain stops.

3619
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:43,270
It's 26 I think we're good.

3620
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,171
What's so,

3621
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:45,160
what's so weird about this?

3622
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,800
It seems like the u s did
it and then Russia is like,

3623
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:48,634
we got it too.

3624
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,870
And it could have stopped there,

3625
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,960
but we just kept going and
going and finally rush is like,

3626
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:52,301
all right,

3627
01:50:52,301 --> 01:50:53,560
we got to get in also.

3628
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:55,180
Well this was the Cold War Man.

3629
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:55,600
I mean,

3630
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,210
I'm sure Russia had the
same sort of motivation.

3631
01:50:58,211 --> 01:50:58,780
Yeah.

3632
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:03,160
As far as their contractors and the
people that were charging dumb idea,

3633
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:04,660
mutually assured destruction,

3634
01:51:04,661 --> 01:51:06,760
like all these military
ideas from 40 years ago,

3635
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:08,740
we now know are completely ridiculous.

3636
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:09,820
But to look at where it

3637
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:10,723
sat,

3638
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:11,940
it's pull up,

3639
01:51:11,941 --> 01:51:13,230
pull back so we can see the numbers,

3640
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:13,720
Brian.

3641
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,553
Okay.

3642
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,053
What did you do?

3643
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,841
Pull back.

3644
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:18,010
So you're not on the thing.

3645
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:20,080
Yeah,

3646
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,090
it's the animation is
making me have to Piss,

3647
01:51:22,091 --> 01:51:22,450
so,

3648
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:23,283
oh my God.

3649
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:28,500
So animation of all nuclear explosions
from 1945 to 1998 and at the end of 1998

3650
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:35,851
it gets to 1032 nuclear explosions
just from the Unites States of America.

3651
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:40,270
715 from Russia,

3652
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:41,770
210 from,

3653
01:51:41,771 --> 01:51:42,604
what does that,

3654
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:43,623
what does that look?

3655
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:44,843
What fucking

3656
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:46,890
great.

3657
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:47,723
France.

3658
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,440
France has a lot of nuclear explosions.

3659
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,633
Is that France?

3660
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:52,711
What is the blue?

3661
01:51:52,711 --> 01:51:53,544
White and red?

3662
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,663
Yeah.

3663
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:59,340
We supposed to know that is
that Mexico is for Jesus Christ.

3664
01:51:59,341 --> 01:52:03,660
Mexico has four for China's 45
who's the one on the far left?

3665
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,010
Some hippie thing.

3666
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,300
Moon and a star.

3667
01:52:06,301 --> 01:52:07,134
Green and white.

3668
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,490
That's like an Arab country.

3669
01:52:08,491 --> 01:52:09,324
Yeah.

3670
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,111
Wow.

3671
01:52:10,111 --> 01:52:10,944
Pakistan,

3672
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,120
India and Pakistan.

3673
01:52:12,121 --> 01:52:12,751
That's what that is.

3674
01:52:12,751 --> 01:52:16,260
India has for Pakistan as to Jesus Christ.

3675
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:16,980
That's scary.

3676
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:19,890
It's really scary is how much
was on our side of the coast.

3677
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:20,390
You know,

3678
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:21,223
like I don't even,

3679
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:21,451
yeah,

3680
01:52:21,451 --> 01:52:22,650
we're nuclear cannot be good.

3681
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:23,963
Maybe it's great.

3682
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,560
Maybe that's why California is awesome.

3683
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:29,070
What does it found out that like a little
bit of radiation is fucking super good

3684
01:52:29,071 --> 01:52:31,170
for you and it makes
really smart people get it.

3685
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:36,840
And the lack of the lack of
nuclear radiation that they
have and like New Jersey

3686
01:52:36,841 --> 01:52:37,950
is what's the real problem?

3687
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:41,420
They need to detonate a couple nukes
in New Jersey and fucking straightened

3688
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:42,090
everybody out.

3689
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:42,390
I'm like,

3690
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,223
oh,

3691
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,153
now we get it.

3692
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:45,170
We just need a little,

3693
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:45,830
uh,

3694
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:46,070
just

3695
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,360
a little bit of radiation in the air.

3696
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,460
I used to think that maybe
cigarettes were probably,

3697
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:50,870
I was when I was competing,

3698
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:54,290
I think that cigarettes may be
like a workout for your lungs,

3699
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,340
that if you could,

3700
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:57,530
if you could lift a little
weights with your lungs,

3701
01:52:57,531 --> 01:53:01,310
but like if he smoked cigarettes that
your lungs and have to like fight against

3702
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:01,790
that,

3703
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:02,650
the cigarette smoke.

3704
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:05,300
And it'd be like lifting weights
to dumbest idea I've ever had,

3705
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:10,040
but it's not too far off from
those like air trainers like those,

3706
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:10,311
uh,

3707
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:11,930
those oxygen things where they,

3708
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:15,860
you're supposed to suck on those like
boss route and had that air trainer h two

3709
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:16,400
o trainer.

3710
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,330
It's your air intake,

3711
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:17,720
right?

3712
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:17,871
Yeah,

3713
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:21,260
I don't think those work man
is a guy who a mock them.

3714
01:53:21,790 --> 01:53:22,160
Um,

3715
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,750
but then I saw hypoxia,

3716
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:26,300
like there was a Victor
Conte video on Hypoxia,

3717
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:27,350
which is real similar.

3718
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:30,260
They do doing like heavy
a high endurance training,

3719
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,260
high intensity and Durrance training
and they do it with like restricted

3720
01:53:33,261 --> 01:53:33,621
breathing.

3721
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:35,480
So I don't know who was right about that.

3722
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:38,510
Altitude is supposed to be where it's at,

3723
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:41,060
like sleeping in the altitude,

3724
01:53:41,061 --> 01:53:41,510
but,

3725
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:46,090
but working out in an area where
it's got plenty of oxygen so that,

3726
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:50,240
that seems contrary to me because the
idea is that not restrict your oxygen

3727
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:51,800
intake while you're exercising,

3728
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,660
but restricting it while you're resting.

3729
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:54,860
That's what's supposed to be good.

3730
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,390
Your body realizes like,

3731
01:53:56,391 --> 01:53:56,601
bitch,

3732
01:53:56,601 --> 01:53:57,740
we ain't going to the air up here.

3733
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:00,410
And then it starts pumping out
all these extra blood cells.

3734
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:00,980
Hmm.

3735
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,450
You see the article that uh,

3736
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:05,390
they found a way to inject
oxygen into somebody's body.

3737
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,260
Yeah.

3738
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:08,210
Keeps you from drowning
for like 20 seconds.

3739
01:54:08,211 --> 01:54:08,960
That's amazing.

3740
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,201
Yeah.

3741
01:54:09,201 --> 01:54:09,891
That's for now.

3742
01:54:09,891 --> 01:54:10,790
It's 20 seconds.

3743
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:12,020
Who knows what it's going to be?

3744
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:13,190
It's going to be like the abyss.

3745
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,620
I was just thinking that we're going to
have the abyss suits where it fills up

3746
01:54:15,621 --> 01:54:17,720
with liquid and we can
go down to the bottom.

3747
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:19,880
That movie kicked ass until the very end.

3748
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:20,991
The very end.

3749
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:24,020
They ruined the whole mood when
you see what the thing looks like.

3750
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:25,110
But space ship.

3751
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:26,240
Uh Yup.

3752
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:27,770
Dumb fucking toys.

3753
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:30,830
Irs thing that comes out of
the water and you're like,

3754
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:31,664
what?

3755
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:33,140
That's not a spaceship.

3756
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:36,170
That's why I liked the movies where the
director has disciplined to leave it to

3757
01:54:36,171 --> 01:54:37,004
your imagination.

3758
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,110
It's hard though.

3759
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:38,750
People,

3760
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,583
people are dumb.

3761
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:39,941
Yeah,

3762
01:54:39,941 --> 01:54:40,880
we're rolling through the whole,

3763
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:44,090
I move that land on the moon
where you are even know.

3764
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:47,870
I mean was there a Werewolf I
didn't even get a good book to have.

3765
01:54:47,871 --> 01:54:50,180
It won't be able to see what it is.

3766
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,410
Well that's like Jj Abrams.

3767
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:53,420
I feel like he's always like a smoke moms.

3768
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:57,140
He's got you like right on the edge of
your seat and then you never get the

3769
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,153
final.

3770
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:01,010
You just want to know what
he could make up anything.

3771
01:55:01,011 --> 01:55:01,761
You just want to know.

3772
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:04,040
You want to have some kind of
certainty and he doesn't give you that.

3773
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:04,821
Well,

3774
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:06,140
he gave me a smoke monster though.

3775
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:09,560
He can go fuck himself with
that fucking smoke monster.

3776
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:10,310
Did you say that?

3777
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,660
That today in California,

3778
01:55:11,661 --> 01:55:13,040
they're trying to figure
out if they want to make,

3779
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:13,480
uh,

3780
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,310
the gray wolf and endangered
specie in California.

3781
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,300
I didn't even know there was great.

3782
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:17,630
Wilson,

3783
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:18,370
California.

3784
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:18,911
Yeah.

3785
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:19,570
Well,

3786
01:55:19,570 --> 01:55:20,720
Gray Wolf's.

3787
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:23,500
Here's the issue with wolves,

3788
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:25,030
and this is something that Steve,

3789
01:55:25,031 --> 01:55:26,200
a Rinella brought up.

3790
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:27,850
They're exactly the same.

3791
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:29,440
Like wolves everywhere.

3792
01:55:29,441 --> 01:55:31,390
It's all this one species of wolf,

3793
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:34,510
but that's the same with humans.

3794
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,330
And some wolves are bigger,

3795
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,310
just like some humans are bigger.

3796
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,740
If you brought a bunch of Germans,

3797
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:44,280
big giant German

3798
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:44,671
people,

3799
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:46,890
and then imported them into Japan,

3800
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:48,750
they started dominating and people said,

3801
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:48,871
well,

3802
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:49,081
hey,

3803
01:55:49,081 --> 01:55:50,250
it's the same species.

3804
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:52,410
We just brought people from another place.

3805
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,400
It's the same thing.

3806
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:54,563
No,

3807
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:54,781
no.

3808
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:59,781
You're changing the environment by
bringing in these much larger versions of

3809
01:56:00,031 --> 01:56:04,230
what used to exist here and the wolves
that you're seeing in like Yellowstone,

3810
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:05,760
these reintroduced wolves,

3811
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:09,660
they're from Canada and they're big.

3812
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:12,060
They're like 150 plus pounds.

3813
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,020
Big But polite.

3814
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:13,690
No,

3815
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:14,523
they're rude.

3816
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,380
They kill a lot of animals.

3817
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,161
But the,

3818
01:56:17,161 --> 01:56:19,260
the wolves that used
to be in North America,

3819
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:20,130
we're smaller.

3820
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:20,761
See,

3821
01:56:20,761 --> 01:56:22,560
there's a thing that happens in,

3822
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:22,801
uh,

3823
01:56:22,801 --> 01:56:23,634
with um,

3824
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:28,050
mammals and it has to do with the
amount of cold these mammals have to

3825
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:28,884
experience.

3826
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:31,050
And the more cold they have to experience,

3827
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:33,120
the larger their body sizes.

3828
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:38,300
That's why polar bears are so fucking big
and you go to like d dear is a perfect

3829
01:56:39,301 --> 01:56:40,080
example.

3830
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,960
Deer in Mexico have much smaller bodies.

3831
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:44,640
Then deer in Canada,

3832
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,960
deer and Canada,

3833
01:56:45,961 --> 01:56:50,100
like in Alberta and all these
Saskatchewan giant deer,

3834
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:51,960
the 300 plus pounds,

3835
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,370
some of the big males,

3836
01:56:53,371 --> 01:56:54,204
the big bucks.

3837
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:58,050
But if you take a deer that's
the same age and it's in Mexico,

3838
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,610
it might only be a hundred pounds.

3839
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,800
So the further north you go,

3840
01:57:01,801 --> 01:57:05,550
the more the animal needs to
generate heat from body mass.

3841
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:08,730
I wonder if that's why whales are so big
because they go so deep that they're in

3842
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,990
a super cold,

3843
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:11,640
like barely freezing kind of thing.

3844
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:12,000
Right.

3845
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,691
It makes sense.

3846
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:13,524
It's a mammal.

3847
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,011
I mean,

3848
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:17,490
this is something that they've attributed
to this reason why grizzly bears and

3849
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:18,690
polar bears are so big.

3850
01:57:18,691 --> 01:57:19,980
It's like as you get north,

3851
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:23,730
the the same species of
animal tends to be larger.

3852
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,230
Pretty fascinating stuff,

3853
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:25,980
man.

3854
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:29,520
Pretty fascinating and completely make
sense with these Canadian wolves because

3855
01:57:29,521 --> 01:57:30,630
their biggest fuck.

3856
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,790
Whereas the American wolves were smaller.

3857
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:33,990
They just were always like,

3858
01:57:33,991 --> 01:57:34,201
you know,

3859
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:35,340
60 70 pounds,

3860
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:35,671
whatever.

3861
01:57:35,671 --> 01:57:40,320
So when they brought over these big ass
fucking wolves from Canada and they have

3862
01:57:40,321 --> 01:57:41,670
that DNA in them,

3863
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:43,680
the big Ass Wolf Dna,

3864
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:48,740
these just decimating elk
and deer populations in an
areas where they're at and

3865
01:57:48,931 --> 01:57:52,540
they've re-instituted
hunting on them now that,

3866
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:55,980
so they brought them in and now they've
got hunting and trapping and people in

3867
01:57:55,981 --> 01:58:00,090
Alaska and a lot of parts of North
America where they have a lot of wolves.

3868
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,760
They have wolf season now
you can go hunting wolves.

3869
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,130
I could never shoot
something that's a dog.

3870
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:06,043
Yeah,

3871
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:07,010
it's going to go whoa.

3872
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:07,920
Oh yes you could.

3873
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,150
I could do a bear.

3874
01:58:09,151 --> 01:58:10,620
I could do almost anything else.

3875
01:58:10,621 --> 01:58:11,420
Can't do a dog.

3876
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:14,880
You couldn't do a dog if it was
coming after you eat your family.

3877
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:15,870
If I had to,

3878
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:16,704
uh,

3879
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:17,971
listen man,

3880
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:22,350
if you were a rancher and you watched a
super PAC like they've had in Siberia,

3881
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:27,300
Siberia hasn't legitimate wolf problem
and Siberia at one point in time,

3882
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:29,010
you know the story of World War One,

3883
01:58:29,011 --> 01:58:30,090
the wolf a thing,

3884
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:31,890
the Germans and the Russians,

3885
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:34,050
they call us a cease fire.

3886
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:38,010
Wolves caused a cease fire because so
many of the soldiers were getting killed

3887
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:38,844
by wolves.

3888
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:39,361
As I said,

3889
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:39,571
hey,

3890
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:39,781
hey,

3891
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:39,991
hey,

3892
01:58:39,991 --> 01:58:40,171
hey,

3893
01:58:40,171 --> 01:58:40,500
hey.

3894
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,480
They ran into a super
PAC and while they were,

3895
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:46,240
the two armies were connecting with
each other while they were exchanging,

3896
01:58:46,241 --> 01:58:47,530
they would send out like scouts,

3897
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:51,520
scouts get eaten by wolves and so they
would find like these bodies like,

3898
01:58:51,521 --> 01:58:51,731
you know,

3899
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:53,980
with their boots on and
the a foot and the boot,

3900
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:54,521
you know,

3901
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:54,880
and the,

3902
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,540
everything else is just
smashed and destroyed and
they realize there's these big

3903
01:58:58,541 --> 01:59:00,250
ass wolf bill wolf type stuff.

3904
01:59:00,251 --> 01:59:00,730
Yeah,

3905
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:04,090
it's fascinating because they
actually had a meeting and they,

3906
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:04,331
you know,

3907
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:04,601
they said,

3908
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:04,811
okay,

3909
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:06,490
let's truce ceasefire.

3910
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,780
Let's go kill these fucking wolves.

3911
01:59:07,781 --> 01:59:08,890
Then we'll go back to killing each other.

3912
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,090
So they had a cease fire,

3913
01:59:10,091 --> 01:59:11,980
killed all the walls and
then went back to war.

3914
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,740
It's crazy.

3915
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:15,290
But,

3916
01:59:15,290 --> 01:59:17,980
but that can happen with wolves.

3917
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:22,630
Wolves can develop super pacs and a in
Siberia they started taking out horses

3918
01:59:22,631 --> 01:59:27,631
and farm animals and they would go a
hundred wolf strong and just invade a farm

3919
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:28,870
and good fucking luck stomp.

3920
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:29,530
And um,

3921
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:33,490
they figured out a way to get over the
fences and then they would just go crazy.

3922
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,810
When things get collaborative,

3923
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:35,770
you get a lot more power.

3924
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,850
It's like the same as dolphins.

3925
01:59:36,851 --> 01:59:40,450
One Dolphin can't do anything but a
whole pack of them can kill a shark,

3926
01:59:40,451 --> 01:59:41,080
I think.

3927
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:41,411
Yeah.

3928
01:59:41,411 --> 01:59:43,900
Well dolphins are really good
at at least fucking sharks up.

3929
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:46,000
Orchids kill sharks on irregular orchids.

3930
01:59:46,001 --> 01:59:46,571
They're so smart.

3931
01:59:46,571 --> 01:59:48,490
They figured out how to
kill sharks the easy way.

3932
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:49,750
Like they,

3933
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:50,101
you know,

3934
01:59:50,101 --> 01:59:51,790
they can communicate
with each other and talk.

3935
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:52,690
We don't know what they're saying,

3936
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:53,590
but we know they're talking,

3937
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:54,640
they figured it out.

3938
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:57,760
How to pass the knowledge from generation
to generation that the way to kill a

3939
01:59:57,761 --> 01:59:58,900
shark is you bite it.

3940
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:02,950
And then you flip it upside down when
you flip a shark upside down were like

3941
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,660
really old designs.

3942
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:05,920
Their designs suck.

3943
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:10,780
It's like God got to them and it was like
he wasn't really good at making shit.

3944
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:15,580
Then it's like old cars like
try driving like a 1970,

3945
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:16,960
you know Plymouth,

3946
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:18,220
their suspensions,

3947
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:19,151
dog shit,

3948
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:20,260
their breaks suck.

3949
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,390
No seatbelts.

3950
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,380
Steering is so vague.

3951
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:25,010
You don't know what it's transmitted.

3952
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:26,770
Their dog shit cars.

3953
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:28,330
That's what a shark is.

3954
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:29,770
The dog shit animal.

3955
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:31,600
Like the design was terrible.

3956
02:00:31,601 --> 02:00:34,360
They have to keep moving and
if you flip them upside down,

3957
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:35,194
they just,

3958
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:35,500
yeah,

3959
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,970
they just bunk out and die.

3960
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,260
So the org has grab them.

3961
02:00:38,261 --> 02:00:41,600
I just flip them upside down and hold
on in women's around them and then they

3962
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:42,040
eat them.

3963
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:45,120
That's such a sign of intelligence that
they found the cheat code to killing a

3964
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,930
what would be their biggest predator?

3965
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:47,201
Yeah,

3966
02:00:47,201 --> 02:00:47,770
that's the,

3967
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:50,920
well that is the only
Predator that they would have.

3968
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:51,491
I mean,

3969
02:00:51,491 --> 02:00:53,140
they would have to
worry about them around.

3970
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:54,250
They're small,

3971
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,180
they're cubs,

3972
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,313
the babies.

3973
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:56,990
But,

3974
02:00:56,990 --> 02:00:57,370
uh,

3975
02:00:57,370 --> 02:01:01,450
an Orca is like way smarter
and more powerful than shark
shark is just an idiot.

3976
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,280
So the arc is the ORC is
basically like a human being.

3977
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,931
The shark,

3978
02:01:04,931 --> 02:01:08,590
the shark is almost like a biological
robot in the same way that spiders are

3979
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:08,920
like,

3980
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:09,460
yes,

3981
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:10,480
of any animal.

3982
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:15,460
Spiders are the only one where I got
curious and research them online.

3983
02:01:15,461 --> 02:01:16,660
And the more I read,

3984
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:19,210
the less I liked them because normally
like no matter what it is like,

3985
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:19,631
Oh shit,

3986
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:20,261
they can do that.

3987
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:21,070
That's amazing.

3988
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:24,970
And I got to the point where it was a
video and it was the mating ritual of

3989
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:27,370
jumping spiders and it's these,

3990
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:28,300
it first I was like,

3991
02:01:28,301 --> 02:01:28,661
Oh shit,

3992
02:01:28,661 --> 02:01:31,300
I am going to like spiders because what
they do to attract each other as the

3993
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:32,890
male like pounds his,

3994
02:01:32,891 --> 02:01:33,160
uh,

3995
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,680
legs on the ground and
the sound vibrations,

3996
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:38,550
I guess stimulate the female
in some way and pull that.

3997
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:38,990
Yeah.

3998
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:39,630
So,

3999
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:40,100
uh,

4000
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,930
so what happened in the
video though is like,

4001
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:42,741
um,

4002
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:43,880
if I'm remembering correctly,

4003
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:45,290
the male jumping spider,

4004
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:48,140
it looks like he's going to get some
and they zoom in on his eyes and you're

4005
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:48,260
like,

4006
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:48,490
oh,

4007
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:50,360
like if the spider could be happy,

4008
02:01:50,361 --> 02:01:51,470
this spider is probably happy,

4009
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:51,711
right?

4010
02:01:51,711 --> 02:01:52,250
Like,

4011
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,040
and then it looks like the
female was about to get mounted,

4012
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,050
which it takes a big
fucking bite out and like,

4013
02:01:57,051 --> 02:01:57,680
wow.

4014
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:01,700
And then just jumps off and he jumps off
in the other direction and you can see

4015
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:02,840
the guts and like,

4016
02:02:02,841 --> 02:02:03,141
you know what?

4017
02:02:03,141 --> 02:02:03,974
Fuck spiders,

4018
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,090
zero respect.

4019
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:06,350
Because I was starting to think like,

4020
02:02:06,351 --> 02:02:07,430
I shouldn't kill spiders.

4021
02:02:07,431 --> 02:02:08,420
If I see them in my apartment,

4022
02:02:08,421 --> 02:02:11,600
I should leave them alone or let
them take the time to let them out.

4023
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:12,051
This is it.

4024
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:12,884
I think,

4025
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,823
okay,

4026
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,140
we'll get these little bastards.

4027
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:16,711
Well,

4028
02:02:16,711 --> 02:02:17,544
they're evil.

4029
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:19,650
They have no morals.

4030
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,401
The robots,

4031
02:02:20,401 --> 02:02:23,460
they don't know how to seek out protein.

4032
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:24,271
Yeah.

4033
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:25,104
And they have venom.

4034
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:25,981
They're,

4035
02:02:25,981 --> 02:02:26,311
they're,

4036
02:02:26,311 --> 02:02:27,144
they're creepy.

4037
02:02:27,150 --> 02:02:27,361
I mean,

4038
02:02:27,361 --> 02:02:28,860
just the idea of black widows,

4039
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:32,040
a Saml necrosis is such a dick move.

4040
02:02:32,041 --> 02:02:33,600
Like it's not bad enough
that you love to bite.

4041
02:02:33,601 --> 02:02:37,890
You got to like the whole thing's got to
rot out over time and some of them can

4042
02:02:37,891 --> 02:02:39,990
kill a person pretty easy.

4043
02:02:39,991 --> 02:02:40,411
Like there's,

4044
02:02:40,411 --> 02:02:43,150
there's certain spiders like um,

4045
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:48,270
those brown recluses that
just do unbelievable damage
with one of their stings.

4046
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:52,100
If you want to never go into the woods
again or ever leave your apartment,

4047
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,320
just do a Google image search for reckless

4048
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,263
bites.

4049
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:55,631
Yeah,

4050
02:02:55,631 --> 02:02:56,464
they're horrible.

4051
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,440
The necrosis aspect of it is
one of the grossest things.

4052
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:02,500
It just causes all the flesh
to die around the wound.

4053
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:03,400
Yeah.

4054
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:04,190
Oof.

4055
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:04,570
I don't know.

4056
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:06,010
This is the one that I
saw because I didn't,

4057
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,390
I don't remember there being captions,

4058
02:03:07,391 --> 02:03:11,410
but it's the same idea cause this is
what they do to attract each other,

4059
02:03:11,411 --> 02:03:14,740
but there's a good chance whenever they
do this ritual that the female will

4060
02:03:14,741 --> 02:03:15,700
choose to eat the mail.

4061
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:17,530
And that right there is
a sign of insanity to me.

4062
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:19,610
I think emails larger all the time.

4063
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:23,660
He's trying to fuck you and show you a
good time with his leg dance and you tear

4064
02:03:23,661 --> 02:03:24,494
his,

4065
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:25,580
his abdomen out.

4066
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:26,151
Well,

4067
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:27,690
the matriarchal society,

4068
02:03:27,691 --> 02:03:29,600
it's like common in bugs.

4069
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,920
It's in ants.

4070
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,060
You know an answer.

4071
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:35,000
There's a lot of female
ants that the queen,

4072
02:03:35,001 --> 02:03:35,900
they kill the,

4073
02:03:35,901 --> 02:03:36,021
uh,

4074
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:38,240
the males and they deal with
the way they breathe with them.

4075
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:39,440
They cut his wings off,

4076
02:03:39,441 --> 02:03:43,610
they cut his legs off and they take
them into the hive and breed with them

4077
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,120
there.

4078
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,530
And he said,

4079
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:46,100
it doesn't even look as a jumping spider.

4080
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,710
It doesn't even look real horrible.

4081
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:51,320
So strange looking.

4082
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:52,830
There's actually a meme.

4083
02:03:52,831 --> 02:03:54,270
It's like misunderstood spider.

4084
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:55,590
And uh,

4085
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:56,933
he's like,

4086
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:57,781
oh great,

4087
02:03:57,781 --> 02:03:58,561
what are you doing over there?

4088
02:03:58,561 --> 02:03:58,790
He's like,

4089
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:59,021
you,

4090
02:03:59,021 --> 02:03:59,470
you bitch.

4091
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:02,110
You just sprayed me and his eyes.

4092
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:04,810
What a creepy fucking bug.

4093
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,700
It's weird.

4094
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:07,000
The same world that evolved,

4095
02:04:07,001 --> 02:04:08,620
that thing also evolved us.

4096
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,210
I watched a video the day,

4097
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:13,480
I didn't know kingsnakes were
so gangster because you know,

4098
02:04:13,481 --> 02:04:15,760
king snakes have no venom.

4099
02:04:16,030 --> 02:04:17,110
So I always thought like,

4100
02:04:17,111 --> 02:04:18,880
king snakes are just like gardens next.

4101
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:19,841
Oh No,

4102
02:04:19,841 --> 02:04:20,081
no,

4103
02:04:20,081 --> 02:04:20,760
no.

4104
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:24,040
King snakes eat rattlesnakes hole.

4105
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:27,520
You got to pull up a video of a
king snake eating a rattlesnake.

4106
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:28,750
I had no fucking idea.

4107
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:33,370
Kingsnakes have a certain protein in
their body that diffuses rattlesnake venom

4108
02:04:33,371 --> 02:04:34,420
and makes them immune to it.

4109
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:36,010
That's a Predator's Predator right there.

4110
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,210
They don't even have teeth,

4111
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:40,740
but they just dash onto
a fucking rattlesnake.

4112
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:41,970
Get Ahold of that bitch,

4113
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:45,870
screw them up tight and start
swallowing them whole headfirst.

4114
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:47,460
They get ahold of him so fast.

4115
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,470
The rattlesnake doesn't even
have a chance to bite him.

4116
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:52,290
Clamp a hold of his head and
just stretch their mouth out.

4117
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:52,750
Sorry.

4118
02:04:52,750 --> 02:04:57,750
I mean the difference being like Joey
Diaz eating you like not that much

4119
02:04:58,621 --> 02:04:59,640
difference in size,

4120
02:04:59,641 --> 02:05:00,930
like not enough where you would go.

4121
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:03,840
How is Joey get David
Semen in his whole body?

4122
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,473
A book.

4123
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:08,530
But this is like a choice
meal for the kingsnakes.

4124
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:09,383
The Joey snake.

4125
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:09,601
Yeah.

4126
02:05:09,601 --> 02:05:10,470
Look at this snake.

4127
02:05:10,471 --> 02:05:11,840
I mean evil looking motherfucker,

4128
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:13,260
but look at that evil fucker.

4129
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:13,921
You would think.

4130
02:05:13,921 --> 02:05:16,140
Now the rattlesnake is a big fat,

4131
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,520
evil look and snake.

4132
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:21,990
That's gotta be the key Predator here
and this king snake doesn't know what the

4133
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:22,824
hell he's doing.

4134
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:23,020
Boy,

4135
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:24,420
he's going near that rattlesnake.

4136
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:27,870
He's going to get killed and eaten and no,

4137
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,360
the rattlesnake eats
a bunch of pussy mice.

4138
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:33,270
This is why you can't expect
perfection in government does.

4139
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:34,290
This is the alternative.

4140
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:35,730
Look at this like rose,

4141
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:36,960
like we should get back to nature.

4142
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,830
We should be more in touch.

4143
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:39,180
This is fucking awful.

4144
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:40,440
Like it's good that we broke free.

4145
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:42,240
Nature's ruthless.

4146
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:46,710
You don't want to get back to nature
because nature does give no fucks about

4147
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:46,861
you.

4148
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:47,580
Look at this,

4149
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,413
look at this thing.

4150
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,520
It gets up to the
rattlesnake and it's like,

4151
02:05:50,521 --> 02:05:51,354
hi,

4152
02:05:51,810 --> 02:05:52,643
how you doing?

4153
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:54,301
Hey,

4154
02:05:54,301 --> 02:05:55,140
I've got a question for you.

4155
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,070
Um,

4156
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:57,540
do you mind if I get
your fucking ass hole?

4157
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:58,680
Look at that.

4158
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:01,260
Clamps a hold of it and runs with it.

4159
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,830
Drags his big fat rattlesnakes.

4160
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:04,890
It's the size of it.

4161
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:08,100
Look at the width of the rattlesnake
and look at the width of its body.

4162
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:09,750
It's the same size.

4163
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,800
Look at that thing.

4164
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:13,850
It's swallowing something
that's the same size.

4165
02:06:13,851 --> 02:06:14,684
Is it?

4166
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:15,720
That's ambition.

4167
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,160
It's ruthless.

4168
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:18,601
It's nature,

4169
02:06:18,601 --> 02:06:19,050
right?

4170
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:19,450
Yeah.

4171
02:06:19,450 --> 02:06:21,330
Nature's that evil fucking cunt.

4172
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,770
While we're on the topic of snakes.

4173
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:27,771
Have you seen that youtube video where
the snake charmer is charming the Cobra

4174
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:32,340
and then gets right up to it and kisses
it on the head and then backs away?

4175
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:33,030
No.

4176
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:35,430
You gotta watch this cause
it's like inspirational.

4177
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:35,761
Yeah,

4178
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:37,680
but you know they take the
teeth out of those things.

4179
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:38,341
Is that what it is?

4180
02:06:38,341 --> 02:06:40,980
So he doesn't care if it
bites him up the same.

4181
02:06:40,981 --> 02:06:42,180
You've got to do it with a live one.

4182
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:43,830
There's cool videos of like,

4183
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:48,070
like these really dangerous scary
like snakes with babies in the,

4184
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:51,110
and it's just like wrapping around the
baby and trying to bite the baby's face

4185
02:06:51,111 --> 02:06:53,610
that they tap the baby's
forehead with her nose,

4186
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:55,920
with their teeth don't come out
because they had him removed.

4187
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:56,761
That's not right.

4188
02:06:56,761 --> 02:06:57,594
I'm in fair.

4189
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:59,790
I'm in favor of a fair fight.

4190
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,320
Fuck a fair fight,

4191
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:01,651
dude.

4192
02:07:01,651 --> 02:07:02,790
You would never have steak.

4193
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:04,680
There was a fair fight.

4194
02:07:04,681 --> 02:07:06,090
You would never get a cheeseburger.

4195
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:09,750
Do you understand that if there's
fair fights you lose every time,

4196
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:11,940
you're not going to get meat from a bowl.

4197
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:13,650
How even you going to get close?

4198
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:17,070
What's the fair fight fair fight
means for every one of them we kill.

4199
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:18,120
They kill one of us.

4200
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,350
Fuck man.

4201
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:23,220
We would lay off stake a long
time ago you were talking with,

4202
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:26,370
with great passion about your
cheeseburger and a beer you had.

4203
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:27,540
Those don't exist.

4204
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:30,450
Look at this snake pop
and this little kid in ad.

4205
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:31,591
First of all,

4206
02:07:31,591 --> 02:07:32,700
those people are assholes.

4207
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:33,990
Sorry Nicholas.

4208
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:38,590
Why even let kid getting relaxed
about being around a fucking snake.

4209
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:40,420
This is like the real
life Xbox right here.

4210
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:42,220
This is how it is in
some parts of the world.

4211
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:43,180
Yeah.

4212
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:43,511
Yeah.

4213
02:07:43,511 --> 02:07:45,040
Look how horrible this is though.

4214
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,420
This fucking poor baby.

4215
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:49,300
Like it's getting tapped on the
head that things trying to kill him.

4216
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:52,420
That thing is trying to kill that baby.

4217
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,310
Whether or not it
actually kills that baby.

4218
02:07:54,311 --> 02:07:54,731
It's still,

4219
02:07:54,731 --> 02:07:56,440
you're letting some heartless,

4220
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:57,280
vicious thing.

4221
02:07:57,281 --> 02:07:58,480
Try to kill your baby.

4222
02:07:58,510 --> 02:07:59,310
Yeah.

4223
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:00,230
Poke it in the eye.

4224
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:01,810
Just observes him afterwards like,

4225
02:08:01,811 --> 02:08:02,620
Huh,

4226
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,453
yeah,

4227
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:04,391
but look at this.

4228
02:08:04,391 --> 02:08:06,100
It's like trying to grab her.

4229
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:07,660
Oh my God,

4230
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,570
that's so disturbing that Oh my God.

4231
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:13,490
And what's crazy is started in the
fucking starts wrapping around the babies,

4232
02:08:13,491 --> 02:08:13,821
which is,

4233
02:08:13,821 --> 02:08:17,590
I don't think it's cool at all
because I mean that's still got it.

4234
02:08:17,591 --> 02:08:17,700
Well,

4235
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:19,620
I'm glad you took a stand serious,

4236
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:21,400
serious party foul.

4237
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:23,600
But I mean I understand like
it's Kinda cute having a snake,

4238
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:24,410
man.

4239
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:24,960
This right here

4240
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:25,890
grabbed it.

4241
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:26,761
Yeah,

4242
02:08:26,761 --> 02:08:27,320
and that's when the,

4243
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:27,570
the,

4244
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:30,690
the baby probably got really fucked
up and they stopped the video.

4245
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:32,190
That's just wrong man.

4246
02:08:32,191 --> 02:08:34,530
You let your baby wrestle a fucking Cobra.

4247
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:36,000
How much do you hate your kids?

4248
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,430
Let a Cobra Bite your baby.

4249
02:08:38,431 --> 02:08:40,980
If a Cobra even with no teeth bit my baby,

4250
02:08:40,981 --> 02:08:42,900
I'd punt that thing to the fucking moon.

4251
02:08:42,901 --> 02:08:43,830
It's just tough love.

4252
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:44,850
That's a belt.

4253
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:46,350
That's that thing is a belt.

4254
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:47,100
Sorry,

4255
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:47,791
pair of boots.

4256
02:08:47,791 --> 02:08:49,080
You give up your life.

4257
02:08:49,470 --> 02:08:50,281
You give up your life.

4258
02:08:50,281 --> 02:08:51,570
You tried to pick a baby,

4259
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:52,623
right?

4260
02:08:53,610 --> 02:08:55,110
So crazy evil.

4261
02:08:55,111 --> 02:08:56,040
Fucking creepy.

4262
02:08:56,041 --> 02:08:58,440
Fanned out snake asshole.

4263
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:00,090
That's just so goofy.

4264
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,460
I don't need to see this anymore,

4265
02:09:02,461 --> 02:09:02,701
man.

4266
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:04,980
This is disturbing asshole parents.

4267
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:08,430
Shitty fucking bad.

4268
02:09:08,670 --> 02:09:10,860
Snake charmer fucking parents.

4269
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:13,450
David [inaudible]

4270
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:13,981
thinking about it.

4271
02:09:13,981 --> 02:09:14,814
He's like,

4272
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:15,571
David,

4273
02:09:15,571 --> 02:09:16,620
are you gonna have a baby someday?

4274
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:17,783
Do you want a baby?

4275
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:19,231
I want kids.

4276
02:09:19,231 --> 02:09:20,064
I don't want to baby.

4277
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:20,401
You know,

4278
02:09:20,401 --> 02:09:20,851
like Ah,

4279
02:09:20,851 --> 02:09:22,540
I'm willing to like doesn't work though.

4280
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:24,000
I'm willing to deal with the baby phase,

4281
02:09:24,001 --> 02:09:24,781
but that's not what I want.

4282
02:09:24,781 --> 02:09:26,220
I want like the foster dad,

4283
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:27,060
big brother,

4284
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:31,260
but I want it to be biologically related
to me cause I think that this sounds

4285
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:32,880
really selfish and like full of Shit.

4286
02:09:32,881 --> 02:09:37,680
But I think that one of the only ways
that we gain in mortality is the fact that

4287
02:09:37,681 --> 02:09:39,930
we're allowing part of us to carry on.

4288
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,520
And I think it's really
cool to think about like,

4289
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:41,701
oh,

4290
02:09:41,701 --> 02:09:46,701
I'm part my dad and he's
parked his grandfather and
that this is the way that we

4291
02:09:48,330 --> 02:09:49,560
communicate through thousands.

4292
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:52,610
Severes do you think that that's all
I'm going to go away when there's real

4293
02:09:52,611 --> 02:09:53,780
genetic manipulation?

4294
02:09:54,110 --> 02:09:54,943
Probably.

4295
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:55,521
Yeah.

4296
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:59,510
We're talking about creating an artificial
human being that one day there's

4297
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:02,600
going to be when if pal tro is
going to like design a child.

4298
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:07,010
We're talking about
artificial human beings.

4299
02:10:07,011 --> 02:10:09,800
We're talking about the ability
to duplicate everything.

4300
02:10:09,801 --> 02:10:11,720
When we were talking
about that the old man,

4301
02:10:11,721 --> 02:10:15,210
the 60 year old man who didn't realize
that he never lived a life and then he,

4302
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:17,330
they implanted all these memories
in him and he starts crying.

4303
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:18,530
He was like blade runner,

4304
02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:22,790
like a replicant Jack like Rutger
Hauer like the end when he's just,

4305
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:27,020
he's really almost human and so human
that he actually lets Harrison Ford

4306
02:10:27,021 --> 02:10:27,740
survive.

4307
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:32,150
He said he's got compassion and he is
calculating and totally and when you get

4308
02:10:32,151 --> 02:10:33,980
to that point and then

4309
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,030
you get to the point where you were
able to manipulate genetics and you say,

4310
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:38,571
you know,

4311
02:10:38,571 --> 02:10:38,841
hey,

4312
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:39,081
you know,

4313
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:41,270
I'm just going to stick
with the genetics I've got.

4314
02:10:41,271 --> 02:10:42,104
I mean I'm not,

4315
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,460
I'm not a,

4316
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:47,220
you don't need to make anything any
better and everyone around you is he man,

4317
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:51,560
everyone around you is God damn Madonna's
everyone around you is Michael Jordan

4318
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:52,281
in his prime.

4319
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:55,760
Everyone around you is his giant
super athlete and you just decide,

4320
02:10:55,761 --> 02:10:58,340
I just like being me normal.

4321
02:10:58,341 --> 02:10:59,460
Me and we were,

4322
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:03,170
our society breaks down
between mods and regs,

4323
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:07,400
like no more racism now it's mods
and regs Gatica kind of situation.

4324
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:08,570
Yeah,

4325
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:09,410
like a second.

4326
02:11:09,850 --> 02:11:14,210
It's second tier citizen if
you're not biologically perfect.

4327
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,740
Well it's those,

4328
02:11:15,741 --> 02:11:20,741
there's some things that people had
contemplated or thought may be the case

4329
02:11:20,781 --> 02:11:24,140
someday in the future that have turned
out to be real of great example.

4330
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:26,180
We were talking about
this yesterday was Ed TV,

4331
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:30,440
that Matthew mcconaughey movie where he
played a guy where they just followed a

4332
02:11:30,441 --> 02:11:33,770
regular camera and it was a
show Truman show kind of know,

4333
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:35,080
but it was a real show.

4334
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:38,560
He knew about the Truman show was the
fact that he didn't know about the talent

4335
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,290
show,

4336
02:11:39,290 --> 02:11:43,820
but that a real show was
based on this guy's life.

4337
02:11:43,821 --> 02:11:46,450
Just him living his life and everybody
wanted to know what he was going to do.

4338
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,360
You got to marry the girl,

4339
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:48,440
you're going to get the job,

4340
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:49,191
like what's going to end?

4341
02:11:49,191 --> 02:11:52,550
They're following him around with a camera
and he becomes famous for no reason.

4342
02:11:52,551 --> 02:11:54,650
And then he realized how
crazy is and the end,

4343
02:11:54,651 --> 02:11:57,350
there's supposed to be some sort
of a lesson that we learned.

4344
02:11:57,530 --> 02:11:58,820
Nobody thought that would ever,

4345
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,680
that you couldn't make that movie today.

4346
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:01,041
Why?

4347
02:12:01,041 --> 02:12:04,370
Because that movie is just a reality
show and no one's going to buy a movie

4348
02:12:04,371 --> 02:12:06,380
about a reality show that's stupid.

4349
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:07,130
Like,

4350
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:07,480
well,

4351
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,320
it's like it's some strange thing.

4352
02:12:09,321 --> 02:12:09,460
No,

4353
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:10,850
you've got Kim Kardashian,

4354
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,150
who's the most famous
woman on the planet earth.

4355
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:16,250
She is at TV.

4356
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:17,720
I mean now it's real.

4357
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:21,350
So things like Gatica science fiction,

4358
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:21,741
wow.

4359
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,461
Craziness.

4360
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:26,660
Genetically Modified human beings to
see the the the modified ones versus the

4361
02:12:26,661 --> 02:12:31,250
non modified ones and the elitism of
the separation because of resources.

4362
02:12:31,251 --> 02:12:34,730
The people that can afford to be perfect
and then the rest of the dregs of

4363
02:12:34,731 --> 02:12:35,301
society,

4364
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:39,530
they're out there banging at the door
trying to get into the fucking spaceship.

4365
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:41,790
That's all coming,

4366
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:42,210
man.

4367
02:12:42,210 --> 02:12:42,590
That's,

4368
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:43,550
it's going to happen.

4369
02:12:43,551 --> 02:12:43,880
If,

4370
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:45,290
if we stay alive,

4371
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:46,310
it's going to happen.

4372
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:47,660
There's going to be perfect people.

4373
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:48,920
If you don't have enough bitcoins,

4374
02:12:48,921 --> 02:12:51,510
you don't get into this
space spaceship to Mars via.

4375
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:55,520
It's interesting how like the founding
fathers didn't address stuff like digital

4376
02:12:55,521 --> 02:12:59,270
privacy or where your metadata should
be stored because they could not picture

4377
02:12:59,271 --> 02:12:59,360
it.

4378
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:03,430
They had no idea what a smartphone was
and that was only a few hundred years or

4379
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,131
less than that.

4380
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:04,911
Clinton could have been,

4381
02:13:04,911 --> 02:13:07,730
could have saw it coming
and so no one saw it coming.

4382
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:08,630
We're also talking about like,

4383
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:09,650
well who owns space?

4384
02:13:09,651 --> 02:13:11,720
Who owns the minerals that are on Mars?

4385
02:13:11,721 --> 02:13:14,690
These will be ridiculous questions a
couple of hundred years ago and I think at

4386
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:16,100
the same way it's going to be like,

4387
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:16,251
well,

4388
02:13:16,251 --> 02:13:20,840
should we have fully automated police
officer's like should we have the century

4389
02:13:20,841 --> 02:13:21,860
in this from uh,

4390
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:25,010
whatever they were the Cylon centurions
should we have those things walking our

4391
02:13:25,011 --> 02:13:26,120
streets and that's,

4392
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:28,070
those are going to be
issues in the next 20 years,

4393
02:13:28,071 --> 02:13:29,120
not the next hundred years.

4394
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:29,601
Yeah.

4395
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:29,930
The,

4396
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:34,930
that's a really point about trying to
figure out who owns the natural resources

4397
02:13:36,121 --> 02:13:39,510
in space because that's
probably going to be,

4398
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,830
we might even have space wars.

4399
02:13:40,831 --> 02:13:42,450
If you think about why humans fight,

4400
02:13:42,451 --> 02:13:44,130
it's mostly for resources.

4401
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:48,210
I could totally see like China and
the u s duking it out in some kind of

4402
02:13:48,211 --> 02:13:52,710
interstellar that could you imagine
like if they found that there was a,

4403
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:53,100
um,

4404
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:58,100
an asteroid or something and it has,

4405
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,220
you know,

4406
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:04,220
fucking hundred trillion dollars where
the oil in it or diamonds or what have

4407
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:04,681
you,

4408
02:14:04,681 --> 02:14:08,760
and you could get there in a day's time
and then Russia says were gone and the

4409
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:09,151
United States,

4410
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:10,350
it was fuck you were going.

4411
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:12,120
And they tried to Duke it out over who?

4412
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:12,380
They,

4413
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:13,740
they've got to have space wars.

4414
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:17,550
They're flying around shooting
rockets at each other in space,

4415
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:19,290
laser beams and shit.

4416
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:20,940
Death Rays,

4417
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:21,840
Star Wars,

4418
02:14:21,841 --> 02:14:22,110
the,

4419
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:22,311
the,

4420
02:14:22,311 --> 02:14:27,311
the actual military program being
used like satellites shooting at space

4421
02:14:27,331 --> 02:14:28,860
shuttles where they're on their way.

4422
02:14:28,861 --> 02:14:31,290
This asteroid to get diamonds,

4423
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:32,280
it's going to be crazy.

4424
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:35,850
And also a space right now is
still mostly government sponsored.

4425
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:37,950
So they think of a specific mission,

4426
02:14:37,951 --> 02:14:38,850
like let's go to Mars,

4427
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:39,381
had photographs,

4428
02:14:39,381 --> 02:14:41,160
some shit and send back the photos.

4429
02:14:41,610 --> 02:14:42,660
And then once that's done,

4430
02:14:42,661 --> 02:14:43,500
the mission's over.

4431
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:44,940
But once we get true,

4432
02:14:44,941 --> 02:14:45,774
uh,

4433
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:47,460
I hate to sound like I'm,

4434
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:49,360
what's the word?

4435
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:52,170
But once we get like free
market enterprise and space,

4436
02:14:52,171 --> 02:14:53,310
as cheesy as that sounds,

4437
02:14:53,311 --> 02:14:55,080
we're like the motivation never stops.

4438
02:14:55,081 --> 02:14:56,490
The mission never stops the mission.

4439
02:14:56,491 --> 02:14:59,040
As we got to go further
and find more resources.

4440
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:02,210
Once we do that we're going to
explore such a large part of,

4441
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:05,610
of space because the money
aspect is finally there.

4442
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,340
Your rise before it's just like we'll
do this because we have to do it.

4443
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:09,300
We have to beat Russia,

4444
02:15:09,450 --> 02:15:10,320
but then we're coming home.

4445
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:10,831
You're right.

4446
02:15:10,831 --> 02:15:13,110
Wasn't that like the
premise of the movie alien?

4447
02:15:13,111 --> 02:15:14,610
Weren't they totally releasing?

4448
02:15:14,611 --> 02:15:18,270
I think really Scott has the most accurate
picture of what the future will look

4449
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:18,450
like.

4450
02:15:18,450 --> 02:15:19,740
It's not going to be utopian.

4451
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,320
It's not going to be completely awful.

4452
02:15:21,321 --> 02:15:23,940
It's just going to be powerful
space mining companies.

4453
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:24,810
Uh,

4454
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:27,930
give us the motivation to create really
fast spaceships cause we got to get out

4455
02:15:27,931 --> 02:15:31,980
there faster to beat other companies and
once he had the same competitive drive

4456
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:34,290
that makes your phone
so good and you know,

4457
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,520
makes all this shit possible,

4458
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:36,481
get that in space.

4459
02:15:36,481 --> 02:15:37,620
It's going to be completely insane.

4460
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:38,221
Yeah,

4461
02:15:38,221 --> 02:15:39,031
no shit.

4462
02:15:39,031 --> 02:15:39,271
Right.

4463
02:15:39,271 --> 02:15:41,310
That's really what's going
to propel space travel.

4464
02:15:41,490 --> 02:15:45,000
They figure out a way to make trillions
of dollars by mining asteroids and

4465
02:15:45,001 --> 02:15:46,020
things along those lines.

4466
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:46,950
The,

4467
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:47,170
the,

4468
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:51,630
the really Scott versions of alien too
with like the most likely scenario of

4469
02:15:51,631 --> 02:15:54,270
what the fuck would happen
if something got to us.

4470
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:57,030
Like something that breeds
as quickly as a disease,

4471
02:15:57,330 --> 02:16:00,210
something that grows to a
gigantic size really quickly.

4472
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:05,211
Like all of our biological limitations
that we sort of put on bodies and aliens

4473
02:16:05,341 --> 02:16:05,960
and what,

4474
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:06,220
what,

4475
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:08,760
what would a body looked
like if it came from space?

4476
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:10,620
It probably looked like a fucking spider.

4477
02:16:10,621 --> 02:16:11,401
Like alien.

4478
02:16:11,401 --> 02:16:12,091
What is alien?

4479
02:16:12,091 --> 02:16:15,660
It's a giant spider and they can't
reason with that thing and tell it like,

4480
02:16:15,661 --> 02:16:17,970
don't be a Predator and eat
everybody on the space ship.

4481
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,200
It's the same as like a,

4482
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,700
you talking about sharks.

4483
02:16:20,701 --> 02:16:23,520
That's something that was
developed in the same system as us.

4484
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:26,370
And we can't even convince
a shark not to eat us.

4485
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:29,740
Think about when you're facing the
thing with the mouth coming out of it,

4486
02:16:29,741 --> 02:16:29,851
you know,

4487
02:16:29,851 --> 02:16:30,280
the multiple

4488
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,113
mouths,

4489
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:32,800
it was going to be no way to stop,

4490
02:16:32,801 --> 02:16:33,251
whatever.

4491
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:34,084
Uh,

4492
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,070
what was the other movie
that was kind of like that?

4493
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:36,790
Um,

4494
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:37,720
with Harrison Ford,

4495
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:38,950
that movie that came out recently,

4496
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:40,120
recently,

4497
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:41,330
and there's gamers game yet.

4498
02:16:41,331 --> 02:16:41,861
I didn't see that.

4499
02:16:41,861 --> 02:16:42,550
Was that any good?

4500
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,630
I thought it was pretty good.

4501
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:44,350
Yeah.

4502
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:48,640
But they go after this like insect race
and it's hard for them to communicate

4503
02:16:48,641 --> 02:16:49,960
and figure out what that race,

4504
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:52,180
his intentions are
because they're so alien,

4505
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:52,661
you know?

4506
02:16:52,661 --> 02:16:55,540
It's like they're talking to
like human sized ants basically.

4507
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:56,540
Oh,

4508
02:16:56,541 --> 02:16:57,410
that's cool.

4509
02:16:57,530 --> 02:17:00,200
We can't even figure out what
the fuck orchids are saying.

4510
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:01,670
And you swim on top of them.

4511
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:05,180
They ride those motherfuckers and we
can't figure out what they're saying.

4512
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:05,871
You know,

4513
02:17:05,871 --> 02:17:07,340
they don't know what dolphins are saying.

4514
02:17:07,370 --> 02:17:08,960
They know when they're upset.

4515
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:09,823
That's it.

4516
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:10,340
That's it.

4517
02:17:10,340 --> 02:17:10,610
You know,

4518
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:11,720
they know when they're happy,

4519
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:15,760
but they're here and we've
been studying them for decades.

4520
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:17,030
We don't know shit.

4521
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:17,631
You know,

4522
02:17:17,631 --> 02:17:22,631
there's no like dolphin decoder device
where we are and it comes out like,

4523
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,240
you know,

4524
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:24,421
yeah,

4525
02:17:24,421 --> 02:17:25,254
Google text.

4526
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:27,300
David Brennan has this
really interesting idea.

4527
02:17:27,301 --> 02:17:29,370
I think he calls it uplifting and it's,

4528
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:32,460
I don't know if he actually believes
this or if it was like something he wrote

4529
02:17:32,461 --> 02:17:33,360
in a science fiction book,

4530
02:17:33,361 --> 02:17:37,260
but it's a really cool idea and it's
that at some point we're going to look to

4531
02:17:37,261 --> 02:17:39,780
other species on the earth
that we find to be interesting,

4532
02:17:39,781 --> 02:17:42,420
probably dogs and dolphins
and stuff and we're like,

4533
02:17:42,421 --> 02:17:43,081
we're going to upgrade.

4534
02:17:43,081 --> 02:17:45,990
You were going to figure out a way for
us to communicate directly because you're

4535
02:17:45,991 --> 02:17:48,390
very similar to us and
you probably have a,

4536
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:48,711
you know,

4537
02:17:48,711 --> 02:17:51,060
a perspective that's different
from the human perspective,

4538
02:17:51,061 --> 02:17:53,070
so we're going to elevate
them to our level.

4539
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:55,590
Whereas right now they're
kind of like savages.

4540
02:17:55,830 --> 02:18:00,830
We're going to bring them into modern
society and kind of coexist with these

4541
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,810
other species in a way that
we've never done before.

4542
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:04,913
Wow.

4543
02:18:05,310 --> 02:18:07,290
Well that is what they,

4544
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:08,960
when you get to the real nutty people,

4545
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,410
thank that human beings
were engineered by aliens.

4546
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:14,410
That's essentially the
premise of the last one.

4547
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:16,000
Promethium yeah,

4548
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:17,020
the engineer,

4549
02:18:17,050 --> 02:18:18,820
you know that is the premise.

4550
02:18:18,821 --> 02:18:23,821
The premise is that human beings were in
some way or form designed by something

4551
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:25,120
more intelligent.

4552
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,960
They decided to bring us up a little bit.

4553
02:18:26,990 --> 02:18:28,250
That engineer was such a Dick.

4554
02:18:28,251 --> 02:18:31,600
It's smart enough to create the human
race but just flips out and starts like

4555
02:18:31,610 --> 02:18:32,421
killing people.

4556
02:18:32,421 --> 02:18:33,254
Stupid movie.

4557
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:34,400
That movie sucked.

4558
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:35,481
It was cool.

4559
02:18:35,481 --> 02:18:36,051
It was okay.

4560
02:18:36,051 --> 02:18:36,980
I'm science fiction,

4561
02:18:36,981 --> 02:18:37,461
it's fun.

4562
02:18:37,461 --> 02:18:38,540
I enjoy those movies.

4563
02:18:38,541 --> 02:18:39,374
But

4564
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,390
it wasn't,

4565
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:44,060
the first one was so god damn good.

4566
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:49,190
And then the second one was pretty fucking
good and the third one was not very

4567
02:18:49,191 --> 02:18:49,960
good.

4568
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:52,010
And then the fourth one was not good.

4569
02:18:52,460 --> 02:18:53,660
And then this one was,

4570
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:55,350
oh man,

4571
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,900
he spent a lot of money on this.

4572
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:59,750
Did you talk to any geeks
need to talk to Geeks,

4573
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:03,560
get a real fucking science fiction
geek and ask him what's wrong with this

4574
02:19:03,561 --> 02:19:04,190
movie?

4575
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:05,540
And he'll tell you like,

4576
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:06,830
why is he freaking out?

4577
02:19:06,831 --> 02:19:09,620
Why is this super smart
giant dude roiling out

4578
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:15,850
and they have this huge like
hologram version of the universe.

4579
02:19:15,851 --> 02:19:17,050
They have to like see it all.

4580
02:19:17,051 --> 02:19:19,630
I can three dimensional
flying through space.

4581
02:19:19,631 --> 02:19:21,440
Is that just because you
wanted to use that technology,

4582
02:19:21,441 --> 02:19:24,220
but that's an inefficient
way of mapping out the unit.

4583
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:26,510
The Universe is infinite.

4584
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,010
We can have an infinite

4585
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,660
map up there and the fucking sky.

4586
02:19:29,661 --> 02:19:31,790
He would just have a
tablet and hit earth done.

4587
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,220
Yeah.

4588
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:33,130
No need for all this stuff.

4589
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:33,530
Yeah.

4590
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:33,740
Good.

4591
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:34,573
Take me to Miami.

4592
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:35,413
Boom.

4593
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:37,640
Did you watch the blood moon?

4594
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,860
That was a true,

4595
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:39,071
yeah.

4596
02:19:39,071 --> 02:19:39,610
It was weird.

4597
02:19:39,610 --> 02:19:39,970
Yeah.

4598
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:40,900
How often does that happen?

4599
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:44,560
I don't even know exactly what the blood
moon is that just the regular clips?

4600
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:45,410
It's a,

4601
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:46,350
it's an eclipse,

4602
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:49,120
but there's something that happens
where it looks red for will kill.

4603
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,370
Let's find out three or four years.

4604
02:19:51,371 --> 02:19:52,031
There's an eclipse,

4605
02:19:52,031 --> 02:19:53,410
but I'm not sure about
the blood moon part,

4606
02:19:53,411 --> 02:19:58,060
but the weird thing is when it got
to that orange ish reddish phase,

4607
02:19:58,210 --> 02:20:01,900
it literally looked like somebody just
throw a ball and it was just floating

4608
02:20:01,901 --> 02:20:04,300
there like it didn't look like
the moon because the lighting,

4609
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,860
especially when it started hitting the,

4610
02:20:05,861 --> 02:20:07,420
the left side really make,

4611
02:20:07,450 --> 02:20:09,670
you never saw lighting
come from the bottom.

4612
02:20:09,671 --> 02:20:12,910
Like that just made the
whole moon look fake as fuck.

4613
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,241
Yeah.

4614
02:20:13,241 --> 02:20:18,241
There's a cool thing on CNN where they
have all the various images of it and

4615
02:20:19,481 --> 02:20:23,620
they have some people did like time lapses
and it's an interesting and the time

4616
02:20:23,621 --> 02:20:26,830
lapse you see like when it's
in certain parts of the sky,

4617
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:31,270
it's totally white and then it gets
to one small segment of the sky where

4618
02:20:31,271 --> 02:20:35,650
there's some sort of a reflection or
something and that is what's causing it.

4619
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:40,680
If rain clouds rain or clouds
obscured your lunar experience,

4620
02:20:40,701 --> 02:20:41,411
don't fret.

4621
02:20:41,411 --> 02:20:46,150
This episode is one of the first four
consecutive total lunar eclipse is known

4622
02:20:46,151 --> 02:20:51,130
as a Tetrad that will occur
in a six month interval,

4623
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:51,760
uh,

4624
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:55,150
until September of 2015 wow.

4625
02:20:55,330 --> 02:20:56,470
Unlike solar eclipses,

4626
02:20:56,770 --> 02:21:00,460
lunar eclipses are safe to view with
the naked eye and don't require special

4627
02:21:00,461 --> 02:21:01,294
filters,

4628
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:03,520
so it's a part of the eclipse,

4629
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:04,660
a process

4630
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:09,180
that right there when you saw that
chartering photo part happened,

4631
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:09,540
it's like,

4632
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:09,811
all right,

4633
02:21:09,811 --> 02:21:10,830
this is not the moon.

4634
02:21:10,831 --> 02:21:12,060
What the fuck is this thing?

4635
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,363
It's creepy.

4636
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:16,050
It's almost like it's a semi-transparent.

4637
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:16,943
It's pretty cool.

4638
02:21:17,550 --> 02:21:17,941
Some,

4639
02:21:17,941 --> 02:21:22,941
a guy has this really wacky youtube page
that I just found out about and it's

4640
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:26,310
interesting when you go to someone's
youtube page and you find out that they

4641
02:21:26,311 --> 02:21:26,521
have,

4642
02:21:26,521 --> 02:21:29,910
like every video has like
2 million plus views.

4643
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:30,181
I'm like,

4644
02:21:30,181 --> 02:21:30,961
this is nuts.

4645
02:21:30,961 --> 02:21:34,080
This guy's insane amount of views
and it's sort of a science based one.

4646
02:21:34,081 --> 02:21:37,020
It's kind of cool that it has so many
views because it's a really intelligent

4647
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:37,883
youtube page.

4648
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:41,310
Someone was asking me to have the guy
on the podcast and I had never heard of

4649
02:21:41,311 --> 02:21:41,551
the guy,

4650
02:21:41,551 --> 02:21:42,301
so I go to his page.

4651
02:21:42,301 --> 02:21:42,571
I was like,

4652
02:21:42,571 --> 02:21:43,400
what?

4653
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:43,800
Yeah.

4654
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,850
One of them was,

4655
02:21:44,851 --> 02:21:49,851
what if the moon was a giant disco ball
and what if the moon was a disco ball

4656
02:21:50,131 --> 02:21:52,650
and it was only 300 miles
from the earth's surface?

4657
02:21:52,651 --> 02:21:54,960
It was like floating right
about what would it look like?

4658
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:58,590
So they did this animated thing
of what the moon would look like.

4659
02:21:58,591 --> 02:22:01,470
As a typical Paul that's 300 miles away,

4660
02:22:01,471 --> 02:22:02,610
it's insane.

4661
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:04,860
We've fills up the whole night sky.

4662
02:22:04,861 --> 02:22:08,100
Like you realize how big the
moon really is and you're like,

4663
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:09,810
oh my God.

4664
02:22:09,930 --> 02:22:13,710
Like when you see this
graphic representation of
it filling up the night sky.

4665
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:16,590
It's a really cool idea
that they try to do that.

4666
02:22:16,591 --> 02:22:17,241
I mean it wouldn't,

4667
02:22:17,241 --> 02:22:18,074
I don't put it up,

4668
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,330
Christ go over this.

4669
02:22:21,331 --> 02:22:22,410
How many times we have to go over this.

4670
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:23,220
Um,

4671
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,360
it's the,

4672
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:25,230
the,

4673
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,010
the size of

4674
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,580
it though,

4675
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:30,420
in relationship to the earth and you
really get an idea of the one quarter of

4676
02:22:30,421 --> 02:22:32,670
the size of the earth.

4677
02:22:32,671 --> 02:22:34,380
Like that's how big the moon actually is.

4678
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:35,580
This is one of the way the fuck up.

4679
02:22:35,581 --> 02:22:36,690
There's this little tiny thing,

4680
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,580
but if it was floating in our sky,

4681
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:40,960
it would literally take up
the entire night's guy that,

4682
02:22:40,961 --> 02:22:41,731
that space show.

4683
02:22:41,731 --> 02:22:41,941
Man,

4684
02:22:41,941 --> 02:22:43,390
I'm so addicted to cosmos,

4685
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:43,981
Cosmos.

4686
02:22:43,981 --> 02:22:44,540
That's awesome.

4687
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:45,600
It's so awesome.

4688
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:46,231
Well,

4689
02:22:46,231 --> 02:22:50,730
Seth Mcfarlane's a bad motherfucker
and Neil degrasse Tyson is also a bad

4690
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:52,380
motherfucker is he'll be on,

4691
02:22:52,381 --> 02:22:53,910
hopefully I'll get them on this month.

4692
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:55,313
He's around.

4693
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:56,190
He's just back and forth.

4694
02:22:56,191 --> 02:22:57,210
We've been emailing each other.

4695
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:57,540
He's,

4696
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:58,560
he's busy as fuck.

4697
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,641
I hope it does.

4698
02:22:59,641 --> 02:22:59,941
Well,

4699
02:22:59,941 --> 02:23:01,380
I don't know what the ratings are of it,

4700
02:23:01,381 --> 02:23:01,860
but I was,

4701
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,510
I was wondering why I was watching it.

4702
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:04,060
Is there anything

4703
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:04,391
good?

4704
02:23:04,391 --> 02:23:04,961
It's really good.

4705
02:23:04,961 --> 02:23:07,690
And what's really cool is that it's on
like Hulu and stuff like that so you can

4706
02:23:07,691 --> 02:23:08,740
just watch it straight up.

4707
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:10,330
Got to cross,

4708
02:23:10,331 --> 02:23:12,070
cross promoted with like duck hunter.

4709
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:17,550
Oh there's some stupid fucking
shows on discovery channel man.

4710
02:23:17,551 --> 02:23:19,380
I went to discovery the
other day and I was like,

4711
02:23:19,381 --> 02:23:20,740
how did discovery becomes

4712
02:23:20,810 --> 02:23:21,380
this?

4713
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:21,830
All of them.

4714
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:24,200
The TLC is now like nothing
to do with learning.

4715
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,740
It's,

4716
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:25,650
it's the uh,

4717
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:27,710
honey booboo channel now.

4718
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:33,220
And discovery has these shows that have
nothing to do with discovering anything.

4719
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:36,410
Now if you want what discovery used to be,

4720
02:23:36,411 --> 02:23:38,990
you got to head over to science
channel and then you get how,

4721
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:39,410
uh,

4722
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:43,160
how it's made is one of my favorite shows
to watch wall show while I'm enjoying

4723
02:23:43,161 --> 02:23:46,180
a certain substances because it gives,

4724
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:48,530
it gives you an
appreciation for everything.

4725
02:23:48,531 --> 02:23:49,370
Like something boring.

4726
02:23:49,371 --> 02:23:51,500
Like this bottle of water
becomes fascinating.

4727
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:52,131
Yeah.

4728
02:23:52,131 --> 02:23:53,750
How it's made is a really cool show.

4729
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:55,400
It's disturbing though.

4730
02:23:55,401 --> 02:23:56,070
Looking at,

4731
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:57,720
there's a new show on,

4732
02:23:57,721 --> 02:23:58,554
um,

4733
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,030
on discovery.

4734
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:03,150
You remember that video that we
played at Ted Nugent and this guy,

4735
02:24:03,151 --> 02:24:05,940
pig man shooting a pigs from a helicopter,

4736
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,730
just machine gunning
pigs out of a helicopter.

4737
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:10,140
These wild feral pigs,

4738
02:24:10,141 --> 02:24:12,300
they have to eradicate from
a lot of these Texas farms.

4739
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:13,830
Well now he's got his own show.

4740
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,240
Pig Man has his own show.

4741
02:24:15,241 --> 02:24:17,880
It's called boss hog and on boss Hog,

4742
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:19,500
he's a running around.

4743
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:24,210
He owns a barbecue place that cooks up
these pigs that he shoots and him and his

4744
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:26,460
dad run around shooting pigs.

4745
02:24:26,461 --> 02:24:29,720
And then they have a lot of fake
scenarios that take place because they're,

4746
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:32,580
they're obviously artificially
scripted scenarios,

4747
02:24:32,581 --> 02:24:32,760
arrows.

4748
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:33,580
And because that shows,

4749
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:36,400
it shows you that we're animals still
and we're starting to accept that.

4750
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:40,030
I don't think it is entirely bad that
we're going to stupid or programming

4751
02:24:40,031 --> 02:24:41,590
because you're not stupid or,

4752
02:24:41,591 --> 02:24:45,610
but things that have the discovery channel
to do the science because we're like,

4753
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:45,911
oh,

4754
02:24:45,911 --> 02:24:47,010
we like to watch people hunt.

4755
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:49,300
We like to watch people negotiate.

4756
02:24:49,301 --> 02:24:50,500
And that's pawn stars.

4757
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:51,450
Fuck.

4758
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:51,610
Like,

4759
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:55,270
we're just interested in seeing other
humans do all these things that we have to

4760
02:24:55,271 --> 02:24:56,104
do,

4761
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:59,470
but their logo has a fucking planet in it.

4762
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:01,391
I mean,

4763
02:25:01,391 --> 02:25:02,620
the discovery channel,

4764
02:25:02,621 --> 02:25:03,790
it's like you thinking about like,

4765
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:04,031
oh,

4766
02:25:04,031 --> 02:25:06,490
we're going to watch a
documentary around polar bears.

4767
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:06,820
Yeah,

4768
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:08,740
we're going to see leopard seals.

4769
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:08,951
Yeah.

4770
02:25:08,951 --> 02:25:10,580
You're not as second to discover anything.

4771
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:12,700
Discover the back of a fucking pawn shop.

4772
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:14,470
I'll show you that.

4773
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:15,970
I made some barbecue.

4774
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:16,813
Woo.

4775
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:18,600
We're gonna sell moonshot.

4776
02:25:18,610 --> 02:25:19,361
We're crazy.

4777
02:25:19,361 --> 02:25:20,920
That cop doesn't even see the camera.

4778
02:25:21,070 --> 02:25:21,950
Look out one normal.

4779
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,830
Jakks well,

4780
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:23,710
it's the truck.

4781
02:25:23,711 --> 02:25:24,460
What's in the truck?

4782
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:27,130
Why is there a camera pointed
at you in a fucking crew?

4783
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:29,170
Why is your microphones on everybody?

4784
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,280
How about that question?

4785
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:31,930
That Mermaid Shit.

4786
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:32,800
All that up.

4787
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,150
That's like creepy videos.

4788
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:35,051
Perfect example.

4789
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:39,460
That animal planet made a
fake fucking show on mermaids.

4790
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,473
Like a fake.

4791
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:44,380
Who pretended that there
were real mermaids and they
knew they were trolling the

4792
02:25:44,381 --> 02:25:45,214
whole time.

4793
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:45,740
You want me?

4794
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:49,150
Tommy's sent me fucking tweets
through thrown real mermaids.

4795
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,680
No,

4796
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:50,861
no,

4797
02:25:50,861 --> 02:25:51,694
they didn't.

4798
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:51,941
No,

4799
02:25:51,941 --> 02:25:53,140
they didn't find real mermaids.

4800
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:55,880
I'm about to actually
cancel my cable this week.

4801
02:25:55,881 --> 02:25:56,360
I think,

4802
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,560
I think I've got Internet.

4803
02:25:58,070 --> 02:26:02,510
I've been trying to just do a soft cancel
where I act like I don't have it and I

4804
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:03,590
just go on Netflix.

4805
02:26:03,591 --> 02:26:04,220
Go on Hulu.

4806
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:06,170
Hulu is the best man between

4807
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:09,440
Netflix and Amazon video.

4808
02:26:09,441 --> 02:26:12,760
There's no reason to really have cable
except for like when there's a live event

4809
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:13,970
that you can just get a,

4810
02:26:13,971 --> 02:26:15,050
I think you can pay,

4811
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:16,000
um,

4812
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,920
so kind of small fee for CNN
live and then you're good.

4813
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:19,430
You know?

4814
02:26:19,430 --> 02:26:19,790
Well,

4815
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:20,510
you know,

4816
02:26:20,510 --> 02:26:22,220
I don't want to recommend bit torrent,

4817
02:26:22,221 --> 02:26:23,054
but you're all,

4818
02:26:24,530 --> 02:26:29,530
there's a way to get things and the most
bit torrented show ever in the history

4819
02:26:30,051 --> 02:26:32,990
of bit torrent is the most recent
episode of game of Thrones.

4820
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:33,890
Really?

4821
02:26:33,890 --> 02:26:34,580
Yeah.

4822
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:38,510
It was a bit torrent
by some insane number.

4823
02:26:38,511 --> 02:26:43,511
I think it was 200,000 different people
had it available for downloading,

4824
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:45,740
which is amazing.

4825
02:26:45,770 --> 02:26:46,400
Here it is.

4826
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:51,400
The winner for the largest bit torrent
swarm ever 193,000 pirates simultaneously

4827
02:26:53,721 --> 02:26:55,980
sharing the same file.

4828
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:01,280
I love the language that we use for the
swarm of pirates is the biggest ever had

4829
02:27:01,281 --> 02:27:05,030
eye patches and hooks it fucking
beat their keyboard with the hook.

4830
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:06,740
Actually never use that anymore.

4831
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:07,633
I stopped it.

4832
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:08,750
I used to too scary,

4833
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:10,073
too dangerous.

4834
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:15,060
Too many people just getting the
fuck suit out of him for for seeding.

4835
02:27:15,061 --> 02:27:16,930
You know you have it up
there and you know you're,

4836
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:18,150
you know,

4837
02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:22,650
having people and then they fucking send
software that infects your computer and

4838
02:27:22,651 --> 02:27:24,270
now you don't even know
that you're hacked.

4839
02:27:24,271 --> 02:27:26,070
And it's just crazy.

4840
02:27:26,071 --> 02:27:26,271
The,

4841
02:27:26,271 --> 02:27:28,590
the fees that some people
like some housewife,

4842
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,730
you owe us $1 million.

4843
02:27:29,731 --> 02:27:32,330
What the,

4844
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:35,250
the nonsense behind it ones and Zeros.

4845
02:27:35,251 --> 02:27:36,030
Bitch.

4846
02:27:36,030 --> 02:27:38,430
I wonder if game of Thrones
does anything about this,

4847
02:27:38,431 --> 02:27:38,911
if they,

4848
02:27:38,911 --> 02:27:40,050
if they'd go after it,

4849
02:27:40,051 --> 02:27:41,640
if they try to stop it.

4850
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:46,260
Definitely during an August
earnings call with investors,

4851
02:27:46,261 --> 02:27:51,261
Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes bragged
about the shows of massive piracy levels.

4852
02:27:53,230 --> 02:27:53,551
It says,

4853
02:27:53,551 --> 02:27:54,660
if you go around the world,

4854
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:55,950
I think you're right.

4855
02:27:55,951 --> 02:27:58,290
Game of Thrones is the most
pirated show in the world.

4856
02:27:58,291 --> 02:27:59,100
He said,

4857
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:00,390
now that's better than an Emmy.

4858
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,050
Huh?

4859
02:28:01,050 --> 02:28:01,520
Wow.

4860
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:01,851
That's what,

4861
02:28:01,851 --> 02:28:02,661
that's a good attitude.

4862
02:28:02,661 --> 02:28:03,494
It's really enlightened.

4863
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:04,010
I like that.

4864
02:28:04,010 --> 02:28:05,480
That is a good attitude because look,

4865
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:07,850
it's not going to stop
people from watching it.

4866
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:09,470
And it does expose your,

4867
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:10,490
if people like it,

4868
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,890
they will go pay money
for the movie version.

4869
02:28:12,891 --> 02:28:15,860
They will pay money for the book
that you get some kind of royalty on.

4870
02:28:15,861 --> 02:28:16,011
You know,

4871
02:28:16,011 --> 02:28:17,420
like there's ways to make money.

4872
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:18,810
Uh,

4873
02:28:18,810 --> 02:28:22,640
HBO CEO doesn't care that
you are sharing your HBO.

4874
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:24,020
What's his password?

4875
02:28:24,021 --> 02:28:25,030
Then I watched his HBO go,

4876
02:28:26,370 --> 02:28:28,310
we're in the business of creating addicts.

4877
02:28:28,311 --> 02:28:28,970
He said,

4878
02:28:28,970 --> 02:28:29,421
oh,

4879
02:28:29,421 --> 02:28:31,100
that's a great attitude.

4880
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:32,420
That's a great attitude.

4881
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:33,141
And you know what,

4882
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:34,520
if people can afford HBO,

4883
02:28:34,521 --> 02:28:35,490
they're going to get HBO,

4884
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:35,931
right?

4885
02:28:35,931 --> 02:28:36,681
If you can afford it,

4886
02:28:36,681 --> 02:28:37,251
and if you can't,

4887
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:38,120
you're not going to get it.

4888
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:40,690
So like this idea that
you're stopping people,

4889
02:28:40,990 --> 02:28:42,230
you're stealing money,

4890
02:28:42,650 --> 02:28:47,650
are they really or are they simply getting
something and enjoying it that they

4891
02:28:48,051 --> 02:28:49,530
would've never been able to afford?

4892
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:51,080
There's going to be a
bunch of people that,

4893
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:51,411
yeah,

4894
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:53,000
they would have been forced to pay for it,

4895
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:55,430
but I bet it evens itself out.

4896
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:55,881
I bet.

4897
02:28:55,881 --> 02:28:56,511
In a long run,

4898
02:28:56,511 --> 02:29:00,350
it kind of evens itself out one way or
another because people are going to get

4899
02:29:00,351 --> 02:29:01,184
HBO.

4900
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:03,680
The music business got fucked.

4901
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:04,791
The music business,

4902
02:29:04,791 --> 02:29:05,510
without a doubt,

4903
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:06,530
that shit disappeared.

4904
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:08,150
They went the dumb way.

4905
02:29:08,151 --> 02:29:08,600
They like,

4906
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,433
this is a,

4907
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:12,080
I swear this is the last time
I mentioned digital money,

4908
02:29:12,081 --> 02:29:15,500
but banks have an opportunity to not
do the exact same thing that record

4909
02:29:15,501 --> 02:29:16,700
companies did was like,

4910
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:17,061
Oh shit,

4911
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:18,530
we got to fight this tooth and nail.

4912
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:22,730
All it leads to is better technology
and the second version you can't fight.

4913
02:29:22,731 --> 02:29:25,550
Whereas the first version you can
and it doesn't stop human behavior.

4914
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:26,870
It just makes you irrelevant.

4915
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:27,221
Okay.

4916
02:29:27,221 --> 02:29:28,600
If they brought you into a meeting,

4917
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:31,000
say like Bank of America
says David Seaman,

4918
02:29:31,001 --> 02:29:31,781
we liked the way you think.

4919
02:29:31,781 --> 02:29:33,460
We heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.

4920
02:29:33,461 --> 02:29:34,420
You've got some great ideas.

4921
02:29:34,421 --> 02:29:35,051
What should we do?

4922
02:29:35,051 --> 02:29:36,340
What should we do is digital?

4923
02:29:36,341 --> 02:29:36,551
You know,

4924
02:29:36,551 --> 02:29:36,701
I'm,

4925
02:29:36,701 --> 02:29:36,851
I'm,

4926
02:29:36,851 --> 02:29:37,091
I'm,

4927
02:29:37,091 --> 02:29:38,110
I don't even have email.

4928
02:29:38,140 --> 02:29:38,970
Okay.

4929
02:29:38,970 --> 02:29:39,803
Hey,

4930
02:29:39,870 --> 02:29:40,080
you know,

4931
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,010
I got to go like to go duck
hunting on the weekends.

4932
02:29:42,011 --> 02:29:42,670
Yeah.

4933
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,430
What should I do?

4934
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:44,211
It's very simple.

4935
02:29:44,211 --> 02:29:45,044
If you're,

4936
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:46,730
if somebody called me in
for a meeting like that,

4937
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:47,930
it's a,

4938
02:29:47,931 --> 02:29:50,990
it all comes down to game theory and it's
like we have this thing in the middle

4939
02:29:50,991 --> 02:29:55,400
of the table that everybody wants and
at the earliest adopters would benefit

4940
02:29:55,401 --> 02:29:55,970
from.

4941
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:58,790
So you as bank of America or you as chase,

4942
02:29:59,030 --> 02:30:02,540
you want to be the first one new adopt
this because you're going to gain so much

4943
02:30:02,541 --> 02:30:06,740
market share so fast that it's going
to fuck all your competitors and people

4944
02:30:06,741 --> 02:30:11,000
right now are desperate for a bit coin
service they can trust and is as Shitty

4945
02:30:11,001 --> 02:30:11,834
as these banks are.

4946
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:17,020
The Bank of America brand name has a
lot more trust then that Guy Karplus.

4947
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:17,451
Right.

4948
02:30:17,451 --> 02:30:19,790
So like between those two organizations,

4949
02:30:19,791 --> 02:30:22,580
who would I prefer to have my
bitcoin with or who would rather,

4950
02:30:22,581 --> 02:30:23,780
who would I prefer to buy it with?

4951
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:26,750
Definitely the bank that's down
the street and that I know has,

4952
02:30:26,751 --> 02:30:29,150
you know whatever market cap they have,

4953
02:30:29,151 --> 02:30:31,760
they have a lot of money and I know
they're not going under tomorrow.

4954
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:36,740
So I would say ignore all the political
rabble rousing and all the bold

4955
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:38,690
predictions people like me are making,

4956
02:30:38,691 --> 02:30:40,670
which will probably not come true.

4957
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,230
And instead look at this as just the
better technology and you as a bank,

4958
02:30:45,231 --> 02:30:48,320
you want to implement better
technologies cause it means lower fraud,

4959
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:49,581
less expense,

4960
02:30:49,581 --> 02:30:51,650
more possibility for
profit and innovation.

4961
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,330
Go fucking do it and
do it before chased us.

4962
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:57,070
That's a really good piece
of advice right there.

4963
02:30:57,071 --> 02:30:58,510
I like to rephrase that too,

4964
02:30:58,511 --> 02:30:59,750
that there is an uh,

4965
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:01,390
you've built up a name,

4966
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:03,910
there's a lot of trust in your
name and you can monopolize it.

4967
02:31:04,150 --> 02:31:05,710
It's like this is what people want now.

4968
02:31:05,711 --> 02:31:09,340
Like you didn't decide it and maybe
it's to your short term disadvantage,

4969
02:31:09,341 --> 02:31:11,050
but people want something
and that's a good thing.

4970
02:31:11,051 --> 02:31:12,100
It's almost like a,

4971
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:15,670
you remember the social network where the
one guy wanted him to put ads all over

4972
02:31:15,671 --> 02:31:16,361
the site and he's like,

4973
02:31:16,361 --> 02:31:16,691
no,

4974
02:31:16,691 --> 02:31:17,710
like we don't know what this is,

4975
02:31:17,711 --> 02:31:21,300
but we know it's cool right now and banks
have not done anything cool in a very

4976
02:31:21,301 --> 02:31:24,690
long time and the young people
are really disenfranchised.

4977
02:31:24,691 --> 02:31:28,260
I hate most banks and it's because
they've been so bad and they just do a bad

4978
02:31:28,261 --> 02:31:29,400
job with what they do.

4979
02:31:29,730 --> 02:31:30,990
If you modernize a little bit,

4980
02:31:30,991 --> 02:31:34,020
you might get the 20 and 30 somethings
to put their money back in your bank,

4981
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,430
you might make a lot of money.

4982
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:37,050
That's a really good point,

4983
02:31:37,051 --> 02:31:37,290
man.

4984
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:41,100
It's a really good point and it's also
about addressing the inevitability of

4985
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:42,510
what's going on like,

4986
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:46,110
but they would look at it in terms of
maybe they have their finger on the

4987
02:31:46,111 --> 02:31:46,591
trigger that,

4988
02:31:46,591 --> 02:31:48,810
but they don't want to press it
too soon and fucked themselves.

4989
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:54,110
It's like when you heard that like a
RJ Reynolds had the patents for several

4990
02:31:54,451 --> 02:31:58,200
different strains of marijuana and
they had labels printed up ready to go.

4991
02:31:58,201 --> 02:31:59,820
That was always one of those urban myths,

4992
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:00,451
you know?

4993
02:32:00,451 --> 02:32:04,380
But the idea was that they don't want
to come out with it too soon because of

4994
02:32:04,381 --> 02:32:05,820
marijuana does become legal.

4995
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:08,820
They want to be able to jump
on it and be able to sell.

4996
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:09,380
That's,

4997
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:10,950
that's the pope called gold.

4998
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:12,100
That's weakness right there.

4999
02:32:12,101 --> 02:32:14,110
Because we never control
when things happen,

5000
02:32:14,111 --> 02:32:15,580
but we control how we respond.

5001
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:20,730
And I think Amazon is run by a brilliant
guy and I think their failure to accept

5002
02:32:20,951 --> 02:32:25,030
bitcoin is one of their first really
big fuckups because overstock is a big

5003
02:32:25,031 --> 02:32:25,780
company too.

5004
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:28,600
And they're going to get a lot bigger
because now there's that loyalty there.

5005
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:30,370
Before I didn't care
about overstock at all.

5006
02:32:30,371 --> 02:32:30,670
I mean,

5007
02:32:30,670 --> 02:32:32,380
I would never mention
them on a show like yours.

5008
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:33,041
Overstock,

5009
02:32:33,041 --> 02:32:34,760
it's like some bullshit ecommerce site.

5010
02:32:35,470 --> 02:32:36,640
It's a ecommerce site.

5011
02:32:36,730 --> 02:32:38,830
And up until recently I
would not care at all.

5012
02:32:38,831 --> 02:32:39,011
I'm like,

5013
02:32:39,011 --> 02:32:40,960
who cares about this second
tier e commerce site?

5014
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:41,861
But now to me,

5015
02:32:41,861 --> 02:32:43,570
they're like the new
Amazon cause they get it.

5016
02:32:43,571 --> 02:32:44,710
And so I can see them,

5017
02:32:45,250 --> 02:32:45,670
uh,

5018
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:48,280
gaining what Amazon would
have if they had jumped in.

5019
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,530
What is the difference?

5020
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:50,170
What does,

5021
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:51,120
I'm not aware of.

5022
02:32:51,121 --> 02:32:51,900
Overstock?

5023
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:52,291
Uh,

5024
02:32:52,291 --> 02:32:53,200
it's just you.

5025
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:53,880
Do you know what it is?

5026
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,950
Brian overstock the big,

5027
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:56,320
oh,

5028
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:56,850
what is it?

5029
02:32:56,850 --> 02:32:57,780
The ads you see much.

5030
02:32:58,620 --> 02:32:59,550
What is overstock?

5031
02:32:59,570 --> 02:32:59,910
Yeah,

5032
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:00,743
it's uh,

5033
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,540
it's pretty much where they take older
stuff where they have too much like a

5034
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:04,140
iPads.

5035
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:04,471
Right?

5036
02:33:04,471 --> 02:33:05,670
They bought too many iPads.

5037
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:07,380
There is a new iPad about to come out.

5038
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:08,430
So overstock,

5039
02:33:08,431 --> 02:33:11,520
we'll buy all those old
iPads for a cheaper price,

5040
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:11,971
you know,

5041
02:33:11,971 --> 02:33:13,050
cause there's too much stock.

5042
02:33:13,051 --> 02:33:13,884
Like it's not selling.

5043
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:14,511
Oh I see.

5044
02:33:14,511 --> 02:33:16,200
So it's kind of like Ross for electronics.

5045
02:33:16,201 --> 02:33:16,921
You get new.

5046
02:33:16,921 --> 02:33:17,910
Anything new there?

5047
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:18,091
Yeah,

5048
02:33:18,091 --> 02:33:18,841
you can get new stuff.

5049
02:33:18,841 --> 02:33:19,291
Pasta.

5050
02:33:19,291 --> 02:33:20,041
But a lot of it,

5051
02:33:20,041 --> 02:33:21,660
I mean it's at least the original,

5052
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:22,380
uh,

5053
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:24,720
how it started off was
always like too much stuff.

5054
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:26,023
That's nice.

5055
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,940
I think that was the way that they
started and took off was that they offer

5056
02:33:28,941 --> 02:33:31,000
cheaper stuff because it
was literally overstock.

5057
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,580
But now you can get pretty much anything.

5058
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:37,740
So what's the difference between their
model of business and Amazon's you think

5059
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:39,210
their model of business is superior?

5060
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:40,360
Uh,

5061
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:42,310
I just think the CEO is able to,

5062
02:33:42,470 --> 02:33:45,400
to look into the future better than
what Amazon is doing because Amazon is

5063
02:33:45,401 --> 02:33:46,300
playing it safe.

5064
02:33:46,330 --> 02:33:47,163
And if you're,

5065
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:48,580
if you're that kind of company,

5066
02:33:48,581 --> 02:33:49,690
you can't afford to play it safe.

5067
02:33:49,691 --> 02:33:52,660
And that's one of the reasons why
Google is doing so well is they go like,

5068
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:55,750
we'll spend a lot of money on
crazy stuff that will not work out.

5069
02:33:56,050 --> 02:33:59,830
And that's okay because one of those
crazy things might be our next major

5070
02:33:59,831 --> 02:34:00,521
revenue stream.

5071
02:34:00,521 --> 02:34:01,600
And that's happened several times.

5072
02:34:01,601 --> 02:34:01,810
You know,

5073
02:34:01,810 --> 02:34:05,020
Gmail started is we're just going to
offer free email and see where it goes.

5074
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:05,351
Now.

5075
02:34:05,351 --> 02:34:06,460
It's a huge source of revenue.

5076
02:34:06,910 --> 02:34:07,691
Give an example,

5077
02:34:07,691 --> 02:34:07,771
like,

5078
02:34:07,771 --> 02:34:09,160
I don't understand what you're saying.

5079
02:34:09,161 --> 02:34:10,090
Like how are they,

5080
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:11,740
how are they doing?

5081
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:14,590
How are they doing it smarter ways and
what does Amazon doing it where they're

5082
02:34:14,591 --> 02:34:15,270
playing it?

5083
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:15,511
Oh,

5084
02:34:15,511 --> 02:34:18,000
it have been doing overstock bitcoin.

5085
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:19,031
Oh,

5086
02:34:19,031 --> 02:34:21,320
so Amazon CEO just said that,

5087
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:22,181
that he,

5088
02:34:22,181 --> 02:34:22,690
uh,

5089
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:25,750
reason why he doesn't do bitcoins
because there's not enough need for it.

5090
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:26,643
And I guess,

5091
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:27,100
you know,

5092
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:28,780
incorporating bitcoin into,

5093
02:34:28,781 --> 02:34:30,070
it's probably gonna cost a lot of money.

5094
02:34:30,071 --> 02:34:30,591
It's probably a good,

5095
02:34:30,591 --> 02:34:31,151
this big deal.

5096
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:31,291
But,

5097
02:34:31,291 --> 02:34:33,430
but he's saying there's
not enough demand for it.

5098
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:35,170
We're going to talk to,

5099
02:34:35,171 --> 02:34:36,004
uh,

5100
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:36,790
um,

5101
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:37,840
our pal,

5102
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:38,763
um,

5103
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:40,020
Alexis,

5104
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:40,510
like,

5105
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:40,721
no,

5106
02:34:40,721 --> 02:34:45,721
not Ohanian Andress Andreas
Antonopoulos next week on the 22nd.

5107
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:48,460
He is a true bitcoin expert.

5108
02:34:48,461 --> 02:34:49,181
I'm not an expert,

5109
02:34:49,181 --> 02:34:53,830
I'm just somebody who likes it like it
went to Nepalis is the bitcoin Jesus.

5110
02:34:53,831 --> 02:34:54,520
He's,

5111
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:57,400
I mean he gets all of
his money from bitcoin.

5112
02:34:57,401 --> 02:34:58,720
He doesn't take money anymore.

5113
02:34:59,050 --> 02:35:00,280
He gets paid in Bitcoin.

5114
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:02,230
He does all of exchanges in bit coins.

5115
02:35:02,231 --> 02:35:03,550
He buys food in bitcoins.

5116
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:04,240
I Dunno,

5117
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:04,960
he does that.

5118
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,141
Yeah.

5119
02:35:05,141 --> 02:35:06,910
I don't do that shit when I'm
out on a date I'm at like,

5120
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:07,121
oh,

5121
02:35:07,121 --> 02:35:09,360
can I print out a paper
wallet and then we'll,

5122
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:10,230
we'll transact.

5123
02:35:10,230 --> 02:35:11,980
You know like I just pay
with a credit card done.

5124
02:35:12,670 --> 02:35:13,660
Overstocks Deli.

5125
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,230
Yeah.

5126
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:15,063
You don't want to like,

5127
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:16,750
let a chick think you're weird.

5128
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:19,000
Like that would be like the deal breaker.

5129
02:35:19,001 --> 02:35:20,650
He tried to pay in Bitcoin.

5130
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:22,270
Although I gotta say women,

5131
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:24,280
I want to give a shout out to women in La.

5132
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:26,230
I to give a shout out to all the ladies.

5133
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:28,670
All the ladies out there,

5134
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,850
especially in La,

5135
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:31,090
keeping your toes pretty,

5136
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:34,240
they're like the polar opposite
of the guy on pawn stars.

5137
02:35:34,241 --> 02:35:38,570
I was thinking about this like that guys
like best I can do is 20 bucks and La

5138
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:39,131
and again,

5139
02:35:39,131 --> 02:35:42,100
this is not like I haven't
sampled like the whole population,

5140
02:35:42,101 --> 02:35:43,100
but uh,

5141
02:35:43,570 --> 02:35:44,260
they're like,

5142
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:47,050
I don't know you all that well best I
can do as a blowjob and sex on a second

5143
02:35:47,051 --> 02:35:49,210
date and you're like
really shit like that.

5144
02:35:49,210 --> 02:35:49,820
Good.

5145
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:50,653
Uh,

5146
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:53,410
women out here in much nicer
than the east coast really?

5147
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:53,870
That's been,

5148
02:35:53,870 --> 02:35:56,080
or when I say the East Coast
Palm about South Florida,

5149
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:59,020
there's a lot of difficult
women in south Florida.

5150
02:35:59,050 --> 02:35:59,883
Difficult,

5151
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:01,390
just not friendly.

5152
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,513
Like,

5153
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:04,780
and I've had to blow on you man.

5154
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:08,080
I've had this conversation with friends
of mine who still live on the east coast

5155
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:08,951
and they're like,

5156
02:36:08,951 --> 02:36:10,180
you don't like dude,

5157
02:36:10,181 --> 02:36:12,940
you're just dealing with superficial
chicks and you think they're friendly.

5158
02:36:12,941 --> 02:36:13,210
I'm like,

5159
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:14,500
I like the superficiality.

5160
02:36:14,501 --> 02:36:15,334
What's wrong man?

5161
02:36:15,460 --> 02:36:16,570
What's wrong with manners?

5162
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:18,610
What's wrong with giving me
your phone number and saying,

5163
02:36:18,611 --> 02:36:18,761
yeah,

5164
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:20,140
I'd love to go out next week and of like,

5165
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:20,891
fuck you.

5166
02:36:20,891 --> 02:36:21,151
You know,

5167
02:36:21,151 --> 02:36:22,690
like is that what you got in Florida?

5168
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,080
Fuck,

5169
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:25,180
you'll you get really a,

5170
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:28,630
you don't know if an interaction is going
to turn out well or if it's going to

5171
02:36:28,631 --> 02:36:29,560
be like the spider video.

5172
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:31,840
That's what you get in
Miami is there's something,

5173
02:36:32,210 --> 02:36:32,651
uh,

5174
02:36:32,651 --> 02:36:35,650
about the culture there where it's like
kind of fun the shoot down guys and

5175
02:36:35,651 --> 02:36:35,861
here,

5176
02:36:35,861 --> 02:36:38,290
like everybody just treats
people like people and I like,

5177
02:36:38,291 --> 02:36:38,620
oh,

5178
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:39,490
it's one of those things.

5179
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:40,090
Yeah.

5180
02:36:40,090 --> 02:36:40,541
Yeah.

5181
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:43,870
The fun shooting down guys
thing like this is a sport.

5182
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,070
There is a thrill to it.

5183
02:36:45,071 --> 02:36:48,220
They get all dressed up and you're like
Horny as fuck and they just shoot you

5184
02:36:48,221 --> 02:36:51,820
down in front of everybody and you don't
see that happening as much out here.

5185
02:36:51,821 --> 02:36:53,530
And I think maybe it's just the culture.

5186
02:36:53,531 --> 02:36:54,370
Maybe it's the weed,

5187
02:36:54,371 --> 02:36:55,180
I don't know what it is.

5188
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:59,050
Maybe it's a reflection of David
seaman getting a little bit of Internet

5189
02:36:59,051 --> 02:36:59,561
celebrity,

5190
02:36:59,561 --> 02:37:02,620
getting some pussy and starting to
judge a patch of dirt differently.

5191
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:04,091
I fucking,

5192
02:37:04,091 --> 02:37:05,380
California is where it's at.

5193
02:37:05,410 --> 02:37:07,750
People are blowing me back in Florida.

5194
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:09,130
They're just angry,

5195
02:37:09,370 --> 02:37:11,410
walkaway hot and screaming at me.

5196
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:12,640
But now look at you.

5197
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:14,150
That was an intense shout out.

5198
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:14,950
It was intense.

5199
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:16,010
You want to give a shout out to Joe's

5200
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,460
cat cause he has the coolest eyes.

5201
02:37:19,710 --> 02:37:20,543
Is that your cat?

5202
02:37:21,390 --> 02:37:21,831
That's Prince.

5203
02:37:21,831 --> 02:37:22,390
All right.

5204
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:22,731
Who is that?

5205
02:37:22,731 --> 02:37:23,750
A Siamese or something.

5206
02:37:24,050 --> 02:37:25,260
Now he's a rag doll.

5207
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:27,200
Ragdoll rag doll cat is a,

5208
02:37:27,201 --> 02:37:27,900
um,

5209
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,240
there were like real sweet,

5210
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:30,074
like you pick them up,

5211
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:31,310
they go limp.

5212
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:33,020
They kind of go rag doll on you.

5213
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:34,040
That's the idea behind,

5214
02:37:34,041 --> 02:37:34,520
uh,

5215
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:34,911
the name.

5216
02:37:34,911 --> 02:37:36,170
I think he's awesome.

5217
02:37:36,810 --> 02:37:37,643
Cool cat.

5218
02:37:37,710 --> 02:37:38,150
Cool.

5219
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:38,510
Yeah.

5220
02:37:38,510 --> 02:37:40,040
Well I started letting
them outside recently.

5221
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:43,820
I used to worry about them because there's
hawks in the neighborhood and owls.

5222
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:44,900
Owls are a big one,

5223
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:45,770
especially at night.

5224
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:48,340
Owls kill cats all the time and uh,

5225
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:51,230
you really have to watch it
because there's an owl that
lives in my neighborhood

5226
02:37:51,231 --> 02:37:52,850
and he's fucking huge.

5227
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:54,020
It's really big.

5228
02:37:54,021 --> 02:37:54,261
I mean,

5229
02:37:54,261 --> 02:37:54,921
I'm not joking.

5230
02:37:54,921 --> 02:37:57,110
It's a body of it is like that big.

5231
02:37:57,111 --> 02:37:59,180
Apply your hunting skills
and get rid of that threat.

5232
02:37:59,390 --> 02:37:59,811
No,

5233
02:37:59,811 --> 02:38:00,730
you can't do that.

5234
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:01,011
You can't.

5235
02:38:01,011 --> 02:38:01,341
No,

5236
02:38:01,341 --> 02:38:02,210
you shouldn't do that.

5237
02:38:02,211 --> 02:38:03,140
You can't do that.

5238
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:04,850
I was a really necessary,

5239
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:07,100
they keep the rat population down.

5240
02:38:07,250 --> 02:38:07,551
Plus,

5241
02:38:07,551 --> 02:38:08,250
if you kill an hour,

5242
02:38:08,250 --> 02:38:11,480
the Illuminati will probably come
after you because of Moloch the owl.

5243
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:13,670
I was in Bohemian Grove,

5244
02:38:13,671 --> 02:38:14,910
I saw Moloch

5245
02:38:15,330 --> 02:38:15,500
the,

5246
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:15,850
here's the,

5247
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:17,130
here's the thing about Bohemian Grove,

5248
02:38:17,131 --> 02:38:18,150
not knowing much about it,

5249
02:38:18,151 --> 02:38:19,590
but if you're a billionaire,

5250
02:38:19,591 --> 02:38:22,410
there are very few people that you can
relate to who aren't immediately like

5251
02:38:22,650 --> 02:38:23,430
immediately like a,

5252
02:38:23,430 --> 02:38:24,450
here's my job resume.

5253
02:38:24,451 --> 02:38:25,410
Like what can you do for me?

5254
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:27,390
It's a very weird situation to be in,

5255
02:38:27,391 --> 02:38:31,530
so you don't want people scamming you and
you want to talk business and you want

5256
02:38:31,531 --> 02:38:32,610
to also relax.

5257
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:33,000
Yeah.

5258
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:36,380
Aren't you going to meet somewhere and
like talk some shit out and nonpublic

5259
02:38:36,390 --> 02:38:37,223
place?

5260
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:37,551
Yeah.

5261
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:38,381
With an owl.

5262
02:38:38,381 --> 02:38:39,950
God mask on and fucking,

5263
02:38:40,050 --> 02:38:40,883
and maybe,

5264
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:42,740
maybe you all just out on a dog.

5265
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:43,913
Maybe you all,

5266
02:38:45,300 --> 02:38:46,370
how do you have a pet out?

5267
02:38:46,390 --> 02:38:48,350
That's a weird half an hour as a pet.

5268
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:50,211
I don't know,

5269
02:38:50,211 --> 02:38:50,630
man.

5270
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:52,010
The owl that's in my neighborhood,

5271
02:38:52,011 --> 02:38:52,611
no bullshit.

5272
02:38:52,611 --> 02:38:54,080
Twice as big as that goddamn thing.

5273
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:54,980
It's huge.

5274
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:57,320
It's sat on my back fence the other day.

5275
02:38:57,321 --> 02:38:57,981
I looked at it,

5276
02:38:57,981 --> 02:38:58,341
I was like,

5277
02:38:58,341 --> 02:38:59,480
wow,

5278
02:38:59,510 --> 02:39:00,710
it's a surveillance devices.

5279
02:39:00,711 --> 02:39:02,300
We probably weighs 30 pounds.

5280
02:39:02,301 --> 02:39:03,530
It's fucking huge.

5281
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:05,420
And I saw one of them with a flow.

5282
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,060
It was flying with a rabbit in its claws.

5283
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:08,960
I was like,

5284
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:10,730
I was watching some prehistoric shit.

5285
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:13,190
It was really weird flying,

5286
02:39:13,220 --> 02:39:14,450
holding onto a rabbit.

5287
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:17,450
Ooh,

5288
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:18,283
give a hoot.

5289
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:19,483
Don't pull it.

5290
02:39:20,410 --> 02:39:23,140
Birds are weird because
they're definitely smart.

5291
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:24,083
There are lizards.

5292
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:24,581
Yeah.

5293
02:39:24,581 --> 02:39:26,800
They lacked the any kind of uh,

5294
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:28,540
relate-ability like a dog.

5295
02:39:28,570 --> 02:39:29,530
It understands you.

5296
02:39:29,531 --> 02:39:30,370
You understand it.

5297
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:31,271
A bird.

5298
02:39:31,271 --> 02:39:31,481
You're like,

5299
02:39:31,481 --> 02:39:32,590
what is this thing thinking?

5300
02:39:32,650 --> 02:39:33,011
But you know,

5301
02:39:33,011 --> 02:39:33,844
it's smart

5302
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:34,350
there.

5303
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:35,610
They have intelligence.

5304
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:38,220
We'll crows have
unbelievable intelligence.

5305
02:39:38,221 --> 02:39:42,510
I know you've seen some of those videos
were crows problem solve and use tools

5306
02:39:42,690 --> 02:39:43,830
and not just use tools,

5307
02:39:43,831 --> 02:39:45,720
but use multiple step tools,

5308
02:39:45,721 --> 02:39:47,820
like one tool to get to another tool.

5309
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,830
They use that tool to get to a third tool.

5310
02:39:49,831 --> 02:39:51,510
Then you that tool to get to meet.

5311
02:39:51,810 --> 02:39:52,051
I mean,

5312
02:39:52,051 --> 02:39:52,980
it's incredible.

5313
02:39:52,981 --> 02:39:53,401
If you've seen,

5314
02:39:53,401 --> 02:39:54,450
if you've seen any of these videos.

5315
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:55,020
No.

5316
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:56,100
You have to watch one.

5317
02:39:56,910 --> 02:39:58,290
It'll fucking blow you away.

5318
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:59,010
Can we get,

5319
02:39:59,010 --> 02:40:01,440
we can't get pulled from
youtube by using a youtube clip,

5320
02:40:01,441 --> 02:40:02,190
right?

5321
02:40:02,190 --> 02:40:03,060
That we can't get.

5322
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:04,193
Can we

5323
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:08,310
fuck motherfuckers pulling us
off youtube left and right.

5324
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:09,030
Um,

5325
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:11,910
see if you can find just one
clip on cro intelligence.

5326
02:40:11,911 --> 02:40:13,020
We've had this on the podcast,

5327
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,820
but it's so fascinating.

5328
02:40:14,821 --> 02:40:17,370
I watched that shit over and over again
and then we'll get the fuck outta here.

5329
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,340
Finding Cro,

5330
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:23,420
cro intelligence,

5331
02:40:23,421 --> 02:40:25,260
using problem solving tools.

5332
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:26,940
Just Google all that shit.

5333
02:40:29,080 --> 02:40:32,590
Crozer apparently as smart if
not smarter than chimpanzees.

5334
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:33,970
How is that possible?

5335
02:40:33,971 --> 02:40:36,550
It has such a small brain
compared to the chimp brain.

5336
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:37,533
I don't know.

5337
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:39,340
Remember you went for 12 years.

5338
02:40:39,341 --> 02:40:40,750
Your faith for something stupid.

5339
02:40:41,110 --> 02:40:41,620
Yeah.

5340
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:42,340
I don't know.

5341
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:44,950
But watch this year put
to give it some volume.

5342
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:51,511
Not very much.

5343
02:40:51,511 --> 02:40:52,344
Fine.

5344
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:54,430
Oh my God.

5345
02:40:54,430 --> 02:40:55,091
Oh Jesus.

5346
02:40:55,091 --> 02:40:55,750
What are you doing?

5347
02:40:55,750 --> 02:40:56,583
I don't know.

5348
02:40:58,030 --> 02:40:59,050
This is not on,

5349
02:40:59,110 --> 02:40:59,770
but it is.

5350
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:00,603
There is volume.

5351
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:04,000
This cro,

5352
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:09,210
so it takes this one twig
and then makes these socks,

5353
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:14,280
this second twig to go over to this
thing and pull this meat towards it.

5354
02:41:16,180 --> 02:41:16,720
Wow.

5355
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:17,553
And then eats it.

5356
02:41:17,770 --> 02:41:20,140
That's definitely like
monkey intelligence.

5357
02:41:20,141 --> 02:41:25,141
So it took one twig to get to a second
twig and then took that second twig and

5358
02:41:25,151 --> 02:41:25,440
went,

5359
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:28,440
I mean it couldn't reach the first twig
without using or the second trig without

5360
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:31,040
using the first wig is unbelievable.

5361
02:41:31,041 --> 02:41:33,040
There's thinking ahead use of tools.

5362
02:41:33,400 --> 02:41:34,330
That's just two.

5363
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:36,970
There's one that where it
shows three different steps,

5364
02:41:36,971 --> 02:41:39,580
like uses one tool to get to a
second tool to get to a second.

5365
02:41:39,581 --> 02:41:40,650
Too bad they're so ugly.

5366
02:41:40,651 --> 02:41:41,860
Or people would have them as pets.

5367
02:41:42,130 --> 02:41:43,570
Why don't think they would tolerate you?

5368
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:44,490
I think so.

5369
02:41:44,490 --> 02:41:44,711
Yeah.

5370
02:41:44,711 --> 02:41:45,760
I think they're wild.

5371
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:48,220
I think there's certain animals
you just not going to figure out.

5372
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:49,000
Like,

5373
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:49,241
you know,

5374
02:41:49,241 --> 02:41:51,610
they tried to tame zebras
at one point in time.

5375
02:41:51,611 --> 02:41:55,420
All these assholes that moved to the
Congo and built the states and tried to

5376
02:41:55,421 --> 02:41:59,290
fucking enslave people and run things
in Africa and then I'll never worked.

5377
02:41:59,530 --> 02:42:02,230
One of the things they tried to do
is they try to domesticate zebras.

5378
02:42:02,940 --> 02:42:04,000
He can't do it.

5379
02:42:04,270 --> 02:42:05,620
Why can't you domesticate a zebra?

5380
02:42:05,621 --> 02:42:06,790
They will tolerate.

5381
02:42:06,791 --> 02:42:08,040
So here's a five step.

5382
02:42:08,070 --> 02:42:08,341
Wait,

5383
02:42:08,341 --> 02:42:08,801
look at this.

5384
02:42:08,801 --> 02:42:10,000
Watch it takes,

5385
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:10,181
I mean,

5386
02:42:10,181 --> 02:42:10,901
this is incredible.

5387
02:42:10,901 --> 02:42:13,990
It takes one tool and then
it goes over and can't get,

5388
02:42:13,991 --> 02:42:16,240
this tool is trying real
hard to get this tool.

5389
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:16,730
He goes,

5390
02:42:16,730 --> 02:42:17,380
hmm,

5391
02:42:17,380 --> 02:42:18,700
let me see what the fuck we do here.

5392
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:21,970
He gets a second tool.

5393
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:22,570
Okay.

5394
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:24,970
Uses that tool to go.

5395
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:26,500
It tries to get the beat,

5396
02:42:26,501 --> 02:42:27,190
can't do it.

5397
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:31,240
Tried to get the third tool so it
uses this one to get to this one.

5398
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:34,720
Now he's got another tool
then takes that fucking tool,

5399
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:35,890
spins it around.

5400
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:39,760
So the other part like the part that has
like the little hook on the end of it,

5401
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:44,680
he's like trying to get the meat,

5402
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:45,490
can't get it.

5403
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:46,323
Alrighty.

5404
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:47,740
And there he goes.

5405
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:49,270
That is true intelligence.

5406
02:42:49,271 --> 02:42:51,640
That's smarter than like 90%
of the people I've dealt with.

5407
02:42:51,641 --> 02:42:52,390
The DMV.

5408
02:42:52,390 --> 02:42:52,811
Yeah.

5409
02:42:52,811 --> 02:42:54,280
It's all of the people at the DMV.

5410
02:42:54,281 --> 02:42:54,731
How about that?

5411
02:42:54,731 --> 02:42:55,564
I said it,

5412
02:42:55,780 --> 02:42:58,600
I can to see if your registration
gets renewed on time.

5413
02:42:58,720 --> 02:42:58,961
Yeah.

5414
02:42:58,961 --> 02:43:00,430
You put those people in that room,

5415
02:43:00,431 --> 02:43:01,031
would that crow,

5416
02:43:01,031 --> 02:43:02,200
the crow would figure that shit out.

5417
02:43:02,201 --> 02:43:03,034
Queer.

5418
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:05,081
Yeah.

5419
02:43:05,081 --> 02:43:08,410
I don't know how intelligence works and
obviously they don't have a language,

5420
02:43:08,530 --> 02:43:13,330
so maybe they're not as hampered by a lot
of and insecurities and a lot of weird

5421
02:43:13,331 --> 02:43:17,470
shit that the human brain harbors like
maybe a lot of what runs us is just

5422
02:43:17,471 --> 02:43:18,670
nonsense and Hawaii.

5423
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:23,370
How much time has everybody spent thinking
about things that have never had like

5424
02:43:23,371 --> 02:43:27,150
not come to pass like fears
that are just a waste of energy?

5425
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:29,250
Probably a fuck load,

5426
02:43:29,251 --> 02:43:29,431
right?

5427
02:43:29,431 --> 02:43:30,210
Yeah.

5428
02:43:30,210 --> 02:43:30,630
Yeah.

5429
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:33,150
I'm just thinking about my own life and
like it's always the thing that you're

5430
02:43:33,151 --> 02:43:36,310
not thinking about that ends up
getting you like an asteroid.

5431
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:36,480
Yeah.

5432
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:36,750
Again,

5433
02:43:36,750 --> 02:43:37,300
asteroids like,

5434
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:37,411
oh,

5435
02:43:37,411 --> 02:43:38,610
we didn't prepare for that one at all.

5436
02:43:38,611 --> 02:43:39,301
Or if Fukushima,

5437
02:43:39,301 --> 02:43:40,350
nobody was preparing for that.

5438
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:43,440
David Moore do.

5439
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:44,890
Can't end on doom and gloom.

5440
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:46,473
Pretty smart.

5441
02:43:47,140 --> 02:43:52,140
Just Sheryl Crow is probably not as
smart as a CHRO as far as like problem

5442
02:43:52,481 --> 02:43:53,080
solving.

5443
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:56,230
If you got Sheryl Crow and the crow and
neither one of them had any idea what

5444
02:43:56,231 --> 02:43:58,750
was going on that you made
them do those two things,

5445
02:44:00,770 --> 02:44:02,360
we can end on a positive note.

5446
02:44:02,361 --> 02:44:02,751
I think,

5447
02:44:02,751 --> 02:44:03,584
uh,

5448
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:05,780
despite the minor negative stuff,

5449
02:44:05,781 --> 02:44:06,890
this has been really positive.

5450
02:44:06,891 --> 02:44:10,100
Like the whole financial system is going
to change it the next five years and

5451
02:44:10,101 --> 02:44:13,790
it's going to swing in a direction where
individuals have more power and banks

5452
02:44:13,791 --> 02:44:14,331
have less.

5453
02:44:14,331 --> 02:44:14,541
I mean,

5454
02:44:14,541 --> 02:44:15,360
that's cool.

5455
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:16,400
It's really cool actually.

5456
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:20,810
And I talked to Stefan Molyneux
early this week and I asked him,

5457
02:44:20,811 --> 02:44:21,021
I was like,

5458
02:44:21,021 --> 02:44:23,870
am I diluted by telling people like
this is going to change everything?

5459
02:44:24,010 --> 02:44:24,321
And he's like,

5460
02:44:24,321 --> 02:44:24,501
no,

5461
02:44:24,501 --> 02:44:26,420
I think that it's going
to change a lot of stuff.

5462
02:44:26,421 --> 02:44:30,350
And he was telling me about how it's
going to change politics in a big way

5463
02:44:30,351 --> 02:44:31,184
because you just,

5464
02:44:31,250 --> 02:44:33,560
you can't get bribes
with bitcoin basically.

5465
02:44:33,561 --> 02:44:35,000
Like banks can't bribe you.

5466
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:36,890
You can't bribe them back by,

5467
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:37,490
uh,

5468
02:44:37,490 --> 02:44:38,323
um,

5469
02:44:38,450 --> 02:44:40,610
propping them up the next
time they need a bail out.

5470
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:45,050
This whole thinking of like a bank just
spends money and pretty much makes risky

5471
02:44:45,051 --> 02:44:46,700
bets and derivatives and stuff.

5472
02:44:46,701 --> 02:44:47,930
And then when those bets,

5473
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:48,410
uh,

5474
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:49,250
go south,

5475
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:52,880
they get a bail out from the
government and get taxpayer money,

5476
02:44:53,060 --> 02:44:54,580
that craziness will go away.

5477
02:44:54,581 --> 02:44:54,980
It's going to be,

5478
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:55,131
oh,

5479
02:44:55,131 --> 02:44:56,210
how many bitcoins do you have?

5480
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:56,331
Oh,

5481
02:44:56,331 --> 02:44:56,541
okay.

5482
02:44:56,541 --> 02:44:56,930
I see.

5483
02:44:56,930 --> 02:44:57,350
Cool.

5484
02:44:57,350 --> 02:44:57,981
So it's good.

5485
02:44:57,981 --> 02:44:58,480
You know,

5486
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:01,450
it actually goes back to
ancient times where a,

5487
02:45:01,460 --> 02:45:03,320
in places like Mesopotamia,

5488
02:45:04,010 --> 02:45:05,420
when merchants would do business,

5489
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:07,580
they didn't need to
chase or bank of America,

5490
02:45:07,581 --> 02:45:08,840
they just had like merchant ledgers,

5491
02:45:08,870 --> 02:45:09,020
like,

5492
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:09,171
oh,

5493
02:45:09,171 --> 02:45:09,471
I see.

5494
02:45:09,471 --> 02:45:10,790
I owe you 15 cattle.

5495
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:11,863
Very good.

5496
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:14,030
And you decide on a standard
and you go with that.

5497
02:45:14,270 --> 02:45:15,680
And the whole world might do that now.

5498
02:45:15,681 --> 02:45:16,700
And it's happening already.

5499
02:45:16,701 --> 02:45:17,780
When I say it might happen,

5500
02:45:18,170 --> 02:45:20,360
there's a reason why is at $500 each,

5501
02:45:20,361 --> 02:45:23,480
and that's because in China where they
have a radically different government

5502
02:45:23,481 --> 02:45:23,901
from hours,

5503
02:45:23,901 --> 02:45:24,890
far more oppressive,

5504
02:45:25,100 --> 02:45:26,450
they don't speak the same language,

5505
02:45:26,451 --> 02:45:27,560
they don't have the same culture,

5506
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:30,140
they're interested in the same
currency and that's really cool.

5507
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:31,770
And bitcoin,

5508
02:45:31,771 --> 02:45:34,380
is it more popular in any parts
of the world besides America?

5509
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:35,590
It's more popular in China,

5510
02:45:35,591 --> 02:45:36,010
I believe.

5511
02:45:36,010 --> 02:45:37,330
I believe most of the,

5512
02:45:37,390 --> 02:45:38,021
I might be wrong,

5513
02:45:38,021 --> 02:45:40,060
but I think most of the trading
volume right now is in China.

5514
02:45:40,390 --> 02:45:43,090
But definitely most of the
startups are in Silicon Valley.

5515
02:45:43,610 --> 02:45:46,040
Wonder what steps will ask,

5516
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:46,993
um,

5517
02:45:47,690 --> 02:45:48,980
Antonopoulos next week,

5518
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:53,930
what steps they've taken to ensure that
the same jackals that have gotten a hold

5519
02:45:53,931 --> 02:45:57,470
of the financial system and twisted
it into this weird cryptic world of

5520
02:45:57,471 --> 02:45:59,990
derivatives on the unexplainable things.

5521
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:05,440
If they've done anything to prevent that
from happening to things like Bitcoin,

5522
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:09,740
I'm sure if there's a way to
corrupted or make it less fun,

5523
02:46:09,741 --> 02:46:09,980
they will

5524
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:13,490
do that or they will try
for their own profit.

5525
02:46:13,491 --> 02:46:14,140
Yeah.

5526
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:14,721
All right man.

5527
02:46:14,721 --> 02:46:15,260
Listen,

5528
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:16,400
always fun talking to you.

5529
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,060
Definitely.

5530
02:46:17,060 --> 02:46:18,200
We've got to do this more often,

5531
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:19,400
which was always cool.

5532
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:20,234
Shit to talk about.

5533
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,433
Never run out.

5534
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:22,513
And uh,

5535
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:22,881
again,

5536
02:46:22,881 --> 02:46:24,980
we're at a strange time in life.

5537
02:46:24,981 --> 02:46:25,270
We're,

5538
02:46:25,270 --> 02:46:25,910
we're,

5539
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:28,710
we're right there at the
peak of the weirdest way.

5540
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:32,330
The world is RC negative because
the technology thing like yeah,

5541
02:46:32,331 --> 02:46:35,990
it's bad at the NSA is collecting our
stuff and I think that that system is

5542
02:46:35,991 --> 02:46:37,280
going to eat itself over time.

5543
02:46:37,281 --> 02:46:42,281
Like we have the FBI spying on the
CIA and the NSA or rather the CIA.

5544
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:43,610
So I fucked that up.

5545
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:47,270
We have the FBI spying on the CIA
and the CIA is spying on the Senate

5546
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:50,090
intelligence committee that's
supposed to be overseeing the CIA.

5547
02:46:50,091 --> 02:46:52,520
So all these people are
spying on each other.

5548
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:53,181
Uh,

5549
02:46:53,181 --> 02:46:54,560
stepping on each other's toes.

5550
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:57,500
And I think eventually is going to happen
is it's not people like you and me who

5551
02:46:57,501 --> 02:46:58,370
will demand reform.

5552
02:46:58,550 --> 02:46:59,990
It's people in the Senate who were like,

5553
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:01,180
I don't want my shit spied on anymore.

5554
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:02,023
This is not good.

5555
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:05,510
And they're all going to agree like
we need some kind of rollback that'll

5556
02:47:05,511 --> 02:47:05,991
happen.

5557
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:06,470
And then we have,

5558
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:07,970
we still have all this amazing technology.

5559
02:47:07,971 --> 02:47:10,250
It's moving faster than
we can even think about.

5560
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:11,210
And uh,

5561
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:12,440
it's mostly good here,

5562
02:47:12,441 --> 02:47:12,831
here,

5563
02:47:12,831 --> 02:47:13,910

It's on iTunes and stitcher.

5570
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:24,343
Is there a website,

5571
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:27,830
David seaman.com and we
say iTunes and Stitcher,

5572
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:29,520
is it also available as an MP3?

5573
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:31,670
Can they just download it
if they have like a zoom,

5574
02:47:31,850 --> 02:47:35,340
if they want to go to David seaman.com

that's it.

5578
02:47:37,561 --> 02:47:38,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
