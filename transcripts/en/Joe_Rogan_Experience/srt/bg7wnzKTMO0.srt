1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,080
The general experience,
I watched the thing,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,630
the crazy eddie.
Do you remember Crazy Eddie?

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,450
When he was getting.
His prices are insane.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,520
Crazy.
Eddie did tell anybody who crazy.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,400
It was crazy.
It was a guy that had stores in all five

6
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:17,670
boroughs of New York wholesale outlets,
tvs,

7
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,040
stereos,
tvs and everything like that.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,390
I saw.
I was watching them.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,440
SNBC greed.
They have a series called grace given

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,270
us.
Let me hear this motherfucker.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,780
Anything and everything and hold letter
came in.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,090
Remember we are not under.
We will not be undersold and we made it

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,850
pretty frequently,
but now

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,320
he's wearing a Santa Claus outfit.
He's going fucking crazy with fake snow

15
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,970
in the background.
He

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,280
like,
like he like hit it out of the park.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,840
Didn't he go to Israel?
He went to high,

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,750
but the most brilliant thing he did was
he took it either.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,300
Don't,
don't fucking check fact me on this.

20
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:13,210
He took it either his nephew,
his son in law,

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,420
somebody that he was related to blood,
put them through college so he could get

22
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:23,701
a job at the irs so they could figure
out how to rob from the irs.

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,630
This is how fucking insane this guy was.
I'm watching this diet and how they got

24
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:35,860
crazy crazy.
Eddie fled after he started just buying

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,560
boxes.
You know how you met me years ago,

26
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:42,760
you would be driving in New York and
there was some guy selling stereo

27
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,660
speakers.
Yeah.

28
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,430
And then you'd take them home and it was
two bricks.

29
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,040
Yep.
Well he did the same thing to investors.

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,490
He took boxes,
filled them up with bricks and just

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,400
stuck them in a warehouse and then he
went public.

32
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,780
So he got everybody to come down and
look at all his inventory and all these

33
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,590
fact checkers.
They're checking boxes as a bricks and

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,250
whoa.
And he had five fucking warehouses all

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,230
around.
They will all fake and he got all this

36
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:11,310
money.
He fled to Israel and he fled for a

37
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,090
while,
but they knew he was a pussy hound.

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,560
Right.
So they got them like Escobar style,

39
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,091
they got,
I'm like,

40
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,350
you know,
on the phone like I'm going to a store

41
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,500
or something crazy.
And what they did was they put a blonde

42
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:28,501
on the side of the road with a miniskirt
and they knew eventually he would drive

43
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:33,571
by and stopped and he stopped.
That's how they nailed them.

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,530
What is the.
Did you google the with the richest

45
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,600
woman in the world where they got their
money from?

46
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,440
He's a bad motherfucker,
paramus syosset,

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
Long Island.
And he had commercials.

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,510
He was the first one that pushed to
commercial barrier.

49
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,220
I mean I would like to look at how many
on the left

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,810
will attack others for not being
progressive enough,

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,990
not being left enough.
So I think it's a panic,

52
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,310
right?
You said this is the kind of behavior

53
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,590
you see in a panic,
a moral panic for example.

54
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,850
And so helen and I,
the third person who worked on the

55
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,120
project with us,
Helen and I wrote an essay about a year

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,900
and a half ago and talking about how the
extremism on both sides is really the

57
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,630
problem and most people reject it.
And should fight it.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,030
Most of us are sensible people in the
middle who hate this.

59
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:30,340
In fact,
data just came out showing that it's 80

60
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,220
percent of the population,
the fringes,

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,930
both sides.
So,

62
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,930
and only eight percent are on the left
and 12 percent are on the right of the

63
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,250
fringe.
However that works out.

64
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,880
And so we wrote this thing and we said
that what's going on?

65
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,820
Actually we called it an existential
polarization.

66
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,850
So you have this idea that everything's
an existential crisis.

67
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,620
So the far right,
we'll start with them,

68
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,810
sees that if the Democrats get power,
oh,

69
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,180
it's open borders.
The terrorists are coming in.

70
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,040
Our entire way of life is going to be
destroyed.

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,840
Catastrophe,
catastrophe,

72
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,860
Ono,
Judith Butler's,

73
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:07,750
you mean 95 genders?
Quick Stop the Democrats no matter what.

74
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,910
And then you have the left.
Oh my God,

75
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,520
if they get power that everything's
gonna,

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,420
be racist.
We're going to be beating gays in the

77
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,400
snow.
It's going to just be the worst thing.

78
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,510
And that's actually kind of a joke,
but,

79
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,510
but it's,
it's for real though,

80
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,610
that they think that the world is going
to fall apart.

81
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,250
If the other side gets power,
and so when you have that kind of a

82
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,350
situation,
you have a panic and you see the

83
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,440
slightest bit of advantage happening on
the other side is just something to

84
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,730
completely freak out about.

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,680
And then what do you do?
You say,

86
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,640
oh well the only possible recipe to
balance the scales to turn further our

87
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,170
way.
If we go toward the middle,

88
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,770
that puts the balance.
Say if the right goes really far right,

89
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,750
and we on the left,
moved toward the middle.

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,550
Now the whole balance is moved,
right?

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,670
So the only way to keep the balance
close to the middle is if they go right,

92
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,760
we go left,
right?

93
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,150
Right.
So then that's going to keep the

94
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,800
balance.
But what that actually does is it.

95
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,780
This is going to get nerdy.
Hang on.

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,800
That actually puts all of the weight on
the outsides and you think about a

97
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,790
spinning thing,
right?

98
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,300
It's got centrifical forces happening.
What's that trying to do is going to rip

99
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,350
the spinning thing apart?
Well,

100
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,100
if you have all the weight crammed in
the middle,

101
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,080
it's like wheel.

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,800
It doesn't come apart right now.
Imagine if you had like two billiard

103
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,940
balls and you have like this big long
stick and there's two holes for the

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,800
builder bars.
They don't go in it like locked in

105
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,634
there,
just sitting there.

106
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,900
You spend that.
What's going to happen there?

107
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,980
Fly Right off,
right?

108
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,740
So if you have all the weight on the
outside and you start spinning a thing.

109
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,400
So that's like the political
conversations.

110
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,310
That dynamic is going to rip the thing
apart.

111
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:31,930
The more weight gets to the outside.
So one side go into the fringe doesn't

112
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,400
mean the other side should go to the
fringe.

113
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,930
That's how you a nation apart.

114
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,883
And uh,
I,

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,250
I pass out to 30 hits,
2:30 in the morning hits and I'm just,

116
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,390
I'm just,
I wake up because I hear the alarm,

117
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,070
you know,
kind of pop off at the,

118
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:48,730
at the hotel.
So now I'm hearing these alarms starting

119
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,220
to go off and I've,
you know,

120
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,680
I checked out,
I checked out on front,

121
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:54,440
I checked out through the window and I
check the lobby.

122
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,460
Nobody was moving.
So I was like,

123
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:58,700
it's a false alarm.
So I got the pillow put over my head and

124
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,180
every can slept through the alarm and
that happened about 2:30.

125
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,940
Now 4:30 comes about on this time.
I don't wake up,

126
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,550
I don't wake up because of the alarm.
I wake up because of the smoke.

127
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm like coughing on my.
I'm like coughing on the smug.

128
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,730
And at first I thought I was dreaming.
So I wake up and I,

129
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,380
at that time I had,
I had uh,

130
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,670
I slept in my town.

131
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,790
I taught tired,
I was and I got up and then we'll go to

132
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,520
turn the lights and the lights turning
on and then I go through the window and

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,600
check the window.
And next,

134
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,750
you know what?
I see the car right in front of me on

135
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,020
fire.
Uh,

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,740
three fourths of the hotels,
like I was probably about five rooms

137
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,960
away from getting hit hard.
Like I'm talking about like,

138
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,110
like fire coming out the window like
that.

139
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,930
And I'm waking up to this,
like thinking I'm dreaming,

140
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,370
you know,
in a towel.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,740
And then the lights,
everything was dark,

142
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,280
but I could see everything,
like the room started getting hot and I

143
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,510
couldn't,
I couldn't hold my breath.

144
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,560
The more I started looking for my shoes,
I couldn't find my shoes and I,

145
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,600
I bumped into my slacks that I let them
on the ironing board that the night

146
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,440
before and I put them on and I grabbed,
I grabbed the,

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,870
I grabbed my phone and I jumped out the
window.

148
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,160
I just thought the one that jumped out
the window,

149
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,650
my right foot catches on fire.
My right foot catches on fire fast and

150
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm looking at kind of,
I'm,

151
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm,
I'm,

152
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm Kinda,
you know,

153
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,220
trying to put it out and it's crazy how
I can see how people could catch on fire

154
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:16,880
real quick because my right leg was,
it was,

155
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,560
it was crazy.
Wow.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,110
So I jumped out and I started walking as
I'm walking them,

157
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,780
seeing like this,
the hotel in front of us was all in

158
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,120
sticks to like the whole thing was just
in sticks,

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,670
like the fire had just ate that thing
up.

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,340
There's a building in front of me on
fire.

161
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,620
Like I'm just walking through the
streets going up the hill and just

162
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,460
thinking like God can be a horrible way
to die,

163
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,100
horrible way to die.
And I got to,

164
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,260
I got a bird's eye view windows on top
of the,

165
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,170
uh,
when I was on top of the hill and then I

166
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,420
saw there's a cop down there,
there's a cop down in the middle of the

167
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,120
freeway just like,
you know,

168
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
that's,
that's where I got to go.

169
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,190
So now I'm running fast and I've seen as
this brush fire kind of come along and

170
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,980
just I'm seeing like California,
like just catch on fire,

171
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:01,700
like completely.
Like through my eyes had jumped over the

172
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,740
fence to get to the freeway,
you know,

173
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,900
no problem.
I'll jump over the second fence.

174
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,670
And then the third fence,
it was a,

175
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,200
it was a very,
like a flimsy,

176
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:14,201
a kind of fence and never brad as I,
as I jumped out and read snag,

177
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,130
like part of my snacks to keep in mind I
was,

178
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,380
I had the only thing I had on with
slacks,

179
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,220
I was commando slacks,
no shirt,

180
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,340
no shoes,
like out in the cold in California.

181
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,570
And as I that flimsy fence as,
as I jumped out that last fence at like

182
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,350
cut it like a part of the fence.
I grabbed my butt and it just,

183
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,040
it cut me open heart and a tour like
half the lake.

184
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,480
So now I'm full.
I'm full of smoke on my right foot's

185
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,550
burn.
And uh,

186
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:45,370
I'm,
I'm pretty much half naked in the middle

187
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,360
of the freeway.
So I see the cop car and I go up to the

188
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,610
cop car and as I'm going up to it,
I'm sorry,

189
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,390
the freaking cop car leaves,
like I can just scrambles.

190
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:57,990
I'm just like,
oh my God.

191
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,580
As soon as that cop car left a,
I remember seeing this big as diesel,

192
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,760
like coming towards me and never get
into the middle of the freeway and

193
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,540
Kinda,
you know,

194
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,700
waving my hands like,
you gotta take me,

195
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,680
I die like this,
like hit me dude.

196
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,900
And as it got closer,
so it was a fire truck and I,

197
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,450
and I get rescued.
I get rescued by the fireman.

198
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,690
They put me in their fire chicken.
They're just kinda like looking at him.

199
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,860
He's like down,
do you just,

200
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,090
you just survived death.

201
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,950
Oh this is it.
This is the video sent to me on that.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,420
Oh,
here it is on Worldstar.

203
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,160
He kept some with the leg kick.
The guy gets up now watch this.

204
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,803
Watch this.

205
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,480
Boom.
Strong leg.

206
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,650
Perfectly timed.
Watch this.

207
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,910
Watch this.
Ah,

208
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,030
out.
Go from the beginning though.

209
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:52,130
In the beginning you see long.
It's two minutes long.

210
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah.
But the beginning,

211
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,330
you see how the fight starts to this
guy,

212
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,810
the guys a come on motherfucker,
you want some of this?

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,490
Get a shirt off.
And the guys like trying,

214
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,730
he's by himself and he's like,
no,

215
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,130
we'll do one on one.
One on one,

216
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,120
one on one.
You fought another dude first diddy?

217
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

218
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:09,980
This guy,
this guy,

219
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:13,130
this is the guy legs kicks.
And after he laid kicks,

220
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:15,110
this dude,
the other guy says,

221
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,580
come on,
keep it over here.

222
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,670
Who doesn't have a wife beater on Kimmy?
Some volume on this.

223
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,580
What's going to be taken down?
Rondo isn't going to get taken down from

224
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,690
youtube.
Oh,

225
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:27,540
okay,
okay to you.

226
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,150
Turn it down.
So the guy's like,

227
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:32,330
come on man.
So like one dude by himself with a bunch

228
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,160
of other dudes,
but he steps in.

229
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,230
This guy knows how to fight.
Look at it as throwing a jab and the

230
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,700
watch this leg kick your dog.

231
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,300
Oh.
So there's quite a bit first whole

232
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,450
different guy.
No,

233
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,920
no,
no.

234
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,150
Yeah,
but that's it right there.

235
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,110
Leg kick,
boom.

236
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,870
And he cracks them.
And so then the guy's like realizing

237
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,730
he's in trouble.
And so he starts backing away and the

238
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,570
guys coming forward,
he's like,

239
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,780
come on bitch.
And so then the other guy afterwards

240
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:56,270
goes,
oh,

241
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,910
you think you're to load,
kick in the leg kick.

242
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,680
So he comes back,
he's like,

243
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,170
tired of this dude walking away from him
and he's like,

244
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,830
I fucked this dude up with one punch and
he wants it back up and this and this

245
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,210
guy goes,
you want to kick,

246
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,580
you want Luke kick here right here.

247
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,313
Cool.
You don't want

248
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,690
to kick him.
But

249
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,530
he's like,
I'm going to try you.

250
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,690
Let's take a drag of a cigarette first

251
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,890
and then takes his shirt off.
Guy has no idea how to fight,

252
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,390
which is Hilaire fat.
Not In shape,

253
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,000
uhm,
like kick guys.

254
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,660
But people are so ridiculous with this
idea that they think they know how to

255
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,494
fight.
Yeah,

256
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,480
Bang out cold.
But that's dark man.

257
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,570
The banging the head,
the back of the head off the concrete is

258
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:45,990
dark.
