1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,160
The joe rogan experience.
I wants it thing the idea crazy.

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,680
Eddie,
do you remember Crazy Eddie?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,170
His prices are insane.
Crazy,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,390
crazy.
It was crazy.

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:17,040
It was a guy that had stores in all five
boroughs of New York wholesale outlets,

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,360
TV's,
stereos,

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,760
tvs and everything like that.
I saw,

8
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,800
I was watching them and some BC greed.
They have a series called

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,280
give us,
let me hear this mother fucker

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,550
[inaudible]
crazy.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,290
He's wearing a Santa Claus outfit.
He's going fucking crazy with fake snow

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,950
in the background.
He fucking like just this,

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,420
like he like hit it out of the park.
Didn't he go to Israel?

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,450
But the most brilliant thing he did was
he took it either don't,

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,800
don't fucking,
you know,

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,830
check back me on this.
He took it either his nephew,

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,130
his son in law,
somebody that he was related to two

18
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,700
blood,
put them through college so he could get

19
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:23,701
a job at the irs so they could figure
out how to rob from the irs.

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,180
This is how fucking and saying this guy
was.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,020
I'm watching this diet and how they got
crazy,

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,581
right.
Crazy.

23
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:36,640
Eddie fled after he started.
Just by boxes.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,760
You know how you let me use it.
Go you,

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,760
you would be driving in New York and
there was some guy selling stereo

26
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,360
speakers.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,770
Yeah.
And then you'd take them home and it was

28
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,690
two bricks.
Yep.

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,570
Well he did the same thing to investors.
He took boxes,

30
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,930
filled them up with bricks and just
stuck them in a warehouse.

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,980
And then he went public.
So he got everybody to come down and

32
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:01,090
look at all his inventory and all these
fact checkers that checking boxes or

33
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,980
bricks and them,
whoa.

34
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,250
And he had,
I mean five fucking warehouses all

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,450
around.
They will all fake.

36
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,320
And he got all this money.
He fled to Israel and he fled for a

37
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,150
while,
but they knew he was a pussy hound.

38
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,560
Right.
So they got him like Escobar style.

39
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,191
They've got,
I'm like,

40
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,450
you know,
on the phone,

41
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,430
like I'm going to the store or something
crazy.

42
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,210
And what they did was they put a blonde
on the side of the road with a mini

43
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:30,211
skirt and they knew eventually he would
drive by and stopped and he stopped.

44
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,090
That's how they nailed them.
What is that?

45
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,760
Did you google the,
the richest women in the world where

46
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:44,761
they got their money from?
He's a bad motherfucker,

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,850
paramus,
syosset long island

48
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,370
and he had commercials.
He was the first one that pushed to

49
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,020
commercial barrier.
I mean,

50
00:02:56,021 --> 00:03:00,220
I would like to look at how many on the
left

51
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,810
we'll attack others for not being
progressive enough,

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,990
not being left enough.
So I think it's a panic,

53
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,400
right?
You see this is the kind of behavior you

54
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,590
see in a panic,
a moral panic for example.

55
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,850
And so helen and I,
the third person who worked on the

56
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,150
project with us,
Helen and I wrote an essay about a year

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,900
and a half ago and talking about how the
extremism on both sides is really the

58
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,240
problem.
And most people reject it and should

59
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,310
fight it.
Most of us are sensible people in the

60
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,330
middle who hate this.
In fact,

61
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:33,250
data just came out showing that it's 80%
of the population date hate the fringes,

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,940
both sides.
So,

63
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:38,350
and only 8% are on the left and 12% are
on the right of the fringe.

64
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,250
However,
that works out.

65
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,220
And so we wrote this thing and we said
that what's going on actually we called

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,820
an existential polarization.

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
So you have this idea that everything's
an existential crisis.

68
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,650
So the the far right,
we'll start with them,

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,810
sees that if the Democrats get power,
oh,

70
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,690
it's open borders.
The terrorists are coming in our entire

71
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,120
way of life is going to be destroyed.
Catastrophe,

72
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,150
catastrophe,
Ono.

73
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,170
Judith Butler is going to be 95 genders.
Quick Stop the Democrats no matter what.

74
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,910
And then you have the left.
Oh my God.

75
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,130
If they get power that everything's
going to be racist,

76
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,870
we are going to be beating gays in the
snow.

77
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,540
It's going to just be the worst thing in
the,

78
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,370
that's actually kind of a joke,
but,

79
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,510
but it's,
it's for real though,

80
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,270
that they think that the world is going
to fall apart if the other side gets

81
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:24,250
power.
And so when you have that kind of a

82
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,320
situation,
you have a panic and you see the

83
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,440
slightest bit of advantage happening on
the other side is just something to

84
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,730
completely freak out about.

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,680
And then what do you do?
You say,

86
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,080
oh,
well the only possible recipe to balance

87
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,200
the scale is to turn further our way.
If we go toward the middle,

88
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,800
that puts the balance,
say if the right goes really far right,

89
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,750
and we on the left,
moved toward the middle,

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
now the whole balance has moved,
right?

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,670
So the only way to keep the balance
close to the middle as if they go right,

92
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,710
we go left,
right,

93
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,150
right.
So then that's going to keep the

94
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,830
balance.
But what that actually does is it,

95
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,780
this is going to get nerdy.
Hang on.

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,800
That actually puts all of the weight on
the outsides and you think about a

97
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,820
spinning thing,
right?

98
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,270
It's got centrifugal forces happening.
What's that trying to do is going to rip

99
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,350
the spinning thing apart?
Well,

100
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,100
if you have all the weight crammed in
the middle,

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,250
like a wheel,
it doesn't come apart right?

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,420
Now imagine if you had like two billiard
balls and you have like this big long

103
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,410
stick and there's two holes for the
builder bars.

104
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,920
They don't go in at like locked in
there,

105
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,910
just sitting there and you spend that.
What's going to happen there?

106
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,980
Fly Right off,
right.

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,710
So if you have all the way down the
outside and you start spinning a thing,

108
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,390
so that's like the political
conversations,

109
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,310
that dynamic is going to rip the thing
apart.

110
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:31,930
The more weight gets to the outside.
So one side go into the fringe doesn't

111
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,400
mean the other side should go to the
fringe.

112
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,930
That's how you tear a nation apart.

113
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,883
And uh,
I,

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,950
I pass out to 30 hits,
two 30 in the morning heads and I'm

115
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:40,784
just,
uh,

116
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,580
I'm just,
you know,

117
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,830
I wake up because I hear the alarm,
you know,

118
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,410
kind of pop off at the,
at the hotel said,

119
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,250
now I'm hearing these alarms starting to
go off.

120
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,230
And I've,
you know,

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
I checked out,
I checked out on front,

122
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:54,440
I checked out through the window and I
checked out the lobby.

123
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,460
Nobody was moving.
So I was like,

124
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,830
it's a false alarm.
So I grabbed the pillow,

125
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,990
put over my head and every can slap to
the alarm.

126
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,460
And that happened about two 30.
Now four 30 comes about on this time I

127
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,170
don't wake up,
I don't wake up because of the alarm.

128
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,450
I wake up because of the smoke,
I'm like coffee and I'm,

129
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,990
I'm like coughing on the smog.
And at first I thought I was dreaming.

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,690
So I wake up and I,
at that time I had,

131
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,410
I had,
uh,

132
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,640
you know,
I slept in my town.

133
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,480
That's how tired I was and I got up and
I'm going to turn the lights in,

134
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,960
the light tank turning down and then I
go through the window and a check the

135
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:24,830
window and next,
you know,

136
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,320
and I see the car right in front of me
on fire.

137
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,300
Uh,
three fourths of the hotels,

138
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,060
like I was probably about five rooms
away from like getting hit hard.

139
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,960
Like I'm talking about like,
like fire coming out the window like

140
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,250
that.
And I'm waking up to this,

141
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,560
like thinking I'm dreaming,
you know,

142
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,750
in a towel.
And then the lights,

143
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,840
everything was dark,
but I could see everything like it.

144
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,580
Like the room started getting hot and I
couldn't,

145
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,280
I couldn't hold my breath and the more I
started looking for my shoes,

146
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,330
I couldn't find my shoes.

147
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,600
And I bumped into my slacks that I left
them on the ironing board that the night

148
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,410
before and I put them on and I grabbed,
I grabbed the,

149
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,870
I grabbed my phone and I jumped out the
window.

150
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,720
I jumped out the one that jumped out the
wound on my right foot,

151
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,650
catches on fire,
I right foot catches on fire fast and

152
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,900
I'm looking to kind of,
I'm,

153
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm Kinda,
you know,

154
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,250
trying to put it out and it's crazy how
I can see how people could catch on fire

155
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,870
real quick.
Cause my,

156
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:17,780
my right leg was like food.
It was crazy.

157
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,290
Wow.
So I jumped out and I started walking.

158
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,890
I says I'm walking them seeing like
this,

159
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,160
the hotel in front of us was all in
sticks through like the whole thing was

160
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,810
just in sticks,
like the,

161
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,670
the fire had just ate that thing up.

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,340
There's a building in front of me on,
on fire.

163
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,620
Like I'm just walking through the
streets going up the hill and just

164
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,470
thinking like God can be a horrible way
to die.

165
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,280
Horrible way to die.
Fuck.

166
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,630
And I got to,
I got a bird's eye view when it was on

167
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,740
top of the,
uh,

168
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,640
when I was on top of the hill and then I
saw there's a cop down there,

169
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,280
there was a cop down,
uh,

170
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
and in the middle of the free ones just
like,

171
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,360
you know,
that's,

172
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,460
that's where I got to go.
So now I'm running fast and I've seen at

173
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,400
this brush fire kind of come along and
just,

174
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm seeing like California like just
catch on fire like completely like

175
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:02,720
through my eyes.
I jump over the first fence to get to

176
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,740
the freeway,
you know,

177
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,930
no problem.
Jump over the second fence.

178
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,730
And then the third fence,
it was a,

179
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:11,000
it was a very like a flimsy,
a kind of fence.

180
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,330
And I remember I as I,
as I jumped out in rich snag,

181
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,130
like part of my snacks to keep in mind,
I was,

182
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,380
I had,
the only thing I had on was slacks.

183
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,220
I W I got what's commando slacks,
no shirt,

184
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,340
no shoes,
like out in the cold in California.

185
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,740
And as I,
that flimsy fence has,

186
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,030
as I jumped out that last fence,
it like cut it like a part of the fence.

187
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:36,680
I grabbed my butt and it just,
it cut me open hard and a tour like half

188
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,500
the leg.
So now I'm full,

189
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,470
I'm full,
I'm full of smoke on my right foot's

190
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,580
burn.
And uh,

191
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:45,490
um,
I'm pretty much half naked in the middle

192
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,360
of for you.
So I see the cop car and I go up to the

193
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,610
cop car and as I'm going up to it,
I'm sorry,

194
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,940
the freaking cop car leaves like fucking
just scrambles and just like,

195
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,990
oh my God.

196
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,380
And as soon as that cop car left,
uh,

197
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,570
I remember seeing like this big as
diesel,

198
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,950
like coming towards me and every get
into the middle of the freeway and kind

199
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:06,541
of,
you know,

200
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,720
waving my hands like,
you gonna take me,

201
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,650
I die like this,
like hit me dude.

202
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,710
And a,
as it got closer to,

203
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,800
so I was a fire truck and I,
and I get Raskin,

204
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,670
I get rescued by the fireman.
It put me in the fire truck and then

205
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,200
just kind of like looking at him.
He's like down,

206
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,120
do you just,
you just survived death.

207
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,531
Oh,
this is it.

208
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,060
This is the video sent to me on that.
Oh,

209
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,470

It's on Worldstar.

210
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,750
Poom watch this.
He gets it with the leg kick.

211
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:32,190
The guy gets up.
Now watch this.

212
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,540
Showing it on.
Watch this.

213
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,203
Okay.

214
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,570
Boom.

215
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,650

216
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,210

218
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,600
Go from the beginning though.
In the beginning.

219
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,130
You see it's long.
It's two minutes long.

220
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,110
Yeah,
but at the beginning you see how the

221
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,800
fight starts to this guy.
Um,

222
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,130
the guys are,

223
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,630
You want some of this?
Get his shirt off.

224
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,560
And the guys like trying,
he's by himself and he's like,

225
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,610
dough.
We'll do one on one.

226
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,690
One on one.
One on one.

227
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,850
You fought another dude first.
Did he?

228
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

229
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:09,950
This guy,
this guy,

230
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,760
this is the guy legs kicks and after he
leg kicks is dude.

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,560
The other guy says,
come on,

232
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,740
keep it over here.
Who doesn't have a wife beater on gimme

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,430
some volume on this.
What's going to take it down?

234
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,540
Rondo.
Just how he gonna put up.

235
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,910
Is it going to get taken down from
youtube?

236
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,991
Oh,
okay.

237
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,130
Okay.
Till you turn it down.

238
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,150
Yeah.
So the guy was like,

239
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,910
come on man.
So like this just one dude by himself

240
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,160
with a bunch of other dudes,
but he steps in.

241
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,230
This guy knows how to fight.
Look at it as throwing a jab and the

242
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,210
wash,
this leg kick.

243
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,270
Oh,
so there's quite a bit first whole

244
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,460
different guy.
No,

245
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:44,920
no,
no.

246
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,150
Yeah,
but that's it right there.

247
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,110
Leg kick,
boom.

248
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:50,020
Then he cracks him.
And so then the guys like realizing he's

249
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,390
in trouble and so he starts backing away
and the guys coming forward,

250
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:53,224
he's like,
come on bitch.

251
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,020
And so then the other guy afterwards
goes,

252
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:57,640
oh,
you think you got load kick in the leg

253
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,020
kick.
So he comes back,

254
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:02,170
he's like tired of this dude walking
away from him and he's like,

255
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:06,040
I fucked this dude up with one punch and
he wants a backup and this and this guy

256
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,210
goes,
you want to Luke kick?

257
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,580
You want to Luke kick here.
Right here.

258
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,683
Okay

259
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,860
dog.
Cool.

260
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:17,840
You don't want to fucking kick
kick home.

261
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,090
Boy,
it takes out.

262
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,890
What is this?
He's like,

263
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,700
I'm gonna try you sticks a drag of a
cigarette first

264
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,980
and it takes his shirt off.
Guy has no idea how to fight,

265
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,270
which is hilarious.
Fat,

266
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,970
not in shape.
Tome leg kick guys.

267
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,660
But people are so ridiculous with this
idea that they think they know how to

268
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,560
fight.
Yeah,

269
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,480
Bang out cold.
But that's dark man.

270
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,570
The banging the head,
the back of the head off the concrete is

271
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:50,571
dark.
Okay.
