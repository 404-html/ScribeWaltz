00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,700
So what kind of tattoo are you
talking about when you hit 10 million?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,350
It's going get that
panther down your neck.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,630
Get something on your neck.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,660
Maybe like an ellipse,

6
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,530
like a lip kiss.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,503
That'd be sick.

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,880
Like a realistic one that I liked that.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,710
I liked that.

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,040
Tat that tentacles.

11
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,270
And now you're talking nonsense.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,090
Can you try to get that?

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,750
That's given me yared towers.

14
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,890
That's 45th.

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,221
Yeah.

16
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,210
That's many days.

17
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,390
Five or six days and you have
to take time out like that.

18
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,224
That's a Kenyan.

19
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,690
You get your wife to
kiss you on the next one.

20
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,740
Hundred percent no to that.

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,900
How about if you get one right above your
been been been been denied right above

22
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:44,370
it.

23
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,450
I hold my Dick like,

24
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,550
oh,

25
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,383
I write up about my,

26
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,250
my hammer home at Dick up and you
just tattoo another set of balls.

27
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,303
Dicks.

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,070
They do get their tests.

29
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,511
They do.

30
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm thinking about doing it.

31
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
No fuck off.

32
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,600
I want to make it sparkly.

33
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,333
It does.

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,440
It doesn't spark up.

35
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,030
If you were going to
get your Dick Tattooed,

36
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,800
what would you do?

37
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,740
Have a little ears,

38
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,603
barnacles,

39
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,600
barnacles or warts.

40
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,730
Elephant is around me and make it black.

41
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,143
Of course there.

42
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,940
I'd sleeve it out in dark
ink if you could possibly be.

43
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,750
Yeah.

44
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,190
Has any guy ever like done that?

45
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,830
Because I know guys get
their entire forms black.

46
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,401
Have you ever seen that?

47
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,860
Like white guys will be a really weird.

48
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,400
It's really weird.

49
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
Like they have one color,

50
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,590
one color tattoo and I always
wondered if like that's a cover up.

51
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,180
Like they maybe had some shitty tattoos.

52
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,670
I always knew it as a cover up.

53
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,500
Like it was a real bad tattoo,

54
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,610
like maybe a girl or something.

55
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,800
So then they just blacked it all
out because you can't cover it up.

56
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,770
There was a famous dude
who had that in a band.

57
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,760
What band was that?

58
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,240
Tim?

59
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,170
Rage against the machine.

60
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,100
Yes,

61
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:44,610
that's right.

62
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:44,971
That dude,

63
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,190
his whole arms was like all black.

64
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,480
A lot of times don't like
recovering addicts get like
the black band and they do

65
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,420
how many years and then just go
black all the way up to your ankles.

66
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,790
I want something on my back,

67
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,440
like right at the top of my back.

68
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,550
Should have your shockers.

69
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,493
Oh

70
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,020
yeah.

71
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,580
Look at this dude.

72
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,900
I want something over my
roots that looks bad ass.

73
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,250
That's very odd.

74
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,470
It would take for to kids.

75
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,933
Who is that guy?

76
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,081
He's from rage shoe.

77
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,980
That looks pretty sweet.

78
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,043
Name Jamie.

79
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,260
Tim.

80
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,501
Tim.

81
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,730
See he doesn't have a name.

82
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,820
That's a bad ass tattoo.

83
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,530
Yeah,

84
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,363
I like those.

85
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,690
What are those things?

86
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,660
That's from like some Japanese
symptom at the tadpoles.

87
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,800
Tadpoles in the middle.

88
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,120
Is that come?

89
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,940
They'll come around a cycle.

90
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,030
It's called Com.

91
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,220
I would get that common.

92
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,801
A Tornado.

93
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,300
I don't have to shave
my chest and my arms,

94
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,060
but that's what happens when you come
into a garbage disposal and you hit the

95
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,894
button.

96
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,580
It's like a symbol of it.

97
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,960
Hey Man,

98
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,131
dude,

99
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,100
he looks sweet.

100
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,210
I'm not mad at that at all.

101
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,500
It might be the best one I've seen though.

102
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,290
They all don't look like that.

103
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,560
It didn't go too deep.

104
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,750
He went like half sleeve,

105
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,510
like down to like the bottom of his bicep.

106
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,390
It's pretty cool.

107
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,510
He's always wearing armor.

108
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,530
Maybe I'll get to six shooters on my hips.

109
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:03,370
You don't just get one tucked in your
lower back pointing towards your asshole,

110
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,320
but just an arrow.

111
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,670
Fun starts here.

112
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,500
Who are these people to get guns like
fighters do near their porn stars?

113
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,170
Porn dns pointing down towards their.

114
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,200
The best tattoos in the game as far as.

115
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,123
Well,

116
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,101
excuse me sir.

117
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,150
Your cheeks are tatted.

118
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,040
This man needs to hit a gym occasionally.

119
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,320
Yeah.

120
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,150
I don't like his body.

121
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,010
Can have the dad bod and
you get all those tasks.

122
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,360
If you're going to work on a tattoo,

123
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,060
if you're gonna your body's going to be
sleeved out like that's not even a dad

124
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:28,271
bod.

125
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,420
That's a good luck getting a woman to
fuck you so you can become a dad bod.

126
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,791
Yeah.

127
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,780
It's a Vegan body out there.

128
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,650
Sorry everybody to.

129
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,340
How dare you.

130
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
I dare you start it now.

131
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,290
I'm gonna get a bunch of pictures
of vegans who are shredded.

132
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,640
Going to be very angry at you.

133
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,230
I got a new bit about uh,

134
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,260
seeing a couple of fucking in
a hotel room across from me.

135
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,640
Yeah.

136
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:45,881
Yeah.

137
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,080
It was fucking amazing.

138
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:47,351
I mean,

139
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,240
I won't do the bid,

140
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:49,074
I'll tell you,

141
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,640
the story has now turned into a bit.

142
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,610
Get fucking crushes.

143
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,780
I mean it went from you to have sometimes
you get a new bit and it can take

144
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:02,440
three months to become your closing bit
because you're still working out this

145
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,720
thing raced to closing bit in
like five tellings of it really.

146
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
So I won't do the bit,

147
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:11,410
but I'll tell you the story which
is basically near is even Portland.

148
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,320
The hotel is like a horseshoe shape.

149
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,160
So I'm on the 10th floor and I look
across into a room and the curtains are

150
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:18,401
open,

151
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,234
lights are on,

152
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,410
chick is on her back,

153
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,101
legs up.

154
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:26,101
And this dude who's ripped his fucking
out and I'm just standing there looking

155
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,490
at him like,

156
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,350
like this is the greatest
thing I've ever done.

157
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,720
Such great things to ever happen.

158
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:36,340
I guess I slept my bag in my hand
and I'm just transfixed and they're,

159
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:36,670
you know,

160
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,720
they're really fucking.

161
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,360
And then at one point he uh,

162
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,090
he,

163
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,600
he's,

164
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,510
he goes down on one knee,

165
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,871
eats her out,

166
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,531
stands up,

167
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,400
keeps fucking.

168
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,750
I'm like high five in the glass,

169
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,584
like go

170
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,110
and then and so I had the curtain closed
because I didn't want them to see me,

171
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,660
but I popped my head through the door.

172
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,700
I looked like a photographer
from the 1930 days

173
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,230
and then I started thinking about what
it might sound like and this sound,

174
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,430
this where it gets creepy,

175
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,190
creepy year is I leave my room.

176
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:18,191
I walked down the hall and I stand outside
the room and I listen and I hear him

177
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,640
grunting and I hear her go

178
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,840
to my room and I call.

179
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,380
I call the room just watching him waiting,

180
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,060
waiting and he didn't pick up,

181
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,410
but if he did I would have been like,

182
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,883
yeah,

183
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,710
you've been bitten by a box jellyfish?

184
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,580
Yes.

185
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,080
Dude,

186
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,050
I've been stung.

187
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,501
Technical.

188
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:47,591
Okay.

189
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:47,861
Yeah,

190
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,110
I'm saying bitten their face.

191
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,330
You've been looked at and read.

192
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,420
You've been read the riot act
now they don't have my mouth.

193
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,710
Did you get.

194
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,950
How'd get stung or do you.

195
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,130
Did

196
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,150
you not know what was there?

197
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,984
Like what?

198
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,000
I didn't know what to say.

199
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,720
Obviously I was about 12
years old in Torres Strait,

200
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:09,320
which is a bunch of islands in between
Australia and Papa New Guinea and I was

201
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,030
playing with a holly
Patar Strait islanders,

202
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,730
a local boys playing in the ocean,

203
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,060
you know,

204
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,170
just swimming around.

205
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,570
And then I had one wraparound.

206
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:17,970
My,

207
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,000
my leg quadricep.

208
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,660
Um,

209
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,171
yeah,

210
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,070
a lot of pain.

211
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,400
I've heard a women who've had children
have said that and been stamped,

212
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,393
have said that it's,

213
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,640
it's far superior pain to
childbirth that superior,

214
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,700
like they enjoy a better or

215
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,900
a far worse,

216
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,550
basically in orders of magnitude worse
than childbirth is how they relate the

217
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,000
pain.

218
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
You'd probably have to talk to someone
who's been stung by a bullet ant,

219
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,330
which is supposed to be one
of the most painful things.

220
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,460
I wouldn't wonder who's got the.

221
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,600
She's got to know,

222
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
like if you get someone,

223
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,431
listen,

224
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,710
I know you've been stung by a bullet in.

225
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
I'd like to encourage you to try the
box jellyfish and tell me it's um,

226
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,471
yeah,

227
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,070
it's a lot of pain.

228
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,830
It's a kind of pain where you
have to scream expletives,

229
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,100
you know,

230
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,080
you can't just sit there and take it.

231
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,370
You have to be screaming something
because it's that painful and it's super

232
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,204
deadly

233
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,720
to the very old,

234
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,490
the very young and the humans,

235
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,100
we get stumped.

236
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,933
Right?

237
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,321
Yeah.

238
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:18,890
That's,

239
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,723
that's actually pretty good.

240
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,380
We're talking very young five,

241
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:21,621
six.

242
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,610
We're talking about the amount
of toxin to body mass basis.

243
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,973
If you're,

244
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,200
if you're a little tiny kid,

245
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,270
then that's a lot of toxin
for a small body mass.

246
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,470
If you're very old,

247
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,000
then it's heart attacks,

248
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,571
aneurysms,

249
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,404
that sort of stuff.

250
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:33,950
Wow.

251
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,010
Aneurysms fucking messes you up.

252
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,641
The pain.

253
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,430
It causes heart attacks or
because you just freak out.

254
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,711
Yeah.

255
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,544
Too much pain.

256
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,250
So just the physical sensation of pain
is the catalyst for these heart attacks

257
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,300
and all these different
things that you just,

258
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,250
your body freaks out.

259
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,471
I mean,

260
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,850
you aren't getting stung by a neurotoxin.

261
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,360
Don't get me wrong.

262
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,050
There's little in the
tentacles of the box jellyfish.

263
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,950
There's new mattresses,

264
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,400
a little tiny poisons,

265
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,240
dots basically.

266
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,430
And when it touches something biological,

267
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,450
um,

268
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,490
so that's why you can wear tiny
little thin lycra suit or pantyhose,

269
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,771
whatever,

270
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:06,520
as long as there's something in between
your skin and the box jellyfish will

271
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,420
never seen it.

272
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,100
But if it touches something biological,

273
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,840
then these little poisonous darts,

274
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,780
fire and they fire into your skin and
they inject a neurotoxin and it makes for

275
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
incredible amount of pain.

276
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,980
Incredible.

277
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,650
And the first day back then was vinegar.

278
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,520
So we had a bottle of vinegar
I remember clear as day.

279
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,400
My Dad came over and he
got the bottle of vinegar,

280
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,300
two liter bottle of vinegar.

281
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,390
And you just put one little splash on
there and then put the lid back up.

282
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,220
And I'm sort of screaming and I'm like,

283
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,370
what the whole bottle on there.

284
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:35,810
But he,

285
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,540
he wanted to save some in case some
of the local got stung as well.

286
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:38,890
So you could.

287
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,270
Oh my,

288
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,070
it's saving them for some folks he
doesn't even know I got one splash

289
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,480
was I was screaming some
explainers I'm over that one.

290
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,130
So how long does the pain last?

291
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,210
Um,

292
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,790
it was about six hours
before I just passed out.

293
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,430
It was six hours of
sitting there screaming,

294
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:56,941
expletives,

295
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,420
and then I,

296
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,890
I guess I just talked myself out,

297
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,161
you know,

298
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,060
and then I passed out.

299
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm still painful for
probably about six months.

300
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,774
Five months.

301
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,430
Yeah,

302
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,990
six months.

303
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,710
Yeah,

304
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,110
it,

305
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,390
it lasts for a long time.

306
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,310
Not as severe as that first six hours,

307
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,300
but it's still.

308
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:12,990
Yeah,

309
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,340
it's,

310
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,000
it's painful.

311
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
Six months.

312
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't recommend it now.

313
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,300
Oh my God.

314
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
That's insane.
