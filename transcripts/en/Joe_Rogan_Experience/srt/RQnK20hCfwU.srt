1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,111
you're here,

3
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:03,600
man,

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:03,841
here,

5
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,520
here when you were talking about Alaska,

6
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,240
you know,

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,920
and getting off the grid and all that.

8
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,323
Uh,

9
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,541
you know,

10
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,720
I had a transformative experience
that first time I went to Alaska,

11
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
I was in college in New York,

12
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,310
I was studying literature and one of my
teachers was a visiting professor that I

13
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,390
got to be friends with.

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,870
Was the youngest person to
ever be a professor at Oxford.

15
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,610
He's like a real big shot at Oxford.

16
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:26,971
I mean,

17
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,950
since 12 slash 61 or something.

18
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,290
This guy's the youngest
person to ever be a professor.

19
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,370
Then how old was he?

20
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,670
Twenty one when he was a full focus on.

21
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
Yeah.

22
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,151
Anyway,

23
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,500
he's very well known guy.

24
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,530
Indira Gandhi was his godmother.

25
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,710
He's written a bunch of books and all
this and he was a friend of mine and he

26
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,880
was uh,

27
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,510
I was in my,

28
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,751
I was,

29
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,270
skipped my junior year of college and the,

30
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,330
so I had a one more year of undergraduate
and then I was going to go to Oxford

31
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,190
for my phd,

32
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,130
thanks to this guy and his connections
and I was going to study literature

33
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:56,350
there,

34
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,990
do a phd and by the time I was 30 be
teaching somewhere hopefully have tenure

35
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,220
and be all set for life.

36
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,610
And so I skipped my junior year because
I found a loophole in the student

37
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,070
handbook where I could like scan through,

38
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,490
which I've done like every
school I've ever been in,

39
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,830
every job I've ever had I find some scam.

40
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,370
Right.

41
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,090
So I,

42
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,510
I a scam my way out of junior year and
I said I'm going to go to Alaska because

43
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,250
I want to see the frontier.

44
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,670
So I hitchhiked from New York to Alaska.

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,580
Had all these freaky
adventures as you can imagine.

46
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,390
Right.

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,560
Went to prison,

48
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,440
got shot at all this crazy shit happen.

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,470
And I met people along
the way who picked me up,

50
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
especially like in the Yukon and
in Alaska who were so fucking kind.

51
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,190
Yeah.

52
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,310
So competent and they take me home.

53
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,590
I,

54
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:44,851
you know,

55
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,960
they feed me,

56
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,130
introduced me the wife,

57
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,871
the kids that,

58
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:48,360
you know,

59
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,950
or women who'd stopped and picked me up.

60
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,970
Just trusting like,

61
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:51,211
Hey,

62
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,571
whatever,

63
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,180
you know,

64
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,940
really self sufficient people.

65
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,740
They built their own houses,

66
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,810
they had healthy relationships.

67
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,310
They knew how to fix their own cars.

68
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,790
They were really self sufficient.

69
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,880
None of them knew anything about the
fancy schmancy literature and philosophy

70
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:06,770
that I was studying.

71
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,080
Right?

72
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Like I,

73
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,800
I had,

74
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,070
you know,

75
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,970
the collected poems of Dh Lawrence and
my backpack and they'd never heard any of

76
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:12,331
this shit.

77
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,164
Right.

78
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
But when I compared them to my professor
friends back at school and I was like,

79
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,620
wait a minute,

80
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,450
these people don't know any of this,

81
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,250
you know,

82
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,450
the elites knowledge.

83
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,800
But they're really happy people and
they're healthy people and they have good

84
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,920
families and they're decent and they're
kind and they're generous to me.

85
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,600
And then I imagine one of them,

86
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,370
you know,

87
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,640
stumbles into Princeton,

88
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,271
New Jersey,

89
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,810
or you're aware I was going to school
in upstate New York and my professor

90
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,644
friends,

91
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:40,950
you know,

92
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,783
come upon them,

93
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,560
they'd,

94
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,410
they'd laugh at them,

95
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,430
they wouldn't help them,

96
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,510
they wouldn't be kind to them.

97
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,840
They went and my professor friends like
had to call the fucking electrician to

98
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:49,740
change a light bulb.

99
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,310
Right?

100
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,821
So it's like,

101
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,091
well,

102
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:51,860
why wait a minute,

103
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,320
what do,

104
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,970
what do I want to do in this life?

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,900
Where am I going?

106
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,370
So that's when I just said,

107
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,790
all right,

108
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,121
fuck it,

109
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:57,954
no Grad school.

110
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,740
And I wrote the guy like,

111
00:02:59,741 --> 00:02:59,921
just,

112
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,400
sorry,

113
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,140
not going to print,

114
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,680
stir a Oxford.

115
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:02,910
Not,

116
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,380
not going to do any of this till I'm 30,

117
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm not going to make a
commitment to anything.

118
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,171
No job,

119
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:08,831
no woman,

120
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,940
no Grad School,

121
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,601
no med school,

122
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:10,931
nothing.

123
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm just going to float around
the world and have adventure.

124
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,061
Wow,

125
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,710
that's fucking cool story.

126
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,270
I love that idea.

127
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,110
That's a,

128
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,220
that's really cool.

129
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,181
I found that,

130
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:20,301
uh,

131
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:24,220
I didn't go to the Yukon but I went
to anchorage recently with already.

132
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,451
Right.

133
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:25,340
And you guys went fishing?

134
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,300
We went fishing.

135
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,280
You the Kenai peninsula

136
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,890
south of Anchorage.

137
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,050
I'm quite honestly,

138
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:33,740
I don't remember.

139
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,490
I don't remember what river on remember.

140
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,070
Yeah,

141
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,903
we had a great time.

142
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,510
Yeah.

143
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:37,880
Uh,

144
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,150
we caught some salmon and
we did a show up there,

145
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,740
but I,

146
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,740
I felt that way as well about the people
that self sufficiency to a lot of the

147
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,010
folks that live up there that eat meat.

148
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,090
Even in Anchorage,

149
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:50,924
which is a city,

150
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,190
you know,

151
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,891
it's a real city.

152
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:54,860
They have hotels and gas
stations and the whole deal.

153
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,270
Movie Theater went to the movies there.

154
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,290
It was 10:00 at night.

155
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,124
It was bright out.

156
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,490
Yes.

157
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,310
Very weird bars with no windows.

158
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,731
Yeah.

159
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,100
You can't get every windows because
people were in there drinking.

160
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,540
You don't want to say the
fucking sun coming here.

161
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,390
I let you know what a
loser you are actually A.

162
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,681
Yeah.

163
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,060
And people will make better decisions
if there was a light on them.

164
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:11,780
We don't want that.

165
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,960
So do they still have a handgun permits
where you have to leave your gun at the

166
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,190
door when you go into the bar?

167
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,020
Someplaces gun check?

168
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah,

169
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,650
you have to check your guns and you
come in because everybody's got guns.

170
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,410
Get Shit faced.

171
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,810
Then you pick up your gun on your way out.

172
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,141
Yeah,

173
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,280
that's the best time to get it.

174
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,720
After you've got an apar architects
that you find people there,

175
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:33,750
they were very kind and very cool and
very competent as you were saying,

176
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:34,610
and they're just.

177
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,900
There are people that are also dealing
with nature in a way different level

178
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,010
they're dealing with whether it's real,

179
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,380
whether.

180
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,213
Yeah,

181
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,420
and we don't have to do that.

182
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,750
We,

183
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,890
especially in California,

184
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:50,891
which is the most ridiculous and retarded
state in the country as far as the way

185
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,370
people behave on the norm,

186
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,271
and don't get me wrong,

187
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,820
I love it here and there's a lot
of cool people here and you know,

188
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,290
all my best friends are here,

189
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,310
but the reality of California is that we
don't have to deal with weather at all.

190
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,140
The worst thing we have
to do is press a button.

191
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,591
Oh my God,

192
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,220
it's hot.

193
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,971
You press a button.

194
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,804
It's not hot anymore.

195
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,411
I mean,

196
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,280
it's really.

197
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,250
As long as the power stays on really
not that fucking hard to deal,

198
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,810
but if you're living in Alaska,

199
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,910
you have to take precautions every year.

200
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,070
You have to keep a candle
in the back of your car.

201
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,120
You have to keep matches.

202
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,780
You have to keep blankets with you at
all times because your car could break

203
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:21,050
down.

204
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,950
You could be at the side of the road,

205
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,900
no one could be on the
road and that candle,

206
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:25,100
it might keep you alive.

207
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,490
You have the light that candle in your
car with all the doors shut and that's

208
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,770
the only way you're going to stay warm,

209
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,613
stay alive.

210
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,450
Like there's A.

211
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,140
There's a lot of that kind
of thinking going on there.

212
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,790
And then when someone sees you
pulled over to the side of the road,

213
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,201
they're not like,

214
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,351
oh,

215
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,430
who's this creepy fuck,

216
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,000
you know,

217
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
in Sherman oaks that pulled over to the
side of the road with his hazards on,

218
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,480
I'm not stopping to this guy,

219
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,890
right?

220
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,221
They're like,

221
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:43,401
Oh,

222
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,780
who is this person,

223
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
this kindred soul out here in the middle
of the woods that got fucked and this

224
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,014
could be me.

225
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,263
Come on in.

226
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,870
Do you guys have cell phone service?

227
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:53,991
No.

228
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,100
If we drive five more miles,

229
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,000
we get cell phone service.

230
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:56,571
Hop in the car.

231
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll take you where we can call somebody.

232
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:58,940
Yeah,

233
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,950
there's not that,

234
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,740
but you're right.

235
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,420
Your professor friends,

236
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,930
to not pick them up would
be right where they live.

237
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,250
That's the crazy thing about it.

238
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:11,120
It's like you're right that the professor
was probably wouldn't pick up someone

239
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,440
who has broken down the side of the road,

240
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,500
but they're right too and not doing that.

241
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,830
If you live in a city because you never
know what the fuck you're going to get.

242
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,650
Exactly.

243
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,130
Yeah.

244
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,431
Yeah.

245
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:20,851
You got it.

246
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:24,480
You got to participate in the world
you're born into whether you agree with it

247
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,020
or not.

248
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,620
How's that smell?

249
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,453
Is that okay?

250
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,211
I don't even smell it.

251
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:27,630
Yeah,

252
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,490
let's go in that way.

253
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,191
Damn.

254
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,024
What's wrong with you?

255
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,640
Because someone,

256
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,000
you know,

257
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,380
son,

258
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,870
you should smell the fuck out of that.

259
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,563
It's nice.

260
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,311
I don't lie to me,

261
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:35,521
man.

262
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,354
I'll put it right out.

263
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,320
Hardly noticed that.

264
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,631
I tell you.

265
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:37,900
I mean,

266
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,300
I know it must be the coke.

267
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,440
How dare you.

268
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,840
Okay.

269
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,830
That's a bad drug.

270
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,430
That's a drug I had access.

271
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,210
I mean I,

272
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,500
you're,

273
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,250
you're in this position all the time,

274
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:50,611
I'm sure,

275
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,150
but you know,

276
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,180
having access to the best
of the best of something.

277
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,130
I knew a guy in college who was the
son of an oil minister from a country I

278
00:06:59,131 --> 00:06:59,671
won't name,

279
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,050
just to keep me out of trouble.

280
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,910
He had a private jet.

281
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,040
He used to fly to Columbia.

282
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,250
He had a diplomatic bag so he could
bring anything into the country.

283
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,020
He'd bring the shit into the country
and he was like in this frat and I knew

284
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:16,110
someone who was in the Frat and
I was never a frat boy at all,

285
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,910
but they would invite me and like these,

286
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,980
like yellow rocks of cocaine.

287
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,330
And it was the.

288
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,220
I mean I went to this dumb ass
college where everybody was rich.

289
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:31,221
So the drug scene there was off the charts
and I've done the best coke there is,

290
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:32,461
right?

291
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:36,630
I mean I know the guy
who invented Mtma I got,

292
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,650
I had these really good connections for
drugs and coke sucks the best in the

293
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:45,654
world.

294
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,840
Don't get it.

295
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,763
Wow.

296
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,251
I mean,

297
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:50,560
my,

298
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,850
in my sense is that it,

299
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,070
it affects a certain personality structure
in a really pleasant way and I don't

300
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,490
have that structure.

301
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,151
So for me,

302
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,950
hallucinogens are like boom,

303
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:03,280
that's pushing my button,

304
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:04,114
right?

305
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,540
Coke,

306
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,590
it just made me fucking
nervous and drink too much.

307
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,380
You're a self deprecating guy and you
joke around about a lot and you also

308
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:16,510
introspective and I think that one of
the things that people don't like about

309
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,360
people that are cooked up is that
they want to talk about themselves.

310
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,760
They want to tell you how
fucking bad ass they are.

311
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,050
They want to brag,

312
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,470
they want,

313
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,690
they want to talk about like making money.

314
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,190
We're going to buy this forest,

315
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,024
we're going to fucking,

316
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,081
you know what I mean?

317
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,870
Like Mike Young used to
always talk about how uh,

318
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,690
people on Coke always want
to start a business with you.

319
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,480
And it's really kind of true.

320
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,530
It's like they always have these.

321
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,760
Yeah,

322
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,640
they have these crazy
grand plans and it just,

323
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,480
I,

324
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
I've never been interested in it.

325
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,250
I got lucky and I ducked
it when I was a kid.

326
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,480
I've told the story a hundred times,

327
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,470
but I had a friend,

328
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,090
my friend that I'm still
friends with in high school,

329
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,460
his cousin used to sell it in his life,

330
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,710
went down the toilet and
I watched him wither away,

331
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,440
lost a shitload of
weight and became weird,

332
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:01,870
you know,

333
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,380
just always on coke and when they weren't,

334
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,081
wasn't on coke,

335
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,070
he was just exhausted,

336
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,760
you know,

337
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,090
it's just like Jesus that looks like a,

338
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,990
like no one.

339
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,050
Someone who got bit by a vampire like,

340
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,860
oh my God,

341
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,270
like you got you get that bug.

342
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,950
They got you.

343
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah.

344
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,390
It's like you're taking all the energy
from of your life and concentrating it in

345
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,460
the few hours after you
do the coke and like,

346
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:19,611
well,

347
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:21,050
what are you going to
do with all that energy?

348
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:21,860
Except irritate

349
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,430
people.

350
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,410
But I knew a girl and
she was a great girl.

351
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
She wasn't a mean person.

352
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:26,690
She wasn't nasty,

353
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,351
materialistic.

354
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:27,981
She's beautiful.

355
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,720
She's really nice and sweet and kind.

356
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:30,181
But fuck.

357
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,030
She loved coke.

358
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,210
God Damn.

359
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,860
And she would feel bad about it.

360
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
She'd got fucking love it.

361
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:35,870
I love doing coke and they're like,

362
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,350
really?

363
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,760
Like what?

364
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:36,830
I,

365
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,140
you know,

366
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,290
I was not curious enough to want to do it,

367
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,220
but listening to her,

368
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:40,401
you know,

369
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:42,050
she knew it was bad news.

370
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:42,771
She shouldn't do it,

371
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:43,940
didn't want to do it anymore,

372
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,310
but she'd tell you,

373
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,173
God damn what I'm doing,

374
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,013
I love doing coke.

375
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,270
In my experience,

376
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,960
the people who tend to get really
hooked on coke are people who have,

377
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,153
um,

378
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,290
issues with,

379
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,720
uh,

380
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,390
they feel bad about themselves.

381
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,030
They feel they've got
a lack of self esteem.

382
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,131
They,

383
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,380
they feel like they,

384
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,430
they're not good enough.

385
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,121
They're not whatever.

386
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,210
There's shame and all that because
the coke takes that away for awhile.

387
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,990
That totally makes sense in
this case because this woman,

388
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,460
her mother was like really overbearing
and her mother was like Super Alpha

389
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,294
successful.

390
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,920
Her mother was a single mom and was like,

391
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,351
like,

392
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:23,940
no man is going to fucking run me
and show she was a lawyer and she ran

393
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:24,960
successful business.

394
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,570
She had a law firm and she was like super,

395
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,570
like intense with her
daughter about achievement,

396
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:31,710
about pursuing things,

397
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:32,110
about,

398
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,310
you know,

399
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,540
don't eat the wrong foods.

400
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:33,890
And you know,

401
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,550
he just,

402
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
it was like really like,

403
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,070
overbearing and gave her a
hard time about her weight.

404
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,281
Like,

405
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:39,001
you're too fat,

406
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:39,990
you're never going to be a model.

407
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:40,620
And like,

408
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,453
Uhm,

409
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,990
and so I guess the coke was like,

410
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,560
Oh,

411
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,393
free.

412
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,220
You don't have to think about it.

413
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,063
Give her.

414
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,160
Maybe she had a deficit
created by her mom's constant,

415
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,190
just never letting her just be herself.

416
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,930
Yeah.

417
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,380
You ever,

418
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,830
you know,

419
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,120
Gaba is.

420
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,960
No,

421
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,793
he's.

422
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,350
Yeah,

423
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,560
I,

424
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,393
it didn't know the name.

425
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,730
I've only seen it written.

426
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:01,830
He's,

427
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,690
he's a cool guy.

428
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,130
And if you ever want to
have him on the show,

429
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:04,671
let me know.

430
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:04,871
He's,

431
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:05,810
he's a friend of mine.

432
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,250
He's a very interesting guy.

433
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:11,150
He's a doctor who works with addicts
and he's been working with addicts in

434
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,960
Vancouver in the slum part
of Vancouver for a long time.

435
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:17,000
A lot of like real down and out people.

436
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,020
Um,

437
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,080
and he also is very interested in
alternative approaches to addiction.

438
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:27,081
And he's written about Iowasca as
a way of dealing with addiction,

439
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,210
treating addicts and all that.

440
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,591
But anyway,

441
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:30,861
he,

442
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,550
uh,

443
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,150
his theory is that all
addiction is due to trauma.

444
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,350
It's not,

445
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,720
it has nothing to do with the
substance or the activity,

446
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,560
it's,

447
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,210
that's just how it manifests,

448
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:41,840
right?

449
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,820
But it's all about psychological trauma.

450
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:47,840
It's all trying to alleviate
suffering of some point of some kind.

451
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,230
And um,

452
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,430
it,

453
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,091
it's interesting,

454
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:55,091
his research a sort of meshes well with
this experiment that was done also in

455
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:56,704
British Columbia.

456
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,031
I can't remember.

457
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:58,751
Marie Williamson,

458
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,340
I think was the scientist's name,

459
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,031
you know,

460
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,580
those famous studies where
they give rats like a,

461
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,160
they've got a water bottle,

462
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,850
it's just water and then another one
that's got coke in it and the rats will

463
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,600
just keep doing the coke and they'll
forget to eat and then they like die.

464
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,300
Like these people you're talking about
lost all this weight and just like

465
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,710
completely focused.

466
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
This guy looked at that.

467
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,350
He,

468
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,650
he was a professor scientist.

469
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,540
He looked at it and he's like,

470
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:22,931
okay,

471
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:23,770
well that,

472
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:28,771
that's the sort of main study that
everybody cites that shows that coke is

473
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:32,170
addictive and it's coke the causes of
the problem and it's the substance and

474
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,670
molecular problems.

475
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,200
But what if we took those
rats a same kind of rats,

476
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,620
but instead of just being in a
cage where there's nothing to do,

477
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,310
put them in a really interesting
environment where there are lots of other

478
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:45,821
options,

479
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,900
there are lots of other rats they're tubes
to go through and things to climb and

480
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,660
things to hide under
and lots of stimulation.

481
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,290
Right?

482
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,220
And then let's try it.

483
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,660
They try it.

484
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,420
What happens?

485
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,050
The rats through the coke once or
twice and then walk away from it.

486
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,943
Never go back.

487
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,143
Right.

488
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,680
So there's an argument to be made that
a strong argument that it's not about

489
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:06,520
substances.

490
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,450
It's like I was saying,

491
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,800
it's about the way this substance,

492
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,400
inner sex with whatever your
particular suffering is,

493
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:12,951
right?

494
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:16,070
So these rats in a cage are obviously
suffering because they're not in a natural

495
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,390
environment or in a fucking cage.

496
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:19,370
There's nothing to do
except like get high.

497
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:20,210
So they get high.

498
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,640
That's a very good point
that I never considered.

499
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,660
That is a very,

500
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,530
very good point.

501
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,880
It's called rat park.

502
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,170
If anyone wants to google it,

503
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,420
just google rat park.

504
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:28,571
[inaudible].

505
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,810
That's what he called this.

506
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,350
You know,

507
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,220
like sort of enclosure that he made
for the rat and a rat being stuck in a

508
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:39,221
fucking fluorescent lighting room and
fucking metal cage and the little water

509
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,600
bottle you gotta suck on big to the
fucking life they live is dog shit.

510
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,621
You're in a prison.

511
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:46,600
So you got,

512
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,691
you got to prison,

513
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,370
a guy in solitary confinement,

514
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,210
right?

515
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,010
And you're offering them to get high.

516
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:55,880
Of course it's going to get high and
you're being surrounded by giants

517
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,593
everywhere you go.

518
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,680
This is enormous creatures who can easily
reach in and just snuff your life out

519
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,600
of squeezing.

520
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,830
It's ridiculous.

521
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,720
And by nature you're terrified,

522
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:05,901
right?

523
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,040
Because you're a prey animal.

524
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:07,340
You're,

525
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,960
you know.

526
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,211
Yeah.

527
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,940
You shouldn't be running from everything
and all of a sudden you can't run.

528
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:11,740
You can't hide.

529
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,573
Right.

530
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,370
And they just reach in and grab you
and they fucking give you a coke.

531
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,853
Yeah.

532
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,420
Which makes even more pair.

533
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,250
Shitty life.

534
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,900
God Damn Pita might have a point.

535
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,671
Yeah.

536
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,600
I remember.

537
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,120
You know,

538
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,280
when the dusk,

539
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,100
when the mosquitoes come
out and you can see a swarm,

540
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,410
you're setting up your tent,

541
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,831
you know,

542
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:37,831
and like I remember setting up my tent
and like every second moving my shirt so

543
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,750
they couldn't like get
in through the shirt,

544
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:40,961
you know,

545
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,600
I had to keep moving the shirt while I'm
setting up the tent and then you get in

546
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,940
there and you can hear it.

547
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:47,560
It's like hail banging against
the side of the tenant.

548
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,510
You can hear them banging on the tent.

549
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,441
Oh my God.

550
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:50,690
Yeah,

551
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,523
they're,

552
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,780
they're little helicopters.

553
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
The fuck did people do before
they figured out tense?

554
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,570
Uh,

555
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,470
well the Eskimos,

556
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:01,460
I believe they smeared fat
on their skin that would,

557
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,060
certain kinds of fat would keep the
mosquitoes off of them and they've got all

558
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,000
sorts of really clever adaptations,

559
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:08,834
you know,

560
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,291
you know,

561
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:09,600
we,

562
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
we sort of assume that
we would be helpless,

563
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,500
but that's because we didn't grow
up there and our culture didn't,

564
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,334
you know.

565
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,190
So there's,

566
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,460
you know,

567
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,960
Wade Davis is a,

568
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,520
he's a,

569
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,020
he's an anthropologist,

570
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,010
he's written a bunch of books,

571
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,000
really interesting guy.

572
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,271
He's,

573
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:23,870
um,

574
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,250
like anthropologists in residence
at the Smithsonian in Washington.

575
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,760
He wrote a book called the wayfarers
I think was his last book about

576
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,623
traditional,

577
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,021
like,

578
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,900
about how these guys could
navigate across the Pacific,

579
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,440
just looking at the stars and the color
of the water and smelling and whatever

580
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,293
they'd.

581
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,961
Anyway,

582
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:42,291
he,

583
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:42,590
uh,

584
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,780
one of the stories he tells us about this,

585
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,560
uh,

586
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,520
Eskimo guy,

587
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,760
old guy and the family sort of took
the keys to the car away from him.

588
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,360
Like you can't go anymore.

589
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:58,220
They were afraid he would go out and die
the traditional way when Eskimo people

590
00:15:58,221 --> 00:15:58,880
got old,

591
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,310
they would just like wander
off into the ice and die.

592
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,560
So as not to be a burden to the family.

593
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,370
Right.

594
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,710
And he was a traditional guy and they
were worried that he would take the,

595
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,930
the snow machine out and just die out
there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or

596
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:12,764
whatever.

597
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,130
So they had this whole intervention.

598
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,950
And so that night he goes out,

599
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,480
gets out of the house,

600
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,000
takes a shit in his hand,

601
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,880
forms the shit into a knife,

602
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,714
blade,

603
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,220
spits on it,

604
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,400
and the spit a is freezing along
the edge and he hones that down.

605
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,560
So he gets a nice sharp
edge with his sped,

606
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,960
takes his shit knife,

607
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,320
kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes
their ribs and makes us a sled out of

608
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:47,120
it.

609
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
And with the sinews and whatever
other pieces of the dogs,

610
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:50,391
you know,

611
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:52,250
he knew all this stuff from his childhood,

612
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,150
hooks up a couple of other dogs to
the sled and he takes off into the,

613
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,410
into the snow,

614
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,040
on his sled with his shit knife.

615
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh my God.

616
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,010
That might be the most
insane story I've ever heard.

617
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:07,970
And they're so clever.

618
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,470
You know how they killed polar bears.

619
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,440
I know they take blood
and put it on a blade.

620
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,630
I know that method that
was actually wolves.

621
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,150
The wolves would lick the blade and uh,

622
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,461
we would,

623
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:19,880
uh,

624
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,230
they would cut themselves to death,

625
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,550
similar kind of thing.

626
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,350
What they would do is they take a little,

627
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,160
they'd make a wooden box
and they would take a seal,

628
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,280
a rib and sharpen the two ends of the
seal rib and they're pretty flexible.

629
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,310
They bend it and stick it into the box,

630
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:34,880
right?

631
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,830
And then they'd pour melted fat into the
box and let it solidify freeze and then

632
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,731
knock it out.

633
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:45,731
So you've got a fat cube with this
flexed to bladed thing inside it and they

634
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,380
leave that in the snow.

635
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,380
Polar bear come along,

636
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,050
swallow it,

637
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,730
and opens in the polar bear and they
just follow the blood drops and it would

638
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:54,390
kill them.

639
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,223
Yeah.

640
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,400
Internal hemorrhaging.

641
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,110
What would it take to kill him?

642
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,600
I don't know.

643
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,433
I don't know.

644
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,870
I just remember that.

645
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:01,561
I mean,

646
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,940
there are stories like
that all over the world.

647
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:03,121
You know,

648
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,380
the Indian monkey trap,

649
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,400
the East Indian monkey.

650
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,130
I don't know how interested
your readers or your listeners.

651
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,500
Well,

652
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,430
that system is,

653
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,900
and this is a good metaphor to.

654
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:13,860
I always remember this one.

655
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,420
They would take,

656
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,020
um,

657
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,531
same thing,

658
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:21,531
take a box with a hole about a little
smaller than a fist in the mail.

659
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,170
In the box,

660
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,250
and then they put a mango in the box
and then hammer it shot and tight to a

661
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,084
tree.

662
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,560
So the mango starts rotting,

663
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,550
the monkey smells it.

664
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,400
Monkey comes along,

665
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,360
can stick his hand in and feel the mango,

666
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,010
but he can't get his hand out as long
as he's holding onto the mango and they

667
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,300
won't let go of the mango.

668
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,940
All they have to do is let
go and they could leave,

669
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:47,940
but they've got the mango in
their hands and they won't let go.

670
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,340
And so the guy comes
around to check the traps.

671
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,590
There's the monkey standing
there with his hand in the box.

672
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,251
Hit It on the head.

673
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,084
You've got your monkey.

674
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,063
Whoa.

675
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,000
Sort of something about greed there.

676
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,110
That's an awesome story.

677
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,070
That is a perfect metaphor to him.

678
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,570
Yeah.

679
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,530
That's amazing.

680
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,491
Wow.

681
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,510
Let go of the mango.

682
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,500
That's my advice.

683
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,970
That's funny.

684
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,721
All Right Gentlemen,

685
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:09,231
I think we're,

686
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:09,500
uh,

687
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,390
we're at three hours,

688
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,553
three hours.

689
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,840
These things fucking fly.

690
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,100
They fly by.

691
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,870
They'd been amongst the most
popular podcast that I do.

692
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,450
And I know you guys are
saying the same thing.

693
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:20,830
Well,

694
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,260
he's pretty good at the one
we did together last time.

695
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,370
I guess mine was the third,

696
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:25,910
right.

697
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,540
Um,

698
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,980
has twice as many downloads as any
other that have been up forever.

699
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,460
And the second is you,

700
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,294
you and me

701
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,290
the same thing with us.

702
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,981
I mean these,

703
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:40,190
these podcasts that we have are amongst
the highest downloaded ones that we

704
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:40,580
have,

705
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,413
you know,

706
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,380
just take effect.

707
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,990
The one we did for sure is
the most direct downloads.

708
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,280
They're really fun,

709
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,203
you know,

710
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:47,960
fun.

711
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,793
They're bizarre.

712
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,630
It's very bizarre.

713
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,890
A combination.

714
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,120
I don't know if you guys saw,

715
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:55,100
I created a page that archives them.

716
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,581
Okay,

717
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:56,414
cool.

718
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,730
I'm happy to transfer it
wherever we decided to do it,

719
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,650
but for the moment it's on Chris Ryan,

720
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:01,790
Ph d dot Com.

721
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:06,490
And you'll see tripod cast tab and
that's where the first three are archive.

722
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
It's just a link that leads
back to your site and your site.

723
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,260
We were talking before the podcast
started about trying to figure out a name,

724
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:14,030
but we're not even close
old men in the snow.

725
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:17,090
That was pretty bad ass because
of your description of what it is.

726
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,570
Right?

727
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,360
But with people,

728
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,400
it's funny,

729
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,600
without knowing the story.

730
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:20,830
No,

731
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,950
you have to tell the story though,

732
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,470
just tell people to start because I
don't think he did while the podcast was

733
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:24,861
going on.

734
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:25,710
It was before the POC.

735
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,290
We were talking about,

736
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,920
uh,

737
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,970
techniques that,

738
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:29,211
uh,

739
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:33,590
that adolescent boys develop the
good ones anyway for not coming.

740
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,143
And uh,

741
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,260
and like some people like think
of baseball stats or whatever.

742
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:43,190
Just something like nonsexual to get
your head away from what you're doing,

743
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,320
which in itself is kind
of a weird thing to be,

744
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:45,561
you know,

745
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:48,580
you're having the best experience of
life and you're trying not to notice.

746
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,760
Nature wants you to come instantly
and just shoot a load into a chicken,

747
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,211
make a kid,

748
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,200
and you want to have a good time,

749
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,313
a strategy,

750
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,210
very zen.

751
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,481
Well,

752
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,830
it goes back to sex at dawn.

753
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,161
It's,

754
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:57,580
you know,

755
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,750
a sperm competition.

756
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,090
Yes.

757
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,150
Nature has designed
you to shoot your load,

758
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:01,741
get out of the way.

759
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:02,850
So the next guy can.

760
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,520
Exactly.

761
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,540
And that's why by the way,

762
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,120
were turned on by seeing gang
bangs and dude's fucking a b.

763
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:08,810
You are.

764
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,643
Yeah.

765
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,051
Anyway,

766
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:15,310
so my technique was to think about
old people trudging through the snow,

767
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,480
like World War II,

768
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,270
you know,

769
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,030
Crimean refugees,

770
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,420
trudging through the
Russian winter freeze.

771
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,120
Any of that.

772
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,480
Yeah,

773
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,540
I like that about Bush.

774
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,761
Yeah,

775
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,630
exactly.

776
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,100
That makes me not want to
come and go with that guys.

777
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
Sorry guys.

778
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,980
I can't come now.

779
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,441
Yeah,

780
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:31,400
that guy's asshole.

781
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,273
Imagine,

782
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,560
would you live the rest of your life if
that guy's an asshole was permanently an

783
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,430
inch from your face?

784
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,060
Oh,

785
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,780
it isn't guy.

786
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,021
Yeah.

787
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,530
What would you do for
the rest of your life?

788
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:39,611
Well,

789
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,121
you can live.

790
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,350
You can do everything you want and go

791
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,053
fucking

792
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,190
asshole block.

793
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,880
You're always be like no
right here to the right.

794
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,691
You can move it around,

795
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,750
but it always has to stay like sorta
like the moon is in your orbit.

796
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,860
That guy's an asshole.

797
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:54,694
His raw.

798
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,303
You know what?

799
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
After a week or two,

800
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,980
you wouldn't even notice it and
say that I would kill myself.

801
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,843
I would kill myself.

802
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,200
Push that guy with me.

803
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,093
I would just.

804
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,690
I didn't show him my life.

805
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Fart in your face.

806
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,163
Perfect.

807
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,670
Everlands in the wrong place.

808
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,720
That's what the Buddhists say.

809
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,620
Hot Air conditioner.

810
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,020
Yeah.

811
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,853
Okay.

812
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,860
Both you guys.

813
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,500
It'll ruin it.

814
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,621
Yeah.

815
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,300
I can't go to prison for saying this.

816
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:16,491
Right.

817
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:17,350
You're talking about this.

818
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:18,310
This is a serious thing,

819
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,410
but you know what non-americans,

820
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,110
if you admit that you have
ever used illegal drugs,

821
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,460
they can stamp your passport.

822
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:25,630
You're never allowed in the country.

823
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,050
I have two friends that happened to.

824
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,130
So if you're in another country and
you start talking about using drugs,

825
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,420
like on another podcast,

826
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,433
they can.

827
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,950
I don't know about podcasts,

828
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,130
but what happened with his friends,

829
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:36,640
she was coming back from Amsterdam.

830
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:41,641
She was a judge in the cannabis cup
competition and she lives in Vancouver and

831
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:42,550
the plane,

832
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,200
she changed planes in Seattle
and they took her and said,

833
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,550
so where are you doing in Amsterdam?

834
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:49,840
And she told them and they said,

835
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,010
so have you smoked marijuana?

836
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,431
She said,

837
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:51,851
yeah,

838
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,020
and they stamped her password.

839
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:57,490
She has never landed in the US again
because she smoked marijuana in Amsterdam.

840
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,980
Wow.

841
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,340
Guy knows a psychiatrist,

842
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:06,140
a Canadian psychiatrist who had worked
with LSD psychotherapy and they stopped

843
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:07,850
him at the drive through border.

844
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:08,211
You know,

845
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:10,910
at Vancouver and interviewed them,

846
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,270
they wikipedia'd him and they're like,

847
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:14,601
oh,

848
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,580
you did a research with LSD.

849
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:17,950
Have you ever used Lsd?

850
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,321
And he said,

851
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:18,830
yeah,

852
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,663
stamp.

853
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,450
Wow.

854
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,650
He's never allowed in the country.

855
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,880
That's crazy.

856
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,321
That's all.

857
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,110
Is that only America as far as I know,

858
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,250
Canada's rough.

859
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,020
If you get them drunk driving in America,

860
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,190
good luck in Canada.

861
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,700
Oh really?

862
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,390
Oh yeah.

863
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,571
Yeah.

864
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:32,871
A lot of,

865
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:33,200
um,

866
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,810
a lot of fighters have issues
getting into Canada for fights.

867
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:37,130
A lot of comedians have issues.

868
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,670
A lot of comedians have had issues
getting into the Montreal comedy festival,

869
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,610
which was one of the big events for
standup comedian because of drunk driving.

870
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:44,030
Yes.

871
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,510
Because a drunk driving or any domestic
violence or anything like that.

872
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,730
Eddie Bravo had an arrest for
having a gun on him legally.

873
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,300
Okay.

874
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,710
He was working for a check cashing place
and he used to have to carry large sums

875
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:02,030
of cash in his car to another location
and so he would leave with the check

876
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:06,200
cashing company and he had a registered
concealed carry permit for a gun.

877
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,000
And so he got pulled over for
something and he had to tell the,

878
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:11,181
uh,

879
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,140
the cop officer,

880
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:12,531
uh,

881
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,120
I worked for check cashing company.

882
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,060
I have a legal registered
handgun in my car right now.

883
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,133
It's loaded.

884
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,220
And then they go,

885
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:19,671
okay,

886
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,331
hold on a second,

887
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,310
we're going to put you in handcuffs.

888
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm going to run this.

889
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,381
So they,

890
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,110
they run it,

891
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,391
they go,

892
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:23,750
okay.

893
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,350
Checks out.

894
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,010
They let them go because it was not even
supposed to be on his record because it

895
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:28,844
was all legal.

896
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,840
Doesn't matter.

897
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,280
Every time he goes to Canada,

898
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,330
they sit him down.

899
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,280
That was about this.

900
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,870
You have a gone on side.

901
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:38,630
You right now you take a gun,

902
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,250
you should go for the border.

903
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,670
No,

904
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:40,831
no,

905
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:40,991
no,

906
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:41,121
no,

907
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:41,261
no,

908
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:41,400
no,

909
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,521
no,

910
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:41,631
no,

911
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:42,010
no.

912
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,421
I was,

913
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:44,900
I was working for a company I
was allowed to have like it.

914
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,410
Cut.

915
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,860
He's got an extra hour every
time he goes into Canada.

916
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,560
That happened to me quickly in
immigration going into Canada.

917
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,310
What'd you get a,

918
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,180
what was your issue?

919
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,421
Well,

920
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,750
they asked me if I'd ever been
convicted of a crime and I said no.

921
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,640
And I go sit down and then they
call me over and they said,

922
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:01,970
uh,

923
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,731
the guys like,

924
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:03,200
um,

925
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
you said you'd never been
convicted of a crime,

926
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:05,241
correct?

927
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:05,511
I said,

928
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:06,110
yeah.

929
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,740
He said,

930
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,760
is there anything you'd like to
say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983?

931
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,833
I was like,

932
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,060
uh,

933
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,421
yeah,

934
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:16,330
I got busted in Fairbank's,

935
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,811
you know,

936
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:16,910
uh,

937
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,210
for eating a snickers bar and the fucking
grocery store and not paying for it.

938
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,230
And,

939
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,700
but I did three days.

940
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:23,900
It was Memorial Day weekend.

941
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:24,560
I did three,

942
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,030
four nights in the prison,

943
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,070
and then the guy said,

944
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:28,350
you know,

945
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,640
20 hours of community service and
this will disappear from your record.

946
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:31,940
And again,

947
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,290
if you don't get arrested in a year.

948
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,930
So I always say no because that's,

949
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:36,081
yeah,

950
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:40,880
I wasn't convicted of anything and they
said it would be taken from my record.

951
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,421
And the guy's like,

952
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:41,990
nope.

953
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,160
The fact that you were not Alaskan so
you're from out of state meant they

954
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,360
couldn't strike it from your
record and it's on your FBI record,

955
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,800
which is what we get in Canada.

956
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,390
So he was knicker thief.

957
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,751
Yeah.

958
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,610
I'm a sneaker thief,

959
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,460
so he's a cool guy.

960
00:25:55,461 --> 00:26:00,410
I did four days in effect in a federal
medium security prison with no underwear

961
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,230
for a snickers for sneakers.

962
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,200
What do you mean with no underwear?

963
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,700
Were you wearing anything or just naked?

964
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,850
I was wearing why have
pants at the grocery store?

965
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,470
Because it makes it more harrowing.

966
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,333
Come on man.

967
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,740
I was.

968
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,500
I was 19 years old.

969
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,320
That.

970
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,790
Yeah.

971
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,870
Will you liked very twink?

972
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:18,350
Ish.

973
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,160
I was twinkie.

974
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,380
I was very twinkie.

975
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,430
So you were worried it
was all going to go down.

976
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,350
I would have been worried
if I were wearing,

977
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,200
you know what anything

978
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,090
is that even.

979
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,030
Isn't that under the amount of money
that they could even bust you for

980
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:32,240
something?

981
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
Maybe not in the eighties.

982
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,310
Reagan was president.

983
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,020
They were trying to
fucking be tough on crime.

984
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,003
Just say no.

985
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:37,531
Yeah,

986
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:38,400
and also I had a,

987
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,960
I mean what happened was we got in
from this 10 day hitch with these two,

988
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,700
I'd met on the ferry coming up the
inside passage and we had this long hitch

989
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,200
through the Yukon territory,

990
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,870
all this crazy shit in the.

991
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,450
And we get to fairbanks,

992
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,360
so the first place we
go to the laundromat,

993
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,160
because we stank,

994
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:56,791
right?

995
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,410
We didn't have that special soap,

996
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,120
your defense defense.

997
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:00,954
So,

998
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,521
and uh,

999
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:02,550
so we went to the laundry mat.

1000
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,890
We put everything possible in the Washer,

1001
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,500
so all three of us were wearing
shorts with no underwear,

1002
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,720
boots with no socks and
a jacket with no shirt.

1003
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,700
And then one of the guys was like,

1004
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:11,940
oh,

1005
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,310
he wanted to go to the grocery
store because there was a pe fund.

1006
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,490
He was going to call his girlfriend to
let her know that he'd arrived on time.

1007
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,610
And I was like,

1008
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:18,790
Hey,

1009
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,480
I'll go over with you and the other
guy's going to stay with the bags or

1010
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,650
backpacks and all that shit.

1011
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:23,340
And you know,

1012
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,300
watch the clothes.

1013
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,700
So I went with him.

1014
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,210
Somebody who's on the phone,

1015
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,770
we start pushing a cart around.

1016
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,750
We were like Soviet immigrants,

1017
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:30,901
like,

1018
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,141
oh,

1019
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:35,520
so many kinds of food here because we'd
been living in the woods eating nuts and

1020
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,500
chocolate and lsd for the last 10 days.

1021
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,640
And so he,

1022
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,900
he opened a,

1023
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,240
a thing of Keifer.

1024
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,790
First time I'd ever heard of Keifer,

1025
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,060
which is like liquid yogurt.

1026
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:45,450
Yeah.

1027
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,860
And drank that great for your
body Acidophilus and I uh,

1028
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:51,220
I for some reason eight,

1029
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,460
a snickers bar even though
I'd been eating chocolate,

1030
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,120
not much.

1031
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,230
Imagination there.

1032
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,820
And then we,

1033
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,810
he used the phone,

1034
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:01,650
we ditched the cart and we left and so
there's some security guy had seen us and

1035
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
turned into a thing.

1036
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,910
This cop showed up and I had a knife
in my boot and some grass in my pocket,

1037
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,400
both of which were illegal
at the time in Alaska,

1038
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,650
but it was enough to make
this cup not like me at all.

1039
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,090
And he was like this,

1040
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:18,690
you know,

1041
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,690
he napoleonic cop kind of situation and
he didn't like smart ass college kids

1042
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:26,430
from outside coming into
Alaska in the summer.

1043
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:29,490
And you want a snickers bar fucking
around fucking around with Kiefer.

1044
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,570
So he took us,

1045
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,270
he handcuffed us and took us to prison.

1046
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:34,740
Fairbank's correctional center.

1047
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,450
Did you not have the money
for the snickers bar?

1048
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,660
Yeah,

1049
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,530
we had plenty of money.

1050
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,550
He just didn't want to pay for it,

1051
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,091
but it was like,

1052
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:39,331
well,

1053
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,650
you tell it to the magistrate.

1054
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,551
Oh,

1055
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,271
you mean for that.

1056
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,350
Now that was just like,

1057
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:45,690
I don't know what the fuck you're
just young and we're just filling.

1058
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,011
Um,

1059
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:46,230
and,

1060
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,651
you know,

1061
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:48,930
and maybe there was a line or
something I don't remember,

1062
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:53,931
but we pretended we were shopping so we
put like dog food and Shit in the cart,

1063
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,810
you know,

1064
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,040
and we ate our stuff and put the,

1065
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,390
the package,

1066
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:59,220
like we were going to pay
for it when we checked out.

1067
00:28:59,410 --> 00:28:59,680
Right,

1068
00:28:59,680 --> 00:28:59,861
right,

1069
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:00,330
right.

1070
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,130
So I don't know what we
were just being dumb.

1071
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,930
But uh,

1072
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,251
yeah.

1073
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:09,251
So we ended up being taken to
this prison and I had a pipe to.

1074
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:09,511
Yeah,

1075
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:10,860
because I remember when we were,

1076
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,030
did the intake,

1077
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,210
the guy that liked the prison
dude who booked us and you know,

1078
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,350
do the whole intake thing.

1079
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,720
I was joking with him,

1080
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:19,081
I was like,

1081
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:19,231
yeah,

1082
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm not going to get
that pipe and grasp back,

1083
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:21,691
am I?

1084
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,231
And he was like,

1085
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:23,310
I don't think so man.

1086
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:23,581
I was like,

1087
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:27,060
well know it wouldn't bother me if it
just disappeared and was never even

1088
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,100
registered because grass
is hard to come by.

1089
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,800
And Alaska wasn't then and so we sort
of had a little understanding like,

1090
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,261
I'm cool,

1091
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:34,620
you're cool.

1092
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,453
Because he was like,

1093
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,271
what the fuck?

1094
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,170
You have snickers bar,

1095
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,004
why would this guy,

1096
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,360
what's wrong with that cop?

1097
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,700
Did you like hit him or something?

1098
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:40,960
You like?

1099
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,410
No,

1100
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,711
you know,

1101
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,390
he just had a hair up his ass.

1102
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:43,900
Right?

1103
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,370
So this guy was cool.

1104
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,320
He saved us because
what he did is he said,

1105
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:47,740
look,

1106
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,650
I'm not going to put you guys
in with the general population.

1107
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,840
You're going to sleep in the gym at night.

1108
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,190
I've got some cots.

1109
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,540
You Sleep in the gym,

1110
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,310
you never let the other one out of
your sight the whole time you're here,

1111
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,720
you go to the bathroom together,

1112
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,160
you go to the showers together,

1113
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,650
you watch each other's back
and you'll get through it.

1114
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:06,484
All right?

1115
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,860
And we did anyway,

1116
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,350
it was wild and this was like 83 I guess.

1117
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,700
And um,

1118
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,150
so the,

1119
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,740
there's a lot of money in Alaska,

1120
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,060
right from all the oil.

1121
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,100
So the prison was plush.

1122
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,530
It was like every meal
was all you can eat,

1123
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,150
salad bar,

1124
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,290
whole wheat rolls,

1125
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,220
white rolls.

1126
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,450
Wednesday was prime rib day where the
cops could pay a buck to eat with the

1127
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,293
prisoners.

1128
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,730
But the catch was you only
have 20 minutes each meal.

1129
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,710
So I'm married like one day we're sitting
there at this table and we're in like

1130
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,261
19,

1131
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,094
maybe 20,

1132
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,941
maybe 20,

1133
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:43,300
something like that where we're sitting
at this table and the guy across the

1134
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,000
table looked like Charles Bronson,

1135
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:46,610
you remember him,

1136
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,340
the stash and the tats and all that.

1137
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,030
And we're just like this dude who is
shoveling it in and he looks up at one

1138
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:52,840
point he says,

1139
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,120
this is the best fucking
prison I've ever been in

1140
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,663
a

1141
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,810
yikes.

1142
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,840
You've got a laundry list
of prisons that don't,

1143
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,670
don't meet that criteria.

1144
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,240
Standard.

1145
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,391
Yeah,

1146
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:04,660
he,

1147
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,110
he,

1148
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,110
his story was he founded dude with his
wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and

1149
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,330
he didn't know if he was dead,

1150
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,220
but as soon as it happened,

1151
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,050
he got in his car.

1152
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,430
He was from New Mexico or Arizona.

1153
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,570
He got in his car and drove to Alaska
because he knew he'd get picked up and he

1154
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:25,330
wanted to get picked up in Alaska
because he'd heard the prisons were much

1155
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:25,640
better.

1156
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,830
That's hilarious.

1157
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,750
So he might've been the
guy to death and said,

1158
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:32,260
the way to deal with this is to go to a
place that has awesome prisons in that

1159
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,590
place.

1160
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,590
Just happens to be on the exact opposite
of the barns and a fucking forest shit.
