1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,550
And totally five,
four,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,530
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,010
one that Jeremy motherfucking and Steve.
What's up buddy?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,250
Good to see you,
man.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,731
Yeah,
you too,

6
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:12,660
man.
Thanks for having me back.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,100
My pleasure.
Brother was cracking skulls and skulls

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,690
or you're coming off of a fucking
gigantic victory man all over.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,540
Hanan Barao who was just a little while
ago,

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,940
consensus.
Top three pound for pound fighter in the

11
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:27,774
world.
Man.

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,620
That was a big victory.
Yeah.

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,880
Yeah.
I think there's a before a Usada,

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,050
you know?
Yeah.

15
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,840
I feel like it's on level playing fields
and you kind of wonder who would be

16
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,990
champions for people who don't know what
we're talking about.

17
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,991
You sought out the US antidoping agency
was hired by the UFC to clean up the

18
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,990
sport.
And God damn bodies are dropping massive

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,020
massive bodies dropping.
I watched the documentary on uh,

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,070
uh,
the cyclist,

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
lance,
Lance Armstrong,

22
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,640
and just watch how that guy just lied
and manipulated his way and you know,

23
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:03,210
people were just calling the smoke and
long time before that.

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,591
And then,
uh,

25
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,090
you know,
here comes a Wicki.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,680
It was a pretty scary dude if you ever
met him.

27
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,040
Night,
night and Nice is a very nice guy.

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,250
Awesome dude.
But you know,

29
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:14,250
he means business man.
He doesn't try to catch the cheaters

30
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,230
and,
and uh,

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,010
I'm,
I'm actually happy because I've always

32
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,310
taken pride in being a natural man and
if I feel like you need to start pumping

33
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,680
steroids,
maybe it's time for you to get out,

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,371
you know.
But,

35
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:23,961
uh,
I,

36
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,020
I love it.
Well,

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,050
Lance Armstrong's defense,
that entire sport was dirty.

38
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:33,051
That's a different sport because if you
like when it's really crazy because all

39
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,210
the years he won,
they like took his titles away,

40
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:36,890
right?
Yeah.

41
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,210
And while he still has,
he's been on the podcast,

42
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,320
I talked to him.
He's a good dude,

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,760
man.
He's in a bad.

44
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,020
He was in a bad spot.

45
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,580
If they took his title away and they
gave it to the next person that didn't

46
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,740
test positive,
it'd be 18th place.

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,960
That's how dirty that supportive.
Yeah,

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,250
that's crazy.
Dirty,

49
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,510
dirty,
dirty sport.

50
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,270
Yeah.
And I was asking him,

51
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:56,851
I was like,
well,

52
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,640
what,
you know,

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,520
he's,
he doesn't know what they're doing

54
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,420
today,
but I'm like,

55
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,340
well how are they doing it today if
they're still breaking records?

56
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,170
He's like,
we'll find out one day,

57
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,590
we'll find out eventually one day that
they're going to figure out what the

58
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,860
fuck these people are doing.
But Novitsky was explaining all the

59
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,550
weird little loopholes that people are
finding like testosterone

60
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,510
supplementation that comes from animals
instead of from wild yams.

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,370
Did you know that?
That's how they catch him.

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

63
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,521
No,
I've,

64
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,070
I've,
I've heard of people doing stuff like

65
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,990
that.
But I mean that just seems insane.

66
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,460
I mean,
last time we're going to show you were

67
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,640
talking about how somebody was pulling
out their blood and refrigerating it and

68
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,280
yeah,
it was at doping basically epo.

69
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,300
That's.
Well that's,

70
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,150
that is still going on.
That's definitely still going on.

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,990
And apparently the way they're supposed
to be able to test that.

72
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,730
Like you're not supposed to use an IV,
right?

73
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,140
Yup.
And the reason why you're not supposed

74
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,500
to use an ivs that somehow or another
through intravenous fluids,

75
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:51,501
you can mask the effects of doping.
So they also have been able to detect

76
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,780
minuscule,
um,

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,840
plastic particles from the tubes that
they use to put ivy fluids back into

78
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,680
your body.
They've been able to detect those

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,260
apparently,
but no one's ever been caught for that.

80
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,940
So that's what they would do.
They would,

81
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,060
they would either use a blood that's
your own blood or in Lance Armstrong's

82
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,570
case,
a lot of the people that were taking

83
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,670
epo,
which makes your body produce more

84
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,504
blood.

85
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,320
But I think guys to this day are
probably still putting blood back into

86
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,970
their body.
That's insane.

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,830
Gives you an advantage,
you know,

88
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,910
and it's kind of scary,
you know what I mean?

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,630
This drastic way.
And then you're pulling blood and then

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,040
you know,
with everything going on.

91
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,510
Well I know a dude that walked into a
fighters' dressing room,

92
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm not dressing room,
hotel room and they had bags of blood in

93
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,800
the hotel room.
They pulled his blood out so he could

94
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,670
make weight.
Yeah.

95
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,130
You were telling me that last time.
What the fuck?

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,113
Yeah,
that's freaky.

97
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,410
That's freaky.
Yeah,

98
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,110
because that's not sanitary.
You're not in the hospital.

99
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:53,020
You're in some hotel room where people
had been farting and shooting loads all

100
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,040
over the place.
It goes to shit all over the wall.

101
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,830
You're just gonna take your blood out
and that environment,

102
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,300
like that's creepy man.

103
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,640
That was like you said,
that was like a long time ago too.

104
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,870
Yeah,
that was a long time ago.

105
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,130
Well,
people have been.

106
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,050
They've been definitely cheating
forever,

107
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,580
but now we're seeing the effects of it.
Like people's physiques are changing.

108
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,640
The way they fight is changing the way
they look there.

109
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,590
Joel.
Yeah.

110
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,430
Everything about them.
Their attitude,

111
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,460
like their confidence,
like some of these guys,

112
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,160
like they're becoming different human
beings.

113
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,430
I mean I,
I the level playing field,

115
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,570
people were getting knocked out,
you know,

116
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,030
their,
their bodies are changing and they're.

117
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,450
And they're seeing that their fight
style is guys,

118
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,790
we're going undefeated and just all
these rampages you're like,

119
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,440
man,
he must be in great shape.

120
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,950
He's just killing it in the fifth round
and now he can't get past round one,

121
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,050
two,
you know,

122
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:40,900
and you're just like,
wow.

123
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,750
Yeah.
And the technique is king,

124
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,170
right?

125
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,010
Technique and training and heart and
courage and cardio and cardio.

126
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,170
Yeah.
We'll go to a guy like mighty mouse

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,320
where he fought a bog routine off and
bogatin off he out cardio the guy beat

128
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,520
his ass,
especially going into the stretch was

129
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,880
just completely out of work.
And um,

130
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,680
and at the end of the fight back with
[inaudible] pops hot for EPO.

131
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,800
Yup.
So even though this guy was on drugs,

132
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:10,450
mighty mouse is technique and cardio and
just as his ability to understand how to

133
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,490
pace himself through a five round fight.
Yeah.

134
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,840
No,
mighty mouse is.

135
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:15,070
He's a,
he's interested in it.

136
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,800
I know you've been a big fan of him and
I've always enjoyed watching that guy.

137
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,010
I mean I can't fight like that guy,
but to watch some of his techniques and

138
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,220
the way you use angles and footwork and
how he learns you in,

139
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,160
in his clinch game is,
is a nasty,

140
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,950
nasty.

141
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,000
You know,
I wonder if maybe you could give some

142
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:34,180
insight on this,
like you used to fight at 1:55 and now

143
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,910
you've got to cut to get down to one
$45.

144
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,000
A pretty big guy,
but mighty mouse is not a big guy and I

145
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:44,440
always wonder like could a guy like
could a light heavyweight or a

146
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,560
middleweight even,
could they possibly even fight like him?

147
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:51,070
Or is that a gravity thing?
Like is part of what's going on with

148
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,720
him.
The fact that he's so light,

149
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,040
like he can move faster.
He's got like more options as far as

150
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,933
equity can do.

151
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,610
Some people are blessed with a better
integrated in their body such as like a

152
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,590
neutral spine.
A lot of people have like lumbar

153
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:07,140
problems in neutral spine.
Ever watched mayweather.

154
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,330
He,
you don't ever see him lean and he's

155
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:13,230
just always in constantly good posture
and good position and just like in

156
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:14,670
wrestling,
if you're in good position,

157
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,990
more than likely you're going to win the
fight.

158
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,480
Mighty mouse,
he just has that type of movement and

159
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,060
integrate his whole body.
Whereas body moves as one,

160
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,730
it doesn't work against them.
There's not a like a lot of rattle and

161
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,140
his body safe.
He throws a kick,

162
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,450
he doesn't land awkward,
he doesn't it,

163
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,180
it goes.
He goes right back to a neutral base and

164
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,050
he's able to laterally move and
constantly have his body working for

165
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,760
him.
So I think him naturally,

166
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:38,360
he just has that type of gifts and
benefits of his body.

167
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,410
He's able to integrate his body to work
as one.

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,750
Therefore you don't waste a lot of
energy.

169
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:46,890
He has really fluid movement.
Look at a guy like Anderson Silva.

170
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:49,870
He's able to beat people just by keeping
his range and,

171
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,780
and just his movement of his body.
He doesn't,

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,990
he doesn't swing like a Mark Hunt or or
me where you know,

173
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,210
like I'll,
I'll throw a lot of powers and normally

174
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:57,870
I miss,
you know,

175
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,250
I'm just trying to,
trying to reach them,

176
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,650
but them guys,
they just use fluid movement and that's,

177
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,520
I think some people are just blessed to
have that integrated in their body in a

178
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,740
good neutral spine and a good solid
base.

179
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,120
And that's why they're able to connect
on their shots a lot more.

180
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,730
It's as convenient,
disconnected,

181
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,390
like,
uh,

182
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,270
say like a short circuit if,
if there's like a small,

183
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,370
like little detail,
like this cord right here,

184
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,340
say it's like it's like broken and
you're not getting the full amount of

185
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:23,540
energy as where if you have a solid base
and a good good spine,

186
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,380
you know how to integrate your body to
use as one,

187
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,420
there's going to be a lot more of a
sturdier connection and more flow.

188
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,610
Yeah.

189
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,650
Fluid movement.
I'm glad you brought that up because

190
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,810
I've always,
I've always thought that about like

191
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,700
efficiency,
that efficiency is very important.

192
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,530
And there are fighters that you see like
wasted movement or lot of slop into the

193
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,440
way they execute techniques and even if
they have power,

194
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,070
like sometimes like they're,
they're so awkward with the way they do

195
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,510
it,
but you've got to think that there's a

196
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,850
lot of waste as far as like the energy
expenditure.

197
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,370
But like,
so you think that that is a,

198
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,890
you said blessed.
So you think that that's a natural

199
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,480
ability?
I think

200
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,550
natural,
some of it occurs that some people are

201
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,250
able to integrate their body.
If you ever just look up people's

202
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,490
postures,
some people just kinda the they'll

203
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,050
slouch will kind of bend over

204
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,860
posture.
It's this thing is kind of actually is

205
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
it popping out?
It always does that.

206
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,030
We got a tape that down Jamie

207
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,300
and you know that like,
like you said,

208
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,610
it's a lot of wasted,
a lot of wasted movement as some people

209
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,550
are just more integrated with their body
so they are a lot more efficient,

210
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,720
you know,
granted then you do,

211
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,240
you've got to have the skills,
the cardio and everything else.

212
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,200
But I feel like if you have a good one

213
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,550
base and plus with the fight skills,
I feel like you're going to be a lot

214
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,760
more efficient and probably have
longevity in your career as well with

215
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,670
injuries and stuff.
Do you think that that's from childhood?

216
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:39,630
Like I've always wondered like there's
some children that start off doing like

217
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:44,631
gymnastics or there's been a lot of guys
in Jujitsu that have got into it that

218
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,340
come from break dancing,
which was kind of interesting.

219
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,620
Is a real recent,
we've seen a lot of guys,

220
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,060
but that ability to minute to move your
body like at a young age,

221
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:56,400
you develop like a real sense

222
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,540
of I want to add just coordination,
you know,

223
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,540
the just dexterity,
so many different attributes that you

224
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,930
develop when you're young and then your
body grows into it.

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,550
Yeah.
It's an intuition,

226
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,391
you know,
once you feel it.

227
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,810
Like I,
I work with a,

228
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,620
like a movement guy,
functional patterns for the long time

229
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,600
and I learned how to integrate my body
and to not waste movement in,

230
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,391
in,
you know,

231
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,910
to activate my core,
my glutes,

232
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,880
my growing all the way to my feet being
on my toes.

233
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,730
If you ever notice people walk like a
duck footed and stuff like that,

234
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,940
it's like all problems in their hips.
That's why you see like a lot of.

235
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,650
So I have like foam rollers and stuff
people roll out.

236
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,700
But you know,
once you release my Fascia,

237
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,700
there's,
there's corrective exercises you can do

238
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,930
to kind of reprogram your mind that
you've been working on such a

239
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:40,470
dysfunction.

240
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,270
You may not even know it.
And,

241
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:42,750
uh,
there's,

242
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,580
there's ways to do that.
You can integrate your body and

243
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,740
neurologically reprogram your mind is
like,

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,450
you know,
this is how I should be walking,

245
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,040
this is how it should be integrated,
my body.

246
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,040
And this helps out with posture and
breathing.

247
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,560
You know,
the ice man Hoff says lot of stuff about

248
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,900
this.
And uh,

249
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,880
it's,
it's real interesting facts to faccento

250
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,140
because this is for everybody.
People worked down at a desk,

251
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,890
slouching,
over typing all the time.

252
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,550
We got tight hip flexors there.
Their lean in poor diet,

253
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,793
you know,
it,

254
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,570
it like this a go.
It goes to anybody,

255
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,250
you know,
to learn how to integrate your body

256
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,140
power of posture.
And uh,

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,950
this guy,
uh,

258
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,480
naughty aguilar from functional
patterns,

259
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,610
really,
he taught me a lot about this and,

260
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,710
and movement and integrating your body.

261
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,050
And it just goes real deep.
Well,

262
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,820
there's,
that's a controversial subject,

263
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,040
right?
Movement coaches,

264
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,360
like there's a lot of people that get
involved with movement coaches and some

265
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,010
people mock it and some people say,
well,

266
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,860
you should just be spending that time
working on your fight training and your

267
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,090
abilities.
You know,

268
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:39,060
your,
your skill set and then just do cardio

269
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,180
and explosive exercises and then some
people say,

270
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,450
no,
you know,

271
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,430
that's good too.
But the,

272
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:48,870
the ability to move efficiently in odd
ways and carrier balance.

273
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,020
Now your guy,
he said it's a functional patterns.

274
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,080
That's what they call it.
Yeah.

275
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,641
The,
you know,

276
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,061
I,
you know,

277
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,820
McConnell McGregor has been,
been doing a lot of stuff with movement

278
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,451
and uh,
you know,

279
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,500
it's pretty good.
That's great.

280
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,730
Ido,
Ido portal,

281
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,070
that guy's a freak if you ever seen a
move.

282
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,810
Yes.
But here's what he lacks.

283
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,430
He lacks a integrating your body.
He doesn't understand the integration

284
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,620
part as it were,
a naughty aguilar with functional

285
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:13,170
patterns.
He teaches you how to kind of just sit

286
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,650
still integrating your body and just
hold these positions where I'm just

287
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,510
standing still or all my toes without a,
uh,

288
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,020
a lumbar extension or,
or,

289
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:22,550
you know,
if uh,

290
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,770
if I'm slouching,
he,

291
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:26,040
he,
he keeps a neutral spine throughout his

292
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,890
whole movement.
So he's using his body as one and he has

293
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,490
a little bit more of an integrated
system as compared to just no one who

294
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,080
knows.
Even having to have a base and then just

295
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,680
go into this movement and you're doing
it all wrong while you have in Lombard

296
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:40,730
or you're slouching.
He believes in integrating that

297
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,750
techniques or your body works like you
said,

298
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,090
more efficiently instead of working
against you.

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,770
Well,
why do you think the Connor's doing it

300
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:47,080
wrong?

301
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,890
Like what?
What leads you to think that just,

302
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:51,270
uh,
just by his posture,

303
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,660
you can watch his posture or watch his
knee if his knee goes over his toe in

304
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,500
like a certain movement or he has like a
lumberyard and a spine as compared to if

305
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,100
you watch like a Naughty Aguilar,
he'll teach you how to do that same type

306
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:06,130
of movement.
But you'll see the little minor details

307
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:06,790
in,
in,

308
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,830
in little millimeters of a difference
that,

309
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,760
that makes you integrated your body so
that your glutes are working with your,

310
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,180
with your core as you walk in.
We walk into everybody just does these

311
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,014
like,
you know,

312
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,390
dead lifts and it's not like a,
a good rotate.

313
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,700
As as humans we rotate,
we walk,

314
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,630
you know,
and fighting.

315
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:26,530
We move and he,
he integrates everything as far as your

316
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,040
core to your,
you're growing to your,

317
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,190
to being on your power to tow so that it
keep saying that power to like two toes.

318
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,180
What do you mean by the,
you know,

319
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,790
like say how you punched on like your
main two fingers.

320
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,120
The two knuckles that are index finger
and the finger,

321
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,660
right?
Yep.

322
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,780
And you know how you have like arches on
your feet and you're kind of walking

323
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,110
like,
look at my hands and you're walking like

324
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,960
that on the outside.
So then if I'm walking on the outside,

325
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,490
my knees like this,
say this,

326
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,250
this is good.
So now I'm integrating everything up to

327
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,570
my growing,
my glutes activated.

328
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,990
But if I'm walking on the outside,
your knee's gonna,

329
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,790
your knee's gonna your outer part of
your knee is going to be taken more of

330
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,280
the,
the,

331
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,160
the load and the damage,
you know,

332
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,700
then you're not integrating or growing.
And that's how people end up actually.

333
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,770
Is this the guy?
This is him.

334
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,350
Functional patterns,
functional patterns.

335
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,620
What is his background?

336
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,420
Uh,
you know,

337
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:13,360
the guy's just a freak dude.
He knows a little bit about everything

338
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,120
and and right here you notice like he
doesn't really have any lumbar

339
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,980
extension,
which is like a lower back thing.

340
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:22,540
Everything is really integrated and it's
minor details in the corps and he's not

341
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,200
shrugging his shoulders.
He's,

342
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,900
he's using fluid movement and everything
that he does is rotational.

343
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,940
And what is his name again?
I'm sorry.

344
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,860
Naughty agular.
Naughty Aguilar.

345
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,680
And where's he out of a.
he's out of Seattle.

346
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,260
I met him in San Diego some years back.
We used to.

347
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,640
We worked a lot in just on a first we
had to fix my body a lot.

348
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,880
I was a of an elbow problems.
I was having all types of problems with

349
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,440
Tommy about myofascial release and then
I got into correctional exercises and

350
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,770
once he was able to fix my base I was
able to start moving and getting into

351
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,760
movements like this.

352
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,620
So what we're looking at folks for the
folks that are just listening is this

353
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:04,621
guy doing all this crazy movements with
kettlebells and dumbbells and jumping

354
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:09,370
around back and forth and see what all
these flips through the air right now.

355
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,180
Really interesting stuff though,
because you can land and they don't,

356
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,650
they don't go out,
they don't,

357
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,560
they don't do this.
And I have watched a idol.

358
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,860
I think that's his name and there's,
there's just these little details that

359
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,710
he doesn't have that he has that he
integrates.

360
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,410
Whereas knees don't,
his knees don't sway out.

361
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,230
Like everything is seriously in a
functional pattern.

362
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,440
Like everything he does,
he doesn't muscle anything to where like

363
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,131
you're,
you're lifting.

364
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,620
Everything is a fluid movement.
He's allowing the swing,

365
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,650
almost like a cheat to allow your body
to rotate.

366
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:39,161
And it's,
uh,

367
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,450
it's,
it's really,

368
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,770
uh,
it's really changed my life,

369
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,600
uh,
work working with this guy and the

370
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,310
things that I've learned and,
and,

371
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:45,970
and,
uh,

372
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,840
the deficiencies in my body that I
really wasn't aware of back then that

373
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,770
I'm working with and you know,
I've

374
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,100
been fighting for a long time and I've,
I've been able to keep healthy and

375
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,410
injury free by doing a lot of these
movements,

376
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,080
myofascial release and working on my
posture.

377
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,440
Breathing.
You know,

378
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,520
people who are doing sprints at night,
they know your nervous system is still

379
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,740
in like a fight or flight mode and you
can't fall asleep,

380
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,320
you know,
such things as breathing to help that

381
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,110
out too.
I mean you've been here with iceman and

382
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,180
hear his stuff.
So I mean breathing's huge.

383
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,130
So I've learned a lot through this guy
actually.

384
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:20,390
So what you're saying is that doing
sprints at night is not a good idea.

385
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,020
No,
it is,

386
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,100
but I'm talking about,
you know,

387
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,980
if you figured out a little calmer self
doubt and that's breathing,

388
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:25,701
you know,
some people are like,

389
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,680
man I can't sleep at night but I,
but I ran,

390
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,611
you know,
it's like okay,

391
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,090
well you can do that by breathing and
just kind of calming your nervous system

392
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,920
down so that you can get that,
that recovery,

393
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,180
because if not you fall asleep.

394
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,120
Your body still thinks it's in fight or
flight mode and that they're still

395
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:41,060
sprinting as where you're able.
If you're able to breathe,

396
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,770
calm yourself down,
you get better sleep,

397
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,380
better rest recovery and the hormones
are going to take over your body and

398
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,840
repair it.
What I think about these things is

399
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,260
obviously this guy's very impressive.
I liked the way he's moving.

400
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:55,310
He's obviously very athletic and very
coordinated and you see when he throws

401
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,560
punches and kicks,
he's obviously had some martial arts

402
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:00,830
background as well.
There's some of these guys though.

403
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,910
I equate it to yoga.
There's a lot of real yoga people out

404
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:09,110
there that are really good at yoga and
they are dedicated to it and it's super

405
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:12,770
important to them.
And then there's the fuckers that are

406
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:17,300
fuckery.
There's just fake spiritual people and

407
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:21,980
they talk a lot of the yoga nonsense,
but they're really just fucking Weirdos.

408
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,650
And I see that a lot in these movement
coaches too.

409
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,070
Like I've talked to a few of them,
like,

410
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,871
Eh,
okay.

411
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,910
I,
I smelled fuckery.

412
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,210
If something,
something going on,

413
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,450
like there's an,
it's a weird Gig,

414
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
like to do that for a living.
What do you do?

415
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,900
Oh,
I teach functional movement.

416
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:36,880
What does that mean?
Uh,

417
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:37,714
it's just,
uh,

418
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,960
you know,
I show people how to move.

419
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,370
I know how to move.
What are you talking about?

420
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,800
He doesn't.
He was never like considered like a

421
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,250
movement coach,
you know,

422
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,420
he was never really considered like a
strength conditioning coach.

423
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:51,170
I went with him with pain management and
then it got into correctional exercises.

424
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,080
I mean this guy is,
he's actually had a eisman health come

425
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,000
hang out with him.
He's went and seen a.

426
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,330
The guy with the Venus project.
I mean this guy,

427
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,950
he's smart,
been all over.

428
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,240
I mean he,
he kind of does it all,

429
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,020
was really self sufficient.
He has a really good brain and

430
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,883
knowledge.
He,

431
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,930
he's not one of them like,
fuck,

432
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:09,980
are you guys.
I mean me and him had had our issues and

433
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,270
stuff before,
but we're,

434
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,490
we're cool,
but he's not one of them guys,

435
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,920
but I know exactly what you're talking
about this,

436
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,750
a lot of people in that,
this business mma business,

437
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm sure you've dealt with a lot of.
They're moving in now.

438
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,980
The leather,
they always see the ido poor towels and

439
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,690
you know the move not guys.
They see these guys that are successful

440
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:30,500
work with guys like Carlos Condo to you
and then I see a few of these guys that

441
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:34,550
are trying to be one of these guys and
but this guy looks fucking legit as

442
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,930
hell.
Like you could tell by the way he's

443
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,450
moving like that is a really athletic
guy.

444
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,081
Yeah.
I don't.

445
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,170
I don't go around doing touch but shit,
you know,

446
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,090
and fights,
you know.

447
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:46,550
I mean I stick to stick to what I know,
but it is good to learn how to use pain

448
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:51,480
management to stay healthy Myofascia and
integrated your body so that you are

449
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,580
working efficiently and you're not
working against yourself.

450
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:54,960
I mean,
it's awesome to go through these

451
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:57,150
workouts that I do now.
I'm going to have a different strength

452
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:01,110
conditioning coach and we stick to a lot
of these functional movements,

453
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,000
athletic movements,
explosive movements,

454
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,810
and we do it with a good integrated
system to where,

455
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,811
you know,
if I,

456
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,920
if I go on banging on this tire and I'm
just recklessly and then I wake up in

457
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,480
the morning,
I'm like,

458
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,070
fuck man,
I got to spar and I'm feeling like crap.

459
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,810
I mean,
it's good to have your body working

460
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,480
efficiently,
using the right things that need to be

461
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,150
used instead of having all the small
muscle groups work in,

462
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,710
you know,
that's how.

463
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,400
That's how you get injured these days.
Know I was reading this post once on a

464
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,440
forum.
I think it might've been the underground

465
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,850
where someone was talking about lifting
weights and a how all their bad sparring

466
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,380
sessions come after lifting weights.
Like,

467
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,214
yeah,
Duh,

468
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,000
like you probably shouldn't be sparring
after you lift a.

469
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,660
like these dudes are talking about doing
like mega squats and deadlifts and power

470
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:45,750
benching and then trying to stay loose
and fluid.

471
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,610
It's not going to happen.
Your,

472
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,890
your,
your tissues all broken down and you're

473
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:53,700
exhausted and it's really a bad idea to
spar when you're like that because then

474
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,391
you know,
well,

475
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,170
what about mental toughness,
but you can't here.

476
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,440
You're not going to learn.
Your body's all fucked up.

477
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,800
You're supposed to be resting or if
you're doing anything he should be doing

478
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,620
like light drilling,
but something where you're forced to

479
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,050
react quickly and move.

480
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,380
That's a good way to get injured,
right?

481
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah,
exactly.

482
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,050
You know,
people do that all the time.

483
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,410
You hear about these guys getting
injured all the time and you know,

484
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:16,320
just being self sufficient,
learning about little stuff like this

485
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,400
because it could help you out,
you know,

486
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,910
such as thing as just a little bit of a
foam rolling out and then a little bit

487
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,730
of correctional exercises that could
just help you out a lot more

488
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,140
efficiently.
And there's no.

489
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,560
I mean I've gotten in arguments where
I've went out to Arizona to see some of

490
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,080
my friends that ended up leaving
alliance and I,

491
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,160
you know,
I got into an argument a little bit like

492
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,950
a battle.
This guy is like trying to tell me to,

493
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,880
I need a my base to do this and I'm like
wearing a fight that I'm going to be,

494
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,500
you know,
10 feet.

495
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,690
My feet are this far apart.
I'm like,

496
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,730
no bro,
like I got to be within,

497
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,860
you know,
I can be able to rotate,

498
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:47,401
move,
you know,

499
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,980
with if I'm spreading my legs out,
you know,

500
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,700
that ain't doing nothing for me.
And I've,

501
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,920
I just,
I see a lot of people doing a lot of

502
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,210
meatheads stuff.
You know,

503
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,870
this isn't an interesting because you're
kind of,

504
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,940
it's a kind of an open ended thing when
you're a fighter because I see these

505
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:06,480
guys trying all this different stuff and
there's no right or wrong way.

506
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,350
Like here's a perfect example.
There's Robbie lawler who's a world

507
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,130
champion bad motherfucker and then
there's Stephen Wonderboy Thompson.

508
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,060
Totally different stance.
I mean totally different way of moving.

509
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,560
Both guys super successful and who
fucking knows what would happen if they

510
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,570
fought.
We really don't know until they fight,

511
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,170
right?
Yeah.

512
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,510
But if wonderboy,
Matt Robbins like,

513
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh man,
you're doing it all wrong.

514
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

515
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,900
You know,
if he's trying to coach him,

516
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,670
but obviously he's not doing it all
wrong.

517
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,340
He's a world champion.
He's not doing it all wrong.

518
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,990
He's doing it perfect,
but is it the best way?

519
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,930
Ultimately you don't know and you won't
ever know until those two guys go at it.

520
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:48,010
And here's what's even crazier.
He might

521
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,390
beat wonderboy.
Wonderboy might be able to beat a guy

522
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,850
that can beat him.
It's weird.

523
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,520
I lived that life.
You.

524
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,050
It's weird,
right?

525
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,620
It is insane.
The home,

526
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,300
we're just watching Holly Holm and then
like shift change.

527
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,200
She gets beat by mistake and then she'd
beat Ronda Rousey type deal.

528
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:08,681
So.
Well,

529
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,620
Rhonda Rousey fought the perfect fight
for holly,

530
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,380
like charging adder.
And Holly's a great counter striker

531
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,300
where it shift Chenko.
If you watched that fight,

532
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,570
she did not lead at all.
She just hung back and waited and

533
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,900
enforced highly into her game.
Yup.

534
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,210
And uh,
you know,

535
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,340
it was just a bad night for holly.
I'm sure she'll be back.

536
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:30,310
But it's interesting tactically.
And,

537
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,830
and if you look at it from a strategic
standpoint,

538
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:36,600
like utilizing your skills to the best
of your ability in,

539
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,140
you know,
when you're inside the octagon and

540
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:43,060
figuring out what about what you do
matches really good against what she

541
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:43,720
does.

542
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,060
And Shevchenko just nailed it.
She figured it out.

543
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,740
Yup.
Crazy man.

544
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,960
That's the fight game.
It is the fight game.

545
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,900
It's a crazy game man.
And it's,

546
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,870
it's interesting you see people jumping
from one trailer to the other and just

547
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,880
looking for that.
And it's almost like you've got a

548
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,700
certain amount of time.
It's like you're playing musical chairs.

549
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,410
So like how much do you got into your
career?

550
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:06,610
You've got maybe like a good solid.
If you really take care of yourself,

551
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:11,611
you've got like 15 years unless you're.
Dan Henderson is abandoned too and he's

552
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,680
fighting for the fucking title.
He's gonna fight bisbing for the title

553
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,930
in London.
That's going to be madness.

554
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,470
And he says if he wins,
he's gonna Retire Dawn.

555
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,760
He should drop,
walk away,

556
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,860
carry out.
The one thing that he hasn't been able

557
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,890
to do is win the UFC gold.
But look man,

558
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,710
he's got as good a shot as anybody
watched that Lombard fight.

559
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,701
Yeah,
I did.

560
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,534
I was.
I was there,

561
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,560
but I couldn't believe it.
Dude.

562
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,260
I was going nuts.
I've been a fan of his for so long.

563
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,860
He's such an awesome guy.
Yeah.

564
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
Real,
real quiet,

565
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,750
chill and just amazing guy.
Dude is hard worker.

566
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,160
I mean,
it's awesome to see that.

567
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,110
Did you see as the instagram post after
he won,

568
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,500
he had an American flag on.
Does it said smoke that Cuban.

569
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,350
Oh
dude,

570
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:51,730
that was crazy.
I can't.

571
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:54,540
I mean Lombard's is scary,
do it.

572
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,610
I'm like,
no.

573
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,171
I'm like,
dude,

574
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,310
he's getting dropped.
I'm like,

575
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,960
no.
Henderson heard him first.

576
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,000
Henderson heard him first and he moved
in for the kill,

577
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:04,840
but Lombard wasn't done and Lombard
cracked him in Lombard had them on the

578
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,700
ground,
had him inside control it,

579
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:10,840
looked bad and then get the way knocked
them out too is so crazy with that.

580
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,960
Back Elbow.
Yeah.

581
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,083
Instincts,
man.

582
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,160
Oh yeah.
No one's ever done that before.

583
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,320
No one's ever knocked anybody.
I mean,

584
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:18,400
he was dead before he hit the ground.
Yeah.

585
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,920
No one's ever knocked anybody that with
elbow.

586
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,701
He,
you know,

587
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,230
he's going to follow up with a couple of
blows.

588
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,340
Oh yeah,
for sure.

589
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,330
Yeah,
you got to pull them off.

590
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,380
Lumbar.
Just scary dude.

591
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,450
And I was done at att one time helping
out,

592
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,590
uh,
Jorge Mazda at all.

593
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,790
And they're like,
hey,

594
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,800
whatever you do,
just don't spar Lombard.

595
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,820
I might think I was way bigger than me.
Like he would say,

596
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,561
he'd be like,
yeah,

597
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,900
he may try to ask you to farm.
Don't spar him,

598
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,870
you know,
it just comes in and he's just a tank,

599
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:41,471
you know?
And I'm like,

600
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:42,191
Fuck Dude,
I'm not,

601
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm not trying to spar that guy.
Hell No.

602
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,130
He's a freak athlete,
man.

603
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,760
Him and Yoel Romero like,
I don't know what kind of rice and beans

604
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:54,761
they were feeding them down in Cuba.
Good rice and beans that you guys are

605
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:57,950
free suit.
Have you seen the new photos,

606
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:01,420
the most recent photos of [inaudible]?
Oh yeah.

607
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,260
Yeah,
fucking Christ.

608
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:07,520
He looks like he's 250 pound dude.
If that guy tripped and fell,

609
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,150
I would seriously just run out the room.
They're like,

610
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,170
fuck that dude.
There's no way,

611
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,090
man.
I mean those guys are tapping before

612
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,640
doing.
It doesn't matter at all.

613
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,780
He just tears your shit apart.
That's insane man.

614
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,960
He's so fucking thick right now.
He's only like five,

615
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,160
seven and he's probably no bullshit.
Two hundred and 30 pounds.

616
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,140
He's enormous right now.
Yeah.

617
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,993
God bless him,
dude.

618
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,400
That guy's scary,
man.

619
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,000
Fuck.
Well,

620
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,820
now that he's not testing,
looking at him right there.

621
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Jesus Christ.
I mean that's a legitimate 225 pounds at

622
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:40,590
five.

623
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,750
Seven,
five,

624
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:43,130
seven.
Yeah,

625
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm way bigger than it,
man.

626
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,530
That's crazy.
It's crazy.

627
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,450
I mean,
dude,

628
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,330
I'm short.
I'm five,

629
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,610
eight and I stand.
I'm taller than that dude,

630
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,220
but he's like a foot wider than me.
Yeah.

631
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:54,740
And you get after I see you on the
audits and always,

632
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
always getting after it.
You know,

633
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,730
maybe after I retired from fighting,
I'm just gonna get on the juice and just

634
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,731
look like that as get back each class.
Do fucking strong man competitions.

635
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,500
Ankle locks all day.
Carry cars and shit.

636
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,550
Yeah.
Do you ever get caught on your car?

637
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,720
Paul Harris might be the guy that you
want right there.

638
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,750
He's ridiculously big right now.
Yeah,

639
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:17,090
that's definitely steroids.
One hundred percent for sure.

640
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,370
One hundred percent.
You don't gain that much weight.

641
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,970
I mean the last time he fought was like
a year ago and he was fighting in one 70

642
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,620
now and now.

643
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,410
I mean obviously a lot of guys would
fight at one 72.

644
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:30,440
Really weigh the one nineties,
somewhere around there and then they cut

645
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:34,060
weight to get down to one 70,
but that is just gigantic and do this.

646
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
That's too much,
man.

647
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,280
He's a fucking awesome Jujitsu player
too.

648
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:41,270
It's not just strong.
He's got some serious legit technique.

649
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,310
My uh,
where my guy who gave him a purple belt,

650
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,620
Dean lister,
you know,

651
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:46,310
he,
he's a,

652
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,830
he's been still going out and competing.
I know he just lost everything.

653
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,050
But uh,
it's just outstanding deeds.

654
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,540
He's very good dude.
He's a big dude,

655
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:57,320
but he rolls like a little guy and he's
just freakishly strong man.

656
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,110
Yeah,
he's a very smart dean.

657
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:02,480
Knows a lot about Jujitsu and he's one
of the reasons why,

658
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,190
you know,
the whole John Danaher,

659
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:07,310
Henzel Gracie team got so good at leg
locks.

660
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,230
A lot of that was the influence of Dean
lister.

661
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,560
Dean lister went down there and did some
training with them and dean has been a

662
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,760
leg lock master from the old days.
Like he was one of those guys that was

663
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,370
leg locking people in the early days of
Abu Dhabi.

664
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,360
Yup.
Back in the early two thousands.

665
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,650
You know,
when people like the leg lock game has

666
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,680
shifted over the last few years and it's
become incredibly dominant.

667
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:32,390
There's so many guys that are winning.
Like Jujitsu has become a largely like a

668
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,480
game of like 60,
maybe even more percent leg locks.

669
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,990
Especially no gate like Eddie Commons,
Gary Tonin,

670
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,650
all these guys from John Donohue camp.
There's so many guys down down there

671
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:47,580
that are just really talented at
attacking legs and not a lot of people

672
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,340
like that.
It's a sophisticated.

673
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,910
Yeah.
When you start playing with the legs,

674
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:51,744
you know,
scary.

675
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,700
No.
Yeah.

676
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,400
Nobody likes getting crippled,
but you know,

677
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,960
like Eddie Bravo had a really good
point.

678
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,441
He's like,
well,

679
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,120
is it okay if someone yanks on your
neck?

680
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,640
Is it okay if someone breaks your arm?
Like it's.

681
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:05,310
What is the difference?
Like just got to tap before you get

682
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
fucked up.
Yup.

683
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,710
Which is easier said than done.
Paul Harris is on there.

684
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,650
You tap all day.
But yeah,

685
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,310
he is tearing people's knees apart.
Yeah.

686
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,870
This kind of bullshit.
It is.

687
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
Well,
it's definitely bullshit when people

688
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,860
tap.
It is definitely bullshit.

689
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:22,410
When people tap.
Do you think there's anything that

690
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,300
should be changed about the current
rules?

691
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,930
Like if you look at MMA rules,
the way they stand right now,

692
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,240
like there's some people that think that
the uh,

693
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,710
knees on the ground issue,
if you,

694
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,720
if you don't know the story of MMA has a
rule where you can need someone to the

695
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:43,050
head if they're standing,
but if they put one hand on the ground,

696
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,070
you can't name in the hat.

697
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,030
So a lot of guys will put a hand on the
ground just to stop the knee and then

698
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,550
the lift that up and put it down like
they play like a little,

699
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,940
like almost like a game of like now.
Now I'm safe.

700
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:54,990
I got,
I'm holding.

701
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,570
Remember like old school wrestling.
You could hold onto the rope and they

702
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,980
would let,
let go of a whole.

703
00:27:58,981 --> 00:27:59,570
Yeah,
Yup,

704
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,403
Yup,
Yup,

705
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,880
Yup.
10 counts stuff like all that.

706
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,410
Didn't they have that in like pancrase
to where in pancreas if someone was hold

707
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,660
onto a submission,
you could grab the rope and they would

708
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:11,030
let go of a submission.
I don't know.

709
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,760
I've never really watched too much
pancrase fucking feel like that was a

710
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,480
rule.
The rope.

711
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,130
Like oh I'm safe.
I'm safe.

712
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,260
It was something about that where if you
grabbed a hold of the ropes,

713
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,280
they had to let go.

714
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,360
No,
I think that's A.

715
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,730
I think it's a good rule.
I mean,

716
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:28,870
I actually just watched the fights over
the weekend.

717
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,600
Darren Elkins,
uh,

718
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,270
he just got need heart in the temple.
You don't me as a fucking illegal,

719
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,720
illegal.
And then the guy punches him after and

720
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:37,980
he falls down.
I'm like,

721
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,360
no way.
That was illegal knee.

722
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,381
And then,
you know,

723
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,900
he just shakes it off,
comes back and ends up beating the guy.

724
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,760
But as an animal,
yeah,

725
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,650
yeah.
He's a fucking hand on.

726
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,260
I fought that guy.
He just,

727
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,840
he's a tough dude.
He's took,

728
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,990
takes shots,
you know,

729
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,920
tough as nails and coming.
Yeah.

730
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,910
It's like you hit him,
he's like a Chris leave and he just gets

731
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,590
more fired up and keeps coming at you,
you know.

732
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,880
But uh,
you know,

733
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,430
as far as those rules,
I think that's kind of fair.

734
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,180
I mean,
unless,

735
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,730
you know,
I don't think UFC Fox wants to see

736
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,220
people getting head stomped and in their
prior roles,

737
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:05,881
you know,
and you know,

738
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,560
damn,
all them guys were juicing over there so

739
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,840
they're just taking people down.
If that was the case,

740
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:12,390
I just go juice uptake people down into
to start soccer,

741
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,560
kicking people all day,
you know,

742
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:14,940
that's scary.
It is.

743
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,400
Imagine somebody standing over you and
then you're just like,

744
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,530
fuck,
this guy is trying to stop me out.

745
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:19,880
I mean,
that's,

746
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,070
that's a scary thought to be thinking.
I don't know if I don't even want to be

747
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,080
fighting.
You

748
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,930
think that if it was legal that you
wouldn't think that way.

749
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,700
I mean,
think of all the stuff that you can do

750
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,280
inside the octagon,
you know,

751
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,760
think of all the techniques that you do
land like,

752
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,230
you know,
like that knee that you landed on Dennis

753
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,300
Bermudez,
that's about as powerful and knee as you

754
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,550
get hit a dude with on the ground
standing up.

755
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:41,790
No matter.
I mean,

756
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,790
that's a goddamn perfect knee.
You land on it and that was pretty

757
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,250
fucking spectacular.
Thank you.

758
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,750
But if that wasn't legal,
you know,

759
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,100
and then you did that.
Everybody be like,

760
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,990
Oh shit,
that shouldn't be legal.

761
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,770
Like perfect example is a Cyborg Santos
Michael Page.

762
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Michael Page hit Cyborg Santos with a
nice so hard that he fractured his

763
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:07,300
skull.
His skull caved in and the fucking Mris

764
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,090
are insane.
I've never seen that in all my years of

765
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,390
watching fights and being involved in
martial arts.

766
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,290
I've never seen anybody's head caved in.

767
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,160
Yeah,
that's,

768
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,701
that's,
uh,

769
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:17,910
that's unfortunate man.
Uh,

770
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,891
you know,
I,

771
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:21,020
I can imagine some,
some trauma and some injuries and you

772
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:21,800
know,
and uh,

773
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,760
I seen sideboard was like,
oh,

774
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:24,380
it'll be fine.
It'll be fine in three months.

775
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,520
Yeah,
that's what you bro.

776
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,380
Yeah.
What?

777
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,420
No dude like,
look at the skull.

778
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,020
That's escaped.
That's nice.

779
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,540
That is nuts.
That's like,

780
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,510
reminds me of that movie concussion with
will Smith and he's talking about the

781
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,540
football players that are taking these
type of injuries,

782
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,500
you know,
and uh,

783
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,790
that,
that's bad man.

784
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,810
This whole fucking skulls.

785
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,110
It's crazy.
I've never seen that.

786
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,880
I've never seen that happen.
I didn't,

787
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,770
I thought that that area was so hard
because that's the area where I,

788
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,510
I guess like a lot of people break their
hand,

789
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,340
their hand right here.
They don't really break it on that area.

790
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,770
Yeah.
But I mean a,

791
00:30:58,771 --> 00:30:59,920
a knee.
Yeah.

792
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,080
And you're kind of coming into it.
That's what it is,

793
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,360
right?
He was moving into it and it was really

794
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,890
just a perfect storm like him moving in
for the take down Michael Page,

795
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:11,650
leaping up at him and he's a bony dude,
you know,

796
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,980
he's a tall,
bony dude.

797
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:16,450
So that there's really not a lot of
quarter muscle that's going to hide that

798
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,480
knee and it's all bone on that dude's
head.

799
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,100
Yeah,
that's a nasty.

800
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,490
Nice.
Congrats to that guy.

801
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,470
That's,
that's pretty sick.

802
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,120
That guy's a bad motherfucker.
Want to see that guy in the UFC?

803
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,350
Yeah.
You break dance and shit.

804
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,400
Yeah.
Well he's just,

805
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,480
he was a point karate guy for a long
time and I've always said that there's

806
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:34,720
something about that ability to just
jump in real quick and get the fuck out

807
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,170
of there that these point karate guys
have their range is way different than

808
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,510
like a boxing.
That's kind of interesting that you

809
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,980
mentioned rob,
because if you ever watched Robbie,

810
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,670
he doesn't play the game.
He gets in that boxing range that way if

811
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,230
you throw a kick,
he's throwing hands.

812
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,490
Right.
And you know,

813
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,230
a wonder boy,
you know he,

814
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,300
he's a tall rangy dude,
but he keeps,

815
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,130
they keep that distance.
I mean,

816
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:56,560
you're a karate guy,
so that range is a lot different than a

817
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,880
Moitai or a boxing and,
and they're,

818
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,450
they're able to move really a
skillfully.

819
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,800
Well,
the point karate guys in particular,

820
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,450
I think that's the next stage of the
elite fighters are the,

821
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,600
like the background they come from.
We've seen guys that are successful that

822
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,570
come from Moitai.
We've seen guys that are successful that

823
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:17,000
come from wrestling,
but I think that point karate is going

824
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:22,001
to be the next stage because these guys
like page and Raymond Daniels who fights

825
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:23,730
out of glory days

826
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,010
are Rodriguez and my buddy,
my buddy Justin Lawrence is like that

827
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,670
uncomfortable karate background and he's
just fast and nasty and he keeps that

828
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,040
weird,
weird little Joe Rogan sidekicks or

829
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,870
scoggins who's fighting this weekend.
He's fighting Ian Mccall this weekend.

830
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,943
Always find.

831
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,380
That'd be interesting.
Yeah.

832
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,970
Scoggins is something too,
man.

833
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,700
He's got that crazy style too,
but he's got wrestling as well.

834
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,211
No,
he.

835
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,490
I first seen that guy fight.
He is good.

836
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,710
Good Cardio,
good wrestling.

837
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,550
I think if that guy just shows up with
the right mindset,

838
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,610
he's going to be one of the top guys.
He's a young kid to a young kid.

839
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:59,770
I think he's only 25 or 26 and super
technical like his.

840
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:04,040
His karate especially like he's got that
wide stance moves in and out real quick.

841
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,110
That's what's real hard to deal with men
because these karate style like where

842
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:13,310
they jump in and they're used to like
leaping in and then they tag each other

843
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:15,950
and get the fuck out of there quick and
then they score a point and then

844
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:19,130
everything stops and so they don't have
to have,

845
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,340
like in their sport,
they didn't have to have the kind of

846
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:25,970
endurance that you would need to like
try doing that at a Thai fight.

847
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,950
The ties are going to kick,
your legs are going,

848
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,880
but the thing about it is that these
guys have developed this incredible

849
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,800
ability to close distance really
quickly.

850
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,530
Then they pick up all the other skills
as well,

851
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,550
but everybody else has to play catch up
on that one thing that they can do the

852
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,500
leaping in and close the distance.
Yeah,

853
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,770
and you get a guy like pages.
Obviously a gifted athlete has been

854
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:47,540
doing it his whole life.
I mean,

855
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,940
he started martial arts,
I think something before it was five

856
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:53,730
years old,
so he's got years and years of

857
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,380
experience plus his body kind of
developed like we were talking about

858
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,140
people that started early with
gymnastics or with break dancing.

859
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,420
His body developed,
leaping in,

860
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,800
throwing kicks,
leaping in,

861
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,260
throwing punches.
He's got some sick dance moves,

862
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,640
you know,
so he's always on rhythm.

863
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:08,474
So you can't.

864
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,520
He's always on rhythm.
Yeah.

865
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,051
That,
that,

866
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,190
that's interesting.
That is interesting.

867
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,510
CEO.
I'm excited to see that guy in the

868
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,180
future.
Well,

869
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,420
I'm excited to see a lot of those guys.
Like I said,

870
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,510
Raymond Daniels as well,
who's a,

871
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,460
there's a great karate match where the
two of them,

872
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,190
uh,
fought in a point karate match,

873
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,230
but he took a look at him here.
Watch what page can do like that.

874
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,690
But he's,
he's hilarious too.

875
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:35,450
He just stands there and looks off in
the distance as the referee stopped the

876
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,810
fight.
He's obviously until he fought cyborg.

877
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,620
He's fighting people that have really no
business being in there with A.

878
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,060
Yeah,
he's on the Cyborg.

879
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,380
Took him down though in that first round
and presented some real problems,

880
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,940
but look at his distance.
May Look at that.

881
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,230
We were just talking about that,
but look at his ability to fucking leap

882
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:56,690
in,
but as also his ability to get the fuck

883
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:57,800
out of the way,
look at that.

884
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,520
It tax off of his back to.
He even won by foot lock.

885
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,470
This motherfucker's got arm bars.
I just mean that a style of a Roy Jones

886
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,050
used to have.
I mean he would just do that weird.

887
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,800
Let me just real athletic.
Exactly where Roy Jones was one of the

888
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,250
greatest boxers of all time and didn't
really use it.

889
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:20,210
Jab instead of used a leaping rep took
straight up leaping left hook.

890
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,360
Well he used the left Hook in place of
the Jab,

891
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,470
but you look like pages got crazy shit
like that right there.

892
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,920
His ability to close the distance and
look how quickly it gets out of dodge.

893
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,110
He's just so used to that style of
people leaping at him and getting out of

894
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,650
the way.
We'll do that one too.

895
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,300
Nasty.
Yeah.

896
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:40,170
Um,
I mean,

897
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,390
part of me likes the fact that he's in
beltour because I think Bella needs

898
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,610
stars because I think UFC needs
competition and I,

899
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,090
I liked Scott Coker,
I liked Bella tour,

900
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,430
I liked Jimmy Smith,
I liked the fact that they're doing well

901
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,190
and I would like to see like real
legitimate.

902
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,580
I'd like to see a real legit,
legitimate unification fight,

903
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,900
you know?
Yeah.

904
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,670
Start competing as teams.
That'd be,

905
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:03,530
that'd be sick.
Yeah.

906
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,620
What are you,
uh,

907
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,530
are you ever thinking about getting into
UFC anytime soon or?

908
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,930
Well,
I was not going to announce this until

909
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,780
assigned,
but I signed for at least one more year

910
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,230
is when I decided to do was um,
I was on the fence man.

911
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,690
So I just do too much shit.
That dude,

912
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,300
I'm too fucking busy.
After awhile I'm like,

913
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,210
I don't know if I'm doing myself or
anything.

914
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm all the different things.
I do a disservice and I was real close.

915
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,300
I was like,
either I'm just going to completely bail

916
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,520
off of this or I'm going to try to
figure it out.

917
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,210
So I had a conversation with Dana.
We had a bunch of conversations and what

918
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,280
I decided to do was,
um,

919
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,670
no more international travel,
no more flying across the planet.

920
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,800
I just let Brian Take care of that for
Brian is fucking awesome.

921
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,470
I'm a big fan.
He's a good dude.

922
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,380
And as is,
uh,

923
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,320
Dan Hardee,
he's fucking awesome.

924
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:51,660
And Kenny,
I think those guys do a great job,

925
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,480
but for me personally,
it's just there's too much.

926
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,410
Like if I go to Brazil,
that's five days out of my life that I

927
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:00,720
can't do this and I can't do all the
other stuff that I do.

928
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,940
And then on top of that there's the
recovery time.

929
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,150
Like when I come back I'm fucking toast.
No,

930
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:08,130
I get it.
That fine just fucks my head.

931
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,460
So I decided to only do per view.
No more fox.

932
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,790
Um,
so I'm cutting down a lot of the events

933
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm doing at least a year,
so it's like a year by year thing.

934
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,760
But uh,
at least one more year.

935
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,490
You got a lot of fan support and you do,
but you know,

936
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,011
you,
you,

937
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,140
you probably want to start enjoying life
a little bit and cut,

938
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,780
cutting down eventually know and just
relaxing and enjoying life a little bit.

939
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,311
I bet.
Well,

940
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,390
you know,
what made me,

941
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,190
um,
tip the other way,

942
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,590
I was like,
I was like real convinced that it was

943
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:35,130
over.
I'm like,

944
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,540
I just,
I'm just going to be a fan.

945
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,180
I'll just do fight companions.
The Nate Diaz,

946
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:43,830
conor mcgregor fight and Holly Holm,
Miesha tate fight that night was so

947
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,960
crazy and so chaotic.
I walked out of there go,

948
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,050
how could I not do this?
How could I not be like I'm sitting

949
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,730
right there cage side for the craziest
shit in the sporting world ever.

950
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,660
Yeah.
So,

951
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,950
uh,
I decided,

952
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:57,630
uh,
it was real recent man.

953
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,680
It was touch and go,
man,

954
00:37:58,681 --> 00:37:59,850
I just didn't know what I was going to
do.

955
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,940
I was one day,
I'm like,

956
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,390
I'm done.
And the next day I'm like,

957
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,710
ah,
I don't know.

958
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,120
So I think the compromise is do less
events figured out,

959
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,790
but I don't,
I don't want anybody to think that I

960
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,450
don't appreciate it or I don't know how
lucky I am or I don't think it's an

961
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,260
amazing job.

962
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,210
I definitely do,
but I'm just,

963
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,460
I'm almost too lucky.
I have too many amazing jobs on the road

964
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,240
for you.
That's a lot of travel and just a lot of

965
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,200
travel,
lot of traveling,

966
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,910
a lot,
a lot of events and shit.

967
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,600
You done seen it all.
But one year was like 23 events.

968
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,720
I was like that's crazy.
That's like every other week and they're

969
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,420
gonna get more and more and more.
UFC is this getting freaking insane,

970
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,210
you know?
Then the big business deal and a lot of

971
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,190
lot of Shit's going down.
Even with the steroids.

972
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:43,820
Mark Hans going crazy.
You know,

973
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,140
someone needs to talk to mark man and
give him a call.

974
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:47,951
Dana.
Yeah.

975
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:52,180
I feel like someone should have talked
to mark immediately and sued that out

976
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:53,014
with him.
But.

977
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,420
But here's what I can tell mark.
If mark is listening,

978
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,020
they tested the shit out of Brock Lesnar
and they didn't know.

979
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,840
They didn't know.
The only way they would have known is if

980
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,820
you told them,
so you saw tested him.

981
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:08,830
He tested clean for a bunch of them and
then he tested positive for the one that

982
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:14,170
was like I think three weeks out of the
fight and then there was the other one

983
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:19,171
that he tested for post fight,
so I don't know what was going on.

984
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,670
I don't.
I mean it's just speculation,

985
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,240
but it could have been that he was just
really struggling and camp and his a

986
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,700
slick.
Here's what he took or allegedly.

987
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:35,380
Right.
He took estrogen blockers and the only

988
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:40,381
reason that anybody takes estrogen
blocker on purpose is to restart their

989
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,330
testosterone after they do a steroid
cycle.

990
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,480
That's why you take it when you take it
on purpose or unless you have some sort

991
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,760
of a biological disorder,
I would imagine,

992
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:55,210
where you have some sort of an excess of
estrogen in your body,

993
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,770
which I don't know why you would have
that.

994
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't.
I'm not a doctor.

995
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,970
If I need to tell you that,
but I'm not a doctor.

996
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,870
I'm not a doctor,
allegedly.

997
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,140
I'm not a doctor,
so I don't know what the fuck was going

998
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:05,890
on,
man.

999
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,970
With Broccoli.
Who knows?

1000
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,960
Maybe brock was like,
look,

1001
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,450
I'm one and done in this bitch.
Yeah,

1002
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,470
just gonna.
Just gonna make some fucking money.

1003
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,383
How much?
How many?

1004
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,060
How many weeks do they need to test me?
Okay,

1005
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,770
so we're inside the window.
Fuck it.

1006
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,750
If we test positive after the fight,
we test positive.

1007
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,010
Like who knows,
you knows,

1008
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,380
you know,
but that's the third time that's

1009
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,830
happened to Mark Hunt doing,
you know,

1010
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,530
and he's talking about this fighters'
union,

1011
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:30,870
which makes things very interesting bro.
Well the problem with the fighters union

1012
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:34,360
is fighters have been notoriously single
minded in.

1013
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,910
They think about themselves.
It's going to be real hard.

1014
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,980
It's not like baseball players,
you know,

1015
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,970
it's not like you could get.
Let's also with baseball players union

1016
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,430
or football.
It's like you have a team,

1017
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,370
you know,
the UFC is the team,

1018
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,340
you know,
there's not like it's,

1019
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,300
you know,
it's not like they're the elite.

1020
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,253
It's,
it's,

1021
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,780
it's weird.
It's a different thing like boxing is

1022
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:59,110
not going to have a box or a union
because then you're always going to have

1023
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,340
like you have 10 vendors,
boxers make a shit ton of money doing.

1024
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,530
They do make a shit ton of money,
but the people that make a shit ton of

1025
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,620
money or the champions,
you know those,

1026
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,110
the high level people in the high level,
people in mma make the same amount of

1027
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:14,320
money.
The real argument is how much money

1028
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:17,590
should the people that are putting on
the big shows like you,

1029
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,160
the guys who were putting on fucking
incredible exciting fights,

1030
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,440
how much should you make the headline of
card?

1031
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:28,710
I know for me personally for my money,
if I'm watching Jeremy Stevens fight,

1032
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:29,980
conor Mcgregor,
I,

1033
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm getting out my fucking popcorn.
I'm excited.

1034
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:35,450
I'm paying my paper view money for that.
Let's make that happen.

1035
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,770
Let's make that happen.
40th five.

1036
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,570
I think he's going to get whooped by
Diaz.

1037
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,800
He thinks,
I think sodium.

1038
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,460
Well,
he got whooped the first time,

1039
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,570
but he was doing really well in that
first round.

1040
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,490
I mean,
that first round was a big round for

1041
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:52,070
connor and then he got tired.
Diaz had what,

1042
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:57,071
10 days and he was drinking Tequila,
go 11 days and he was drinking Tequila

1043
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,130
and I respect that,
but I think it's gonna be the same

1044
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,510
seating situation.
I do.

1045
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,830
Well,
there's a good argument there.

1046
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,620
There's a good argument for sure.
Connor's got the one shot,

1047
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:06,961
man.
He's just,

1048
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:09,320
he's just like me.
He's like a rep could mean he's got that

1049
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,970
one shot and put your lights out,
you know,

1050
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:13,550
but he's like you at 1:45.

1051
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,270
Whereas nate,
who has been fighting at 1:55 and one

1052
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:19,850
slash 70,
his whole career is a bigger guy like

1053
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,960
nate.
When I stand next to him,

1054
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:22,160
he's a big guy,
man.

1055
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,300
He's a big.
He's 55 is huge and you can take a shot.

1056
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,240
Takes a fucking.
The only guy to put them out with Josh

1057
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,710
Thompson and I've said time and time
again.

1058
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:33,230
Josh Thompson,
one of the most underrated guys in the

1059
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:34,250
sport.
Josh Thompson.

1060
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,480
The timing just wasn't right for him.
Yup.

1061
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,700
Like school.
Yeah,

1062
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:41,330
he's old school,
but he's fucking good man.

1063
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,120
He was fucking good.
And when he fought nate,

1064
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,040
he was just on his game and he had
kicked him.

1065
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,350
Yeah,
Josh Thompson had kicks anybody.

1066
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,640
He's finishing up,
you know what I mean?

1067
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,750
No,
he's an athletic dude,

1068
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,440
man.
That guy has been around a thing before

1069
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,630
the UFC.
He cut out the 55 division,

1070
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,190
you know,
and that's when I was kind of coming up.

1071
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,500
I was like,
I'm going to fight it 70.

1072
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,590
Yeah.
Like fuck it,

1073
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,290
I want to be in UFC.
I guess I got to go up to one 70.

1074
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,030
So I was taking fights at like 65.
We'll explain.

1075
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,890
People know what you're saying.
Is the UFC didn't have a 1:55 division

1076
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:10,671
for a while?
Yeah,

1077
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,080
they could.
They got rid of it.

1078
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,330
Well this is,
you know,

1079
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,430
a lot of people don't realize when they
see the sport now and it's gigantic.

1080
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,430
It's huge.
When you were first fighting and

1081
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,620
competing man,
it was.

1082
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:23,600
You had to really love what you're
doing.

1083
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,760
It wasn't like there was some Ronda
Rousey,

1084
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,890
conor mcgregor pay days that people were
getting,

1085
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,810
you know,
when you hear about the paydays these

1086
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:31,760
people are getting now,
like John Jones,

1087
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:35,840
his manager was saying that John missed
out on at least $10,000,000 for his

1088
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:40,841
fight with Daniel Cormier and then Jon
Anik was saying that over the two years

1089
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:45,710
it's probably going to cost him as much
as 30 to $40 million when you factor in

1090
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:47,990
all the super fights he could have had
in two years,

1091
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,690
which is just fucking crazy.

1092
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,220
Yeah,
dude,

1093
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,010
he's one of the pound for pound best
manager.

1094
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:56,900
So he's his own worst enemy I guess.
Well for him it's another weird one.

1095
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,300
So that was an estrogen blocker thing,
but a doctor,

1096
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,100
but I'm not cycling off it.
People cycling body changed to it,

1097
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:06,651
you know,
and that,

1098
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:07,640
that's,
that's kind of crazy.

1099
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:09,400
He got,
he got real big and he was like into

1100
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,480
lifting a lot.
And then lifters,

1101
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,190
man,
those guys love that stuff so.

1102
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,980
Well,
the lifters to the problem is you get

1103
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,660
some bro Science,
you know,

1104
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:19,100
you get some dudes in the gym,
Bro.

1105
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,580
I'm telling you bro,
you cannot test positive broke because

1106
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,210
what you're gonna do,
you're going to drink three gallons of

1107
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:25,970
cat piss and you're going to go in there
like three gallons.

1108
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:26,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1109
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,530
Do do it to be a champion to champion.
Like they'll tell you some wacky shit.

1110
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:31,980
This guy was telling that if he

1111
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,800
was trying to tell me that all these UFC
guys,

1112
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:35,880
man,
they're tested positive.

1113
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,590
I know how to get them off that man.
I go,

1114
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,453
no,
you don't.

1115
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,220
You don't date.
You saw Lance Armstrong,

1116
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,050
one of the,
one of the richest guys.

1117
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,600
You'd always given speeches and high
five and the president.

1118
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,560
If that guy can't be Jeff Novitsky,
I don't think anybody,

1119
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,553
you know,
I mean.

1120
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,290
Well,
here's the thing about Lance Armstrong

1121
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,130
never tested positive.
You have to realize that Lance Armstrong

1122
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,410
never tested positive.
He had just stayed,

1123
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:00,040
never caught him.
He admitted guilt.

1124
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,193
Admitted.
Yeah.

1125
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,030
Yeah.
He had admitted,

1126
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,010
but they know the walls are closing in.
All these people were suing them.

1127
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:07,440
He was suing people.
There's a lot of chaos going on.

1128
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,480
He just wanted to go and clean.
There's no,

1129
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,110
there's no drug tests that show that
Lance Armstrong was doing anything.

1130
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah,
he was definitely doing some shit

1131
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,840
though,
which is really kind of crazy.

1132
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,180
I don't get why people want to go ride a
bike for that long.

1133
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,540
And I mean honestly,
you know,

1134
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,260
since you saw it as kind of came in,
I've done a lot of cardio and stuff,

1135
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,580
but I'm like,
you know,

1136
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:29,820
I've ran up to a,
like a little bit over two hours or

1137
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,190
around two hours and uh,
you know,

1138
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,200
I don't want to go ride a bike for
fucking seven,

1139
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,660
eight hours and get up again.
And I'm like,

1140
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,410
fuck that.
I'm going to,

1141
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm going to do some epo just so I can
just go out and just get it for $70

1142
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,440
million.
It's a child's fucking method of

1143
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,780
transportation.
Do some porn bro.

1144
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,710
Just go kill it for seven,
eight hours.

1145
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,480
Like why are you going to.
I mean,

1146
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,870
that's just nuts.
I don't.

1147
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,730
But to each their own,
I'm.

1148
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,550
Look what it is is a mental toughness
thing.

1149
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,500
It's like their ideas,
like they're going to keep grinding it

1150
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:57,000
out.
One other people are going to slowly

1151
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,950
back off and fade and going to keep
going.

1152
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,380
Nope.
That's the true break through break.

1153
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,890
That's what I find in running and doing
these long runs and stuff throughout

1154
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:07,490
camp.
That's a sets a different pace and that

1155
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,620
that is right.
The mental edge that you have from

1156
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:13,530
running and you're just like,
it's insane.

1157
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,550
You almost got to be a madman,
but you only know that when you actually

1158
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:21,190
complete that type of a long run and you
endure that type of thing,

1159
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,790
other everybody else can kind of look
back at me and you're crazy.

1160
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,670
Like we don't do that,
but you are kind of crazy in your head

1161
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:27,481
and you're like,
yeah,

1162
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,380
fuck yeah,
I am crazy.

1163
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:29,160
I did do that.
Well,

1164
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,320
you know what?
Put you on another level.

1165
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,570
It's one of those things where you just
constantly try to find your limit.

1166
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,490
Like,
I'm going to hold my breath for a

1167
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:35,790
minute.
Hmm,

1168
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,290
I did it.
Let me see if I can do two minutes.

1169
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,124
I did it.
Okay,

1170
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,090
what's the world record?
And then you start trying for whatever

1171
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,210
the fuck the world record is.
And like I have my buddy campaigns,

1172
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:48,810
he does a ultra marathons.
He's done 100 miles and now he's doing

1173
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:52,260
200 miles in August.
He did a 100 miles last month to get

1174
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,920
ready for 200 miles next month.
Damned like what?

1175
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,360
That's intense.
Two days,

1176
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,060
two days of running.
That's crazy bitch retarded,

1177
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,410
right?
Yeah,

1178
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,020
he's retarded.
But I bet that guy's probably cool to

1179
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,770
hang out while he's the fact that I bet
he's just a wild madman,

1180
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,980
you know,
when you go hang out with them and

1181
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,960
probably hear some of his ideas and his
beliefs.

1182
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,510
Well he's just mentally.
It's tough as it gets.

1183
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,670
And he's just trying to find his limits,
you know,

1184
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:18,150
he's always trying to find his limits
and he can't find his limits at 100

1185
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,700
miles,
which is fucking bananas.

1186
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,860
That's all trying.
How does,

1187
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,280
how does he.
Forty eight,

1188
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,720
48,
48,

1189
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,070
Leo,
you know what they say?

1190
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,110
They say that,
um,

1191
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,010
those marathon or ultra marathon,
like a lot

1192
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,010
of them are older because it's not,
it's not something that young guys excel

1193
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:36,760
at,
like you're not going to find like a 20

1194
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,280
year old athlete.
It's really good at running 100 miles.

1195
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,570
It's dudes that have been divorced and
had their heart broken and went

1196
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:44,404
bankrupt,

1197
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,040
came home and the girlfriend was fucking
their best friend that I've been there

1198
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,410
in high school.
Bad guys have that extra gear.

1199
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,780
Those guys that are,
that are 30,

1200
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,940
30 years old and they're there,
they're crying.

1201
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,461
It's like,
Bro,

1202
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,840
get over it dude.
It's all right man.

1203
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,610
If she's,
if she wants to go,

1204
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,970
she's going to go and bang,
you know,

1205
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:05,500
30 black guys or she wants to do.
So that'd be black guys always.

1206
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,660
Whenever I remember his word it.
Did he see him crying?

1207
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,000
I mean,
I went to that in high school,

1208
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:10,391
man.
I was like,

1209
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:11,171
all right,
that's enough of that,

1210
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,460
you know,
at a young.

1211
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:15,880
I'm glad I did because some people
mentally they just don't get it.

1212
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,520
And then when they get a little bit
older and they go through it,

1213
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,400
they're just like,
whoa,

1214
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,240
whole life just changed.
You got to learn how to get your

1215
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:25,030
heartbroken recover.
Like if you don't get your heart broke,

1216
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,970
you'll never understand what it's like
to get your heartbroken.

1217
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,250
Like it's,
it's a really important thing.

1218
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,470
Like when it's happening,
you feel like the world's over.

1219
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,990
Then you
looking back,

1220
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,930
it's hilarious.
Like I look back on some heartbreaks

1221
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,490
that I had when I was 19.
I'm like,

1222
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,940
yeah,
I think it's funny now that I was being

1223
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:47,470
such a bitch,
you know,

1224
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:51,380
that I was crying a writer,
a like a load back note.

1225
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,230
I remember that man.
Of course,

1226
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,600
every guys,
every girl to the money and you look

1227
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:05,980
back at it,
but do it when you're going through it,

1228
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:06,491
man,
you're like,

1229
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,870
fuck,
I need to just shoot myself.

1230
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,360
I fucking can't stand this dude.
Like,

1231
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,210
speaking of shoot myself.
Did you see that video?

1232
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:16,780
That fucking rapper that shot himself in
the mouth around video.

1233
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,250
See that stupid asshole.
This guy made a video of him.

1234
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:26,251
He put like a gun next to his cheek and
shot a hole through his face on camera.

1235
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,110
I think he's going to get more hits now.
Yeah,

1236
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:32,230
because you got shot.
He was saying he doesn't give a fuck.

1237
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,740
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck what policy it.

1238
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,910
Watch this guy.
Yeah,

1239
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,980
go ahead.
Play it.

1240
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,590
Does that a starter pistol or was that a
bullet?

1241
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,810
Because here's the thing.
He's in his car.

1242
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,370
This is one thing that leads me to think
that this is a starter pistol because

1243
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:50,350
he's in his car.
Right.

1244
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,200
So where's that bullet going,
man.

1245
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,530
Straight through his mouth.
Yeah,

1246
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,120
but he doesn't hold it at the end of the
video.

1247
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,820
Did he though didn't go through his
other cheek?

1248
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,620
Did he though?
Let's watch.

1249
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,670
What's his name?
Casper night.

1250
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,780
Is that his name is dummy.

1251
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,250
Fuck.
I don't give a fuck about nothing in

1252
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,400
gangster.
I the Holy Shit.

1253
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,830
I didn't swallow anything.
We didn't go.

1254
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,430
He didn't swallow running.
We need to go

1255
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,700
whatever bucket.
If I die,

1256
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:49,180
fuck it.
You're not going to die from that pussy.

1257
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,730
Huh?
What is this Guy Thinking?

1258
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,050
People?
People do this stuff nowadays and it's

1259
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:02,051
just really kind of discussing where
does this guy's parents at home doing

1260
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,680
math?
Seriously,

1261
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,880
man,
I the fucking bullshit.

1262
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,980
You just shot yourself video.

1263
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,350
See,
it's possible that that was a 22.

1264
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,080
It was a very small gun obviously
because the sounds like it was a very,

1265
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,510
very low low volume sound.
So I think that was probably like if

1266
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:30,300
anything it was a 22 and if he did
swallow the bullet,

1267
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,350
I mean maybe I guess maybe it doesn't
make sense that looked like it came out

1268
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:37,950
the other side disturbing to watch.
It's not really that you just shot

1269
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:39,690
himself something,
but just his attitude,

1270
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,820
what is wrong with you man?
Not,

1271
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,150
not good,
not good.

1272
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:49,410
That's not a goal in individual with.
The crazy thing is that guy might get

1273
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:53,970
like success for that.
Like he made some posts about it where

1274
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:56,250
he was like,
y'all got played or something like that.

1275
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:57,760
Like what?
Okay.

1276
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,430
You see the post that he wrote,
he's got a whole post after it.

1277
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,500
A doctor stitched him up.

1278
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,790
A doctor's like,
I'm okay,

1279
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,380
know disturbed well,
you could take a starter pistol by the

1280
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,240
way and it will blow a hole through your
mouth.

1281
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,010
There's a guy who,
uh,

1282
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:22,380
was an actor when I was on this TV show.
His friend was on the TV show with me

1283
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:28,550
and the guy had died.
He was playing around with a blank and

1284
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:31,380
you know,
he had a like for a movie and he put the

1285
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:35,250
thing up to his head and didn't realize
that the amount of force that comes out,

1286
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:38,040
just the air a fractured his skull and
killed him.

1287
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,990
Oh yeah.
From a blank.

1288
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,550
Brandon lead die like that.
Right?

1289
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:44,490
Like Brandon Lee died because it wasn't
a blank.

1290
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,990
There was some sort of a particle that
was inside the blank and it shot him in

1291
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:52,860
the chest.
And the conspiracy theory buckle up

1292
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,730
black helicopters that the conspiracy
theory is the same people that killed

1293
00:52:56,731 --> 00:52:59,850
Bruce Lee wanted to kill brandon Lee
because brute,

1294
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,700
like this is Joey Diaz believed.
What does the dog.

1295
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:05,160
I'm telling you,
you don't get away with those fucking

1296
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:08,100
Chinese triads.
You can't dodge that bullet.

1297
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,180
Because he was telling me that
he was like,

1298
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:14,310
exactly this voice,
this motherfucker,

1299
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,960
he was,
he was saying that um,

1300
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,440
that Bruce Lee had some sort of a deal
to do movies for the Chinese triad and

1301
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:26,040
he was doing all these movies for them
and then left to come America to

1302
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,890
be a big time movie star.
And when he came over to America to be a

1303
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:32,430
big time movie star,
he fuck those people that he had this

1304
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:33,300
deal with.
They were like,

1305
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,640
Oh really?
And then they came and got him.

1306
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,410
But man,
dude,

1307
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,620
I honestly do that growing up,
you know,

1308
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,070
not being racist or anything.
But I've had a lot of late,

1309
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,820
no Asian friends and stuff man.
And they do,

1310
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,030
they get violent and they get into like
wolf packs quick.

1311
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,470
I've seen.
Oh yeah,

1312
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:53,370
I did security one time man.
And I seen like two dudes fighting and

1313
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:56,740
then it turned into the whole Asian
community just throwing bottles,

1314
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,810
shooting out in the parking lot,
you know,

1315
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,660
just a throwing cueball's chairs,
more bottles in disguise this laying

1316
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,680
down like fetus position.
And I've seen him just do a lot.

1317
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,190
I mean,
they stick together and I seen a guy

1318
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,950
actually stabbed some dude and then get
this.

1319
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,690
This guy comes out and he's like,
he's like,

1320
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,880
I just got stabbed and he's come up to
this police officer.

1321
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,890
Police officer pulls out his gun and
he's like,

1322
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:17,790
get on the ground.
He's like,

1323
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,750
Bro,
I just got stabbed.

1324
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:19,770
He's like,
get on the ground.

1325
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,290
And the guy's like squirting blood out
his back and then like,

1326
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,540
like 50 Honda civics and accurate as
Bra,

1327
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,230
just all taken off.
And the guy was like laying on the

1328
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,390
ground telling them to get on the
ground.

1329
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,560
I Dunno man.
De Moines,

1330
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,590
Iowa.
I saw a fucking video yesterday of a

1331
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:39,020
cop.
They just gave this kid like $180,000 a

1332
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,000
cop hit him.
He's on his motorcycle.

1333
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,330
The kids stopped at a light.
The cop hits him from behind.

1334
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,970
Okay.
That he falls over,

1335
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:50,880
get the cop,
gets out of the car with his gun,

1336
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:55,590
drawn the kids like what the fuck?
The cop kicks him in the chest and

1337
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:59,100
breaks his collarbone and then tells
them to get on his knees and the kid

1338
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:02,100
gets on his knees.
All captured on fucking video.

1339
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:03,090
In what?
What was the.

1340
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,860
What was the cause of him getting pulled
over?

1341
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,850
Nothing.
There was no,

1342
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:09,120
cause he's the only boy.
He was on a motorcycle.

1343
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:09,901
Watch this shit.
No,

1344
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:13,260
this isn't it is it?
It goes way ahead.

1345
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,020
Oh,
that's what you sure.

1346
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,630
This is the same one because the other
one was at an intersection.

1347
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:22,710
Jamie.
Oh,

1348
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:26,190
this guy seems like he's flying.
Are you sure it's the same video?

1349
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,630
Yep.
Well that's the case.

1350
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:29,550
And this kid,
it was a speeding thing.

1351
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,910
Oh there.
Oh,

1352
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,290
okay.
Well that changes everything.

1353
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:34,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

1354
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,870
So they,
they bumped him on purpose.

1355
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,910
Okay.
Let's see how this goes down.

1356
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,250
Well,
I'm changing my folk tune right here

1357
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,530
that said this was speeding
motorcyclist.

1358
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,970
Gee,
he's not stopping.

1359
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,830
Oh,
they fucking hit him on purpose.

1360
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,190
Oh,
oh yeah.

1361
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,223
Oh,
okay.

1362
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,740
This is different.
This is falling off your little bike.

1363
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,150
Yeah,
it's a bump.

1364
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,410
So Watch.
He's like,

1365
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,340
Whoa,
we'll do.

1366
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,400
Oh,
a little front kick,

1367
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,550
a little 300 fat.
So gay karate kid.

1368
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,600
That was a terrible thing.
He's holding the gun gangster to right

1369
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,440
here.
He's slept too many fucking boys in the

1370
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:11,970
hood movies.
Hey,

1371
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:12,750
you know what,
man,

1372
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,930
that changed my tune.
People need to just shut their mouth

1373
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:18,340
when it comes to the authority,
you know,

1374
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,030
and I think of these other countries.
I'm like,

1375
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,740
other countries don't do that because
they will sever your head off if you're

1376
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:24,160
filming

1377
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,360
them,
they're going to cut your head,

1378
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,710
you know,
people come here and they're like,

1379
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,720
they get in this mix.
The cops trying to like,

1380
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:29,271
hey,
you know,

1381
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:30,960
like you're coming with us and then
they're like,

1382
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,380
people recording and then they don't
listen and the cop has to use force,

1383
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,223
you know,
and they're just.

1384
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,080
People just don't really respect her.
Granted,

1385
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,210
there is other sides.
But did,

1386
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,840
did see the guy in Florida that got shot
while he was lying down with his hands

1387
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,320
up talking to.
He was a therapist and he's totally

1388
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,200
unarmed lying on his back and the cop
shot him and then he's like,

1389
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,130
why'd you shoot me?
He's like,

1390
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:52,880
I don't know,
like,

1391
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,870
and then the cop changed his story.
The cop completely changed the story

1392
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,670
after it was over,
you know,

1393
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:59,380
look,
there's good and bad,

1394
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:01,570
but I didn't see the full video of this.

1395
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,770
I only saw the end.
Which really makes you think like when

1396
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:07,640
you,
you see a lot of these interactions that

1397
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:10,360
people have with cops.
Like what led the cop to be so fucking

1398
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,820
ramped up?
Well here now you understand that guy

1399
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:17,821
was risking all sorts of people's lives
lives by riding that motorcycle,

1400
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:21,100
like a fucking maniac.
And then the cop got ahold of him.

1401
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,830
He bumped him to knock him off the bike,
but that kid was fine,

1402
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,520
but that kid got $180,000 for that
breaking the law.

1403
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:30,880
He gets 180 grand for a weak ass bitch
front kick.

1404
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,290
Terrible front kick too,
right?

1405
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,124
Yeah,
yeah.

1406
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,770
He had a glock though the gangster
glock,

1407
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:36,790
you know,
but you know,

1408
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,601
some,
some people,

1409
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,910
you know,
the cops that,

1410
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:41,410
you know,
not all of them because I have uncles

1411
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:42,790
that are cops.
They're great people,

1412
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,040
but they're just like us.
You know.

1413
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:48,340
And it makes them no different and some
people I feel like they get a little

1414
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:49,600
power power trip

1415
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,140
100 percent times.
Been polite to cops and I've been

1416
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,020
treated very rudely,
you know,

1417
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,490
and then there's times where I've been
polite and they've been applied or they

1418
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,730
let me off on like a speeding ticket.
I was speeding,

1419
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,690
you know,
but there's times where I've seen cops

1420
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,500
just look like maybe they got bullied in
high school and they take advantage.

1421
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:07,920
But I mean that's just human nature.
What do you want?

1422
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,370
It was in an unmarked Camaro that looks
like this.

1423
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,140
And he didn't have a siren outside.
They only had his lights on.

1424
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,960
He didn't even know he was being chased.
Oh,

1425
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,920
well that's nice.
That's what the motorcycle.

1426
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:22,520
I said,
well that makes sort of sense more.

1427
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,810
Send a video of him in and out.
I don't know.

1428
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,550
Got One hundred 80 grand.
He's lucky.

1429
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,920
Yeah.
He's still driving a Douche bag.

1430
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:33,330
I mean if you want to drive like that,
go on a fucking raceway man.

1431
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,840
You can take that bike on a race way.
You're not supposed to cut in and out of

1432
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:40,320
traffic the way he was doing,
going ridiculously excessive speeds.

1433
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,140
The video,
like when he's cutting off cars and

1434
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:44,040
stuff like that.
That's,

1435
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,770
that's how people die and not
necessarily you.

1436
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,930
That happens here in la all the time.
I was driving down here from San Diego

1437
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:52,060
and I mean I do that all the time at
those bikers,

1438
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:52,391
man,
they,

1439
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:54,640
they zone in and out and I don't hear
him come behind me because they're

1440
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:58,360
flying and I'm in between traffic and
they combine almost like scraped your

1441
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:00,370
mirrors and then they're getting mad at
you and you're like,

1442
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,181
Bro,
I don't see.

1443
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:03,130
You know,
I got a little bit of music plan.

1444
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:05,060
It's not like real loud,
but it's like I can't hear you into

1445
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,100
like,
you're right there.

1446
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,140
That's why it's sometimes just to
release those.

1447
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:08,870
Harley Davidson's

1448
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,280
are so loud,
like there's a.

1449
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,890
I saw a bumper sticker that said loud
pipes save lives.

1450
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,170
They really do.
It makes a big difference.

1451
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,560
Make sense that they have those,
those loud pipes like that.

1452
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:19,760
But,
you know,

1453
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:24,140
I think that cops are just like you and
me and one of the things that I think we

1454
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:27,380
should all take into consideration is
the amount of people that they deal with

1455
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:30,980
on a daily basis that are criminals that
are violent,

1456
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,950
that are dangerous,
that there's just so much shit they have

1457
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:36,560
to deal with.
I just don't think most people are

1458
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:40,550
qualified for that job.
I think that job should be for people

1459
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:43,970
that are like ex military that are solid
as a fucking rock,

1460
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:47,480
I think it should be super high paying
and it should be a really well respected

1461
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,220
job.
And I think those people should be like

1462
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,340
integrated in whatever community that
they're enforcing.

1463
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,411
Yeah.
Uh,

1464
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:54,840
you know,
I was actually telling this,

1465
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,960
I don't even know if I told my coach
today,

1466
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:56,821
but I was thinking,
I was like,

1467
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:58,940
man,
I want to go and help out the cops in a

1468
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,130
little bit of like candy,
like combat and go in and help them out.

1469
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,150
Because I mean,
a lot of people don't know.

1470
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:05,900
I mean,
if you come up to me and I'm not

1471
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,650
thinking anything,
but I can just quickly pull out a gun

1472
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:10,080
and shoot you and sometimes those cops
don't know,

1473
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:11,280
you know,
and they're trying to be nice and then

1474
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:14,430
they get killed on the spot or you know,
they may not know and they killed them

1475
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:16,350
and maybe it wasn't a gun,
but I mean,

1476
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:19,980
that's a quick little within,
you have to make a huge decision and

1477
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:23,280
just such a matter of seconds,
it's going to be me going home and,

1478
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,080
you know,
not just like a fight,

1479
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:25,470
you know what I'm saying?

1480
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,000
Hey man,
it's going to be me going home in the

1481
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,210
winter and feed my family as compared to
you,

1482
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:29,561
you know,
that's,

1483
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:31,830
that's life or death situation.
So it's,

1484
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,020
it's definitely scary.
I feel like they definitely need a

1485
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:36,960
little bit better education on the
training and uh,

1486
01:00:36,961 --> 01:00:38,730
you know,
if anybody in San Diego is listening to

1487
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:39,750
this or any police,
you know,

1488
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:40,860
I'd love to come help,
you know,

1489
01:00:40,861 --> 01:00:42,390
I'm sure like dominick Cruz and the
guys,

1490
01:00:42,391 --> 01:00:44,280
we'd love to come help and uh,
you know,

1491
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:47,490
and have you guys come into the gym and
just keep the community safe,

1492
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,673
crazy

1493
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,280
be mandatory.
The cops have at least some sort of

1494
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,350
martial arts training because uh,
you know,

1495
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:57,580
I was talking to big John Mccarthy about
this where he was telling me how few

1496
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:00,490
police officers can even physically
defend themselves.

1497
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:03,040
He's like,
there's a lot of guys that just don't,

1498
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:06,130
they don't know anything and they don't
work out at all overweight.

1499
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:06,710
Yeah.
And if,

1500
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,460
if shit goes down,
like they're helpless.

1501
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,920
And these are the supposed to be the
people that are supposed to serve and

1502
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:12,754
protect.
Yep.

1503
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,890
Know.
And John obviously he's a giant Dude and

1504
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:18,630
plus a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu
and been around martial arts alive.

1505
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,600
But you know,
when you're dealing with someone who is

1506
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:25,800
a explosive,
dangerous person that might be a felon

1507
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,250
their whole life and you're someone who
has no experience at all in any kind of

1508
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,710
hand to hand combat situation,
you're,

1509
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,700
you're in a bad spot.

1510
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,080
Yeah.
You know,

1511
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,410
a lot of them don't know.
And I've even been in a,

1512
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,160
like a training with the army and
military and wounded warriors praying.

1513
01:01:42,161 --> 01:01:44,760
I mean I've trained a lot of people in,
a lot of people don't even know the

1514
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:47,730
basis of just hand fighting in
Bellingham fighting is very important.

1515
01:01:47,731 --> 01:01:49,860
Especially if someone's holding a gun,
you know,

1516
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:51,990
they don't even know that chokes.
And it's like,

1517
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:52,890
wow,
that's crazy.

1518
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,270
They don't know basic stuff,
you know?

1519
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,040
Yeah.
Because what if they ran into a guy like

1520
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:57,020
me out there,
you know,

1521
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:59,670
like one of those villains,
like the guy from Morocco who robbed a

1522
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:00,830
bank,
you know,

1523
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,590
it was just like a legit criminal.
I mean,

1524
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,800
which some are wholly Marie.
Yeah.

1525
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:06,720
Lee Marie,
you know that you run into that guy and

1526
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:07,750
he's like,
he's like being all cool,

1527
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,270
boom.
All of a sudden he's like trying to snap

1528
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:10,081
your neck.
Well,

1529
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:13,050
that guy was crazy because he was super
skilled,

1530
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:18,320
but a fucking legit gangster.
Criminal criminal pulled off,

1531
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:19,830
uh,
the biggest,

1532
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:20,370
80 million

1533
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,250
armed heist in European history.
Right.

1534
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,470
Never found a single dollar.
Is that true?

1535
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,360
Yeah.
They never found the money.

1536
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,950
Never found the money.
Oh my God.

1537
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,170
Who's got the money lead Murray,
who's really.

1538
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,110
Well,
he's in jail now,

1539
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:35,040
right?
But Rocco.

1540
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,530
Yeah.
Pat Miletich shut and hold a training

1541
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:39,090
coach of mine.
He keeps in touch with them.

1542
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:41,010
Was like a pen pal.
I don't know if he still does or not,

1543
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,450
but a dearly dearly.
I was watching pat today.

1544
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,830
I was watching him.
He was,

1545
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,350
um,
I watched lion fight.

1546
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:51,390
I'm a big Fan of lion fight.
He was doing commentary for lion fight.

1547
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,640
You.
Pat was saying that he was about to do

1548
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,370
100 mile run and I was asking him.
I was going to mention that.

1549
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:56,601
Yeah,
yeah.

1550
01:02:56,601 --> 01:03:00,060
I seen him on facebook.
I follow them and I guess he put out

1551
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:00,930
like this,
like little lists,

1552
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:03,690
like he's going to do like do a four
mile,

1553
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,200
10 mile and then he's basically like
building up like 15,

1554
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,910
20 miles that he's going to do 100 mile
run.

1555
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,780
But like,
you just do that slowly just by building

1556
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:13,440
like a little base and getting himself
ready for that.

1557
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,870
But that's a.
Why was he doing that?

1558
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,630
I don't know.
He's,

1559
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,670
he's getting older.
I'm just fucking with divorce or I don't

1560
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,504
know,
man.

1561
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,510
You never know.
Maybe it's just looking for a new

1562
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:25,344
challenge.
Yeah.

1563
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,370
Retired from fighting,
you know,

1564
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,510
I mean,
uh,

1565
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:30,060
I seen Don Frye recently just get
knocked out recently,

1566
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:32,520
but you know,
I mean I feel like yeah,

1567
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:35,190
he got knocked out by one of A.
was it dog?

1568
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:38,460
The bounty hunters,
a security guys that was really old.

1569
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:43,080
Video was from a long time ago.
Don Don was really drunk.

1570
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,153
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1571
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,040
And he got into some sort of a fight in
a hotel with some dude seen that,

1572
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,880
I think that was really old.
There's always that dog in you,

1573
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,220
you know,
I mean you've probably been away from

1574
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,790
competition for awhile,
but you still like to grapple and just

1575
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,960
get after it,
like in your gym,

1576
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:58,650
always see you hitting it.

1577
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,930
But I mean just as a man or a
competitor,

1578
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:04,410
you always have that type of.
I mean eventually you gotta let it go

1579
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:05,700
and eventually your time's going to
pass.

1580
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:08,010
But I mean you're always gonna have that
drive and you know,

1581
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,640
running or doing something like that or
swimming is always going to probably

1582
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:13,410
keep that passion,
that drive,

1583
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:15,800
that still in use.
So it's probably good to kind of release

1584
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:17,900
that and go out there.
And I mean definitely.

1585
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,850
I think it's definitely good to push
yourself in some sort of a way because I

1586
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,450
think we're,
a lot of guys were,

1587
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:26,160
it's really a classic story with boxers
especially.

1588
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:30,480
They stopped competing and then they get
into hard drugs and it happened with Joe

1589
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,930
Lewis had happened with um,
a set white guy.

1590
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:37,200
I understood which one fluid done,
knocked him out.

1591
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,060
He was doing cocaine with some hookers.

1592
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,970
You got them on video.
What's his name?

1593
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:42,571
Man,
oh,

1594
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:43,740
Ricky Hatton.
Ricky Hatton.

1595
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,980
Yeah.
I was thinking of um,

1596
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:47,460
goddammit,
the dude who,

1597
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:49,890
uh,
Cassius clay beat Sonny Liston,

1598
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,220
Sonny Liston,
he died of a drug overdose to.

1599
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,850
They didn't know a lot of those guys.
They,

1600
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,600
they stopped fighting and there's also
the,

1601
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,460
the,
the thought of,

1602
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,640
you know,
you have a long career of getting hit in

1603
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:06,720
the head and then you want to self
medicate efforts over like a lot of

1604
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:08,110
these guys,
they have um,

1605
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,920
issues with their,
their,

1606
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,320
their systems,
like the endocrine systems,

1607
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:14,820
they have issues with the pituitary
gland.

1608
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:17,740
A lot of depression comes in and they
start,

1609
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,890
they start trying to fix that without
alcohol or fix that feeling with cocaine

1610
01:05:23,551 --> 01:05:26,020
or prescription and prescription drugs.
Yeah.

1611
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:26,950
Yeah.
Those are the worst.

1612
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,190
What prescription drugs are a real
problem because a lot of guys get

1613
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:31,670
injured and then,
you know,

1614
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,120
they go to a doctor or they got a
problem,

1615
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:37,350
their lumbar or something like that or
trying to imagine the disc.

1616
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1617
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,090
It's dangerous,
man.

1618
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,360
I watched that episode ballers and uh,
the Rock Johnson,

1619
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:45,590
he's always smashing them vicodins and
you know,

1620
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:48,370
those nfl guys talks about that.
You've seen that show.

1621
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,160
It's pretty sick.
Show the rocks man.

1622
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,790
And uh,
you kind of see that and you're like,

1623
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,840
man,
that kind of makes sense that,

1624
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,580
you know,
most likely that they are shooting them

1625
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:57,760
up and get back on the field.
You got to win the game and you know,

1626
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,200
when you're in that moment you're not
thinking about it.

1627
01:05:59,201 --> 01:06:01,120
But then in the longevity,
you know,

1628
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:02,540
like that movie concussion,
you know,

1629
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,180
the one guy from the steelers was going
down the opposite way and then smashed

1630
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:09,020
it into a car.
It was wanting to kill his family and

1631
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,150
just snaps out,
you know?

1632
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,340
And that's just a,
that's just crazy men.

1633
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,331
Well,
you know,

1634
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:15,100
head injuries or no fucking joke man.

1635
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:20,190
And that was one of the things that I'm
brock was talking about with wwe that

1636
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,490
earlier in his career he had issues
where he was,

1637
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:26,530
you know,
those guys are fucking flipping each

1638
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:29,530
other and landing on.
People could say that's fake wrestling

1639
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:30,101
these,
that term,

1640
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:32,860
fake wrestling.
Those fucking flips a real man.

1641
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:35,590
The impact is real.
Those guys getting body slammed,

1642
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,660
that's all that all counts.
Cutting themselves.

1643
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,320
And then,
you know,

1644
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,550
tax like mankind used to do and fallen
off the cages and the tables and then

1645
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,600
those,
uh,

1646
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,440
those metal chairs and they would just
bash them over.

1647
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:47,190
That's real man.
That,

1648
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,340
that's a real.
That's real.

1649
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:48,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1650
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:49,210
That's.
I'm like,

1651
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,043
dude,
that's crazy.

1652
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,660
It is crazy.
And you see that a lot of those guys are

1653
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:56,500
suing the wwe now.
Like Jimmy superfly snooker was wearing

1654
01:06:56,501 --> 01:07:01,180
a suit and going to court and they're
suing the wwe for still around.

1655
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,700
Superfly still around,
I guess probably got some head injuries.

1656
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,580
Didn't use to jump off the rope and like
the head.

1657
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:06,760
But yeah,
that was his thing.

1658
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:09,760
One of the most dangerous moves to would
get the super fly.

1659
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:14,170
He would stand on the top ring and fly
into the air jungle show days.

1660
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,290
Boom.
Your fucking brain.

1661
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,270
Jostling around inside is coconut.
Yeah.

1662
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,890
He had that gene simmons hair.
Dude,

1663
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,540
that's.
He was my favorite man.

1664
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,660
My manager was just telling me about
jake the snake.

1665
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,680
Uh,
there's a documentary on Netflix and

1666
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:33,850
it's just sad that that guy he went to
alcoholism to depression was in a

1667
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,610
trailer just from having everything to
those,

1668
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:42,190
those injuries and self-medication into
drug and alcohol addiction and stuff.

1669
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,260
It's a hard word.
Hard road.

1670
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:49,090
That's that life of being a pro wrestler
is so fucking difficult.

1671
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,370
They don't get nearly enough credit for
what they do.

1672
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:56,580
Those guys were on the road sometimes
260 plus days a year and they are

1673
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:01,831
throwing each other through fucking
doors and smashing you over the head and

1674
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:06,040
fucking all the stunts that they have to
do all the flips and all the craziness

1675
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,180
while lifting like meat heads to
juicing,

1676
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,160
juicing up,
lifting like crazy.

1677
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:10,920
It was crazy,
man.

1678
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,070
Yeah,
it is crazy.

1679
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:15,470
But
it's a lifestyle.

1680
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,330
Yeah.
I mean

1681
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,390
they chose it.
I guess.

1682
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,350
GotTa love it.
Yeah.

1683
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,630
You do.
You know when you got,

1684
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,310
you got to love it and that's really,
that's ultimately their decision.

1685
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,760
It is,
I guess,

1686
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,530
but I think super fly was saying that I
don't see.

1687
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,390
Don't want to know.
It's kind of crazy.

1688
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:32,340
This is really recent,
but you know,

1689
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:36,390
when I was a kid I was in high school in
the eighties and super fly was the man,

1690
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:38,730
you know,
he was like the big deal and when I was

1691
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:42,060
in high school,
so no one knew shit about concussions

1692
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:42,894
back then.
No,

1693
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,840
no one knew anything about cte.
We never heard of that term.

1694
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,110
We heard of brain damage,
like sky's get punched drunk.

1695
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,620
That's what we heard.
But no,

1696
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,440
but we always thought,
ah,

1697
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,770
you could kind of tell see a guy like
starting to slur his words.

1698
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,170
It's time stop and you'll get better,
you know,

1699
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:02,980
but that's why we didn't know that you
get it from playing football.

1700
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,180
You never heard of that,
right?

1701
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,810
Nope.
Nobody even talked about.

1702
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,760
Denied in NFL.
Covered it up.

1703
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,940
Yeah.
Well that was,

1704
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:11,130
I didn't see that movie concussion,
but that's what it's based on.

1705
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:11,510
Right?

1706
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,360
Yeah.
And then,

1707
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,550
you know,
but at the same time,

1708
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,271
you know,
the guys,

1709
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,650
they want to go out there,
they want to play,

1710
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,540
they want to,
they want to compete.

1711
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,860
You know,
this is a natural drive,

1712
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:20,500
but I mean you are put yourself at risk,
but you know,

1713
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,690
at the same time we could all just go
out of here and get in a car accident

1714
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:24,900
and die just so of course,
you know,

1715
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,930
there's a lot of things that people do
that they really,

1716
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,210
really enjoy that are risky.
Are we supposed to tell people they

1717
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:31,550
can't fucking surf anymore because
there's sharks out there?

1718
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,510
Yeah,
I mean,

1719
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:34,880
what are we supposed to do?
You tell people they can't race cars

1720
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:35,750
anymore.
He can't.

1721
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,060
It's uh,
I mean,

1722
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,460
no one could talk about it better than
you.

1723
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,500
I mean,
you're a professional cage fighter.

1724
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,690
It's one of the most dangerous jobs in
all sports.

1725
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,230
I started to just fighting for,
just to kind of defend myself going

1726
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:49,600
through different schools and getting
bullied and you know,

1727
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:50,920
I started fighting,
fighting,

1728
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:55,450
but then once I kinda got into the sport
and my uncle who kind of led me into

1729
01:09:55,451 --> 01:09:56,284
this,
my grandpa,

1730
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:00,610
and then I started fighting at 16 years
old and I was fighting like grown men

1731
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:05,350
and adults and a mma fights in the May.
And no holds bar is like we'd go to a

1732
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:08,050
bar and there'll be like pool tables,
people be drinking beer.

1733
01:10:08,051 --> 01:10:09,880
I couldn't even get in.
You had to be like 18 to get in.

1734
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,500
I was 16,
but my grandpa,

1735
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:12,640
he was super cool.
Nice guy.

1736
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,720
He allowed me to come in and I was
fighting these grown men and I was like,

1737
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,920
pop brought you to fight in a cage.
Yeah,

1738
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,810
when you were six.
Because he knew that I was legit.

1739
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:20,710
Man.
GRANDPA.

1740
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,380
He was,
he's passed away.

1741
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,250
But yeah,
he uh,

1742
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,290
he was getting great grandpa.
Yeah.

1743
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:29,710
He boxed and wrestled throughout his
life and was a competitor and wow,

1744
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:31,810
he seen me getting a couple of street
fights

1745
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,140
and he's like,
he knew I was wrestling.

1746
01:10:35,141 --> 01:10:37,750
I'd always kind of get scrapped and rest
because I used to just cross face people

1747
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:40,390
real hard and I'd always kind of get
into a little scrap and match or

1748
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,920
whatever.
And uh,

1749
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,520
he invited me out there and Josh near
was the man out there at the time and I

1750
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,950
was 16 years old and I go out there and
I just start.

1751
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,610
I started fighting and then like once I,
once I did that and then like my first

1752
01:10:51,611 --> 01:10:52,960
fight and then my,
my older sister,

1753
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,280
she was there and like,
she uh,

1754
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,810
there was like these strippers that were
there,

1755
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:57,070
I mean had huge boobs,
you know,

1756
01:10:57,071 --> 01:10:59,050
I never seen anything like that.
She's like,

1757
01:10:59,080 --> 01:10:59,771
oh,
this is my brother.

1758
01:10:59,771 --> 01:11:00,580
He just won.
They were like,

1759
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,300
Oh hey,
like,

1760
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,140
what's up,
you know?

1761
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:02,831
And I'm like,

1762
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:03,970
like this is the life,
right?

1763
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,480
Just knock somebody out now.
Now girls are hitting me up,

1764
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:09,670
you know?
And then like I was like the man in

1765
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:12,610
school and I did it and I did it just
because I loved it.

1766
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,160
And you don't know.
Now I look back

1767
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,971
today and I'm like,

podcast,

1770
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:20,430
Joe Rogan.
I'm like,

1771
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,260
Damn Dude.
Just finding really took me very far.

1772
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,780
I feel like I found my passion.
But when you caught a wave,

1773
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,270
you caught it like right when it was
taken off.

1774
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,760
And like we were talking about,
you were in the UFC before there was

1775
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:33,120
even a 155 pound division.
You were thinking about fighting one 70.

1776
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,620
And I grew up old school.
Josh near old school as fuck.

1777
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,800
That's a tough dude.
That's another dude.

1778
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,300
Doesn't get enough credit.
Josh neer.

1779
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,990
He's a talented motherfucker,
man.

1780
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,900
Tough as nails my best man.
That's my guy.

1781
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,640
Do My right hand man.
Good Dude.

1782
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,890
Good fight around.
Do you ever see that video?

1783
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:51,620
I'm sure you've seen hell of a father to
dude.

1784
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:52,530
He's just,
he's a good dude.

1785
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,700
He's actually a pretty smart with his
money.

1786
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:56,340
A lot of people thought he was stupid
just because he's quieter people.

1787
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,440
What's up with them?
Like I just don't want to talk to

1788
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:00,390
people.
He just thinks a lot of people are

1789
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,253
bullshitting,
you know,

1790
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,320
which mainly motherfuckers are.
Yeah,

1791
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:04,610
yeah,
for sure.

1792
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,750
He's real conservative and then.
But once you get to know them,

1793
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:07,830
dude,
he's the funniest dude.

1794
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:09,630
He's always prank and people are really.
Yeah,

1795
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:11,810
he's a jokester and he was really good
with his money and he,

1796
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:12,571
he,
uh,

1797
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:15,780
he paid for the way for a lot of Iowa
guys coming out of Des Moines.

1798
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,350
We went up to the military,
which I followed him and uh,

1799
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,740
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't
for him.

1800
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,780
That's a good store.
And the guy's an animal.

1801
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:24,160
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of the way he fights to

1802
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,960
fight for a very,
very smart and very tough to go.

1803
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,520
Relentless Dude.
Do you see that?

1804
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,710
I'm sure you've seen it.
I was going to say the video of some

1805
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:35,340
dude came into the gym and challenged
him some big ass dude and he beat the

1806
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:38,030
fuck out of the guy he had.
He had a story about that guy just of

1807
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:40,130
bullying him.
He said that the guy was huge.

1808
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:40,741
Real cool.
Yeah.

1809
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,630
You say you met him out at the bar and
he's like,

1810
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:43,530
Hey,
let me buy you a drink.

1811
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:46,140
Let me buy you a drink.
And he's being cool at the bar and he's

1812
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:46,501
just like,
man,

1813
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,660
this guy is kinda weird.
So he kind of separated,

1814
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,760
didn't have any confrontation and the
guy was being all cool.

1815
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,130
He says as he was leaving,
he's like,

1816
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,360
man,
I went to go get some girls.

1817
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:55,430
You know,
he's like this guy,

1818
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,090
there's a lot of dudes at the bar like I
left.

1819
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,560
He's like,
I look on my phone,

1820
01:12:58,561 --> 01:13:00,420
it's on facebook disguise.
Like if you,

1821
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,600
dude I'll beat your ass,
blah blah blah.

1822
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:05,070
Like you don't know me.
And Josh is like,

1823
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:06,210
okay Bro,
I don't even know you,

1824
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:08,340
but you know,
I thought it went nowhere.

1825
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:11,100
He meets the guy says,
all right man,

1826
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:13,320
I'm going to get out of here.
And then the guy just starts talking

1827
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:16,770
crazy shit and left and then he keeps,
he keeps harassing Josh and Josh is

1828
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:17,491
like,
okay Bro,

1829
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:20,220
like I don't get why you're coming at me
but you want to come to the gym,

1830
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,020
sign the waiver,
we can go at it.

1831
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,450
And so josh,
by the way,

1832
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,070
way bigger than this,
way bigger,

1833
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,470
way bigger.
I think he's got some issues in the Josh

1834
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,890
for like 55,
fight 70 to 75,

1835
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:34,230
72 towards the end to 20 at least.
Right.

1836
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,040
Big enormous dude and he comes in and I
guess Josh like sparked a little bit but

1837
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,510
he's Kinda like conserving and he's
like,

1838
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,360
because I figured this guy was going to
come in and he said he came in and then

1839
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:44,490
he's like let's go.
And then they,

1840
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,320
they,
they laced up and then they fought and

1841
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,590
then josh is kind of just walk forward.
Just kept his hands up,

1842
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,350
let the guy kind of bomb and get tired
and eventually took them down and

1843
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,350
started putting it on him.
He beat the shit out of him but it

1844
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:57,420
didn't.
The guy had boxing gloves on when

1845
01:13:57,421 --> 01:14:00,920
there's something because he's on the
smaller bought and he,

1846
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,840
the guy chose the boxing so he chose
what he wanted to do.

1847
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:08,940
So it was like an old school ufc event.
Like it was like going down and the guy

1848
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,310
was like,
they weren't someone.

1849
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,280
Wasn't someone trying to press charges
on Josh?

1850
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,880
No,
no weirdness going on because it was all

1851
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:20,280
over the internet and everybody was
talking about the what near did was kind

1852
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:21,640
of fucked up and I'm like,
well,

1853
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,580
I don't know man,
when a guy comes to your gym and wants

1854
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:27,610
to fight like that,
that's a weird predicament for a

1855
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,010
professional fighter to be in.
But it's real common.

1856
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:33,340
Like Dojo wars have always been common.
Diaz was in them.

1857
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:35,980
I mean that,
that's how they say the gracies back in

1858
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:36,740
the day,
they would,

1859
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,790
uh,
these boxers and a weight lifters.

1860
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:41,050
I mean,
there's a lot of old school videos of

1861
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:43,340
guys would just come in like,
you think you're the man with his

1862
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,790
Jujitsu stuff.
Like,

1863
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:47,260
let's see it.
Then they would get beat up and tapped

1864
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:47,820
out,
you know?

1865
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:51,850
And then that they had a respect for it.
That happens in all sorts of martial

1866
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:54,400
arts schools that happened in my
taekwondo school all the time.

1867
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,170
Once or twice a year,
some guy would come in out of nowhere

1868
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:02,470
that wanted to fight and then they would
put him in there with a black belt and

1869
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:03,990
you'd get kicked in the head.
It was,

1870
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:05,740
it was common,
it was super cool.

1871
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,930
It's like,
I think that's always going to be the

1872
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:10,870
case if you have a place that teaches
people how to fight,

1873
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:14,440
there's always getting me some fucking
Wackadoo who thinks he knows how to

1874
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:15,570
fight,
wants to go in there.

1875
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:17,530
And the street guys who get out,
I don't get it.

1876
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:20,140
And I seen dominant cruise on a video
not that long ago.

1877
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,550
Uh,
an old school video.

1878
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:25,240
When I saw that dog,
he comes in and then he's like,

1879
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,820
no,
just stand with me and this and that.

1880
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:31,460
Did you ever see that video?
There's a video of a Dojo war where this

1881
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,740
karate guys beat this homeless guy,
like almost to death.

1882
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,260
And the word was that they beat him to
death,

1883
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,170
but they dragged the guy out and threw
them in a dumpster.

1884
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,270
But this is a.
see,

1885
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,760
I don't know if anybody ever
definitively,

1886
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:50,740
because this was something that took
place in the 19 eighties and I don't

1887
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:53,860
know if they ever.
It's a fucking very disturbing video to

1888
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:58,360
watch because the guy like he was
getting his ass kicked and the guy kept

1889
01:15:58,361 --> 01:15:59,350
beating them up.
This is it.

1890
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:03,070
Yeah.
So I think the guy who's the homeless

1891
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:06,580
guy who's a.
is he wearing the bell bottoms right

1892
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:07,130
there?
Yeah.

1893
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,670
That dude,
that dude see it says right there

1894
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:11,140
mentally challenged,
man.

1895
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:16,141
Beaten to death by MMA fighter.
See was an mma because there wasn't even

1896
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,210
mma back then.
So the,

1897
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,350
the,
the guy behind him,

1898
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:24,130
the black guy with the black belt in the
white guy is the guy beat,

1899
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,450
beat the fuck out of him.

1900
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:30,430
And this guy,
I guess he was just a crazy person and

1901
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:35,431
these guys exist that pretended he knew
martial arts and I think he thought he

1902
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:38,140
was just going to go in there and work
out or something.

1903
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:42,130
And so he's like throwing these little.
He's got like a little something

1904
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,630
throwing some kicks,
but look,

1905
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:45,910
he's not,
it's not even like he's really trying to

1906
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:46,990
hit them.
It seems.

1907
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:49,600
It's weird.
He's kind of crazy.

1908
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:55,050
But the other guy is like taking his
time and he winds up beating the fuck

1909
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,790
out of
inside,

1910
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,420
inside like it.
So I don't know what style of karate it

1911
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:03,490
is,
but this is super old school.

1912
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,430
I mean the,
the video is shitty as fuck.

1913
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,550
See?
But yeah,

1914
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,250
but he's throwing the other guys throne,
but he's like two and like karate,

1915
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,540
like,
oh,

1916
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:15,950
let me try to,
we'll kick to the leg,

1917
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,500
sweep the look.
It's weird,

1918
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,860
man.
It's weird because it's not,

1919
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:21,650
oh,
CEO,

1920
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:25,700
you just connect it to the guy just
doesn't really know how to fight.

1921
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:27,860
But he sort of knows how to look like
he's fighting.

1922
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:31,340
He just crushed to keep pounding.
He's,

1923
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,950
he beats the fuck out of this guy.
It's way worse than this.

1924
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,820
Oh,
he had kicks others.

1925
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,270
The Nita down opponent is that black
dynamite.

1926
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,840
And he's like,
I'm done.

1927
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,440
I'm done.
I'm done.

1928
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,273
He's like,
nope.

1929
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,350
So then he comes back.
It's almost,

1930
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,780
see now he's almost kind of like
fighting for his life.

1931
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,770
But he's fighting a guy that's a trained
martial artists that's probably been

1932
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:53,600
doing this forever because he's a black
belt.

1933
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,360
He should've just kinda knocked him and
let it.

1934
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,350
Let it be done.
Yeah.

1935
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,193
He's.

1936
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,670
Oh,
they got sound effects.

1937
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,520
It's unnecessarily there.
He's out.

1938
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:04,960
He's out.
He's out.

1939
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,290
Dude.
In the back of my head.

1940
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:11,060
It was done here.
That though.

1941
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:14,810
So he stomps his head.
Stop Dude.

1942
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,350
Dragging them out the back door.
Yeah.

1943
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,770
Damn,
that's crazy.

1944
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,190
Look at the blood blood coming out of
his head.

1945
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,420
That guy ever getting in trouble for
that.

1946
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,820
I don't know.
I don't know what the story is behind

1947
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:30,654
that

1948
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:36,650
is the trail of the conflict.

1949
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,590
This is.
This is snapchat today where you're

1950
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,580
snitching on yourself right here.
Basically.

1951
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,940
Evidence.
This is the blood.

1952
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,460
My dojo.
Wow Man.

1953
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:52,380
That's Kinda messed up.

1954
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,590
Nineteen 84.
That goes.

1955
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:02,520
He told the date,
seven trying to get a judge.

1956
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:08,520
I mean snapchat.
I guess you could kind of make the

1957
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:10,760
argument that it was a fight.
So what happened?

1958
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,860
They show where they put the guy this
outside.

1959
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,610
It is just blood on the ground.
The guy to die or no,

1960
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,280
he didn't.
No,

1961
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,410
I don't know because I don't.
I don't know if anybody's ever.

1962
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,080
We'll see.
See if you can find out whatever data is

1963
01:19:22,081 --> 01:19:24,480
on it.
That's my point is like those kinds of

1964
01:19:24,481 --> 01:19:27,000
things they've,
they've happened throughout the history

1965
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:32,001
of martial arts schools.
I saw a bunch of Dojo wars back in my

1966
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,260
taekwondo days,
but I never saw anybody get beaten to

1967
01:19:34,261 --> 01:19:38,310
death like that or if the guy was,
but he could have easily died.

1968
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:42,510
He got stomped on the head twice while
he was unconscious and that was a big

1969
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,270
guy that stomped him and he stomped him
on the temple.

1970
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,190
He could die.
He was knocked out with,

1971
01:19:47,191 --> 01:19:49,290
uh,
the knees on the ground and then he was

1972
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,830
just like trying to get out,
but you can just clear as day the guy's

1973
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,700
out of his,
which he's Naeem in the back of the head

1974
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,140
a couple Sundays.
That's.

1975
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,330
Well the stomps to was his head was flat
completely on the ground.

1976
01:20:00,331 --> 01:20:02,480
That guy just stomped his head.
Yeah.

1977
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:03,540
Are.
Yeah.

1978
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,970
And it's a guy,
obviously a karate guy who knows how to

1979
01:20:05,971 --> 01:20:07,980
kick and he stopping you.
That's not like

1980
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,040
a regular person stomping you guys
getting to get some force behind those

1981
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:12,900
stumps.
Yeah,

1982
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:14,010
I don't know what happened.
See what,

1983
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:17,080
find out.
Sorry to be a mood breaker.

1984
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,940
What's next for you?
What's going on?

1985
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:25,370
We want the big fights.
Me and they haven't even though you

1986
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:26,204
know,
but I know.

1987
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:30,420
I know Max Holloway's in front of me and
the guys who are in front of you right

1988
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:31,960
now.
You're in the mix coming off last.

1989
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:32,361
Yeah.
What?

1990
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,194
What's,
what are they?

1991
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,560
I don't like the rankings,
man.

1992
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,570
I don't want.
I just want to fight,

1993
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:37,170
man.
I've been,

1994
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,540
I've been dude.
I'm the type of guy that I just go up.

1995
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:43,230
Sean Shelby sees me and he looks at me
and then he just runs the other way.

1996
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,590
What are the rankings?
I think I'm number like seven,

1997
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,440
but like Dennis Bermudez number six.
I think he's in front of me.

1998
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,800
How's that work?
Here's a.

1999
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,310
that's a perfect example.
I don't pay attention to that man.

2000
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:55,740
Honestly,
I've been fighting everybody in the 55

2001
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:57,000
and 45 division.
It's like,

2002
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,640
well,
the rankings are based on per employee,

2003
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,910
but it's not,
it's,

2004
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:05,130
it's the input output of writers.
You know,

2005
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:08,640
like here's a perfect example.
When conor mcgregor knocked out Josie,

2006
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:13,641
although some Brazilian writer put him
lower on the list than he was before,

2007
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,270
he's just jealous.
Yeah.

2008
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,860
Well there's a lot another other than
shit.

2009
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,160
Like here's a perfect example.
When you buy a hall,

2010
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,930
knocked out Gig Arpu,
saucy.

2011
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:27,540
He was ranked below him after the fight
below him on the fucking rankings.

2012
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,770
Well,
what are the.

2013
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:30,390
What the fuck is the point of the
rankings?

2014
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,150
If you fight a guy,
you knock him out,

2015
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,920
you stop him.
He jumped,

2016
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:37,470
spinning back,
kicked him in the head and then put them

2017
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:38,304
away.

2018
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:42,000
What the fuck?
What more does a guy have to do to get

2019
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,810
ranked ahead of a guy you don't like?
I guess their ideas that most Sasaki has

2020
01:21:45,811 --> 01:21:49,320
more experience.
Like if you watch uriah hall fight,

2021
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,240
you can't tell.
He's a motherfucker.

2022
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

2023
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,460
He's a beast.
Then stop.

2024
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,980
Stop watching fights.
Stopped commenting.

2025
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,900
Stopped,
stopped writing shit.

2026
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:58,980
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2027
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:00,300
He want,
he wanted.

2028
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:01,740
He moves ahead.
That's it.

2029
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,390
Yep.
I believe that two men.

2030
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,130
The fuck is Dennis Bermudez ahead of
you.

2031
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,640
I don't know.
I think because maybe he beat me.

2032
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,010
He beat Max and then I lost a Max,
which is,

2033
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:13,500
uh,
when did he beat Max Holloway?

2034
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:16,610
Yeah.
He'd be Holloway Holloway couple of

2035
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,820
years ago before conor did.
Yeah.

2036
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,010
Bermudez is a beast dude,
but he was very good.

2037
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,500
Very good.
No doubt about it.

2038
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:25,350
I'm not saying we're the best.
Scott says anything wrong with Bermuda.

2039
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,050
He's an awesome fighter,
but I did not know that he beat

2040
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:29,900
Holloway.
I thought Halloween's only last was to

2041
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:34,040
uh,
connor caught her in a dentist's last

2042
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:34,650
year.
Will.

2043
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,290
Well,
Alto Holloway's really young,

2044
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,191
you know,
I mean,

2045
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:40,530
you think when he fought Dennis,
I mean,

2046
01:22:40,531 --> 01:22:42,390
I didn't even know he fought down,
so I'm trying to remember that.

2047
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,670
But when he was,
your honor,

2048
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:47,010
he was really young too.
I mean,

2049
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:48,230
he's a young kid.
Yeah.

2050
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,910
He used to train with that guy back and
forth.

2051
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:53,420
So it's kind of weird fighting him and
that's why maybe the fight with distant

2052
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:56,100
play.
He knew I had the power and then he just

2053
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:59,460
kind of played the,
just moving around game and it was just

2054
01:22:59,461 --> 01:22:59,911
weird,
man.

2055
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:01,840
I really couldn't get into a,
uh,

2056
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,980
my style of fighting my rhythm and it
was just kinda like,

2057
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,220
he's clever.
Yeah.

2058
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:06,921
Yeah.
And you,

2059
01:23:06,921 --> 01:23:07,754
he moves a lot.

2060
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,900
Yeah,
he's clever and not being there for the

2061
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,870
big shots.
He rarely gets hit with big shot mixes.

2062
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:18,300
Good with switch stances and everything.
But just overall we never really gotten

2063
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:21,140
into a fight.
I felt like we just really didn't get

2064
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:22,930
it.
Getting that type of engagement and it

2065
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,630
was just weird because I,
I trained with this guy before,

2066
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:29,470
I like I knew who he was and like I'm in
there and things are going so slow that

2067
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:33,010
I know exactly everything's going on.
I really just couldn't be in the moment.

2068
01:23:33,011 --> 01:23:33,850
I'm Kinda like,
man,

2069
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:37,060
like I know everything.
Like I'm seeing people in the front row.

2070
01:23:37,061 --> 01:23:38,620
I just,
I just felt really weird.

2071
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,050
Oh Wow.
So like you weren't zoned in.

2072
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,310
Yeah,
just didn't have the,

2073
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:43,630
like the focus.
I don't know,

2074
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:48,631
maybe it was just handled a little
little tattoos had I'm in the zone or

2075
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:50,390
something.

2076
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:52,870
I don't know if that was just a weird
smart for him.

2077
01:23:52,871 --> 01:23:54,640
Man.
He's a very clever guy.

2078
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,550
I liked the way he fights.
I liked the way fuck cups wants and I

2079
01:23:57,551 --> 01:24:00,340
was super impressed with that because
copd is dangerous as fuck.

2080
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:01,630
Yo,
that's another good one.

2081
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,220
A way fought.
Uh,

2082
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,410
Ricardo Lamas.
He was like,

2083
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:06,380
let's just.
Yeah,

2084
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,910
that was crazy.
Fight on my bra.

2085
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:13,180
What can we do that like,
come on man.

2086
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,200
Yeah.
Well there's certain levels of knockout

2087
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:18,034
power.
Yeah.

2088
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,260
You're a dude.
I used to,

2089
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:21,690
I used to throw them around a lot,
so he,

2090
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:25,300
I think he just knew that he just wasn't
going to try to engage with me and then

2091
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:27,850
he just was going to stay away.
Power is a weird thing,

2092
01:24:27,851 --> 01:24:30,310
isn't it?
It's like some guys like,

2093
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,490
you just have certain.
Yeah,

2094
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:35,430
there's just no getting around that.
There's like,

2095
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,330
there's certain guys that no matter what
they do,

2096
01:24:37,331 --> 01:24:38,470
they'll have great technique.

2097
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,450
They'll win fights,
they'll even knock guys out,

2098
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,720
but they'll never be able to just step
in and rumble.

2099
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:44,990
Johnson somebody.
Yeah.

2100
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:45,900
Savage,
you know,

2101
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,860
that's just what makes rumble Johnson
him.

2102
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:50,680
And that's what makes him,
me and Robbie lawler reprise three in

2103
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:53,740
the same.
And I don't try to be a movement guy,

2104
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,310
don't try to do this and that.
I like to be in the fight getting after

2105
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:59,840
it because I feel like I can break
people that are.

2106
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,420
I'm a knock you out.
If not,

2107
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:03,370
I'm going to be in shape to go all the
rounds.

2108
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,720
Do you ever think that maybe if you
could be a movement guy and could do all

2109
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:09,940
those other things,
you could have that as well because it's

2110
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:11,950
not like your power is ever going to go
away.

2111
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,890
You're always going to have that.
Like when you knocked out dos Anjos with

2112
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,030
that upper cut,
like that's,

2113
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:19,990
that's classic Jeremy Stevens,
you know when you knocked out Bermuda's

2114
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:22,060
with that flying knee,
you've got that power.

2115
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,510
Like if you incorporate it,
all those other techniques that you see

2116
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,910
these other guys doing as well.
Like you know,

2117
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:31,750
if you ever thought of that,
like maybe just expanding what you do.

2118
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,750
And,
and also I work on that too because

2119
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:38,600
people expect a certain kind of fight
from you because you're so aggressive.

2120
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:41,860
You so you know,
moving forward all the time that if you

2121
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:44,530
fought in a different way it would
probably fuck people up.

2122
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,330
Yeah,
I mean I'm always trying to work on

2123
01:25:46,331 --> 01:25:49,670
everything because I feel like you have
to be adapted using the Charles Darwin

2124
01:25:49,671 --> 01:25:51,370
theory.
It's not the strongest or the smartest

2125
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,910
person who's willing to adapt to change.
That's going to be around the longest.

2126
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:58,150
And uh,
you got so many young talented kids

2127
01:25:58,151 --> 01:25:59,200
coming up,
uh,

2128
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,063
you know,
like,

2129
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,660
just young,
you know,

2130
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,730
like little Max Holloway's Yair,
like these little,

2131
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,680
uh,
pedis pedis bro.

2132
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,840
And I mean,
you got this talent.

2133
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,890
You have to constantly be evolving,
getting better work on your game and all

2134
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:13,910
angles.
Jujitsu,

2135
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,600
wrestling who is fighting is fighting
someone good because Sarah's.

2136
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:19,180
Yeah,
that's interesting.

2137
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:22,120
Was a little barn barn.
I like this era.

2138
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,110
He's a funny dude.
See that fight going like,

2139
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,944
uh,
that uh,

2140
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,030
that Tony Ferguson and that other guy,
see if that fight funky fight action

2141
01:26:30,031 --> 01:26:31,070
going on.
Craziness.

2142
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,600
Role.
Legit fight.

2143
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,560
Rodriguez is no fucking joke.
That's what I'm saying.

2144
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:38,570
You got to be kicks.
Got To be on your toes.

2145
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:43,490
Damn that dude.
Throw some wild his end to Andrew Philly

2146
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,560
fight.
Oh,

2147
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,820
caught him with that fucking flying
roundhouse.

2148
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:48,620
Kick the damn.
He's good.

2149
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,483
Yeah.
Yeah.

2150
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,700
He's also like,
he,

2151
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:54,270
he practices that shit so often.
Like you ever see him hit pads?

2152
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:56,590
These karate taekwondo?
Yeah.

2153
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:01,070
He'll throw like all that spinning shit
in practice all the time.

2154
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,280
Like it's a part of his normal comments
first.

2155
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,200
First Nature.
Not just trying to do that shit or try

2156
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:08,980
to try not to be or try to be exciting
or something like that.

2157
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,810
Just kind of harnesses his own.
What did you think of Aldo versus edgar?

2158
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,930
This the second fight was boring dude.
Do you think it was boring?

2159
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:19,670
It was boring.
I think as as a,

2160
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,850
as a fighter,
there was a lot of stuff going on as at

2161
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:27,350
a high level and a good stuff going on,
but I just thought it was boring.

2162
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:31,850
I just felt like Aldo just fought to
just get by and when man,

2163
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,550
but I'll do.
Or Frankie didn't look like himself.

2164
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:36,680
Man.
I think he got caught a bunch of times.

2165
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,890
I think although look masterful,
I thought it was a brilliant fight.

2166
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:41,480
Yeah,
I mean if you're going to fight frankie,

2167
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:42,530
that's the way to fight him.

2168
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:46,480
I mean he threw very little kicks,
countered with punches and movement and

2169
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:47,770
I thought he looked great.
Yeah.

2170
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:50,390
As far as like,
I don't mean that's what,

2171
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:53,150
that's what I'm saying is as I look at
that and I'm like,

2172
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:54,830
I see,
I see the type of level that that is

2173
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:56,930
that,
but it's just like it was a boring

2174
01:27:56,931 --> 01:27:58,460
fight,
but then I also felt like it was,

2175
01:27:58,461 --> 01:28:00,770
it was kind of weird.
I didn't see frankie moving like he did.

2176
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,840
It made me kind of think maybe he was
injured.

2177
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,910
I think he just got caught.
I was thinking God,

2178
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,630
he got his and Joe,
Joe,

2179
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,710
Joe José's a lot,
lot bigger than him and he's had his

2180
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:12,890
number and Waldo looked big in that
fight too.

2181
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:17,260
Like he looked smaller for the Mcgregor
fight and I think concentrated a lot on

2182
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:18,680
strength conditioning for this fight.

2183
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,400
And he looked like although of old feel
like they all looked like the older that

2184
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:25,070
knocked out Mendez in Brazil.
It'll look thick.

2185
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,240
We'll.
So I think,

2186
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,560
yeah,
I think maybe,

2187
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:30,260
you know,
he's had issues back and forth with

2188
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:33,890
making 1:45,
so maybe he's got it dialed in better.

2189
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,140
I don't know.
I Bet I bet he did because he did look

2190
01:28:36,141 --> 01:28:39,860
great that fight and he did.
He did find a smart fight and I just,

2191
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:42,090
I just felt like he could have finished,
finished frankie.

2192
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:43,820
He felt like he could have done a little
bit more,

2193
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:47,320
but then I also heard that he didn't
want to throw kicks and he only used his

2194
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:51,380
left hand because he had like some
snitches telling them like that Frankie

2195
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:53,390
was going to take them down off kicks,
you know,

2196
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,890
which.
But that's obvious,

2197
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:56,930
isn't it?
I mean obviously frank is going to try

2198
01:28:56,931 --> 01:29:00,080
to take him down off cakes because all
those got that nasty left right leg

2199
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:00,820
kick.
Yeah.

2200
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,100
No,
he's always throwing kicks.

2201
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,780
Yeah.
I don't think he's ever really took them

2202
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:05,970
down to me.
I'll be right back up.

2203
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,833
Yeah.
You know.

2204
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:10,740
Well I mean he,
he just fought a great fight.

2205
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:12,470
If you want to beat Frankie.
Yeah.

2206
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,230
Yeah.
I mean,

2207
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:14,640
I liked it,
I enjoyed it.

2208
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,610
I thought it was a really good fight,
but I see your point.

2209
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,630
It wasn't like,
Gosh,

2210
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,760
that was just stylistically that,
that doesn't really play it play out

2211
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:28,380
with Frankie and in him.
I think he put me in Aldo in there or me

2212
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:30,770
and mcgregor.
I think you're going to see a lot of

2213
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,840
high level action.
We're going to be kicking and punching

2214
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:35,870
each other and knew each other in the
face and it's going to be exciting,

2215
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,130
you know,
at the same time,

2216
01:29:37,131 --> 01:29:38,630
but still very skilled in a

2217
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,910
method of madness type of way.
Yeah.

2218
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,370
How old are you now,
man?

2219
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,870
30.
Just 30.

2220
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:48,250
So when you think about your career,
do you have it mapped out like what

2221
01:29:48,251 --> 01:29:51,000
you're trying to accomplish and when,
when do you have an exit strategy?

2222
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:54,070
Do you know when you're,
when you're going to be done prime right

2223
01:29:54,071 --> 01:29:57,400
now it seems like 30 to 34,
right?

2224
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:58,080
Yeah,
exactly.

2225
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,130
Family.
Look at Robbie lawler.

2226
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:02,160
I look up to that guy a lot in the way,
the way he's Kinda handled his career

2227
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,940
and who's to say within,
you know,

2228
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,650
what if I go in there and the next three
or four fights on skin Kao and then it's

2229
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:08,101
like,
okay,

2230
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:09,090
it's like Sam Sauce,
like,

2231
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,470
man,
maybe it's time for me to hang up,

2232
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,410
you know?
Then then I would definitely,

2233
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:15,210
if I'm getting ruined like that and
hurting myself,

2234
01:30:15,211 --> 01:30:18,840
I don't want to be brain dead or talking
about killing my family because I have

2235
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,390
trauma injuries or anything like that.
So definitely not.

2236
01:30:21,391 --> 01:30:25,140
But I definitely want to have an exit
strategy and things that I want to do.

2237
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:27,270
But as of right now,
I feel healthy.

2238
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,860
I want,
I want to keep fighting and it's like I

2239
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:30,270
said,
I'd tell Sean Shelby on my man,

2240
01:30:30,271 --> 01:30:31,230
keep me active,
dude.

2241
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,630
I don't want to fight twice a year.
You know that that's,

2242
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:37,200
that's rough to live off of and I just
want to keep fighting because I just

2243
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:39,390
want to be right back in the mix.
Even if I had to go out of the top 10

2244
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:41,100
right now because everybody else has
kind of lost.

2245
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:42,960
I've already fought people where they
already got fights,

2246
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,930
you know,
let somebody else from like the 11 or

2247
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:48,600
twelfth 13th guy in the rankings who's
coming off a win,

2248
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:52,230
let's me and him fight and then we can
get right back in the mix so that we can

2249
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:56,850
get those Josie Connors because I want
to keep the featherweight exciting,

2250
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,920
the featherweight division.
That's why I moved down here and I feel

2251
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:02,250
like a lot more athletic,
explosive and I want those exciting

2252
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:03,810
fights.
I haven't fought them guys and I feel

2253
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:06,600
like those are great fights for me to go
out there and really excel.

2254
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,270
Make some big money.
And in wind.

2255
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:08,660
Yeah,

2256
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:09,730
just shock the world.
Oh,

2257
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,420
you've been killing it at featherweight
and what do you walk around at?

2258
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,780
No.
Do you weigh right now?

2259
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:18,610
I'm probably like 7,577.
I know I just ran an hour yesterday.

2260
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:19,980
Yeah,
lose 30 pounds.

2261
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:21,550
He gets off.
Holy Shit Dude.

2262
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:23,000
You know what's funny man,
is I,

2263
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:25,780
I do all this work.
I get down and then like,

2264
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:26,810
you know,
they get,

2265
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,400
they give me this time off,
I get,

2266
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:31,060
I go home,
I eat a little bit of food and when I'm,

2267
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:32,500
when I'm at home,
like training,

2268
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,180
that's the worst.
Like if I'm traveling,

2269
01:31:34,181 --> 01:31:36,130
like I'm actually all right because I'm
not eating everything,

2270
01:31:36,131 --> 01:31:39,310
but when I get home and my Mexican
mamacitas right there just cooking me

2271
01:31:39,311 --> 01:31:42,850
all the good foods just grubbing down
and then I'm like,

2272
01:31:42,851 --> 01:31:43,481
all right,
cool.

2273
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:44,314
You know,
and no one's.

2274
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,420
I'm just training,
doing my thing and then,

2275
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:48,520
you know.
But what kind of Diet do you follow?

2276
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:50,050
Do you have any nutritionist or
anything?

2277
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,510
Yeah,
George Lockhart fitness.

2278
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,400
George personally is brilliant.
I've been working with.

2279
01:31:54,401 --> 01:31:55,900
He's the guy that doesn't get enough
credit,

2280
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:56,920
you know,
he does.

2281
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,200
He's worked with a lot of athletes in
the law,

2282
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,160
a lot of fighters and

2283
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:03,940
done a fantastic job.
He's really good in military too and he

2284
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:08,290
knows what he's doing and he doesn't
charge me $10,000 a camp.

2285
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,480
So I think he's great.
I've been working with him since

2286
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,740
beginning.
I've preached this guy and uh,

2287
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,870
he,
he's an amazing man.

2288
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:16,000
He's,
he's really actually had him a lot in my

2289
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:19,660
corner and him coming to the last fight
seen me work out and he's just like,

2290
01:32:19,661 --> 01:32:20,260
man,
dude,

2291
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,920
he's like,
you're on your stuff dude.

2292
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,210
And everything that he gives me the Diet
and I just,

2293
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:26,920
I feel good man.
I feel good at further away.

2294
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,930
So when you work with a guy like George
Lockhart,

2295
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,950
what is like,
what's the protocol?

2296
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:34,150
Has these set up your camp?
Like it's all computerized.

2297
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,780
I can basically go into the computer
type in my weight.

2298
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,670
Uh,
the Times that I'm training the hours

2299
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:43,650
that I'm training to the intensity and
then I type in my weight.

2300
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,580
I wake up in the morning,
weigh myself,

2301
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:49,030
and then I tied that into the computer
and the computer just goes off of day to

2302
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:51,280
day basics gives me,
like say if I don't have Kefir,

2303
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,550
I can substitute for egg whites and it's
all computerized.

2304
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,140
If I need any help or I'm like,
Hey,

2305
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:57,130
I'm not doing this.
He'll,

2306
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,870
he'll adjust a little bit of things for
me.

2307
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,580
It's basically right there on the
computer.

2308
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:04,120
Do you get blood work done where you
find your nutrient levels or find what

2309
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:05,970
you need or what you need to sign?
I have,

2310
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,220
I have a long time ago and I haven't
done that recently,

2311
01:33:09,221 --> 01:33:10,054
but uh,
you know,

2312
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:13,150
it's nutritionists like George Lockhart.
I feel great.

2313
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:13,751
I,
I honestly,

2314
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:16,120
I feel amazing when,
when I'm feeling good and I'm in that

2315
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:17,420
right mindset and training hard,
I,

2316
01:33:17,421 --> 01:33:18,310
I feel good.
But no,

2317
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:20,300
I haven't gotten the bloodwork done in
awhile,

2318
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,460
but I did do that.

2319
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,800
So it's interesting.
It's all computerized.

2320
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:24,520
So the,
you,

2321
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,880
you write your weight,
you type your weight in and you type

2322
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,180
like what you're saying if you've got a
strength and conditioning day and he

2323
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:34,690
adjusts your caloric intake accordingly.
Calorie intake,

2324
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,640
you know,
depends on the program.

2325
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,430
He has it all program.
Wow.

2326
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:41,760
I'm not for sure the exact details how
he does that,

2327
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:44,230
that's his thing and why he makes his
money.

2328
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:46,300
But.
So does it show you immediately or do

2329
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,550
you send him the information?
Then he sends it back to you

2330
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:51,550
immediately.
I just click it in and then it shows you

2331
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,230
showed me right there and then,
uh,

2332
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,130
then like by like Saturday or Sunday,
it just for like the work week so they

2333
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,710
can see how much,
how much I'm losing if I need to,

2334
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:02,830
uh,
lower the calorie intake or if like

2335
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:05,140
maybe like I'm feeling kind of lethargic
and my weight's good.

2336
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:07,530
Heal up a little bit of carbs for me,
you know,

2337
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,590
if I call him like,
hey man,

2338
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:09,970
you know,
I've been doing good.

2339
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:11,170
I've been killing to speak,
but you know,

2340
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:12,004
I'm just,
uh,

2341
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,940
my weights down.
He's like,

2342
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:13,481
oh,
it's good.

2343
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:13,890
Okay,
let's,

2344
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,860
let's,
let's get a little bit more,

2345
01:34:14,861 --> 01:34:18,640
a half of a sweet potato or a little bit
more oatmeal before practice or

2346
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:20,390
something like that.
So he's a,

2347
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:23,500
he's very smart man.
He's very real calculated in his

2348
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:24,450
approach and it's,
uh,

2349
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:28,000
it's interesting to learn from in the
nutrition and everything that I get all

2350
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:30,040
natural on that stuff or just
background.

2351
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:33,190
He's a military guy.
He actually used to be a,

2352
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,900
he's.
He told me that he was actually a

2353
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:39,930
chunkier kid growing up and then he just
got into diet and nutrition and losing

2354
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:44,410
weight and then he got into the military
and helping out the military with a

2355
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:47,020
nutrition.
That's interesting that he's devised a

2356
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:49,270
computer program.
I haven't heard of anybody else that

2357
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:53,260
does that where you can enter in all the
data and it gives you instant results.

2358
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,000
Yeah.
Check that out.

2359
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,500
That is it.
That's very interesting.

2360
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:56,821
I'm,
I'm,

2361
01:34:56,821 --> 01:34:58,070
I to check out his stuff.
I'm going

2362
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,340
to,
I'm going to go look at this after that.

2363
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,340
Fitness vt.com.
And uh,

2364
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:03,960
I've been trying to get people on this a
long time ago.

2365
01:35:03,961 --> 01:35:04,510
I'm just like,
man,

2366
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,390
it's simple.
It's easy to sign.

2367
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,640
Stand for.
I'm not for sure.

2368
01:35:08,641 --> 01:35:09,474
Fitness vet,

2369
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,720
I'm not sure what the.
Okay.

2370
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:14,300
Um,
so when you,

2371
01:35:14,301 --> 01:35:15,500
uh,
when you work with him,

2372
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,290
so like say if you start now and you're
177 pounds,

2373
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,780
how much time do you need to get down to
1:45.

2374
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:23,690
And what do you way before you start the
big cut,

2375
01:35:23,691 --> 01:35:25,070
before you dehydrate yourself?

2376
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:27,620
Uh,
I would only need nine weeks,

2377
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,090
nine,
10 weeks and I'll be ready to go.

2378
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:30,860
And then,
you know,

2379
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:32,280
the,
the,

2380
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:35,900
the thing with now without the ivs is
I've been putting in a lot of roadwork,

2381
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,730
you know,
uh,

2382
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,300
on top of things.
I've just been putting in an extra

2383
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:39,400
credit.
The roadwork,

2384
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:42,020
the,
that runs the swims,

2385
01:35:42,021 --> 01:35:43,930
the cycling,
uh,

2386
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,070
you know,
I'm into all that now as far as pushing

2387
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:47,570
cardio phase a pace.
But,

2388
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,770
you know,
a lot of people just,

2389
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,130
they work out,
they work out,

2390
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,220
they work out and then they just do
these drastic weight cuts.

2391
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:54,470
And I used to do these and uh,
you know,

2392
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:57,590
I'd still feel fine,
but I was cutting so much weight man and

2393
01:35:57,591 --> 01:35:58,970
it,
it really started to hurt.

2394
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:03,590
I mean I'm laying on my death bed and it
was like a nasty baptism and uh,

2395
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,750
and it now,
now you know,

2396
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,700
with the,
with these runs and burning fats,

2397
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:10,520
I've learned how to stay smart and,
and learn like,

2398
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:12,200
okay,
now you need three weeks hard.

2399
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,570
And then like a week of recovery,
like on runs and,

2400
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,020
and running,
like after say say we do like 75 minutes

2401
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:19,930
of just straight wrestling and then
I'll,

2402
01:36:19,931 --> 01:36:24,200
I'll go run another 45 to an hour just
at a real low pace that I'm just burning

2403
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:28,060
fat burning calories and like throughout
the week I'm burning like a,

2404
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:31,580
like a pound and a half to two pounds
per week just depending on my body fat.

2405
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:34,550
And as slowly I get down,
I just keep niching niche and niching

2406
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:36,470
and then come time to double the weight.
Cut.

2407
01:36:36,471 --> 01:36:37,550
I'm only,
I'm only cutting,

2408
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:38,840
you know,
12 pounds.

2409
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,240
You know,
granted I've cut a lot over the time but

2410
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:44,860
I've burned a lot of body fat and then
at that point your body starts to just

2411
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,600
rejuvenate and you're recovering,
you're burning more than you're eating.

2412
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:49,450
And then I'm dropping,
dropping weight.

2413
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,220
It makes the weight cut a lot easier
than once I do the water loads and,

2414
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:56,000
and more towards the way cut.
It's just that much easier and it's a

2415
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:58,060
lot easier going in.
We not like,

2416
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,100
man,
man,

2417
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:02,790
I got to cut another 15 pounds.
I'm already fucking die into socks.

2418
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:03,683
Doing well.

2419
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:05,450
I'm looking at a guy like you,
you know,

2420
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:06,740
if I,
if I didn't know any better,

2421
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,100
like if I wasn't involved in the sport.
Um,

2422
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:14,180
and I saw a guy like you,
that's one 77 and 71 75 wherever you're

2423
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:15,200
at.
And I,

2424
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:17,120
and someone said you're going to fight
at 1:45.

2425
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:17,990
I'd be like,
what?

2426
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,330
Like you're not,
he doesn't have any fat to lose.

2427
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:21,920
Like I'm looking at you like you don't
have,

2428
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,530
you're not fat at all.
It had one 75.

2429
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:28,560
I've always been solid.
I've never been like a real fluffed up

2430
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:31,380
or anything or you know,
I've always just been like one of those

2431
01:37:31,381 --> 01:37:32,640
solid guys.
I've never been.

2432
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:34,770
You never seen me get tossed around or
anything like that.

2433
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:36,090
It just always just been solid.

2434
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,020
Well that's why it's crazy to think that
you could even get down to 1:45.

2435
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,090
I don't,
I don't really lift a lot of weights.

2436
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:45,090
I do.
I do a lot of more footwork explosions

2437
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,320
with medicine balls and kettle bells
and,

2438
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:50,270
and a lot of sprints.
Focus,

2439
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:53,610
cardio cardio's king man,
it really is right and it helps your

2440
01:37:53,611 --> 01:37:56,490
mental out a lot and helps cuts a lot
easier.

2441
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:58,260
A lot of people don't do that.
They just train,

2442
01:37:58,261 --> 01:37:59,310
train,
train killed himself,

2443
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,950
excuse me,
and then they go to cut all that weight

2444
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:04,810
and they don't understand that cardio
help your,

2445
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,120
your,
your mental state.

2446
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,130
The runs and the weight cuts.
Yeah,

2447
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,293
just like,
ah,

2448
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,090
I don't know man.
You just go through breakthroughs like

2449
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,460
when you don't want to run and it's like
you're tired after 75 minutes and you're

2450
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:14,851
like,
man,

2451
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:16,230
fuck dude,
I got to do this run.

2452
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,970
But then when you do it and then you're
like,

2453
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:19,440
man,
I'm going to do it like you got 20 more

2454
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:21,300
minutes and you just like 20 more
minutes and I okay,

2455
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:23,880
I'm going to pick up the pace a little
bit or I'm gonna keep going through.

2456
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,560
Sometimes you'll just kind of get ran
down,

2457
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:27,630
ran down and then like all of a sudden
you'll hit that,

2458
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,150
that final runner or next run and then
boom,

2459
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:31,830
you have a breakthrough.
Next thing you know,

2460
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:34,650
next week you're recovering a little bit
faster.

2461
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,260
He noticed that the fresh guys that are
coming in,

2462
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:40,350
they're getting more tired than you and
just one round and you started having

2463
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:44,910
these little mental breakthroughs in
these little psychological steps.

2464
01:38:44,911 --> 01:38:48,090
You ever read the art of war.
It's just like little little moves like

2465
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:51,270
that that you can kind of see that are,
that are that are approaching your game

2466
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:53,880
and it's just the psychological effect
that like,

2467
01:38:53,881 --> 01:38:54,511
hey man,
I've,

2468
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,150
I've done this cardio and then I ran for
this amount.

2469
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:00,120
I mean the last,
the last camp I ran to Brazil and back.

2470
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:02,220
Basically it's how much I ran.
So I was like,

2471
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:04,200
dude,
there's no way that this guy is going to

2472
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:06,440
push a pace that I can't handle,
you know,

2473
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,110
and it's just these mental breakthroughs
that the runs really help.

2474
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,730
That's interesting.
So you,

2475
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,420
what kind of strength and conditioning,
like what kind of cardio do you do

2476
01:39:15,421 --> 01:39:19,230
outside of running sprints?
Sprint.

2477
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:21,960
Lot of sprints running to.
You heard like dominick Cruz.

2478
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:23,130
I mean that guy just moves,
moves,

2479
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:24,070
moves,
moves in,

2480
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,030
yes.
Sprints.

2481
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,070
This is part of running and then,
um,

2482
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:28,950
you know,
strength to strength,

2483
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:30,750
conditioning,
mixing in sprints with a lot of

2484
01:39:30,751 --> 01:39:32,390
explosive movements,
a lot of footwork,

2485
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:35,460
lot of the dam.
Again,

2486
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,280
Nadia Aguilar does just.
Yep.

2487
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,180
I mean,
I worked with George Castro now at

2488
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:40,350
alliance him in May.
He's,

2489
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:42,390
uh,
he's been with me for awhile and he's

2490
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:44,790
the guy that really,
he's like my big brother when I don't

2491
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:45,930
want to do shit.
And he's like,

2492
01:39:45,931 --> 01:39:46,530
no,
like,

2493
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:48,990
we're going to get this done.
He's that little voice that's like,

2494
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:49,651
yeah,
you can,

2495
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,870
but it's real voice.
He's that dude who can train,

2496
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:53,250
like turn it all the way up.

2497
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:55,590
Somebody I can really push me,
you know,

2498
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:57,270
some guys are just like,
if this guy was over and,

2499
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:58,620
you know,
no offense if he's like yelling at me,

2500
01:39:58,621 --> 01:39:59,610
like,
do these brands that like,

2501
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:03,600
come on Bro.
But we've seen George Castro looked him

2502
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,453
right in the eye.
Yeah,

2503
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,510
he's offended.
And uh,

2504
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:07,390
you know,
George counties,

2505
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,251
just that guy.
He's like,

2506
01:40:08,251 --> 01:40:09,270
my big brother.
He's like,

2507
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:09,691
he's like,
Hey,

2508
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:11,450
let's get to know them really well.
You want to win?

2509
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,363
He's like,
do you want to win?

2510
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,590
Like,
yeah,

2511
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,400
and he,
he just,

2512
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:14,941
he just,
he,

2513
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:17,910
I connect with him mentally.
It's like I can,

2514
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:18,990
I can,
I can feel bro.

2515
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,310
He was like,
he's got a big heart.

2516
01:40:20,311 --> 01:40:22,080
He cares.
He genuinely just really pushing you to

2517
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:23,340
the top.
And Man,

2518
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,550
we've been dominant legalese.
And so when you're doing a,

2519
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:30,030
you're doing sprints and what are the
kinds of things you're doing?

2520
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:32,580
Like conditioning wise?
We hit the track.

2521
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,530
We had the track usually about every
Saturday.

2522
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,350
Uh,
you know,

2523
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:36,990
we're,
we're doing a lot of lateral drills.

2524
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:40,110
We're doing 100 yard sprints were we're
running around the full track sprint,

2525
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:42,540
so a lot of his legs,
legs,

2526
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,070
cardio,
cardio is king.

2527
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:45,210
A lot,
a lot of running.

2528
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:48,570
Do you do the Airdyne you're doing
anything with your arms to the

2529
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:49,830
aerodynamics.
We do,

2530
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:50,671
you know,
lateral drills,

2531
01:40:50,671 --> 01:40:53,090
explosive medicine balls,
throws kettlebells.

2532
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:53,950
What does that,
uh,

2533
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:54,220
the

2534
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,670
wheel with your hands that you do that's
like a bike with your hands.

2535
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,660
A lot of guys do.
Do you do that thing?

2536
01:40:59,661 --> 01:41:00,494
And I'm talking about

2537
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,330
think I'm talking about Broccolis or had
that thing I'd never done that.

2538
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:11,030
Use the old school speed bag.
Is that what you do that are just

2539
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:13,320
getting my uh,
Miguel raise my boxing coach.

2540
01:41:13,321 --> 01:41:13,730
Dude,
he'll,

2541
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:17,090
he'll have you throw in like 5,000
punches and around you know that.

2542
01:41:17,091 --> 01:41:18,560
That guy's the man.
He's Mexican style.

2543
01:41:18,561 --> 01:41:21,530
He's from Tijuana school.
Thai boxer.

2544
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:22,421
Yeah.
What?

2545
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:25,250
It's funny how many fucking bad ass
fighters came out of Mexico.

2546
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:27,620
It's kind of crazy when you really stop
and think about it.

2547
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,600
Like they live in a different world,
man.

2548
01:41:29,601 --> 01:41:31,700
You're talking about drug lords.
If you go down to their,

2549
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:34,010
in their gym and is the price shoot you
like,

2550
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:34,850
Hey,
I want to challenge you.

2551
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:38,180
See Ya.
And Ain't nobody going to care or

2552
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:40,310
mentioned the damn thing or put it on
camera.

2553
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,380
Know.
So I mean that's a different world they

2554
01:41:42,381 --> 01:41:43,130
live in another.

2555
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,730
Do you monitor your heart rate?
Yup.

2556
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:46,580
Yup.
I sure do.

2557
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,110
Yep.
I do the vo two Max and,

2558
01:41:48,111 --> 01:41:50,070
and all that.
And uh,

2559
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,610
I know what zones to kind of stay in
when I'm like,

2560
01:41:52,611 --> 01:41:56,420
just kind of slowly doing my runs.
But then at the same time you can't be a

2561
01:41:56,421 --> 01:41:58,820
pussy and manage your heartbeat.
You got to fucking get after it.

2562
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,860
You know,
you gotta you gotta break yourself,

2563
01:42:00,861 --> 01:42:02,960
Dude.
I mean there are so many times that I

2564
01:42:02,961 --> 01:42:05,960
wanted to quit and that I just felt like
crying and it was just done.

2565
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:08,030
I pushed myself.
But then boom,

2566
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:09,410
I had those mental breakthroughs.
Like,

2567
01:42:09,411 --> 01:42:10,460
you know what,
I fucking finished.

2568
01:42:10,461 --> 01:42:11,294
You did.
I did it.

2569
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,850
Most people went home after,
after wrestling.

2570
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,790
I mean there's times where I find myself
in the gym still running on the

2571
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:20,330
treadmill or running at the beach and no
one's around,

2572
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:21,500
no one I'll,
I'll hit up.

2573
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,760
Some of my friends were like,
oh no,

2574
01:42:22,761 --> 01:42:23,594
no,
you know,

2575
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,030
I'll have like one guy come in and run
with me a few times.

2576
01:42:26,031 --> 01:42:29,540
But sometimes I find myself alone or my
strength conditioning coach will put us

2577
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:32,230
through a workout.
And then I'll go run like another 45

2578
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:35,150
slash 75 or an hour and a half.
And I'll look to my left,

2579
01:42:35,151 --> 01:42:38,230
looked to my right and no one's there,
just like my coach and I'll be like,

2580
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:39,300
where are they at,
George,

2581
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,490
where the,
I like the Diaz,

2582
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,250
you know,
because his name is George George.

2583
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:45,260
And he's like,
that's why you're fucking savages you,

2584
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:47,810
that's why you're going to win.
And that's really what it comes down to.

2585
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:49,430
But as far as the heart rate,
I get it.

2586
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:51,230
I do it.
I followed that program.

2587
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,130
But then there's also a time to kill
yourself on sprints,

2588
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:55,821
you know,
not,

2589
01:42:55,821 --> 01:42:57,620
not like spar,
spar all the time.

2590
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:01,010
I barely spar at all.
I spar probably once a week right now I

2591
01:43:01,011 --> 01:43:02,750
haven't,
I haven't since my fight I've,

2592
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:06,080
I've done tai drills and drilling and
wrestling and strength conditioning.

2593
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:07,550
I've already been doing sprints and
running.

2594
01:43:07,551 --> 01:43:10,440
I just ran an hour easily yesterday and
uh,

2595
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:12,230
I just don't spar,
spar,

2596
01:43:12,231 --> 01:43:13,064
spar,
spar,

2597
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:16,670
preserve me.
You can only get hit so many times

2598
01:43:16,671 --> 01:43:19,120
already.
I already know a fight,

2599
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:22,010
but you know,
when it comes time to an camp,

2600
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:22,470
you know,
I,

2601
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:25,320
I do my sparring or you know,
uh,

2602
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:28,370
probably by Friday I'll spar two rounds,
take around,

2603
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,300
off spar,
around,

2604
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,193
be done.

2605
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:32,870
Alliance is one of the best gyms in the
world.

2606
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:35,000
And Eric del Fierro doesn't get enough
credit.

2607
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:37,970
He's one of those guys.
He's a quiet guy,

2608
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:41,840
doesn't need a lot of attention.
I always put him in a category like Mark

2609
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,770
Henry's,
another one of those guys,

2610
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:46,280
doesn't get enough credit,
just sort of like lays back is not like

2611
01:43:46,281 --> 01:43:49,160
one of those guys that puts a lot of the
spotlight on himself.

2612
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,070
But he's done a phenomenal that Jim is

2613
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,470
amazing.
So many great fighters come out of there

2614
01:43:54,471 --> 01:43:56,450
as well.
We actually got dorms now,

2615
01:43:56,451 --> 01:44:00,230
so these young Mexican fighters and
people from all over are starting to

2616
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:01,480
come into the,
uh,

2617
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:03,020
come into the gym.
We have these little,

2618
01:44:03,021 --> 01:44:04,720
uh,
dorms right next to the gym that,

2619
01:44:04,721 --> 01:44:06,500
uh,
that are open now that are available.

2620
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:09,860
Uh,
we got dominick Cruz just won the title.

2621
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:12,980
You got me when you got Phil Davis when
and he's about to fight for a title

2622
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:15,160
Justin Lawrence's back.
Uh,

2623
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,000
I mean Ross Pearson's there.
I mean he,

2624
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,880
he's fighting a Jorge Mazda at all
coming up.

2625
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:20,930
So,
uh,

2626
01:44:20,931 --> 01:44:23,340
all these guys were putting on good
windstream Pearson's fight.

2627
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,280
Is He fighting one 70?
Yeah,

2628
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:27,320
I think so.
Ross is moving to one 70?

2629
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,610
No,
I think dollars.

2630
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:33,170
$70 go down to 55 again.
No,

2631
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,330
he's fine at one 70.
Oh yeah,

2632
01:44:35,331 --> 01:44:37,450
because he just had that close fight
with or you know,

2633
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:40,490
I think it would maybe last the first or
two rounds and then at the end,

2634
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:41,720
you know,
Ross has putting it on him.

2635
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:43,910
I guess he just hit up.
Joe was like,

2636
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:44,631
Hey,
I heard,

2637
01:44:44,631 --> 01:44:45,560
oh boy.
Backed out.

2638
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:46,351
I'm,
I'm ready to go.

2639
01:44:46,351 --> 01:44:46,891
Awaits.
Good.

2640
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:47,910
And just.
Yeah,

2641
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:51,020
because Ross was fighting at 45 for a
little bit.

2642
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:52,730
Tried 45.
God Damn.

2643
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:54,020
He was skinny.
He didn't like that.

2644
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:55,280
Yeah.
He doesn't like that at all.

2645
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:58,280
He's cutting a lot of weight and I don't
know if he was doing it properly or

2646
01:44:58,281 --> 01:45:00,260
whatnot,
but he just didn't like it and he likes

2647
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:03,350
finding 55.
Ross likes to lift and he's a big dude.

2648
01:45:03,351 --> 01:45:06,670
He's got some big legs on him.
He's a power guy and uh,

2649
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,120
you know,
45 stuff,

2650
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:09,020
dude.
Yeah,

2651
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:11,750
I would imagine it's a takes everything
I got,

2652
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:13,640
but I kinda liked putting into that
point where it's,

2653
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,320
it's,
it's breaking the edge,

2654
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,480
you know,
because there's a point where like,

2655
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:18,150
I'm nice,
I,

2656
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:19,130
I'm,
I'm fine,

2657
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,870
you know,
like fight the whole way in thing.

2658
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:25,400
We'll get into that a little bit later
about how you can weigh in early and

2659
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:28,160
then you eat.
I kind of liked that edge where I feel

2660
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:30,620
like I'm dying and then like I looked
that guy in the eye who's,

2661
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,750
you know,
I think about who he could beat me or

2662
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:33,651
this and that,
you know,

2663
01:45:33,651 --> 01:45:36,400
I'm training from the whole camp and I
kind of liked that,

2664
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,340
that,
that edge,

2665
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:38,390
that,
that switch of that,

2666
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:40,830
that meanness.
It's on motherfucker.

2667
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:43,250
Like I've been trained in long time.
You know,

2668
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,110
I've,
I've put everything into this and it

2669
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:46,880
really takes all,
I got to make 45,

2670
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:50,410
so I kinda like this which for me and
some people may be different.

2671
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:53,690
Do you like the fact that you know,
that he's got to go through that as

2672
01:45:53,691 --> 01:45:56,030
well?
So I like the fact that I have to,

2673
01:45:56,210 --> 01:46:00,800
it takes everything I have in all the
discipline and all hard training to make

2674
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:04,910
145 pounds and once I'm there,
I mean I feel ferocious.

2675
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:09,560
I feel mentally strong and it takes
everything I got and I like doing that

2676
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:13,900
because I'm going to be at my best and
I'm going to perform at my best when

2677
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,770
it's like that,
it's a good mental switch for me to

2678
01:46:15,771 --> 01:46:16,640
have.
I like that.

2679
01:46:16,641 --> 01:46:18,560
That's my style.
That's interesting.

2680
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:21,260
You know,
conor Mcgregor's coach was talking about

2681
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,100
that he thinks that connor not cutting
weight was probably a bad thing for them

2682
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,210
and that,
you know,

2683
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:29,150
fighting Diaz and just being able to eat
whatever he wanted.

2684
01:46:29,151 --> 01:46:33,530
It not go through the grueling pattern
that he's gone through all his other

2685
01:46:33,531 --> 01:46:35,390
fights.
Look at his demeanor though,

2686
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:39,260
at the winds were at 45.
He looks like a savage.

2687
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,750
I mean he looks like death,
like,

2688
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,770
like we all do,
but he looks like he's like,

2689
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:44,090
you know what,
I'm ready.

2690
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:45,260
I'm ready to get after it.
He's,

2691
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:46,310
he looks mean.

2692
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:50,250
When he came in and fought Diaz,
he's smiling and he's all happy.

2693
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:52,050
Just like,
oh Bonnie fast.

2694
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:53,250
See his demeanor.
He was like,

2695
01:46:53,251 --> 01:46:54,990
oh,
nothing's going on.

2696
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,131
It's like,
okay,

2697
01:46:56,131 --> 01:46:57,710
now these guys that are weighing in,
does that,

2698
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:58,950
that,
does that take away a little bit of the

2699
01:46:58,951 --> 01:46:59,741
intensity,
you know,

2700
01:46:59,741 --> 01:47:01,980
it was kind of asking dominic that
little bit and he's just like,

2701
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:03,780
Nah,
it's still going to get after it,

2702
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:04,951
you know,
because I was like,

2703
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,640
man,
if I go back and already you just stay,

2704
01:47:06,641 --> 01:47:07,411
can I come in?
Like,

2705
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:09,660
am I going to be that intense at the,
at the,

2706
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:13,960
do you mean what you're saying is um,
because there's new way in rules where

2707
01:47:13,961 --> 01:47:15,910
you can weigh in way earlier.
So,

2708
01:47:15,911 --> 01:47:18,160
um,
when they announced the weigh ins now,

2709
01:47:18,161 --> 01:47:20,950
like say if the fighters weigh in at
4:00,

2710
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:23,590
you've already weighed in,
you wait in 10:00 in the morning,

2711
01:47:23,591 --> 01:47:25,450
so you've already had a chance to
rehydrate,

2712
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:27,490
get some food,
and then you get back on.

2713
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:30,850
The good thing is everybody looks way
healthier when they weigh in because

2714
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,280
man,
some like connor's perfect example.

2715
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:34,370
Some guys would.
Wayne,

2716
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,940
James Irvin was probably the worst ever.
James Irvin,

2717
01:47:36,941 --> 01:47:39,630
when you would fight at one 85,
like Jesus Christ,

2718
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:44,020
you see him,
he was so drunk and Oh my God,

2719
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:45,250
man,
he was so drained.

2720
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:46,510
He looked,
he looked crazy.

2721
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:49,150
It looked like he was about to die.

2722
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:52,780
First Time I made 45.
I remember seeing you and Dana and you

2723
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:53,950
like Dana was a,
you're right.

2724
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:55,743
Yeah.

2725
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,570
And that was ivy days,
right?

2726
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,500
Yeah.
How much of a difference is it using the

2727
01:48:01,501 --> 01:48:03,920
Nivea and not using an IV?
And I don't really feel a difference to

2728
01:48:03,921 --> 01:48:04,820
be honest.
Really.

2729
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:06,300
I mean,
George Lockhart,

2730
01:48:06,301 --> 01:48:09,520
you may be changing that for me because
of the nutrition that he,

2731
01:48:09,521 --> 01:48:10,640
that he,
he's there,

2732
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:13,200
his whole teams,
they're just feed me coming in and

2733
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:15,800
knocking on my,
my hotel room and like,

2734
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,430
eat this,
do this at this time,

2735
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,870
and it just makes it easier.
And then,

2736
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:19,681
uh,
you know,

2737
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:23,160
they rehydrate me properly and I,
and I believe in those guys in my team

2738
01:48:23,161 --> 01:48:25,950
and the rehydration and I feel the same.
If not,

2739
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:26,820
I feel better.

2740
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,820
So That's interesting.
You feel better?

2741
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:30,200
Hmm.
Yeah.

2742
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,330
Some guys have said that,
like Joe Silva was actually telling me

2743
01:48:32,331 --> 01:48:34,810
that it's actually more effective to do
it orally,

2744
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:36,410
orally.
A lot of doctors

2745
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:37,283
trusted,
uh,

2746
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,660
one of my doctors,
a Brad Arches back home said that,

2747
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:42,630
uh,
he gave me a lot of tips because when

2748
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:43,860
this came in I'm like,
I'm freaking out.

2749
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:44,671
I'm like,
fuck dude,

2750
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:45,650
they're taken with these ivs.
I'm gonna.

2751
01:48:45,651 --> 01:48:47,850
Have to go back 55.
No freaking out,

2752
01:48:47,851 --> 01:48:50,520
you know?
And they were sending me all this stuff,

2753
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:50,821
you know,
and I,

2754
01:48:50,821 --> 01:48:52,260
I read a lot about it because I was
like,

2755
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:53,340
all right,
well do this.

2756
01:48:53,341 --> 01:48:56,970
And then I met Daryl Christian,
one of my wrestling coaches who's a

2757
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,130
WHO's a phenom Olympian,
and uh,

2758
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:01,140
he's just like,
we got to put in this robot dude.

2759
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,700
He's like,
we've got to start building your cardio

2760
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:03,181
base.
He's like,

2761
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:05,430
you've always just killed yourself,
killed yourself.

2762
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:07,530
And then had a kid yourself making
weight.

2763
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,570
He's like,
you never build a cardio base.

2764
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:12,660
He never had a solid foundation.
So then we started these heart rate

2765
01:49:12,661 --> 01:49:15,420
monitors,
vo twos and put in these broad programs,

2766
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:17,160
putting these different sprints.

2767
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,630
But you were always in good shape.
Like,

2768
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:20,400
what do you mean by you didn't have a
cardio base?

2769
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:22,480
Uh,
I was more or less to sprint.

2770
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:25,180
It was just top heavy.
I never really had a low intensity.

2771
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:28,710
And uh,
what is it like the vo two Max?

2772
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:32,560
The reason why people do that is because
a lot of people wanted to know how they

2773
01:49:32,561 --> 01:49:34,930
would build endurance.
And people think that you just need to

2774
01:49:34,931 --> 01:49:35,531
sprint,
sprint,

2775
01:49:35,531 --> 01:49:36,041
sprint,
sprint,

2776
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:37,180
sprint,
and you're gonna be in good shape.

2777
01:49:37,181 --> 01:49:38,470
Granted,
you might be in good shape,

2778
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,400
but none of them had a low base cardio
where they would just run that like say

2779
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:44,610
like a four point eight or five point.
Oh,

2780
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:46,570
on a treadmill for a long period of
time.

2781
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:50,710
And actually how you build the anaerobic
system a lot better is through low base

2782
01:49:50,711 --> 01:49:52,900
cardio.
It's done based system or is it

2783
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,160
aerobics?
Aerobics,

2784
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:57,820
aerobics system is exploding.
Yeah,

2785
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:58,690
they'll,
they'll,

2786
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:02,970
they find that you can expand recovery
and,

2787
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:05,560
and uh,
work harder and a lactic threshold by

2788
01:50:05,561 --> 01:50:08,170
doing the low base cardio like Diaz
does.

2789
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:11,090
Yeah.
It's just constant pressure because you

2790
01:50:11,091 --> 01:50:14,160
got that guy who's going to sprint and
he's gonna head out and then like he's

2791
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:15,380
going to drop down in,
in,

2792
01:50:15,381 --> 01:50:17,020
in that round.
And the guy might be here,

2793
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:18,780
but then he's going to sprint.
But then he just,

2794
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:20,680
he just can't.
He just gonna slowly start to pull in.

2795
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:23,620
That's how diaz he slowly just kind of
just passes you.

2796
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:25,810
The guy may sprint and be punching a
punching him.

2797
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:26,910
And he just sticks pow,
POW,

2798
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:27,390
POW.
Yeah,

2799
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:29,620
well Diaz is hitting you with 50 percent
punches,

2800
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:34,390
but he's hitting you with 30 times more
constants and then in the round he's

2801
01:50:34,391 --> 01:50:37,210
able to recover even better while you're
already at lactic threshold.

2802
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:39,510
Then you try to,
you try to fire up the heart rate again.

2803
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:42,050
It's like dude,
your body's like managed to shot and

2804
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:46,300
they found out through those video and
those runs that the aerobic base is

2805
01:50:46,301 --> 01:50:50,020
built more through low base cardio and
that's what he's talking about building

2806
01:50:50,021 --> 01:50:52,840
the base because you can't slow pace
cardio low,

2807
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:53,733
low,
low,

2808
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:56,710
low pace and that you can't just build a
house without a base.

2809
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:58,450
Need that base.
And that's what I really started

2810
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:01,570
learning and honestly I feel a lot more
efficient.

2811
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:05,860
I feel a lot more healthier and in my
cardio even a lot better in the fights I

2812
01:51:05,861 --> 01:51:06,620
believe.

2813
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:11,180
That's interesting.
So the long runs and the long cardio,

2814
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:16,130
it sort of like a,
a solid foundation and then sprints on

2815
01:51:16,131 --> 01:51:19,610
top of that explosion on top of that.
Got To do it all.

2816
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:22,370
Do you follow like a Tabata protocol or
anything like that?

2817
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,300
Do you know what that is?
Wouldn't know was to butter Tabata is a,

2818
01:51:25,301 --> 01:51:28,750
an endurance protocol that uh,
I don't know why,

2819
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:33,940
why it's called Tabata,
but I believe it's like a 22nd sprints

2820
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:37,550
followed by 10 seconds of rest,
20 seconds sprints.

2821
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,810
There's,
there's some sort of.

2822
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,960
My friend John Rollo told me about it
and a lot of athletes apparently follow

2823
01:51:44,001 --> 01:51:44,870
it.
Here it is.

2824
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:47,990
What is Tabata Tabata training is the
most popular one of the most popular

2825
01:51:47,991 --> 01:51:51,860
forms of high intensity interval
training consists of eight rounds of

2826
01:51:51,861 --> 01:51:56,420
ultra high intensity exercises in a
specific 20 seconds on 10 seconds off

2827
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,530
interval.
Yup.

2828
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:00,700
So when it says eight rounds,
so I guess eight,

2829
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:04,740
22nd sprints and eight ten second rests.
So

2830
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,560
I do a little bit of Tabata training for
sure.

2831
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:10,940
I mean we even go even doing 30 seconds,
45 seconds and then you know,

2832
01:52:10,941 --> 01:52:15,770
eventually it peaks off in itself,
but for sure 100 percent and be be doing

2833
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:17,240
that as well.
And then low based training.

2834
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,370
That's it.

2835
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:23,370
Interesting that you're a big proponent
of that long slow style because that was

2836
01:52:23,711 --> 01:52:26,920
one of the things that some people that
weren't fighters,

2837
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:30,080
but we're a strength and conditioning
people would say that that's not going

2838
01:52:30,081 --> 01:52:31,860
to benefit you,
you know,

2839
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:34,690
they would say that's not what you need
to do in a fight because a fight is

2840
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:37,690
explosion.
It's fast and you don't have that slow

2841
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:39,940
running thing.
But old school,

2842
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:42,970
like old school boxers,
they all ran like that.

2843
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,320
They all ran long miles.
Yeah.

2844
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:46,010
And they ran

2845
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,110
slower.
Do you ever see Mike Tyson in his early

2846
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:50,520
days?
Just slowly running for him?

2847
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,030
Yeah,
he was running five miles,

2848
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:54,710
five miles.
You could probably get done within low,

2849
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:55,581
low pace,
you know,

2850
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:56,930
35,
45 minutes.

2851
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,580
You know,
it's Kinda interesting because my

2852
01:52:58,581 --> 01:53:00,470
strength conditioning coach now,
George Castro,

2853
01:53:00,471 --> 01:53:02,450
he used to workout with Don Frye and
he'd be like,

2854
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:03,471
he'd be like,
man,

2855
01:53:03,471 --> 01:53:06,170
one day I was stretching into the like,
well what the fuck you do get,

2856
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:07,610
get gloves on,
get in the ring.

2857
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,110
And he was like,
take off your shirt,

2858
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:09,950
let's do this,
you know?

2859
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:11,930
And then like they just go,
but there was no,

2860
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:13,930
there was no structure to it.
But now you know,

2861
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,500
we're,
we're meeting these coaches and the,

2862
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,090
the,
the scientists and behind it,

2863
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:17,530
you know,
and,

2864
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:18,380
and uh,
you know,

2865
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:20,360
my only a Olympian coach,
Darrell Christian,

2866
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:21,290
he's just like,
dude,

2867
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,480
he's like,
you cannot build high based cardio,

2868
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,410
bike sprints,
press print,

2869
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:25,220
killing herself.

2870
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,310
He's like,
we got to build this low base and he's

2871
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,300
also a spinal surgeon,
you know,

2872
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:31,880
and he's also been in the game for a
long time and he's like,

2873
01:53:31,881 --> 01:53:35,690
that's how all these fighters and top
notch guys would stay in shape all year

2874
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:36,920
round.
It was drilling,

2875
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:37,551
drilling,
drilling,

2876
01:53:37,551 --> 01:53:38,510
drilling,
and he was like,

2877
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:41,240
we would just do long runs anytime we
get a break.

2878
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,400
We had to be doing long runs like every
other day.

2879
01:53:43,401 --> 01:53:45,080
And he's like,
that's why we were able to make weight,

2880
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:47,900
stay on task and be in shape all the
time.

2881
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:51,500
And he's to make sense man.
And it really makes sense when you talk

2882
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:52,960
about the Diaz brothers,
you know,

2883
01:53:52,961 --> 01:53:54,110
as I was saying,
Diaz,

2884
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:57,730
but really both the Diaz brothers.
But nate is a little different than NEC

2885
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,780
has.
Nate will explode more than nick.

2886
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:03,380
Nate has a little more fire power when
he goes after dudes,

2887
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:08,270
but both those guys are known for doing
triathlons and you know,

2888
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:13,271
nick even more so than,
and you know what they smoke weed to do

2889
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:17,540
and then they and then they go out and
then they'll just run forever and that's

2890
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:18,374
okay.

2891
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:20,540
You're just building that base,
building that car to you and they,

2892
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:23,090
they just,
they had those mental breakthroughs.

2893
01:54:23,091 --> 01:54:23,451
Like,
dude,

2894
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:28,280
I ran three hours after practice.
Like what the fuck are you going to do

2895
01:54:28,281 --> 01:54:30,380
to me?
I'm going to keep pacing on you and

2896
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:31,021
you'll see it.
I,

2897
01:54:31,021 --> 01:54:35,600
I can break people in the gym by
constant pressure pace and then like I

2898
01:54:35,601 --> 01:54:37,640
can recover within 20,
30 seconds.

2899
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:38,474
Why?
They're like,

2900
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:39,790
right.
You know,

2901
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:42,500
and their,
their bodies is breaking down and it

2902
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,260
truly does work.
And it's just a simple science.

2903
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:49,300
Isn't it funny because the glamor stuff
is explosions,

2904
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:52,190
right?
The glamor stuff is cleans and snatches.

2905
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:58,040
Throwing fucking tires around a parking
lot and sledge hammer in a tire on it.

2906
01:54:58,041 --> 01:55:00,930
Kettle bells that look like they're 10
pounds that weigh like 101.

2907
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,050
If you ever done the uh,
Keith Weber Kettle Bell Co,

2908
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,720
extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

2909
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:08,290
No Dude,
this is another fucking.

2910
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:10,510
Yeah.
What's crazy about it is it's 40.

2911
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,380
He'll you do it with a 35 pound bell and
you're like bitch ass 35 pound

2912
01:55:15,381 --> 01:55:17,990
Kettlebell with flex.
I going to do it seems like nothing.

2913
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:20,270
It's not like glamorous because it's
light,

2914
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:22,880
but man,
it breaks you.

2915
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,620
It breaks you.
Yeah.

2916
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:25,850
Yeah.
We have it.

2917
01:55:25,851 --> 01:55:26,830
I'll have,
I'll have on it.

2918
01:55:26,831 --> 01:55:29,930
Send you one man.
I think there's one too when I think he

2919
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:32,540
has a three out now.
But Dan,

2920
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:35,480
he's a stud.
I've had that guy in here too.

2921
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:38,270
He's a fucking master when it comes to
these,

2922
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:40,070
um,
these workouts and it's the same thing.

2923
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:44,160
It's 45 minutes man.
And it's just breaks you down.

2924
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,350
I do it.
And when I started out,

2925
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,480
like for the first 20 seconds,
I'm like,

2926
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:50,430
how am I even going to get tired doing
this?

2927
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,350
Two minutes later I'm like,
oh my God,

2928
01:55:52,351 --> 01:55:54,410
I got 38 more minutes of this.
Yeah.

2929
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:55,830
The fuck I'm going to do this.
Yeah.

2930
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:59,700
It's the glamorous shit is like
explosions,

2931
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:01,560
right?
The glamorous shit is ridiculous,

2932
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:04,270
but hitting the bag,
but it's,

2933
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:06,420
that's more,
it's more fun to do anyway.

2934
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,310
Oh,
is this it?

2935
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,103
Yeah,
this.

2936
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:15,270
Oh see,
it seems like it seems like not that big

2937
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:16,470
a deal,
right?

2938
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,450
Like what are you doing?
You get this little bitch ass.

2939
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:23,451
Wait,
you only doing 35 pounds but my long

2940
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:29,120
periods of time doing just difficult
shit like this and just constantly

2941
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:33,420
moving and squad and then yeah,
I think there's something real to

2942
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:34,170
running,
man.

2943
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:38,190
I think running is something.
There's something about long slow

2944
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:39,390
running.
The mental,

2945
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:40,900
I think it is that right

2946
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,420
challenge.
Anybody go out on a run and don't take

2947
01:56:43,421 --> 01:56:45,550
your phone.
Just go out on a run where you have to

2948
01:56:45,551 --> 01:56:46,810
run.
Like say you run two,

2949
01:56:46,811 --> 01:56:49,330
two and a half miles and you don't
listen to music and you have to go back.

2950
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:51,730
I do,
but a lot of people they just,

2951
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,580
they'll run like 15 minutes and I'm
like,

2952
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,870
they're done.
When you say don't take your phone,

2953
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:58,660
what do you really try to challenge
yourself like one time?

2954
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,630
Just because sometimes I listen to music
and sometimes I just like to listen to

2955
01:57:01,631 --> 01:57:03,160
my thoughts.
Like what am I thinking right now?

2956
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:06,710
What are my thoughts?
What are my thoughts bringing me and uh,

2957
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:10,630
it's hard to.
It's meant it's mentally you'll find

2958
01:57:10,631 --> 01:57:12,220
out.
It's more mentally,

2959
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:14,860
uh,
than anything than the physical.

2960
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,540
Do you get addicted to that?
Runner's high.

2961
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,010
Yeah.
Do you know what sex is better?

2962
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:19,480
Dude.
You know,

2963
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,250
sex.
Sex is better.

2964
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:24,820
Sleep dude.
Especially inclined sprints.

2965
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,650
I just feel like your testosterone's a
little,

2966
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:30,100
but yeah,
it definitely is a good sprint hollow.

2967
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:35,170
Anytime you're doing like real intense
stuff,

2968
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:38,080
like high intensity things like
sprinting they say is really good for

2969
01:57:38,081 --> 01:57:39,250
your testosterone.
Yeah.

2970
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,320
Hill sprints in particular,
right?

2971
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:45,190
Yup.
Hill sprints or inclines a treadmill's

2972
01:57:45,250 --> 01:57:46,083
uh,
you know,

2973
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:50,020
even working with kettlebells ever hit
like a good kettlebell session.

2974
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:51,070
Then we can just like,
man,

2975
01:57:51,071 --> 01:57:54,460
I feel freaking good.
Your testosterone's moving,

2976
01:57:54,461 --> 01:57:57,280
you just feel a lot more BC.
Yeah.

2977
01:57:57,281 --> 01:58:00,580
It's interesting how high intensity
stuff does that spikes your endocrine

2978
01:58:00,581 --> 01:58:01,810
system?
Yeah,

2979
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,970
I love that.
I like to feel bad and say it's a

2980
01:58:03,971 --> 01:58:06,970
natural good feeling that I have.
I'm 30 years old and never injected

2981
01:58:06,971 --> 01:58:09,060
anything in my life and uh,
I like,

2982
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:12,550
I like that high and the mental aspect
of it,

2983
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:16,150
that's kind of interesting too because
people do take steroids just like man

2984
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,230
now that,
that little,

2985
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:19,710
that little edge that they got the
little high than they were getting in.

2986
01:58:19,711 --> 01:58:20,381
They're just like,
yeah,

2987
01:58:20,381 --> 01:58:22,510
I'm killing it.
But then when they stopped doing that,

2988
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:24,690
mentally they get fucked dude.
Like,

2989
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:27,130
dude,
like man must still the same guy.

2990
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:30,250
My Body looks different.
I never really put in the work with.

2991
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,020
He used to say that,
you know,

2992
01:58:32,021 --> 01:58:33,340
and then like what you think about,
like you're like,

2993
01:58:33,341 --> 01:58:35,200
man is there,
mental has got to be broken,

2994
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,030
you know,
like what the hell

2995
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,710
you ever see Dan Gable,
uh,

2996
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:41,980
or hear him talking about that when he
was competing against the back

2997
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,960
during the doping days where the
Russians,

2998
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:48,100
he knew they were all on steroids,
but his philosophy was banned from the

2999
01:58:48,101 --> 01:58:49,900
Olympics.
They didn't actually,

3000
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:52,810
they didn't change it.
They were about to get banned totally,

3001
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:56,680
but they pulled back and they got a real
problem with Brazil.

3002
01:58:56,681 --> 01:58:57,620
Do you hear those?
Um,

3003
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:01,690
those Australian people were staying in
the Olympic village like this fucking

3004
01:59:01,691 --> 01:59:03,190
place.
The toilets were all backed up.

3005
01:59:03,191 --> 01:59:06,040
His electrical wires hanging out of the
fucking walls.

3006
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:08,920
It's not safe.
And it was over the Dan Gable thing

3007
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:11,680
though.
Dan Gable is a fucking animal,

3008
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:13,120
right?
One of the best wrestlers ever.

3009
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:18,360
Dan said that when he was competing that
he felt like it didn't matter if those

3010
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:21,880
guys did steroids because they didn't do
the work.

3011
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,710
So they knew that they didn't do the
work.

3012
01:59:23,711 --> 01:59:26,440
So in their head,
if one thing went wrong,

3013
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:28,780
they would unfold and fall apart and he
will break them.

3014
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:33,100
He felt like he had a mental advantage
over guys that did steroids.

3015
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,580
The guys that cheated,
that they were not going to be able to

3016
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:37,810
beat him.
It didn't matter.

3017
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:38,980
Know.
And he was right.

3018
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,430
I mean he beat everybody.
I believe that when,

3019
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:44,350
like I said,
when you're doing these runs and he's

3020
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:46,930
mental breakthroughs and you're really
putting in the work and when it's all

3021
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:49,390
said and done and then you're peaking
and everything kind of wears off and

3022
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,590
everything's just flowing,
right.

3023
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:53,650
It's like you just look in the mirror
and you're like,

3024
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,360
look at that guy and you're like,
dude,

3025
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:57,580
there's nothing that you can do that's
going to break me.

3026
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:59,490
I've already been broken down many of
times.

3027
01:59:59,491 --> 02:00:02,680
It's the same thing the army does.
They break you down to build you up and

3028
02:00:02,681 --> 02:00:04,930
then when you're in that complete,
when you've,

3029
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,390
when you've pushed yourself passionate
limits and you've had those mental

3030
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:09,640
breakthroughs of where you thought about
quitting,

3031
02:00:09,641 --> 02:00:12,850
but then you kept going and then you did
it again and again and again,

3032
02:00:12,851 --> 02:00:15,220
and you keep pushing like your boy did
the 100 miles.

3033
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:17,050
Now he's going to do 200.
You know,

3034
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:20,650
just mentally he has an advantage over a
lot of people.

3035
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,780
You get comfortable in that horrible
state.

3036
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:24,220
Yeah.
Being uncomfortable.

3037
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,190
Uncomfortable.
Yeah.

3038
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:27,370
Yeah.
Dan gambled those.

3039
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:31,180
There's a cautionary tale on that as
well because Dan Gables had two hip

3040
02:00:31,181 --> 02:00:32,980
replacements,
knee replacements,

3041
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:34,030
like his body,
bro.

3042
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:37,200
He's so tough.
He broke his body and that's uh,

3043
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:38,063
that,
that is,

3044
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:39,880
you know,
I've always wondered about guys like

3045
02:00:39,881 --> 02:00:42,940
maybe Cain Velasquez or these guys that
are constantly getting injured.

3046
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:45,450
Like they're almost too tough.
Yup.

3047
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,170
Maybe they're not training.
Right.

3048
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,940
You know,
you've got to stay up on Rehab as much

3049
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:50,170
as you're training.
Man.

3050
02:00:50,171 --> 02:00:51,090
I'm at home,
you know,

3051
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,990
everybody's talking about Netflix and
chill.

3052
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:55,780
When I go home I'm on a,
I'm on a Lacrosse Ball,

3053
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:59,980
I'm on a foam roller,
a I got a bow staff state that I had a

3054
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:00,730
tip,
you know,

3055
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:03,970
getting into my neck,
like a bow staff.

3056
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,970
And I had a,
my mean like a,

3057
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:09,600
um,
like what guys like hit each other with

3058
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:13,110
and I had it tipped out so that like I
can like dig into my neck,

3059
02:01:13,111 --> 02:01:16,060
my neck and put it into the wall.
So it has like a point at the top

3060
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:18,310
because normally shaved down like a
pencil.

3061
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,330
Yeah.
Pretty much.

3062
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:21,550
Javin yourself with a fucking vampire
stake.

3063
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:23,920
Yup.
Right into all my muscles that are sore

3064
02:01:23,921 --> 02:01:25,300
and it.
And you do it yourself.

3065
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:26,830
Yeah.
Myofascial release.

3066
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,170
Oh Wow.
And you stick it in your neck?

3067
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:30,790
Yep.
Neck pecs,

3068
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,490
subscap.
Again in my,

3069
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:35,620
you know,
breaking up my abdominals,

3070
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:37,540
getting into my calves,
you know,

3071
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:38,500
when,
when I'm at home,

3072
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:38,891
you know,
because I,

3073
02:01:38,891 --> 02:01:40,160
I like Rehab from,

3074
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,570
uh,
from my therapist,

3075
02:01:41,571 --> 02:01:44,480
like once a week when I'm in camp,
but on the outside,

3076
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:46,430
like I'm constantly maintenance in my
body,

3077
02:01:46,431 --> 02:01:47,061
the injuries,
you know,

3078
02:01:47,061 --> 02:01:50,270
when I'm throwing those bombs of right
hands and stuff.

3079
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:50,661
I'm like,
man,

3080
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:52,220
I'm freaking sore.
My next Jack,

3081
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:53,250
my back's Jack,
you know.

3082
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:55,060
Have you ever used one of these things?
Man,

3083
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,140
this is a.
Oh yeah,

3084
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,113
one of those.
Uh,

3085
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,930
I go,
I got one of supernovas that's,

3086
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:02,120
I liked that one,
but I like the big one even better.

3087
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:06,620
The Wad supernova from a rogue fitness,
they have those.

3088
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:09,350
I live by that big one man.
I like the little one,

3089
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:13,580
but honestly more pinpoint the ones will
break up like the bigger areas and it's

3090
02:02:13,581 --> 02:02:14,414
good.
But then when she,

3091
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,060
once you break that down,
you want to get even more pinpoint.

3092
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:18,590
Yeah.
In lacrosse ball,

3093
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:22,220
he didn't use you loser.
Lacrosse balls just as good and a lot of

3094
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,440
ways that one's got a little bit more
texture to it.

3095
02:02:24,441 --> 02:02:25,940
So some people like that.
But you know,

3096
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:27,380
this is,
this is legitimate here.

3097
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:28,790
Rogue.
Yeah.

3098
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:31,880
So when you broke fitness,
they got a lot of great shit man.

3099
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:35,480
I got one of those.
I'm a reverse hyper machines from them

3100
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:38,180
two in the back.
You ever used that reverse hyper,

3101
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:40,560
hyper ice fibrates sort of?
No,

3102
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:40,791
no,
no,

3103
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:41,750
no.
Reverse hypers.

3104
02:02:41,751 --> 02:02:42,581
Uh,
it's a,

3105
02:02:42,581 --> 02:02:44,750
uh,
it's a decompression machine.

3106
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:45,770
Oh,
you,

3107
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:47,330
uh,
you lift with it.

3108
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,030
It's Louie Simmons from west side
barbell invented it.

3109
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,320
And what it is,
is,

3110
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:54,380
um,
you can show it right here.

3111
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,600
It's like you,
you go,

3112
02:02:56,700 --> 02:02:59,990
it pulls you down,
show them in a video if you can,

3113
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:05,260
you lean your body over this platform.
And then when you let the weight down,

3114
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,330
it actually,
it's like a,

3115
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:12,620
a,
and the active decompression for your

3116
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:14,210
back.
That's Louie Simmons.

3117
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:17,240
He's a pretty,
pretty much a legendary power lifter

3118
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:20,540
guy,
but also super smart dude and so like

3119
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:22,910
when she's lifting it up there,
when it's going down,

3120
02:03:22,911 --> 02:03:27,911
it's decompressing her spine so it's,
it's strengthening it on the up,

3121
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:32,660
but on the down it's pulling it apart
and so because the distance that the

3122
02:03:32,661 --> 02:03:37,661
weight travels underneath you,
it asks for an active decompression of

3123
02:03:37,821 --> 02:03:38,960
the back.
It's phenomenal,

3124
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:41,180
man.
I was having some back issues.

3125
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,160
Nothing helped me a lot.
Yup.

3126
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,910
Do you do any yoga or anything like
that?

3127
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:51,310
I do hot yoga when I'm in camp every
Friday I like at 4:30.

3128
02:03:51,311 --> 02:03:55,870
I go and do a hot yoga and I do an hour
and a half and that in itself is a

3129
02:03:55,871 --> 02:03:57,310
mental thing.
You got to get through because I look

3130
02:03:57,311 --> 02:03:57,761
over.
I'm like,

3131
02:03:57,761 --> 02:03:59,000
damn,
it's got to be like an hour.

3132
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:04,060
You how have a look over it?
We were in there 10 minutes and then I

3133
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:05,171
look over.
I'm like,

3134
02:04:05,171 --> 02:04:06,310
man,
this old guy is doing it.

3135
02:04:06,311 --> 02:04:08,470
I can do it right.
Get all my girls in there.

3136
02:04:08,471 --> 02:04:09,940
You know,
I got to be the man saw my,

3137
02:04:09,941 --> 02:04:12,220
you know,
I gotta I gotTa step up and to get

3138
02:04:12,221 --> 02:04:13,070
through them.
Damn things.

3139
02:04:13,290 --> 02:04:15,520
It's intense.
I do that twice a week and I've done it,

3140
02:04:15,521 --> 02:04:17,170
you know,
I'm not going to lay on my back and just

3141
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:19,750
focus on breathing because all my,
oh my job,

3142
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:22,090
you know,
and you're already cutting weight and

3143
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:24,910
got a full week of training and you're
probably dehydrated too.

3144
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:27,510
I always try to drink a lot of water.
I mean I'm,

3145
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:30,490
I'm drinking water constantly.
I try to get over a gallon a day.

3146
02:04:30,491 --> 02:04:34,200
I got to alkaline machine machine.
Yeah.

3147
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:36,700
What does that shoe.
It keeps your body in higher alkaline

3148
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:38,400
which your body naturally

3149
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:42,930
he's got like a five or whatever they
say to be over a five or better because

3150
02:04:42,931 --> 02:04:46,290
you're a cancer cannot survive in a
higher alkaline,

3151
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:49,590
uh,
like almost acs type stuff.

3152
02:04:49,591 --> 02:04:52,680
Like if your body's like broken down,
that's how you're able to get sick as if

3153
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:54,510
your immune system is broken down.
Well,

3154
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:57,750
this actually helps with a faster
rehydration recovery and keeps your body

3155
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:01,950
in a higher alkaline state.
So it's harder to get shit done.

3156
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,510
Yeah.
I don't know.

3157
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:08,460
Jamie looked that up because I've heard
that you really can't change the

3158
02:05:08,461 --> 02:05:11,490
alkaline state of your body or of your
blood.

3159
02:05:11,491 --> 02:05:12,890
I don't know.
Things that you can do it.

3160
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:15,270
Let me.
Wheat Grass keeps you in higher alkaline

3161
02:05:15,271 --> 02:05:16,890
and I mean I.
But,

3162
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,470
but is it a,
your blood more alkaline?

3163
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:20,304
Like what?
What is,

3164
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:22,560
what is getting more alkaline?
Your blood?

3165
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:24,570
Yeah.
I don't know if that's true,

3166
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,060
but what about the honest supplement
says say that uh,

3167
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:28,530
you know,
they're from higher,

3168
02:05:28,531 --> 02:05:32,790
a higher altitude and that they're
getting it from these grounds.

3169
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:34,110
That's cordyceps.
Mushrooms,

3170
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:37,440
that's different.
Cordyceps mushroom is a mushroom that

3171
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:41,610
aids and oxygen utilization that doesn't
have anything to do with see what,

3172
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:43,270
what people do.
Um,

3173
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:46,170
there's like a lot of talk about
alkaline,

3174
02:05:46,171 --> 02:05:49,130
like making your blood alkaline and how
it changes.

3175
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:52,260
But I remember reading something that,
that's Horseshit,

3176
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,380
but first of all,
what you're doing is all healthy.

3177
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:57,450
Like if you're telling me you'd taken
wheat grass juice,

3178
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:59,790
you're getting fido nutrients,
you're getting,

3179
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:01,590
you know,
all sorts of minerals that you're

3180
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:05,580
getting healthy vitamins for sure.
It's definitely really good for you.

3181
02:06:05,581 --> 02:06:08,070
So wheat grass juice is phenomenal.
I mean,

3182
02:06:08,071 --> 02:06:10,410
I,
I try to eat my body and in the state

3183
02:06:10,411 --> 02:06:12,930
and I'm always drinking that water.
Test your blood.

3184
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,430
I mean,
how do you know that you're in an

3185
02:06:14,431 --> 02:06:16,620
alkaline state?
Are you testing yourself?

3186
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:18,080
Uh,
I have tested,

3187
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:20,730
I've tested the water of life taking
strips and test it out,

3188
02:06:20,731 --> 02:06:21,330
but no,
I've never,

3189
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:23,100
I haven't tested my blood to see if I
am.

3190
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,840
The only time I've done that was with
uh,

3191
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:27,060
when I took like the Piss test is a
test,

3192
02:06:27,061 --> 02:06:30,330
my rehydration and stuff.
The guy he lives let you look it in the

3193
02:06:30,331 --> 02:06:31,280
scope.
The Usada Guy,

3194
02:06:31,281 --> 02:06:32,330
you know,
he comes in and he's like,

3195
02:06:32,331 --> 02:06:33,360
Hey,
pull your pants down,

3196
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:36,120
start paying.
And then he'll put it in there.

3197
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,650
And uh,
the guy he was,

3198
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,060
the last time I did it,
he's like,

3199
02:06:39,061 --> 02:06:39,990
look at the light,
see that?

3200
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:42,000
And like I was,
I was pretty high and he's like,

3201
02:06:42,001 --> 02:06:42,750
this is good.
He's like,

3202
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:44,220
that means you're really hydrated.
And he's like,

3203
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:46,590
that's really good.
It's definitely good to be hydrated.

3204
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:49,770
Drinking a lot of water,
especially when you're training as much

3205
02:06:49,771 --> 02:06:51,750
as you are.
It's very,

3206
02:06:51,751 --> 02:06:52,920
very,
very important.

3207
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:57,960
They say that just a small percentage of
dehydration has a big impact on I fletc

3208
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,480
performance.
Yeah.

3209
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,353
Thirty percent.

3210
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,390
Really a little bit dehydrated.
Wow.

3211
02:07:02,530 --> 02:07:06,840
A decrease it by 30 percent towing a fax
to that.

3212
02:07:06,841 --> 02:07:09,390
I've learned in the Fitness Vet
Lockhart,

3213
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,613
uh,
you know,

3214
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:13,500
the sumo wrestlers,
the only twice a day,

3215
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:17,130
but they're eating only twice a day.
Their body conserves a lot more because

3216
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:17,521
they're like,
oh,

3217
02:07:17,521 --> 02:07:18,810
this is the only food that we're going
to get.

3218
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:23,670
And they hold onto it as competitive.
Like we eat a $45 wheat like five,

3219
02:07:23,671 --> 02:07:26,610
six times a day.
So our body constantly pushing it out.

3220
02:07:26,611 --> 02:07:26,880
Like,
oh,

3221
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,780
we're going to get more.
We get more than with just like water,

3222
02:07:29,781 --> 02:07:32,460
water's like gas and where you put in,
the more you're going to burn off.

3223
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,271
Right.
That's a,

3224
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:37,630
that's a counter intuitive thing that
you hear about guys cutting weight.

3225
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:40,960
They drink a ton of water before they
have to dehydrate themselves,

3226
02:07:40,961 --> 02:07:42,940
so your body's used to extending that
water.

3227
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:45,400
It doesn't try to hold onto it.
Is that the idea behind it?

3228
02:07:45,401 --> 02:07:46,770
Yep.
Excuse.

3229
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:47,321
It's like,
oh,

3230
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:50,140
we're going to get more and more so just
it'll just keep expanding out,

3231
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:51,370
push it out,
push it out.

3232
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:55,540
Do you fuck around with distilled water
now?

3233
02:07:55,541 --> 02:07:57,470
I haven't in a long time.
I haven't heard that.

3234
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:59,440
It's of dangerous.
That's not good for your body,

3235
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:01,930
right?
Because your body can actually be.

3236
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:06,940
It strips you of minerals because you.
Your water's supposed to be attached to

3237
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:09,670
all these minerals and when you just
drinking only distilled water,

3238
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:11,130
your body kind of freaks out.
Yup.

3239
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,940
That can be dangerous.
Too much of that.

3240
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:16,840
And I've heard of people kinda like
convulsing.

3241
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:19,060
I think I sent somebody from the
ultimate fighter show one time,

3242
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,820
like water load and then fell asleep and
then he was like,

3243
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:25,180
you know,
that probably freaked me out a little

3244
02:08:25,181 --> 02:08:26,880
bit,
but what's fucked up is if you could

3245
02:08:26,881 --> 02:08:28,450
drink too much water,
you can die.

3246
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:29,570
Yeah.
And I,

3247
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:30,970
I saw our,
remember,

3248
02:08:30,971 --> 02:08:34,120
uh,
I was in Sacramento I think.

3249
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,610
And there was a,
maybe a San Jose,

3250
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:38,980
I don't remember if it was a local radio
show,

3251
02:08:38,981 --> 02:08:41,680
had a contest to drink the most water to
when a playstation.

3252
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,080
And this lady drank so much water.
She died.

3253
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,430
Yeah.
I was like,

3254
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:47,380
I didn't know you could fucking die from
water.

3255
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,990
Apparently.
Like frats,

3256
02:08:49,991 --> 02:08:54,970
like people like pledging for frats.
People have died from it to a hazing

3257
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:55,951
type stuff.
Yeah.

3258
02:08:55,951 --> 02:08:56,681
Yeah,
exactly.

3259
02:08:56,681 --> 02:08:58,600
That's crazy.
Funny thing about alkaline.

3260
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:02,180
I found a website talking about it.
I don't know if this is how legit said

3261
02:09:02,181 --> 02:09:05,260
per precise nutrition.com.
It just talks about the claims of

3262
02:09:05,261 --> 02:09:10,261
alkaline water and it really says
there's no legit studies that even said

3263
02:09:10,951 --> 02:09:13,150
that it'll do anything to.
You did that,

3264
02:09:13,151 --> 02:09:16,390
you were that you can even make it
change to an alkaline state.

3265
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:16,861
Yeah.
See,

3266
02:09:16,861 --> 02:09:19,680
that's what I was seeing that the
variables,

3267
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:24,710
the variation is so small that that it's
like you're not going to get that from

3268
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:30,530
like water tested the water before.
I've never tested my own blood and I've

3269
02:09:30,570 --> 02:09:32,790
only seen the that I was rehydrated at
a,

3270
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:35,430
at a high alkaline,
but I mean there might be some sort of

3271
02:09:35,431 --> 02:09:39,630
benefit to it anyway.
Even if you can't like change the actual

3272
02:09:39,631 --> 02:09:42,180
state of your blood.
I mean there's some sort of benefit for

3273
02:09:42,181 --> 02:09:44,520
it biologically.
One maybe ask George.

3274
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:46,650
Maybe he would know.
He probably know more than we would.

3275
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:51,170
The only thing it does say that might be
why it's his kidney.

3276
02:09:51,171 --> 02:09:55,190
Patients should avoid alkaline water,
which is why athletes and exercises are

3277
02:09:55,191 --> 02:09:57,440
one subgroup who might benefit from
drinking it.

3278
02:09:57,770 --> 02:09:59,690
I don't know what that statement really
means,

3279
02:09:59,691 --> 02:10:03,710
but it doesn't make sense.
That's the only thing really adds in

3280
02:10:03,711 --> 02:10:04,220
there.

3281
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:05,750
Do you ever fuck around with
cryotherapy?

3282
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:07,250
I've done it.
Yeah.

3283
02:10:07,251 --> 02:10:10,220
I really find that fund the difference.
I find more or less a mile fashion.

3284
02:10:10,221 --> 02:10:12,380
Having somebody digging in with like an
elbow or something,

3285
02:10:12,381 --> 02:10:14,510
it's a lot more beneficial.
I've done cryotherapy.

3286
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:16,790
What about both?
I mean,

3287
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:19,010
I don't think there's anything that you
could do for Rehab.

3288
02:10:19,011 --> 02:10:19,360
I mean,
I've,

3289
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,850
I've done the float tanks and stuff like
that.

3290
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:24,500
Just time to where I'd get my mind at
ease and it's pitch black.

3291
02:10:24,501 --> 02:10:26,790
I don't have my kids running around,
you know,

3292
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,210
ask him for juice and take me here.
Take me there,

3293
02:10:29,211 --> 02:10:30,620
you know,
any of that.

3294
02:10:30,621 --> 02:10:31,730
So it's good.
I mean,

3295
02:10:31,731 --> 02:10:33,950
any type of recovery that you do.
I mean

3296
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,590
if you're a high level athlete and
you're out there just banging on your

3297
02:10:36,591 --> 02:10:38,540
body,
I mean any mile Fascia,

3298
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:41,540
release a cryotherapy flow,
you know,

3299
02:10:41,541 --> 02:10:44,660
any type of meditation floats,
phenomenal for um,

3300
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:47,420
um,
magnesium too because that like epsom

3301
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:49,640
salts bath,
not the floating is great because your

3302
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:53,270
body absorbs magnesium but float tanks
filled with epsom salts.

3303
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:55,200
You get a lot of magnesium from that,
that way.

3304
02:10:55,590 --> 02:10:57,200
And you're able to relax too.
Yeah.

3305
02:10:57,201 --> 02:10:58,790
Oh yeah.
Just kind of calm down.

3306
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:00,980
Let me crazy way because it's like zero
gravity.

3307
02:11:00,981 --> 02:11:03,740
Like you feel everything sort of
stretching out and unwinding.

3308
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:04,970
Yeah.
You got one of those in your house,

3309
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:05,421
right?
Yeah,

3310
02:11:05,421 --> 02:11:06,770
my basement too.
That's awesome.

3311
02:11:08,230 --> 02:11:12,410
It's pretty dope.
Edibles and just getting the Zona people

3312
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:12,961
come over.
They go,

3313
02:11:12,961 --> 02:11:15,290
what the fuck is that?
It looks like I got a big meat locker

3314
02:11:15,291 --> 02:11:17,020
down on with a man.

3315
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:18,013
Come on in,
man.

3316
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:19,330
Show you some shit.
Like,

3317
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:20,570
got hookers in there.
What do you got?

3318
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,600
Dead people.
Um,

3319
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:24,321
but it's,
uh,

3320
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:26,270
there's,
there's a bunch of different things that

3321
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:30,570
people have shown that have some sort of
benefit and it's about finding like,

3322
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:33,380
I guess what really jives with you,
right?

3323
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:34,101
Yeah,
for sure.

3324
02:11:34,101 --> 02:11:36,680
I mean look at a guy like Dana White,
just travel all the time,

3325
02:11:36,681 --> 02:11:38,150
you know what I mean?
What do you,

3326
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,040
how do you stay healthy all the time?
You know,

3327
02:11:40,041 --> 02:11:41,330
like traveling,
you know,

3328
02:11:41,331 --> 02:11:43,100
you got to take vitamins with you.
For sure.

3329
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:46,490
I take probiotics as well.
That's a big thing on it.

3330
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:49,070
Has this thing total gut health.
That's huge.

3331
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:50,150
Yeah.
The chlorella,

3332
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:51,700
chlorella or whatever.
Uh,

3333
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:56,740
well total gut health is a combination
of probiotics and a,

3334
02:11:57,681 --> 02:11:58,150
um,
uh,

3335
02:11:58,150 --> 02:12:00,500
a bunch of other stuff that's in there
that,

3336
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,630
um,
well pull,

3337
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:03,210
pull it up,
pull up a on it,

3338
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:06,170
total gut health so he could see what
all the different ingredients are.

3339
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:07,010
But,
um,

3340
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:11,060
I'm a big believer in probiotics.
I eat a lot of Kimchi.

3341
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:12,840
I eat,
um,

3342
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:16,820
um,
different sorts of Sauerkraut,

3343
02:12:16,821 --> 02:12:18,650
organic Sauerkraut,
natural sauerkraut.

3344
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:21,590
I think a fermented foods and,
and,

3345
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,520
um,
a key for you were talking about key for

3346
02:12:23,521 --> 02:12:25,520
the earlier.
I drink that stuff too,

3347
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:27,470
so all the different stuff that's in
there.

3348
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:30,800
Um,
it's hard for me to read that.

3349
02:12:30,801 --> 02:12:34,190
Jamie
probiotics,

3350
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:37,610
a Kombucha.
Oh yeah,

3351
02:12:37,611 --> 02:12:39,350
I love that Shit.
I drink that every day.

3352
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:40,690
Dude.
I need a sponsorship.

3353
02:12:40,691 --> 02:12:42,750
The Kombucha Dude,
I spent a lot of money,

3354
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:44,060
gts,
Kombucha,

3355
02:12:44,061 --> 02:12:47,060
Holla at Jeremy Stevens.
Acidophilus is in there.

3356
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:48,520
It's also the,
um,

3357
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,440
the good thing about these as the,
they're in little packets so you can

3358
02:12:51,441 --> 02:12:53,210
take them with you.
And,

3359
02:12:53,211 --> 02:12:57,830
uh,
the actual live culture that's in lives

3360
02:12:57,831 --> 02:13:01,040
off the substrate that's in the packets.
So it's a,

3361
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:02,900
it's actually a little ecosystem.
And you're just,

3362
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:03,770
I'll love on him.

3363
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:06,410
And I live by it.
I just gave my buddy some of them in

3364
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:08,780
mind and we're doing these runs the
other day and he's just like,

3365
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:11,360
man,
I think getting these dreams now I can

3366
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:12,680
remember my dreams.
He's like,

3367
02:13:12,681 --> 02:13:13,760
I'm sleeping better.
And he was like,

3368
02:13:13,761 --> 02:13:15,550
I feel so good.
You know,

3369
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:17,270
he's always kidding.
Yeah,

3370
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:19,240
I think it's calming.
And it's also a,

3371
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:23,450
I think that is also a trip to fan trip
to fan which produces,

3372
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:24,070
um,
uh,

3373
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:27,200
it's the building block for Serotonin
trip to Fan,

3374
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:31,920
which your body converts to five htp and
a five htp.

3375
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:36,030
Your body converts to Serotonin.
That's big for dreams.

3376
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:37,830
Yeah.
And you wake up a lot happier,

3377
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,710
motivated.
A lot of people that are into lucid

3378
02:13:40,711 --> 02:13:42,060
dreaming,
they take that Shit.

3379
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:47,090
They'll take like tryptophan or five htp
or Alpha brain which contains coleen.

3380
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:51,840
It'll take these different nootropics
before they go to sleep and purpose so

3381
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:53,440
that they could have trippy dreams.
Right.

3382
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:54,610
I did that the other day.
Dude,

3383
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:57,280
here's a weird thing.
I'm actually a big dreamer and I get

3384
02:13:57,281 --> 02:14:00,190
into these dreams and I kind of figured
out like what they're about and I had

3385
02:14:00,191 --> 02:14:03,490
two teeth fall out and uh,
one of them meet your,

3386
02:14:03,530 --> 02:14:06,130
you know,
the thing that they say is money is

3387
02:14:06,131 --> 02:14:11,131
coming in death and I just had my bonus
and a banged in my bank account and then

3388
02:14:11,951 --> 02:14:16,070
my grandma right now is at the hospice.
I just found out today actually gonna

3389
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:20,530
fly out tonight to get there early in
the morning to see her and I'm like,

3390
02:14:20,531 --> 02:14:21,760
dude,
the two teeth,

3391
02:14:22,270 --> 02:14:22,901
well,
money.

3392
02:14:22,901 --> 02:14:27,460
And then now my grandma's sick.
So whoa dreams doing that.

3393
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:28,271
That's crazy.
You ever.

3394
02:14:28,271 --> 02:14:30,280
You ever done James?
Because I think last time I was talking

3395
02:14:30,281 --> 02:14:32,020
about the show where I knew I was
flying,

3396
02:14:32,450 --> 02:14:34,420
I could just,
that's a common one.

3397
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:35,470
Yeah.
And it's real.

3398
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:37,480
It's like you're in,
you're in control of your life.

3399
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:39,610
There's good power,
good energy that you're in.

3400
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:40,983
Good.
Uh,

3401
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:42,850
like you're in a good energy in your
life.

3402
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,740
And it was pretty sweet.
Well,

3403
02:14:44,741 --> 02:14:45,120
you can

3404
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:49,230
definitely adjust the way you approach
certain situations,

3405
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:51,060
right?
You could look at things in a positive

3406
02:14:51,061 --> 02:14:53,640
way or we all know people that look at
things like,

3407
02:14:53,641 --> 02:14:55,320
oh,
the world fucking closing in on me,

3408
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:56,161
and you're like,
whoa,

3409
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:56,550
whoa,
whoa.

3410
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:58,920
You live in America.
You're not in Ethiopia.

3411
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:01,170
You have both your feet.
You're not paralyzed.

3412
02:15:01,171 --> 02:15:03,780
You don't have malaria.
What the fuck are you complaining about?

3413
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:05,280
Exactly like it's,
it's,

3414
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:07,500
it's a perspective issue with a lot of
people,

3415
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:12,800
but the way you approach different
scenarios in your life has a huge impact

3416
02:15:13,441 --> 02:15:18,060
on how you feel and as an athlete
especially I would imagine as a fighter,

3417
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:22,800
it's very important to maintain a
healthy mindset and to keep your stress

3418
02:15:22,801 --> 02:15:26,760
levels at a very low level while you're
training and while you're going through

3419
02:15:26,761 --> 02:15:30,750
camp and like the law,
like we've all seen fighters that go

3420
02:15:30,751 --> 02:15:35,040
through camps and they have fucking
crazy relationship problems at the same

3421
02:15:35,041 --> 02:15:37,230
time and it fucks them up,
man.

3422
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:39,030
Right?
Laughing,

3423
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:39,580
right?
Yeah.

3424
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,710
No,
I mean doing my,

3425
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:43,350
my like I get hungry and I'm getting
angry.

3426
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:44,611
You know,
my girls just say,

3427
02:15:44,611 --> 02:15:45,590
all right,
you gotta stay away from him.

3428
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:48,630
Let's get him some food.
But that's reasonable,

3429
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:50,820
right?
And that's just crankiness from cutting

3430
02:15:50,821 --> 02:15:53,370
weight,
but like crazy people in your life,

3431
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:56,370
like if you date and some crazy girl,
if you're a girl and you're dating a

3432
02:15:56,371 --> 02:15:59,070
crazy guy and they cry like a lot of
people,

3433
02:15:59,071 --> 02:16:00,780
if they're not getting enough attention
from you,

3434
02:16:00,781 --> 02:16:04,350
they start drama because issues like if
you're focusing too much on other

3435
02:16:04,351 --> 02:16:05,910
things,
they get upset at.

3436
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:09,270
You cut those people along awful long
time ago,

3437
02:16:09,271 --> 02:16:10,020
Joe.
Yep.

3438
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:11,250
Yep.
Very important,

3439
02:16:11,251 --> 02:16:11,881
right?
Yeah.

3440
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:12,430
Yeah.

3441
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:13,081
Hey,
I gotta ask you,

3442
02:16:13,081 --> 02:16:13,370
man,
what,

3443
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:15,060
what do you think about.
We think about God.

3444
02:16:15,150 --> 02:16:16,830
What is your theory on that?
You believe,

3445
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,680
believe in God.
Do you know him?

3446
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:19,860
No,
I don't.

3447
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:22,720
I don't know.
Maybe omnipresent in everything I am.

3448
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:27,280
I definitely am open to all sorts of
possibilities.

3449
02:16:27,281 --> 02:16:31,900
Post life.
I don't that I have any sort of lock on

3450
02:16:31,901 --> 02:16:36,850
what happens that I haven't experienced.
So for me to say that there's no god or

3451
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:41,851
that there isn't some omnipresent entity
or or energy or something that is the

3452
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:47,590
guiding force of the universe,
that would be ridiculous.

3453
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:49,540
What do I know?
I mean,

3454
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:54,490
I think human beings,
we are in some sort of strange state of

3455
02:16:54,491 --> 02:16:58,030
development where we're aware of our own
existence.

3456
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:01,180
We're aware of life,
we're aware of certain rules of the

3457
02:17:01,181 --> 02:17:04,900
universe seems to follow,
or the universe seems to be,

3458
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:08,050
if everything seems to be constantly in
motion and changing,

3459
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:09,970
know whether it is,
uh,

3460
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,120
the,
the,

3461
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:16,540
the orbit of planets,
whether it is the biological life on

3462
02:17:16,541 --> 02:17:18,550
planets,
whether it's the life of stars,

3463
02:17:18,850 --> 02:17:19,810
things have a life.

3464
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:21,820
And they,
they come and they go,

3465
02:17:21,821 --> 02:17:24,820
and then even you,
the galaxies themselves,

3466
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,450
every galaxy in the center of every
galaxy has a supermassive black hole

3467
02:17:28,451 --> 02:17:31,270
that's one half of one percent of the
entire mass of the galaxy.

3468
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:36,510
And that supermassive black hole is
sucking that galaxy into it's fucking

3469
02:17:36,701 --> 02:17:41,701
center into the event horizon.
When you see these spiral galaxies at

3470
02:17:41,711 --> 02:17:45,490
the center of those spiral galaxies is a
black hole that's absorbing all the

3471
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:50,491
matter slowly but surely of that galaxy.
And then no one knows what is going on

3472
02:17:51,521 --> 02:17:52,870
in that black hole.
They don't,

3473
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:55,690
they don't understand what it is.
They have theories,

3474
02:17:55,930 --> 02:18:00,930
but one of the theories of black holes
is that inside every black hole is

3475
02:18:01,361 --> 02:18:06,361
potentially a whole nother universe,
so there's hundreds of billions of

3476
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:09,610
galaxies.
Each galaxy has a super massive black

3477
02:18:09,611 --> 02:18:13,330
hole in the center of it,
and inside each one of those galaxies

3478
02:18:13,331 --> 02:18:16,900
may be hundreds of millions of other
galaxies,

3479
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:19,060
hundreds of millions of other
universities,

3480
02:18:19,510 --> 02:18:23,020
so the the idea that anybody could sit
here and tell you there's no god,

3481
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:24,430
man of God.

3482
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:28,360
I think it's incredibly arrogant when
people say there is no god.

3483
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:33,630
What I think is that religion clearly
shows the hand of man.

3484
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:39,090
It clearly shows the manipulation of
other human beings where they have taken

3485
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:44,140
some universal rules are there are some,
some universal golden rule is treat

3486
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:47,710
others the way you would like to be
treated and understanding that loving

3487
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:50,650
each other.
Brothers and sisters and friends and

3488
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:54,730
community has massive benefits and you
feel connected to each other and it is

3489
02:18:54,731 --> 02:18:56,780
the right way to be.
It's there's,

3490
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:58,900
there's a benefit to that.
We all feel it.

3491
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:01,150
We know it.
The love that you have for your

3492
02:19:01,151 --> 02:19:03,190
children,
like I know the love that I have for my

3493
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:08,110
children and the love that I have for my
wife or my friends or people that are

3494
02:19:08,111 --> 02:19:09,870
close to me when I see there's.
There's,

3495
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:14,890
there's a beauty in that that is it's
magical and I don't know if that beauty

3496
02:19:14,891 --> 02:19:19,891
and that magic is to in its to enforce a
sense of community so that we can

3497
02:19:20,021 --> 02:19:23,590
continue to breed so that we were
rewarded a,

3498
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:28,310
these natural reward systems so that we
can continue to foster life and that we

3499
02:19:28,311 --> 02:19:30,350
can continue to evolve and grow.

3500
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:31,790
I don't know.
I don't know what it is,

3501
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:37,030
but I know that the best things in life
are they're connected to love and I

3502
02:19:38,091 --> 02:19:40,490
would think that if there's any guiding
force,

3503
02:19:40,491 --> 02:19:44,810
any beautiful force of the universe,
it is that love and even the love of the

3504
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:49,790
beauty of the universe itself.
There's a love that I get when I last

3505
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:53,390
night went out on my porch and I smoked
a little tube and I looked up at the

3506
02:19:53,391 --> 02:19:56,600
stars and I was.
I fell in love with the stars.

3507
02:19:56,601 --> 02:19:58,820
Man.
I feel love when I look out into the

3508
02:19:58,821 --> 02:19:59,511
universe.
I mean,

3509
02:19:59,511 --> 02:20:02,450
I think I was one of my favorite things
to do is look at stars.

3510
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:06,790
Just look up and go fuck big.
Same Way I do my.

3511
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:09,560
That's funny.
I'm always looking at the moon like,

3512
02:20:09,561 --> 02:20:13,490
man,
it's full moon and the stars in the sky,

3513
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:16,940
one quarter the size of the earth and
it's just floating up there.

3514
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,590
Especially when you're out in the middle
of nowhere.

3515
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:20,100
Like it sounded.
Look up,

3516
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:23,050
Mrs. Pure dark man.
Look at that dude,

3517
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:24,470
man,
that's sick.

3518
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,070
When I was a kid I went,
um,

3519
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:29,840
I was in camp once.
A boy scout camp in New Hampshire.

3520
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,050
Boston.
Yeah.

3521
02:20:31,050 --> 02:20:33,020
I used to for a little while to these
fucking kids.

3522
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:35,450
I went to boy scout camp with criminals.
Man,

3523
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:37,460
he's fucking kids.
I was A.

3524
02:20:37,461 --> 02:20:39,980
I lived in Jamaica plain,
which is kind of a sketchy.

3525
02:20:40,390 --> 02:20:43,040
It's gentrified now,
but in the 19,

3526
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:45,140
late 19 seventies it was kind of
sketchy.

3527
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:47,870
Where's it at?
Jamaica plains is a suburb of Boston.

3528
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:48,650
Oh,
Boston.

3529
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:50,570
And it was a,
it was just not a good neighborhood.

3530
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:53,120
We didn't have any money,
but the kids that I went to,

3531
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:56,120
boy scout camp with,
they would like take other kids and

3532
02:20:56,121 --> 02:20:58,730
fucking tie him up and leave him in the
woods and shed.

3533
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:02,690
It was like,
it was so sketchy,

3534
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:07,100
but they gave us rifles to man.
We have 20 twos and bows and arrows,

3535
02:21:07,310 --> 02:21:10,400
so we're out there and it was not that
organized.

3536
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:12,830
It was weird because I remember I was
out there,

3537
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:16,280
we were doing something and I heard,
I go,

3538
02:21:16,281 --> 02:21:18,070
what is that?
And the guy goes,

3539
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:20,060
I was a ricochet.
I go ricochet.

3540
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,970
Like as in a bullet,
I guess someone hit a rock and it

3541
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:23,804
ricocheted.
I'm like,

3542
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:25,130
I'm out.
I'm like,

3543
02:21:25,131 --> 02:21:28,310
fuck this.
Just from the rest of the time I was

3544
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:29,960
there for two weeks,
I'll just went fishing.

3545
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:33,020
I just abandoned everybody went fishing.
I didn't even know I was gone.

3546
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:35,390
Like I could've drowned out there.
No one cared.

3547
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:40,930
But I remember going outside and for the
first time in my life being in a place

3548
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:44,480
where there was no lights,
there was no city,

3549
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,290
there was nothing.

3550
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:47,660
We were just in the woods and you look
up and just be like,

3551
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:49,340
fuck.
Yeah,

3552
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:52,580
like look at all those stars.
Those are out there all the time.

3553
02:21:53,370 --> 02:21:54,950
I don't see them all the time.
Yeah.

3554
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:56,390
No,
I mean,

3555
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:58,190
kids these days probably don't even see
them at all.

3556
02:21:58,470 --> 02:21:59,540
IPADS,
everything that's going on.

3557
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:01,850
Have you been to.
I know they don't even bother.

3558
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:04,670
Have you been to the Big Island?
Nope.

3559
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:05,930
Dude,
there's,

3560
02:22:05,931 --> 02:22:09,640
um,
there's an observatory at the top of a

3561
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:12,290
model isn't Maunaloa the,
um,

3562
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:16,190
the Keck observatory in the big island
and the way the big island is set up,

3563
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:21,220
they have special diffused lighting so
that the street lights don't provide

3564
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:24,980
light pollution.
So you could see everything and you go

3565
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,980
through the clouds and dude,
it looks like that when you,

3566
02:22:27,981 --> 02:22:29,710
when you're up there,
I think it's like,

3567
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:34,590
I want to say like 13,000 feet above sea
level.

3568
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:37,770
But when you look up at the sky dude,
you see the Milky Way,

3569
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:41,010
like the full Milky Way.
It's incredible.

3570
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:44,070
Like see if you find it,
just go do google images of from the

3571
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:46,950
Keck observatory because maybe that's a
good one.

3572
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:49,200
Yeah,
that's what exactly what it looks like.

3573
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:51,780
Dude.
You sit up there and you look up and you

3574
02:22:51,790 --> 02:22:53,910
like,
like if you're going to go there,

3575
02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:58,500
you've got to go when it's no moon,
because I went the last time I went,

3576
02:22:58,501 --> 02:23:01,350
we fucked up and it was a full moon.
It was still beautiful,

3577
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:04,110
but it was a full moon and you just
don't see as many stars.

3578
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:04,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

3579
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:08,040
If you can get up there and you don't
have to go to the very top you go to.

3580
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:10,110
There's like a visitor center.
That's all you need to do.

3581
02:23:10,111 --> 02:23:12,060
They have some telescopes,
but you don't even want to look at the

3582
02:23:12,061 --> 02:23:12,810
telescope.

3583
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:14,850
Just look up man,
look up and enjoy.

3584
02:23:15,050 --> 02:23:16,110
It's amazing.
It's.

3585
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:20,340
I really feel like there's something
going on with people today.

3586
02:23:20,710 --> 02:23:25,500
One of the things with the arrogance of
human beings and the ridiculous way we

3587
02:23:25,501 --> 02:23:28,050
behave,
I think part of it is connected to the

3588
02:23:28,051 --> 02:23:32,580
fact that we don't see space anymore.
I think space is so humbling and it,

3589
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,790
I think it's psychedelic when I don't
even have to do.

3590
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:37,560
I don't have to smoke pot and have to do
anything.

3591
02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:40,590
When I go to Hawaii and I look up,
I get high.

3592
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:43,440
I feel like I just like,
it puts me in perspective.

3593
02:23:43,441 --> 02:23:46,320
It lets me know like you're in a magical
place.

3594
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:50,730
You're on this,
this strange circular spaceship that's

3595
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:55,731
hurling through infinity and above you
is an infinite number of giant

3596
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:59,100
explosions,
huge fireballs in the sky.

3597
02:23:59,101 --> 02:24:01,500
We have floating there.
No one knows why.

3598
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:04,890
So that's what I think about God,
that,

3599
02:24:04,891 --> 02:24:05,790
that is,
you know,

3600
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:10,410
I just think a lot of people,
they use religion and God as a

3601
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:15,411
scaffolding to try to be a good person
and to try to have rules and to try to

3602
02:24:15,811 --> 02:24:19,170
have structure in their life and to try
to give themselves something to look

3603
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:21,150
forward to,
which I think is a good thing.

3604
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:26,330
I think there's a lot of good things
that religion provides people,

3605
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:30,510
but I also think it provides people with
a lot of excuses to be shitty to people.

3606
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:32,250
A lot of hate,
you know,

3607
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:35,130
a lot of,
I mean especially ancient religions that

3608
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:40,160
suppress women or suppress gay people or
suppress people's rights in any way,

3609
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:44,970
shape or form based on this idea that,
you know,

3610
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:47,700
it's ancient scripture tells them
they're not supposed to do certain

3611
02:24:47,701 --> 02:24:48,480
things.
Yeah,

3612
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:53,070
I think that's all ridiculous,
but I think that's not really God.

3613
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:56,350
That's the hand of man.
So if it's the.

3614
02:24:56,430 --> 02:25:01,430
The problem with even the term God is
that it's Kinda been co opted by

3615
02:25:01,561 --> 02:25:03,810
religion,
which has definitely been co opted by,

3616
02:25:03,811 --> 02:25:05,310
man.
You learn.

3617
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:10,340
You can learn a lot from ancient
religious texts and ancient knowledge

3618
02:25:10,381 --> 02:25:14,100
that people knew.
They figured things out a long time ago

3619
02:25:14,101 --> 02:25:17,370
and they were trying to figure out a way
to pass that down onto other people.

3620
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:22,350
But the problem is in the translation,
like none of the ancient religions were

3621
02:25:22,351 --> 02:25:25,600
ever written in English.
None of them know they were written all

3622
02:25:25,601 --> 02:25:27,820
sorts of different.
Like the Bible for here is a perfect

3623
02:25:27,821 --> 02:25:30,790
example of the original Bible was
written in ancient Hebrew.

3624
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:35,560
Well actually Aramaic,
if you go to the Dead Sea scrolls were

3625
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:40,180
in Aramaic and the Dead Sea scrolls
contain a lot of the stories that are in

3626
02:25:40,210 --> 02:25:43,660
the ancient bibles and it's like it's
really convoluted.

3627
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:48,660
The translation between Aramaic to Latin
or Greek to back to English.

3628
02:25:50,261 --> 02:25:54,790
It's like you lose a lot and then an
ancient Hebrew and in ancient Hebrew

3629
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:59,320
also words double is numbers,
letters double his numbers.

3630
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:03,460
There's no numbers in ancient Hebrew.
So like the letter a is also the number

3631
02:26:03,461 --> 02:26:04,560
one.
Yup.

3632
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:09,660
So words also have numerical value,
like the word God and the word love.

3633
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:15,370
They have the same numerical value
because the numbers in the letters like

3634
02:26:15,371 --> 02:26:18,940
what it means something.
It's not like you can say,

3635
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:21,160
oh go fuck yourself.
Like it's not,

3636
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:24,820
it's not like just a phonetic language.
It's a language that also has

3637
02:26:24,821 --> 02:26:28,480
mathematics incorporated to it and that
meant something.

3638
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:32,080
It was a part of.
So when you take these ancient Hebrew

3639
02:26:32,081 --> 02:26:36,530
sentences and you translate them to
English and you don't just translate it

3640
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:39,760
to English and translate them to Latin,
he translate them to Greek and then you

3641
02:26:39,761 --> 02:26:42,520
translate into English a lot lost in the
process,

3642
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:46,990
but I think these people were trying to
figure some things out about life and I

3643
02:26:46,991 --> 02:26:48,730
think we could probably learn something
from them,

3644
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,770
but for sure a lot of it was people
manipulating the other people around

3645
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:55,690
them and saying,
God says this,

3646
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:59,380
you have to do that or,
or you will die in a fiery fucking pit

3647
02:26:59,381 --> 02:27:01,700
in the middle of the earth and oral just
to the teacher.

3648
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:04,300
So there was a lot of horseshit involved
in religion.

3649
02:27:04,301 --> 02:27:07,420
So it's not,
it's not all bad.

3650
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,910
It's not all good.
But it's interesting.

3651
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:11,170
Yeah.
Yin and Yang.

3652
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,510
There's a lot going on,
Jeremy.

3653
02:27:12,570 --> 02:27:14,780
There is.
Do you live right?

3654
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:15,713
Yeah.
Right.

3655
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:18,670
So back to you and your career,
um,

3656
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:21,610
because we're going to wrap this up soon
and we go to restaurant for 20 hollow

3657
02:27:21,611 --> 02:27:22,960
for 20.
For all you people out there.

3658
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:24,280
If you're,
um,

3659
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:27,070
if you're looking at your career right
now and looking at your future,

3660
02:27:27,071 --> 02:27:28,870
you're trying to just get a big fight
right now.

3661
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:31,030
So you're,
you're calling these guys have a set

3662
02:27:31,031 --> 02:27:32,000
anything up if they.

3663
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:32,581
No,
man,

3664
02:27:32,581 --> 02:27:33,030
I,
uh,

3665
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,640
like I said,
man,

3666
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:35,160
I,
I hassle Sean Shelby Dude.

3667
02:27:35,161 --> 02:27:36,060
And I'm like,
Yo dude.

3668
02:27:36,061 --> 02:27:37,350
He just like,
what does he say?

3669
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:38,280
He's just,
you know,

3670
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:39,660
he just kinda looks like,
man,

3671
02:27:39,661 --> 02:27:41,070
this guy's crazy.
He's like,

3672
02:27:41,071 --> 02:27:41,851
he's always had.
He's like,

3673
02:27:41,851 --> 02:27:43,050
I'll get you something,
I'll get you some.

3674
02:27:43,470 --> 02:27:45,060
But the division is kind of in a funk
right now.

3675
02:27:45,061 --> 02:27:48,750
Either everybody's got fights or I've
already fought people or you know,

3676
02:27:48,751 --> 02:27:51,210
they're coming off losses normally.
Like they try to prepare you with the

3677
02:27:51,211 --> 02:27:52,140
wind.
So I told Shawn,

3678
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:52,970
I go,
hey man,

3679
02:27:52,970 --> 02:27:55,740
if I ain't going to get like a frankie
or an Aldo fight,

3680
02:27:56,010 --> 02:27:57,720
I'm like,
give me somebody outside real quick.

3681
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:00,030
Let me,
let me just go get a good wind.

3682
02:28:00,031 --> 02:28:01,980
And like you said,
I'm still right there in the mix.

3683
02:28:01,981 --> 02:28:04,470
So then when it all pans out,
I'm right there

3684
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:07,270
big though.
Here's my question.

3685
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:09,460
Like if,
let's say there's a big title fight

3686
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:11,200
coming up,
say if,

3687
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:13,660
uh,
although who just won the interim title

3688
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:17,980
is going to defend his title against
someone else in the top 10 and you know,

3689
02:28:17,981 --> 02:28:20,530
you see that coming up to you and you
don't have a fight scheduled.

3690
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:22,130
Do you start thinking

3691
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,230
baby,
someone can get injured and you might

3692
02:28:24,231 --> 02:28:29,231
get that call because mma,
particularly the UFC is notorious for

3693
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:31,640
last minute fallouts or guys get
injured.

3694
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:34,970
Uh,
right after my fight was a right before

3695
02:28:34,971 --> 02:28:36,350
UFC 200.
So I,

3696
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:38,420
right as I got done,
you know,

3697
02:28:38,421 --> 02:28:40,730
I was 100 percent healthy.
He had no injuries.

3698
02:28:40,731 --> 02:28:41,564
I was like,
Hey,

3699
02:28:41,690 --> 02:28:42,351
you know,
I was like,

3700
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:43,140
ah,
I just want to let you know,

3701
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:45,710
you know,
I know maybe some people were ahead of

3702
02:28:45,711 --> 02:28:47,210
me,
but I'll let you know I'm going to be

3703
02:28:47,211 --> 02:28:50,300
ready in 100 percent focused.
And uh,

3704
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:51,410
you know,
I didn't do anything.

3705
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:53,840
I went out and joined myself one time
and then I was,

3706
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:55,970
I was training,
I was back to doing sprints strike right

3707
02:28:55,971 --> 02:28:58,250
away.
And then about two weeks before that

3708
02:28:58,251 --> 02:29:00,680
fighter.
So I ended up going to Mexico on

3709
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:02,660
vacation,
my cousin got married and then I just

3710
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,860
went out and enjoyed myself.

3711
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:07,280
But for like two weeks straight I was
continuing to stay on point.

3712
02:29:07,281 --> 02:29:08,570
Yeah,
I stayed on just in case.

3713
02:29:08,650 --> 02:29:10,550
Yeah.
Because things happen,

3714
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,280
you know,
and I can be that guy to step up and I

3715
02:29:13,281 --> 02:29:15,470
let them know and I let it.
I let everybody else know that,

3716
02:29:15,471 --> 02:29:15,891
hey,
I'm,

3717
02:29:15,891 --> 02:29:18,350
I'm ready,
I'm ready to take that next step and you

3718
02:29:18,351 --> 02:29:21,020
can rely on me.
And it's tricky though because you're so

3719
02:29:21,021 --> 02:29:21,920
big,
you know,

3720
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:25,070
if like if something was scheduled for
two weeks from now and then all the

3721
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:27,410
sudden you got this call,
you really can't make weight in two

3722
02:29:27,411 --> 02:29:27,981
weeks.
No,

3723
02:29:27,981 --> 02:29:29,120
not now.
Yeah.

3724
02:29:29,121 --> 02:29:29,850
Now.
So,

3725
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:30,621
you know,
like I said,

3726
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:32,480
I was,
I was preparing for $200 and it didn't

3727
02:29:32,481 --> 02:29:33,350
happen.
So now I've,

3728
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:34,970
I've,
I've taken my time off,

3729
02:29:34,971 --> 02:29:37,610
I've enjoyed myself.
I've traveled and uh,

3730
02:29:37,611 --> 02:29:39,200
you know,
I enjoyed yourself,

3731
02:29:39,201 --> 02:29:40,040
but you're not fat.

3732
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:42,890
This is where it's so confusing.
Like I'm looking at you right now.

3733
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:45,200
You're fucking in shape.
Your fit dude.

3734
02:29:45,201 --> 02:29:47,360
I just ran the other day and I am in
shape.

3735
02:29:47,361 --> 02:29:48,230
It's just I,
I,

3736
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:49,280
my coach,
he just,

3737
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:51,070
we just,
I stay on my diet.

3738
02:29:51,270 --> 02:29:54,590
I've been enjoying myself like on the
weekends and I love lava cakes and ice

3739
02:29:54,591 --> 02:29:56,850
cream and a who doesn't,
hey,

3740
02:29:56,890 --> 02:29:57,291
you know,
and I,

3741
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:57,870
and I,
I,

3742
02:29:57,870 --> 02:30:00,020
you know,
I have to enjoy myself a little bit

3743
02:30:00,021 --> 02:30:01,310
because there's got to be a Yin and
Yang.

3744
02:30:01,311 --> 02:30:03,730
There's got to be a dark side and then
there's got to be the good side.

3745
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:06,620
It as of right now,
I've been back on the Diet and

3746
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:07,820
everything is going good.
I've been,

3747
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:11,090
I've been doing my runs.
I just really haven't been that dialed

3748
02:30:11,091 --> 02:30:11,600
in.
Like,

3749
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,520
Hey,
I have a set date and I'm doing things

3750
02:30:13,521 --> 02:30:17,470
in particular as I was training right
after my fight I was ready and set and

3751
02:30:17,820 --> 02:30:19,340
still striving toward that goal.

3752
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:21,020
It just didn't happen that way.
That's fine,

3753
02:30:21,021 --> 02:30:23,870
but give me a fight.
I need Sean Shelby,

3754
02:30:23,871 --> 02:30:26,210
do you get me a fight night?
I want those exciting fights.

3755
02:30:26,211 --> 02:30:30,020
I think a lot of people want to see me
and Josie auto get after it.

3756
02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:32,630
They want to see me and conor mcgregor.
He's a heavy handed guy.

3757
02:30:32,631 --> 02:30:35,390
He's an exciting guy.
He's an interesting dude and people want

3758
02:30:35,391 --> 02:30:39,620
to see the one test that they want to
see the live fights.

3759
02:30:39,621 --> 02:30:41,050
They don't want to see the,
the,

3760
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:42,740
the land pregnant.
And there's nothing wrong with that.

3761
02:30:42,741 --> 02:30:44,660
You gotta win.
I understand that people got to provide

3762
02:30:44,661 --> 02:30:47,870
for their family,
but I like to personally get into legit

3763
02:30:47,871 --> 02:30:51,890
fistfights to where I liked to scrap it.
No matter where the fight goes.

3764
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,080
If you take me down,
I'm trying to elbow you in the head.

3765
02:30:54,081 --> 02:30:55,130
I'm trying to get back up.

3766
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:57,970
I'm trying to put you to sleep.
So I,

3767
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:59,600
um,
I feel like I'm an exciting fighter.

3768
02:30:59,601 --> 02:31:00,880
I've been in the game a long time.
I'm,

3769
02:31:00,881 --> 02:31:04,850
I'm ready for that next level of
competition and just staying focused and

3770
02:31:04,851 --> 02:31:06,770
dialed in.
You're definitely a fan favorite.

3771
02:31:06,771 --> 02:31:07,790
And your favorite of mine,
man.

3772
02:31:07,791 --> 02:31:10,430
I'm a big fan.
I love sign the shorts for you by the

3773
02:31:10,431 --> 02:31:12,380
way.
I want to see him in that new new,

3774
02:31:12,381 --> 02:31:12,921
uh,
building.

3775
02:31:12,921 --> 02:31:13,820
Man.
I hope you get that.

3776
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,560
Well,
we fucked up man.

3777
02:31:15,561 --> 02:31:18,080
We were in the process of buying a
building and it looks like it fell

3778
02:31:18,081 --> 02:31:20,040
through somehow,
or another guy that

3779
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,100
owns a building such a Twat Burger.
I don't know what,

3780
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:26,190
but we'll figure it out,
but if it gets something when we do get

3781
02:31:26,191 --> 02:31:27,510
it,
what we're going to do is we're gonna

3782
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:31,260
set up a gallery and I definitely,
I got Jeremy Stevens shorts and hand

3783
02:31:31,261 --> 02:31:34,400
wraps from his last fight.
We'll put those in a frame and uh,

3784
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:35,820
we'll get you to sign that and put that
up.

3785
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:36,940
Hell yeah,
appreciate it.

3786
02:31:36,941 --> 02:31:39,190
Me,
I've always been a fan too and I know

3787
02:31:39,191 --> 02:31:42,150
you always represented me very well and
I've watched that podcast that you're

3788
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:43,570
doing it.
I just thought that was awesome.

3789
02:31:43,571 --> 02:31:44,330
You know,
in La,

3790
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:45,730
a lot of people like,
hey man,

3791
02:31:45,731 --> 02:31:47,260
Joe Rogan gives you a lot of love and
all.

3792
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:48,880
I kept my shorts and I was like,
man,

3793
02:31:48,881 --> 02:31:50,320
I gotta get back on the podcast.
And I was like,

3794
02:31:50,321 --> 02:31:52,600
you know what?
This guy actually offered me some money

3795
02:31:52,601 --> 02:31:53,920
and I was going to sell them.
And I was like,

3796
02:31:53,921 --> 02:31:55,150
Nah man,
I got to give them to my man.

3797
02:31:55,151 --> 02:31:55,511
Joe,
oh,

3798
02:31:55,511 --> 02:31:55,830
thank you

3799
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:56,730
brother.
I appreciate that.

3800
02:31:56,731 --> 02:31:58,310
Very much.
Appreciate having me on here too.

3801
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:01,110
All right.
You could find Jeremy on twitter.

3802
02:32:01,111 --> 02:32:05,100
Lill he then mma.
I'm instagram yet,

3803
02:32:05,101 --> 02:32:08,550
but is he than MMA?
All right man.

3804
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:09,960
Look forward to seeing you soon,
brother.

3805
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,823
Hey,
thank you guys.

3806
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:13,470
Folks.
We'll be back tomorrow with Justin Wren.

3807

Fight for the forgotten building wells
in the Congo.

3808
02:32:17,101 --> 02:32:17,550
Bitch.
