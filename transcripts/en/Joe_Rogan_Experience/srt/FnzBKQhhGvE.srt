1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,870
All right,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,550
we're on.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,280
We're on live.

4
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,113
Yeah,

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,031
we're on live,

6
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:06,750
ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,620
Nobody even knows it.

8
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,690
A Justin Scoggins is about to fight.

9
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,280
There was a bit of a delay with
a Callan and shop getting here.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,513
Fast Airlines.

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,560
Southwest Airlines will let
the fly every 15 minutes.

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,221
It's amazing.

13
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,060
They get it anywhere at all.

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,460
But uh,

15
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,250
it's sex bus get to fly everywhere.

16
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,010
Anywhere anybody at won't fly that.

17
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:28,411
They're like,

18
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:28,710
all right,

19
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,360
well cool.

20
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,610
Uh,

21
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,560
if you never heard this podcast before,

22
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,660
this is what we call
fight companion podcast.

23
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,873
Um,

24
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,100
Scoggins this kid right here,

25
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,400
Justin Scoggins,

26
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,971
that's his name,

27
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,151
right?

28
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:39,301
Yeah,

29
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:39,870
that's right.

30
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,810
He's a bad motherfucker.

31
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,580
I called one of his fights
before and he is about to fight.

32
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,050
The fight is going to start.

33
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,180
Mario Yamasaki says go now.

34
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,530
Fight starts now.

35
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,760
Um,

36
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,390
pressure.

37
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,980
Really interesting fighter.

38
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,143
He fights.

39
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,220
He's got like this karate style,

40
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,570
but he also,

41
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,404
um,

42
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,881
he also,

43
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,570
uh,

44
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,710
throws a lot of,

45
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,544
um,

46
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,860
like a traditional martial arts techniques
and he's got a wrestling background,

47
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,723
so it's pretty interesting.

48
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:08,841
Oh,

49
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:09,870
it was getting dragged to the ground.

50
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,704
Look at this.

51
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,890
It's Goggins is the guy
with their black shoes.

52
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,610
The guy on the bottom.

53
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,230
Yeah.

54
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,980
Dustin Ortiz,

55
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,840
Justin Scoggins and Dustin Ortiz.

56
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,170
Dustin came out,

57
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,400
pressure map,

58
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,630
take pressure on him right away,

59
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,540
which is pretty impressive
because Scoggins a good wrestler.

60
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,210
If you never heard this podcast before,

61
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,320
this is what we call
fight companion podcast.

62
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:32,180
What we do is we watched the fights live.

63
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,610
We're watching the fights lights
four 15 on the clock right now.

64
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,211
Unless you want to,

65
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,044
if you want to sync up.

66
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,660
We,

67
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,493
we um,

68
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,700
[inaudible] I like how he
scooted his hips up there.

69
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,410
That was some expert shit.

70
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,661
Oh,

71
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,494
it's sneaky.

72
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,240
We do these podcasts while the fights
are going live and we talk while the

73
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:52,340
fights are happening and that's
what we're doing right now.

74
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,570
Dustin Ortiz's on top.

75
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,700
Justin Scoggins is on the bottom.

76
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,050
Who came out with fight
companion who let me know.

77
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,070
I Dunno.

78
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,900
Just happened.

79
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,740
It just kind of happened,

80
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:01,670
but it's a good way to call it.

81
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,911
Yeah.

82
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,870
And so a lot of people,

83
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:06,080
what they do is they watch this and
they watch the fights at the same time.

84
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,921
If you're doing that,

85
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:07,610
look at these kind of,

86
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,530
Kinda need them in the
face when he's down,

87
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,110
which is kind of a
sneaky thing you can do,

88
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:12,680
right?

89
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,290
Can you do?

90
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,820
Yeah.

91
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,570
You kind of guys.

92
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,201
Oh,

93
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,880
we got it done.

94
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,660
It's going to pop.

95
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,950
It's going sideways to look at.

96
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:19,784
He's putting his foot.

97
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,671
Stop it.

98
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,190
He has put his foot on there.

99
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,143
That's pretty slick.

100
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,391
That's,

101
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:24,390
that's slick.

102
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,221
Slick,

103
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,140
but oh,

104
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,360
oh,

105
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,010
oh,

106
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,621
oh.

107
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:28,490
It's hyper extended.

108
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,421
Oh,

109
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,350
this is so ugly.

110
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,311
Damn.

111
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,930
That dude is gangster,

112
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,823
so,

113
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,990
so tough that he's not.

114
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,900
Wow.

115
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,990
Wow.

116
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,940
That's amazing.

117
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,900
He got out of that,

118
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,670
but keep an eye on that arm.

119
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:43,220
That arm might be Jack Modified for sure.

120
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,073
Another word.

121
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,291
Yeah,

122
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,100
that thing's done,

123
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,933
son.

124
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,800
That arm for sure.

125
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,410
It's going to suck jerking off of that
thing for the next couple of weeks.

126
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,790
You're going to have to play the mystery,

127
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,150
man.

128
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,290
You have to use the left arm.

129
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,950
Doug.

130
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,570
I'm going to get really weird.

131
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,550
It was his left arm,

132
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,384
wasn't it?

133
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,430
Hmm.

134
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,210
Oh they hell.

135
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,661
They said,

136
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,440
well wasn't it?

137
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,191
If he's left handed.

138
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:03,381
Right.

139
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:04,840
And then we'd have to
go back over it again.

140
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,510
I'm pretty sure it was his
left arm that he was attacking.

141
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:07,721
Yeah,

142
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,061
you're right.

143
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:08,894
Yeah.

144
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,903
Okay.

145
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,670
But uh,

146
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,830
Scoggins very high in this kid.

147
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,320
He's only 21 to wow.

148
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,610
And like I said,

149
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,600
wrestling background,

150
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,310
but real good at karate.

151
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,360
Is that a att?

152
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,060
Yeah.

153
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,880
These guys are 35 hours
a one 25 the flyweight.

154
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,923
Yeah.

155
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,800
These motherfuckers go for days.

156
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,250
Wow.

157
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,720
Cardio is even in their mind,

158
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,150
they think about it.

159
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,860
They should have 25 minute rounds
looking at 25 minute rounds.

160
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,740
Three 25 minute rounds there.

161
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:37,574
Hummingbirds.

162
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,190
Oh,

163
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,930
hand down.

164
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,730
Yeah.

165
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,191
I'll get this.

166
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,270
Scoggins takes his bag.

167
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,104
Very nice.

168
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,280
Good role by Dustin.

169
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,950
Dustin looks like more of a wrestler
and Scoggins does it has a lot more

170
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,810
[inaudible] shoes yet.

171
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,850
So we're looking at is
Dustin is not giving up man.

172
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,410
Motherfuckers on his back right now.

173
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,510
Ooo,

174
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,343
good trip.

175
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,840
So we just got back from Vegas to fights,

176
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:04,674
man.

177
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,910
Look at this or teases
getting Scoggins back.

178
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,370
Scoggins fighting off those hooks.

179
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,031
He's going to spin it.

180
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,900
We'll get that.

181
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,210
So good.

182
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,760
This is going to spin trying to hit that
switch the cages in the way cage fucks

183
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,630
you up a lot of times,

184
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:19,930
Huh?

185
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,820
Cage really limits a lot of stuff.

186
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,320
It can help you sometimes wait,

187
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,540
especially if you're a ground and
pound guy wrestler grounded pound.

188
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,800
It's a dream for you.

189
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,290
But as a Jujitsu guy makes things tougher.

190
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:34,291
I think power Dustin or
is a Duke Roufus has guy.

191
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,590
Very interesting.

192
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,360
That's why you so who is to Rufus?

193
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,470
How dare you?

194
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,880
How dare you ever do

195
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,140
I like asking the questions
that a lot of people don't know.

196
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,360
Oh,

197
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,651
too bad.

198
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,400
We don't have like a way,

199
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,233
that's what I'm here.

200
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,670
If we had like a whip
and they just slap Cowen.

201
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,643
How'd he says that?

202
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,650
How do you not know who Duke Roufus
Scoggins dropdown for gt room.

203
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,830
The brother of,

204
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,340
um,

205
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,091
Rick Rufus,

206
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,470
Rick the Jet Rufus who was,

207
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,010
uh,

208
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,380
one of the big PKA karate stars.

209
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,930
Like one of the most exciting steps.

210
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
Yeah.

211
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,980
Amazing fighter who turned into a more
tie fighter after we had some more tie

212
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,120
fighters and got fucked up.

213
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,920
And then his brother Duke after,

214
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,160
um,

215
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,900
his after Rick Rick up fucked
up by some Thai fighters.

216
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,650
Um,

217
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,650
his brother went into a Meu time self and
Duke became a more Thai world champion

218
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,490
and now he trains Anthony Pettis.

219
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,480
Sergio Pettis.

220
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,900
Wow.

221
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,440
He's trained a Alan Belcher is
trained a lot of high level fighters.

222
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:30,011
Any trains.

223
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,120
It's got Dustin our teas too.

224
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,590
He was on my podcast last week,

225
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,760
two weeks ago.

226
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,420
Great.

227
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,253
Really good guy.

228
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,180
Really good salt of the earth.

229
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes.

230
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,310
Couldn't get a nicer person and super
like super intelligent and really well

231
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,040
read.

232
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,330
Uh,

233
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,890
when it comes to fighting,

234
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,520

Moyie Thai especially on TV.

235
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,230
Lot of empty seats out there.

236
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah,

237
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,310
the crowd.

238
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,143
Well this is the,

239
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,320

240
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,611

241
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:58,190
of the second card of the second
day and they're in a 14 seat arena.

242
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,420
If you're a UFC,

243
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,070
UFC fan,

244
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,070

pants for this weekend.

245
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,521
Yeah.

246
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,000
Listen,

247
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,833
there's no big,

248
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,501
but look at me.

249
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:06,691
Right.

250
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:07,491
And have you ever seen me?

251
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,930
This I've one lazy eye.

252
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm exhausted.

253
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,040
Just got off the plane
straight to Rogan studios.

254
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,590
Exhaust nowhere to go and UFC.

255
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,380
What?

256
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,711
I mean,

257
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,820
it's been Yossi 20% I'm like CNN of UFC

258
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,511
mark de Gras,

259
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:23,781
Tay,

260
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,870
Brian Cowen,

261
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,640
Brian Stann,

262
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,980
my buddy Justin,

263
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250
and we were out until four
o'clock in the fucking morning.

264
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,560
I had to get up at seven and cash.

265
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,433
How late it was.

266
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,030
Well that's Vegas man.

267
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,520
Everybody's at four
o'clock in the morning.

268
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,920
The places mob and also they sent,

269
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:41,370
the casinos are set up so you
don't realize how late it is.

270
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,201
There's music,

271
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,034
the lights,

272
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,720
Dustin one nice left hook there.

273
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,561
Look at this.

274
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:50,561
Boom at the right hand and then taking
him with the left hook of this call.

275
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,170
Ooh,

276
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,840
that was after two days in Vegas though.

277
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,381
I'm good.

278
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,160
You can keep it.

279
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
You get a human being.

280
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,181
That's my thoughts.

281
00:06:59,181 --> 00:06:59,751
Exactly.

282
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,610
Two Days in Vegas is all you need.

283
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,310
Some dudes love it there,

284
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:04,500
man.

285
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,750
I know.

286
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,870
So gamblers,

287
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,250
look at how Scoggins style,

288
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:07,461
man,

289
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,640
it's really interesting style for
a guy who was a good wrestler.

290
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,850
Put works interesting for sure.

291
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:11,690
It's all karate.

292
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,660
He's very like Mochida like look at that.

293
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,760
But he throws a lot of
front lake sidekicks.

294
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,040
Almost like a point.

295
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:18,874
Your style,

296
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,960
Dustin aren't teases.

297
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,910
No joke though,

298
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,300
man.

299
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,811
Not at all,

300
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,031
man.

301
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm just bringing it.

302
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,660
I love that Leprechaun beard too.

303
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,171
Oh,

304
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:28,640
bulletproof coffee.

305
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,170
Both guys podcasting it a lot bolder
with this dog has with a beautiful tie up

306
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,500
of that cause he's like
got that right arm hooked.

307
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,430
Like he's going for a crucifix here.

308
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,460
Someone almost got a
crucifix this weekend.

309
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,840
I forget who it was.

310
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,940
Someone rolled into a crucifix.

311
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,870
Did the same thing.

312
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,550
Tied up one arm when my faves raw
Drysdale got a rear naked choke.

313
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,180
First round.

314
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,750
Did he really?

315
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,230
Yup.

316
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,100
First fight of the night.

317
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,120
Not Surprising.

318
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,620
Drysdales a monster.

319
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,170
All I know is I got to
hang out with Dan Severn.

320
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,303
Um,

321
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,390
the beast.

322
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,020
Yes.

323
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,780
He looks at his skin's better
than anyone's in the bedroom.

324
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
Sat 56 years old.

325
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,980
Couldn't look better.

326
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,111
Yeah,

327
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:05,631
it's amazing.

328
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:05,811
Right?

329
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,910
Was he drinking fucking raw milk all day?

330
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,290
I,

331
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,123
yeah,

332
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,423
I'm somewhere.

333
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,890
He looks like a muscular Freddie Mercury.

334
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,930
He's a great guy too.

335
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,200
He's got some great stories
about the old wrestling days,

336
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,340
international wrestling.

337
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,360
Louie this or tease roles,

338
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,790
Dustin over right in front of Rufus.

339
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,430
The other thing about having
a coach like to crew is,

340
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,200
is he's such a great guy that
like he motivates you so much.

341
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,290
You want to fight well,

342
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,500
want to win for me.

343
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,453
Yeah,

344
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,490
that's real man.

345
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,010
You know guys talking about their
relationships that they have with their

346
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:37,940
trainers like that.

347
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,880
Me and Dwayne or time I had breakfast
with Dwayne and and Vegas retirement that

348
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,501
him and Tj,

349
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,350
how close they are and oh,

350
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:43,820
you're seen.

351
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,210
For him it's cool because it's
like he's living through Tj.

352
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,210
Like he wished he had himself
as a coach when he's coming up.

353
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,720
So for Tj it's cool that
is dead is interesting.

354
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,980
Like it takes a lifetime to knowledge

355
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,590
and a lot of times by
the time guys did their,

356
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,910
their bodies are worn out.

357
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,210
Yeah.

358
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,110
It's crazy that a teacher had no
time to bask in the championship.

359
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,750
He just got back right back into camp.

360
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,613
I don't like that.

361
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,830
Like after I was talking to Tj battle,

362
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,290
he goes,

363
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,930
I'm right back in the canvas already,

364
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,201
man.

365
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,120
You just won the belt is yeah,

366
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:12,781
that's what they want,

367
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:12,941
man.

368
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:13,170
That's it.

369
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,530
All right.

370
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:13,741
Well,

371
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,171
you know,

372
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:14,430
um,

373
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,410
it was supposed to be in Vegas.

374
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,550
It's supposed to be,

375
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:17,911
uh,

376
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,481
August.

377
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:22,890
The late August show was supposed to
be in Vegas and something happened.

378
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:27,240
They decide to move it to a Sacramento
because it's t J's hometown.

379
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,380
Good for Tj.

380
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,830
Yeah.

381
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,491
Great for Tj.

382
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:34,491
Terrible for brow because of the quick
turnaround after a k o that's the only

383
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,850
thing that concerns me.

384
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,500
But why rush it like this?

385
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,311
That's a good question.

386
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,330
Browse camp wanted it.

387
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,980
They wanted it right away.

388
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,060
They think it was a fluke.

389
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,810
No,

390
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,471
no homie.

391
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,820
A fluke is if you get hit right,

392
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:45,690
like in the first round,

393
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,291
get knocked out.

394
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,124
That's a fluke.

395
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,581
Yeah.

396
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,320
They don't live rounds of a pure ass.

397
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,400
Wilbon is not a fluke.

398
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,490
They think the five rounds came
about because of the first round.

399
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,201
Cause he clipped him.

400
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,460
He got dropped in the first round.

401
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,660
He didn't know where the fuck you
was for the rest of the fight.

402
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Oh Wow.

403
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,330
Like he went into the
fifth round apparently,

404
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,620
and he thought it was the third round.

405
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,020
He had no idea what was going on.

406
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,720
I get that.

407
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,261
I get that.

408
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:04,791
How that that,

409
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,001
that,

410
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:08,460
that speaks to your point about having
them fight that early though he needs

411
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,294
more time off.

412
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,841
Oh yeah.

413
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,200
That's a head trauma man.

414
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:11,641
But the,

415
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:11,911
you know,

416
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,590
those Brazilians are tough as nails,

417
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:13,801
man.

418
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,310
They want,

419
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,143
they want to kill them.

420
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,780
Falter,

421
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,220
you know?

422
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,680
Yeah.

423
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,780
Justin Ortiz is strong as fuck dude,

424
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:19,614
look at this.

425
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,590
Meanwhile his pressures
Coggins unbelievable.

426
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,240
Scoggins is like this kid that has a
lot of hype behind him and justifiably,

427
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,300
but I am blown away by Dustin Ortiz.

428
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,260
Right.

429
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,600
I mean that's just the fact that
he got out of that arm bar man.

430
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,730
Then our bar was fucking,

431
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,610
it was his left arm.

432
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,290
You're writing this on
the replay was his left,

433
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:37,600
was it?

434
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,980
Yeah,

435
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,813
you're correct.

436
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,510
So maybe jerks off lefty.

437
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,210
We don't know.

438
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,930
We don't know.

439
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,860
Maybe it makes it up.

440
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:45,850
Could be ambidextrous.

441
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,940
Maybe just gets a cortisone shot
so he could keep eating off.

442
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,931
She's flexible.

443
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,080
You might use or might use both.

444
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,470
Finds a doctor,

445
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,080
give them cortisone shots
and continue this jack off.

446
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,820
Uh,

447
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,220
can we,

448
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,460
uh,

449
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,240
you almost got caught in a bad situation
there and instinctively shoved that

450
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:04,670
second Armin Scoggins

451
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,370
is fishing for the triangle
ground and pound stuff.

452
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,850
If,

453
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,390
especially if you're a restaurant like
this where you had a wrestling base and

454
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,510
you're heavy on the sky,

455
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,070
like a Mark Munoz,

456
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,810
it opens you up for submissions.

457
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,893
Huh?

458
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,893
What are you saying Brian?

459
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,890
This guy and in the little box here,

460
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,600
I saw him leaning against the,

461
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:20,990
uh,

462
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,790
do you know who that is?

463
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,430
No.

464
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,360
How dare you again?

465
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,790
Yeah,

466
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,660
that's Marcus Conan's.

467
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,760
So here he is such a stud
that is a fucking legend.

468
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:32,150
He was one of the heavyweight champions
of extreme fighting championship.

469
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,030
He was a part of one of the
fights that changed MMA.

470
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,540
Really?

471
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,871
Yeah.

472
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:36,411
Because,

473
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:36,680
uh,

474
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,680
he fought Maury Smith and Maury Smith
head kicked him and nobody amber from

475
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,380
Denver.

476
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,920
Wow.

477
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,600
Nobody at Maurice's from Denver.

478
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,030
Yeah,

479
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,410
yeah.

480
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:45,950
Originally.

481
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,410
Yep.

482
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay.

483
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,780
And he trained at a Seattle though,

484
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:48,614
right?

485
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,573
Did most of his,

486
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,660
he lives in Seattle now.

487
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:50,911
Random,

488
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,490
some Maurice this weekend
at the lion fights.

489
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Really?

490
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,141
Yeah.

491
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,920
Muy Thai fighter.

492
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,100
How's

493
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,720
he look?

494
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,480
He looks great.

495
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,830
Really fucking just fought.

496
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,200
Is 50 just bought?

497
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,400
Yeah.

498
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
He one head kick.

499
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,390
Yeah.

500
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,210
At 50 50 oh my God.

501
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,771
How to fight.

502
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:03,490
Who did he fight?

503
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,690
Some guy who shouldn't have been fighting.

504
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,524
Maury Smith.

505
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,241
Yeah.

506
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:06,710
Yeah.

507
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,210
Some guy.

508
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,800
The story and it's taking me some guy,

509
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,440
Guy Murray Smith beat the shit.

510
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,931
Tell me about,

511
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,010
tell me about Conan and the fight.

512
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,311
Oh,

513
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,030
I'm so,

514
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,960
Conan was a Jiu Jitsu black belt and
that was back at the time when everybody

515
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,210
thought that Jujitsu black
belts were like unstoppable.

516
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:20,800
Like if someone was a Jujitsu black belt,

517
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,730
it was it,

518
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,061
you know,

519
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,020
you were just getting killed.

520
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
It was like the hoists Gracie days,

521
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,301
the early days.

522
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:30,301
It was like 93 94 somewhere around there
and Maury Smith leg kicked the fuck out

523
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,990
of them and then head kicked him.

524
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,500
Wow.

525
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah.

526
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,780
It just kept the fight standing when,

527
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,160
when he got taken to the ground,

528
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,260
use good butterflies
got back up to his feet.

529
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,680
Just really never Morris his
ground game was all about defense.

530
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,880
100% defense.

531
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,190
It was all butterflies
and defense and endurance.

532
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,110
Maurice has crazy,

533
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,480
crazy cardio for a heavyweight did.

534
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:49,900
Yeah,

535
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,220
I remember that fight with Mark Coleman.

536
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,300
I remember that so well.

537
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,440
Just kicking them going,

538
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:53,771
what's up?

539
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,041
Come on.

540
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,331
Ground up,

541
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:54,590
Cami.

542
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,423
Mark.

543
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,430
Mark Coleman.

544
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,210
That's what he said during the pre fight.

545
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,890
He was like a more ground and
pound the shit out of them.

546
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
And so I was there,

547
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,021
man.

548
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:02,970
I was there live.

549
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,370
Yeah,

550
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,570
I interviewed him after the fight.

551
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,990
That was back when I was the post fight
interviewer and Maurice was standing in

552
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:08,291
front of him.

553
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:08,441
He goes,

554
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,890
come on mark ground and pump me.

555
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,750
Come on mark.

556
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,100
Black leg kick.

557
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:12,341
Come on,

558
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:12,501
mark.

559
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:12,891
Just talking.

560
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:13,510
I'm like,

561
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,781
come on.

562
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,500
Ground up on me.

563
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,741
Come on.

564
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:15,011
Ground up.

565
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,210
Tell me whack.

566
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,291
Whack him.

567
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,040
What's that leg kick?

568
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Yeah,

569
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,100
you're gangster.

570
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,720
Yeah,

571
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,261
but he was,

572
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:24,010
he's not an Morris is an interesting
guy because he's not like an angry guy

573
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,341
though.

574
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:25,030
He tried to,

575
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,241
you know,

576
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,590
like mark was done.

577
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:28,130
He was so exhausted but more.

578
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:29,980
He's never like tried to close the deal.

579
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:30,970
Never tried to finish him off.

580
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,540
Just fought real smart
but was fucking with him.

581
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,390
I'm beating his ass.

582
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,500
Some guys are like that.

583
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,120
Right guys was real nice personalities.

584
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,230
Like when you look at like a pack,

585
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,880
Ya'll just want to hurt anyone.

586
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,660
Maurice,

587
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:40,991
he's like,

588
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,910
he loves to play around
like he's a silly goose,

589
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,530
but Conan just looked like I was watching
him as you were taking pictures and I

590
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:52,531
looked at him and he's so wide and he
looked like just an old like lion with

591
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,524
barnacles on it.

592
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,311
Just sitting there.

593
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:54,861
Not Sonya,

594
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:55,270
just,

595
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:55,631
no,

596
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,351
not at all.

597
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,184
He just looked like,

598
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,833
come back on us there.

599
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,190
Are we still recording?

600
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,870
Yeah.

601
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,870
We had a little computer issue.

602
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:15,950
Lays in jail is,

603
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,480
are we still on Ustream?

604
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,680
Yep.

605
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:17,960
Yep.

606
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,770
Okay.

607
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,520
We had a little issue.

608
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:19,881
Oh,

609
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:20,211
Dustin.

610
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,410
Archie's with nice to left.

611
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,330
This is a great fucking fight.

612
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:23,820
This,

613
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,180
this isn't.

614
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,500
Meanwhile,

615
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,860
we're talking about all sorts of shit
from the past and Scoggins and Ortiz who

616
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,390
won a war on a crazy fight.

617
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:29,721
Oh,

618
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:30,554
back here.

619
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,300
This is a great fight.

620
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,860
Scoggins takes him down again.

621
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,121
Hey Brendan.

622
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,030
Thanks for making me do a wheel kick
in my genes this morning at 10 in the

623
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,331
morning.

624
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,110
That was a lot of fun.

625
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,943
If I'm a bunch of people,

626
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,880
that was good for the man.

627
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,400
That was someone else's idea though.

628
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,250
That's real good.

629
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,630
I have to hold the thing we talked about.

630
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,410
What was good about it?

631
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,573
Nothing.

632
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,480
I thought Kendell Xian
blows Asil out though.

633
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,530
In this case,

634
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,364
Zachary's jeans.

635
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,660
Jeans are super.

636
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,060
How do you strike a,

637
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,150
how often you throw kicks?

638
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,990
Like once a year.

639
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,150
I would say since I've been boxing,

640
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,080
I kicked the bag now,

641
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:06,550
but no,

642
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,460
nothing like that.

643
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,780
I don't throw wheel kicks.

644
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,890
I had no business doing that.

645
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,533
Norm had norm.

646
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,770
Yeah.

647
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,290
Had An artichoke boy

648
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,570
stuck in half guard though.

649
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,160
Very hard to finish from half card.

650
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,430
Do it for me.

651
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,800
This Dustin rolls over.

652
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,071
Oh,

653
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,120
Scoggins stays on him.

654
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,350
Unbelievable fight.

655
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,460
This is why I love little guys,

656
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:25,731
man.

657
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:26,070
They just,

658
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,170
the transitions.

659
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:27,611
I love it.

660
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,270
You don't see heavyweights
moving like this,

661
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,410
which I was little.

662
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,720
I was talking to on the way here.

663
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,071
He goes,

664
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,730
no you don't.

665
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,290
It's good to be the king of the beach,

666
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:36,710
bitch.

667
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,910
I would care about the beach.

668
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,950
The beach you say?

669
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,983
Yeah.

670
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,980
He say that.

671
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,670
Meanwhile,

672
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,740
sitting next to you are wedged in,

673
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,540
in those little seats on southwest.

674
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,500
I wish you were a smaller,

675
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,320
have you ever thought about
trying to go to two oh five yeah,

676
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:51,830
I have.

677
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,011
Yeah,

678
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:53,750
I've thought about it before the end.

679
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,710
Towards the end of my career,

680
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,250
I'll do it.

681
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,240
I'll do one cut to it.

682
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:56,450
Just,

683
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,720
you know,

684
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,570
like everyone seems to do that.

685
00:15:58,571 --> 00:15:59,990
It's like the older phase of the guys,

686
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,920
they didn't make the cut,

687
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:01,970
but um,

688
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,660
yeah,

689
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,493
I mean,

690
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,740
as right now I'm 250 pounds,

691
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,480
so that's a really tough cut.

692
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,180
Everyone always asks me that though.

693
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,220
You're about to 30 fight week though,

694
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:13,910
right?

695
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,170
A two 35.

696
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,610
So when you think about that,

697
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,870
you're not watching your diet at all.

698
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,021
I mean,

699
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,771
you're eating healthy,

700
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:19,700
but you're not like,

701
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,220
think about some of the shit
that some of these guys do.

702
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,001
Like,

703
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:23,600
um,

704
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,100
you know a guy like Weidman.

705
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,281
Oh,

706
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,980
what does widen and walk around it
before he tries to make two oh four or

707
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:30,590
[inaudible] 85 85 is a big fucking guy.

708
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,060
Yeah.

709
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,361
Yeah.

710
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,050
He is.

711
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,310
Well this is the difference.

712
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,270
A lot of those guys get crazy out of
shape in between fights like crazy out of

713
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:38,511
shape.

714
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,344
I don't,

715
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,220
you know,

716
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,531
like I,

717
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:41,120
I don't,

718
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,740
I don't put on tons of weight.

719
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,800
Who puts on the most
weight in between fights?

720
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,550
Well you used to be rumbled Johnson.

721
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:46,971
Yeah.

722
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,661
Anthony Johnson.

723
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,620
Just understanding like it,

724
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,390
he was walking around at two 35.

725
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:53,230
He's sucked down to one 70 and I,

726
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,620
we were doing this movie
and I looked at him,

727
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:54,831
I said,

728
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,641
what do you weigh right now?

729
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,290
He goes about two 35 I said,

730
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,720
you're going to make one 70
and in two months he goes,

731
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:00,554
I'll make it.

732
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,690
Six weeks is fucking madness.

733
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,740
This fight is awesome.

734
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,410
We should really pay attention to this.

735
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:05,660
Like,

736
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,500
cause it's so good.

737
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,334
It's really good.

738
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,930
It's a crazy scramble.

739
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,893
Yeah.

740
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,150
Dustin Ortiz is no joke man.

741
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:15,140
He's on the map now.

742
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,221
Win,

743
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:16,851
lose or draw.

744
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,030
He's on the map because
this is a great fight.

745
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,580
I like how this guy's protecting
his knee because Dustin new.

746
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:22,880
Yep.

747
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,271
There you go.

748
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,104
Go for the knee bar.

749
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,331
Who did that?

750
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:26,980
Beautiful.

751
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,813
How are you?

752
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,370
Yeah.

753
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:28,730
Nice.

754
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,030
And one up on top and wash his legs fresh,

755
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:31,340
Ryan.

756
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,640
Man.

757
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,473
Yeah.

758
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,180
Well he's strong or tease is very strong.

759
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,970
This is great stuff we'll
use covering Scoggins face.

760
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,130
That's a sneaky fucking move,

761
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:42,964
man.

762
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,830
You know we were talking
about this the other day,

763
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,870
that Brian Caraway fishhook incident.

764
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,311
That's dark,

765
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:48,840
man.

766
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,860
This that's

767
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,430
dark.

768
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,330
That's frowned upon.

769
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,020
I can't leave how bombs he held that fish.

770
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,800
It's not by accident.

771
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,720
Come on.

772
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,180
Who?

773
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,920
I think you said it
was a genuine accident,

774
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,480
right?

775
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,540
Well that's what he said.

776
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:00,840
You know,

777
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,890
I don't want to call him a liar,

778
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,210
but I think I just did.

779
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,111
Yeah,

780
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:04,351
he for,

781
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,250
she liked Careway.

782
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,121
I like him a lot.

783
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,780
I mean he might have not even known he
was doing it because it was so ferocious

784
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,620
in the heat of the moment,

785
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,320
trying to finish that whole,

786
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
that's a crazy fucking row.

787
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,240
I'm trying to be nice.

788
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,073
I know

789
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,240
I was a straight straight
elementary yard fish home pleat,

790
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,190
total fish hook.

791
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,340
How long did he hold it for?

792
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,620
Five seconds more maybe.

793
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,280
Right.

794
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,690
Just yanking him back baby.

795
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,940
Five seconds solid.

796
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,761
But I said yeah,

797
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,220
like five seconds is a
long time for anything.

798
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,083
One,

799
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,313
two,

800
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,760
three,

801
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,200
you know that's long,

802
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:41,930
long time and he's got his fingers deep
in this guy's mouth and he's pulling

803
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:45,120
them towards him to try to get
the choke playing for keeps I,

804
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:48,570
they really do in a purge like
commercial and one of my best friends,

805
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,404
Frank Grillo.

806
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,390
Did you see purge one though?

807
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,790
Oh of course I didn't man.

808
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,290
I kinda like it hurts one day.

809
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,733
One started.

810
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,890
I can't wait.

811
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,723
It hurts when it started,

812
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,971
it started,

813
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,100
I think they made the movie
for something really tiny like,

814
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,780
like everybody,

815
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,260
like I'm $1 million they spent,

816
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,290
it was too much so popular that Ethan
Hawke made $7 million on them and that's

817
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,130
why you blowing up Ethan Hawke spot.

818
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,650
I'm just telling you what he made.

819
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,040
People are going to hit
him up for loans now.

820
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,730
I need some cash.

821
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,871
Yo Ethan.

822
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:19,201
Man,

823
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,730
I have this independent project.

824
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,940
How many guys come to you with
like independent projects?

825
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,110
Three a day.

826
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,040
Including emails.

827
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,660
You get it to Joe?

828
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,320
Yeah,

829
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,550
I get dudes want me to help.

830
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,360
Help them produce their animated
features and the Meta features.

831
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,980
Animated things,

832
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,880
movies,

833
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:36,810
TV shows.

834
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,180
Good friend fucking gave me an ear beating
a ferocious ear beating the other day

835
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,230
about some reality show he's trying
to put together about him being,

836
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,440
you know,

837
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,350
you're in the TV business.

838
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:46,531
I go,

839
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,480
well how many of the TV,

840
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,480
but what the fuck are you talking about?

841
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:48,931
What does that mean?

842
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:49,770
We had that TV show,

843
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,071
man.

844
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,210
You know you're in the TV business.

845
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,660
I,

846
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,010
I'm trying to put together this show.

847
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,650
Well find somebody who actually
use it like a TV producer.

848
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,240
I want you to help me connect me.

849
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:57,451
No,

850
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,170
I don't have time.

851
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,003
I don't have time.

852
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,130
This is the dose we,

853
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:00,964
me and you guys.

854
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,730
No one hits me up about doing that stuff.

855
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,080
I get Dick Pics.

856
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,003
That's what I do.

857
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,810
Take pics on Instagram and Twitter.

858
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,110
I get long volume.

859
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:09,780
Tough man.

860
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,561
Get some volume here.

861
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:10,791
Jamie.

862
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,624
Want to hear the ones,

863
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,920
I think you're gonna
through your boy on the Ra.

864
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,813
Oh.

865
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,100
But that you have to Dustin.

866
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,893
Wow.

867
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,160
He just brought the pressure man.

868
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,023
Take uh,

869
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,640
Dustin or tees with the split decision.

870
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,480
Solid B.

871
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,481
Wow.

872
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,340
Scoggins is very bummed out,

873
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:28,174
man.

874
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,013
Of course.

875
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,213
Wow.

876
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,900
Wow.

877
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,141
Wow.

878
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:32,531
You know what?

879
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,520
We were talking so much,

880
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,720
we didn't really score that.

881
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,063
That's fair.

882
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,450
I don't know if it's fair.

883
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
I'd have to watch that fit.

884
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,170
You're talking so much.

885
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,410
I always say that like eat
sometimes during a fight,

886
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,860
like while we're doing commentary,

887
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,870
like I talked about it with Jimmy Smith,

888
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,060
last stuff.

889
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,590
I companion when you mother
fuckers weren't around.

890
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,933
Wow.

891
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,990
Doug Smith.

892
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,781
Great.

893
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:01,140
And uh,

894
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,130
Ian Mccall was,

895
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,881
I was on it too.

896
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:03,714
It was really fun.

897
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,020
But Jimmy was talking about they
make him score it Bella toward,

898
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:08,190
they make them score the rounds.

899
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,371
Oh,

900
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,000
that's dope.

901
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,420
Yeah.

902
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,710
But they make them score the rounds.

903
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:10,821
Why?

904
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,240
He's doing commentary and I'm like,

905
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:12,481
man,

906
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,330
I don't know.

907
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,083
I don't do it.

908
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,373
Me Personally,

909
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,150
I could do it,

910
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,290
but I don't want to do it.

911
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,930
I say it during the
pot during a broadcast,

912
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:22,620
I say,

913
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:22,891
you know,

914
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,260
I think this guy won the
fight or one the rounds.

915
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:29,190
But the reality is if you want to
really call the fight correctly,

916
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:30,120
you have to shut your mouth.

917
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
You're still scoring at boxing lives,

918
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:32,550
right?

919
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,960
I mean well it's a 10
point must system but it's,

920
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,400
it's,

921
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,910
you know,

922
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,520
it's really dumb because you're
working within a flawed system.

923
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:39,330
Right.

924
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,680
But the real problem with that flawed
system is like a boxing wrap around in

925
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:45,810
boxing it's three minutes
and there's a bunch of them.

926
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,141
You know,

927
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:48,030
regular fight is 10 rounds,

928
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
non title fights,

929
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,921
10 fuck around.

930
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:51,480
It's tied to fight is 12 rounds.

931
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,171
You know,

932
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:53,160
an MMA fight.

933
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,450
Big Difference.

934
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,680
Three rounds,

935
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,640
only three rounds.

936
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,990
And there could be a ten nine round where
one guy just beats the shit out of a

937
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:04,300
guy and then another ten nine
round where it's like a toss up.

938
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,050
That doesn't make any
sense cause it sucks.

939
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,070
Cause this is a sports so
new too well stole a system.

940
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:14,190
We stole a of a judging system from boxing

941
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,350
because there just isn't a criteria
for if somebody's keeping pressure on

942
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,000
holding position on somebody

943
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,740
take down,

944
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,551
take down defense.

945
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,720
How about takedown defense?

946
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,381
How about that?

947
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:25,910
That should go along with
how about submission?

948
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,920
Attempting temps.

949
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,380
Yeah,

950
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,330
all that stuff and there should be like us

951
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,550
gale of like one to 10 of how
close to submission is like the,

952
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:34,831
okay,

953
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:37,080
like look Scoggins and
our perfect example.

954
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,540
That was a fucking nine
that Armando was nine nine,

955
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,101
nine and a half.

956
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,770
That was about as close as you
can get to not getting tab.

957
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,410
You have to take that in consideration.

958
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,591
Yeah,

959
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:46,424
he got out of it.

960
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:46,731
Look,

961
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,770
it's not mad at her at all.

962
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,200
I heard 14 bro.

963
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,741
No,

964
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:52,080
whatever.

965
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,940
She saw 24 she's already tattooed up.

966
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,080
I can't believe she can't
be 14 that's not illegal.

967
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,791
I'll tell you what.

968
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,200
It was fun though at the expo.

969
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,093
Oh,

970
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,461
I'll tell you what.

971
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:02,480
It was so violent.

972
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,830
The questions I was getting about
our Lawsky all that was amazing.

973
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,893
We were in the elevator.

974
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,571
Exhausting,

975
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,404
man.

976
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,010
Dude.

977
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,701
What happened?

978
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,230
Although I had human and I do this,

979
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,610
then I'm finally out of there.

980
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:13,851
I'm like,

981
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,091
all right,

982
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:14,871
this was a good day.

983
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:15,704
This is fun.

984
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,060
Last interview.

985
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,780
Um,

986
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,591
I go on some show,

987
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:19,490
I'm not going to call them out.

988
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,661
This dude,

989
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,830
I've had an issue with them before.

990
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:23,930
I did not want to do this
radio and need because of this.

991
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,850
So I do the interview and he goes,

992
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,040
you haven't had a fight was awful.

993
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,120
That's sucked.

994
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,643
Excuse me sir.

995
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,030
You're 300 pounds.

996
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,620
You've never fought in your life.

997
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,450
You can't talk to people like that,

998
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:35,840
man,

999
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,140
I will never come on your show again
after he critics to say that to him.

1000
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,770
Oh,

1001
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,281
when we were done,

1002
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:40,700
he's like,

1003
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,091
listen man,

1004
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm gonna give him,

1005
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,433
don't bother.

1006
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,130
Do not bother,

1007
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,460
man.

1008
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,761
I was like,

1009
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:44,300
I'm good.

1010
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,781
You know what I mean?

1011
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:45,350
I'm,

1012
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,590
I,

1013
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,980
I don't,

1014
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,450
I don't like confrontation.

1015
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,570
So I just go,

1016
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,041
I'm good man.

1017
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,874
Just walked away.

1018
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,860
But it's crazy to me.

1019
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,671
Crazy to me,

1020
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,300
man.

1021
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,410
I thought it was terrible.

1022
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:54,981
I said,

1023
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:55,221
I said,

1024
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:55,671
that's fine.

1025
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:56,370
Who did you have winning though?

1026
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,840
Use?

1027
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,021
Oh,

1028
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:57,950
you for sure.

1029
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:58,860
One that I go,

1030
00:23:58,861 --> 00:23:59,694
thanks man.

1031
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,411
You know what it is,

1032
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:00,711
man.

1033
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:00,841
It's,

1034
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:03,500
it's that sports guy radio bullshit.

1035
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,060
There's a certain amount of sports guy
radio bullshit that's leaked into MMA.

1036
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,781
You know,

1037
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,590
like that.

1038
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,300
They think that they can be cool.

1039
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:11,871
Well,

1040
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:13,800
there's no repercussions there.

1041
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,110
You can talk to me however you want.

1042
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:15,831
I can't do anything.

1043
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:16,664
I'll get in trouble.

1044
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,960
Obviously I'm not going to snap your neck.

1045
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:18,770
I'd love to.

1046
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,551
I'm not going to,

1047
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:20,450
I can't do anything.

1048
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

1049
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,990
Well even nine that it's just like,

1050
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,430
can't you talk about a fight without
being disrespectful to the guy that was

1051
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,150
fighting?

1052
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,360
Like it seemed like you
guys knew each other.

1053
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,010
You were both very tentative.

1054
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,440
It was.

1055
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,410
There was a lot on the line
for both of you are lost.

1056
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,790
You look particularly nervous.

1057
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,420
Like,

1058
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,350
like what was,

1059
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,840
what was frustrating about the fight?

1060
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,650
Do you could talk about a fight for sure.

1061
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,250
Look,

1062
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,170
anybody whose ever competed before,

1063
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,870
if you've had more than a few fights,

1064
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:50,240
there's going to be some
that are just go off.

1065
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,500
You might be sick,

1066
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,670
you might be injured,

1067
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:53,260
you might,

1068
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,630
I,

1069
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,260
you know,

1070
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,510
you,

1071
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,770
you can't think that every
fight is going to be great.

1072
00:24:57,771 --> 00:24:58,820
They're just not going to be,

1073
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,170
you're going to have shitty ones.

1074
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,010
Things happened in like,

1075
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,740
but the thing is when I talked to him,

1076
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:04,041
I was like,

1077
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:08,330
Gabby on the AIO did that fight
suck 100% should I have one?

1078
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,900
Yeah.

1079
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,010
Do I need to do things different?

1080
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,850
Yes,

1081
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,330
I was,

1082
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,620
I was banking on just like I'm used
to when I used to train with them an

1083
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:16,640
aggressive or Lassi,

1084
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,040
which I,

1085
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,170
I hate that we're talking about again,

1086
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,831
ally were just,

1087
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:19,460
shit happens,

1088
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,350
but our last scheme would come forward,

1089
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,220
aggressive,

1090
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,380
so worked on and I'm a
back foot counter fighter.

1091
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,260
It's how I get my takedown.

1092
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,230
It's my big combination stuff like that.

1093
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,170
So when he's not being
aggressive and approaching,

1094
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,160
I should've adapt and I didn't.

1095
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,920
So you get a shitty fight
and that's what happened.

1096
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,530
Straight up fight sucked.

1097
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,201
However,

1098
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:36,920
I won the fight.

1099
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,671
So this guy,

1100
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:39,410
when you were doing this interview,

1101
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,420
was he like mocking you?

1102
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:41,601
Like,

1103
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,550
what was he doing that was
pissing you off so much?

1104
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,181
No,

1105
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:44,870
listen,

1106
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,231
uh,

1107
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:45,590
officer,

1108
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,240
I could take his job if I wanted to on,

1109
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:47,401
you know,

1110
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:50,030
I just destroyed him on
air w with everything,

1111
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:50,271
fight,

1112
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:50,511
talk,

1113
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:51,140
everything.

1114
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,350
So he was a little defensive
already and I'm like,

1115
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:54,501
yeah,

1116
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,261
minute fight suck.

1117
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:56,990
So it gave him a chance to jump in.

1118
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,000
A fight was terrible.

1119
00:25:59,130 --> 00:25:59,280
Oh,

1120
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,260
so before that,

1121
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:00,471
oh,

1122
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:05,300
so there was like a build up already
where he was like kind of a like a little

1123
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,130
bit and then I've been told
him and then he was like,

1124
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:07,251
well,

1125
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:07,770
what's next for?

1126
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,001
I said,

1127
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,201
I haven't,

1128
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,430
I have no idea man with
this is a weird fight.

1129
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,230
You know what they're going to do with me?

1130
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,420
I don't know because technically I really,

1131
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,254
I won the fight.

1132
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,270
They gave our last game,

1133
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,690
main event against big foot.

1134
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,430
So obviously they're not too mad at him.

1135
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,391
So with me,

1136
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:20,950
I'm not sure.

1137
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,440
I said,

1138
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,520
who do you think I should fight?

1139
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,583
And he had,

1140
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,250
he had,

1141
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,420
he couldn't come up with anything.

1142
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,283
He had nothing.

1143
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,960
What did you think about
this truth situation,

1144
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,111
man?

1145
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:30,980
That's kind of crazy.

1146
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,310
Math heartbroken.

1147
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,530
I was looking forward to that fight
and honestly I think it was almost a,

1148
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,480
I don't say a blessing in disguise,

1149
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,700
but I don't think she
would have won that fight.

1150
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,451
Really.

1151
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:41,601
You're,

1152
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,081
you're off.

1153
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,220
I don't why?

1154
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,063
I don't at all.

1155
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,420
And I think that the time away
they wanted to give him more of a,

1156
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,440
an easier fight.

1157
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,330
A guy where he could
get his bearings back,

1158
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,220
get used to the octagon and the lights.

1159
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,001
It's a different animal.

1160
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:57,120
And when you don't fight in while
for those at your own calls him out

1161
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,340
clean would have happened if you want to.

1162
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:00,551
No,

1163
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:00,881
go ahead.

1164
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:03,010
You got this done for folks
who don't know what happened.

1165
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,460
Um,

1166
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,240
Stephan struve is a
really tall fighters foot

1167
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,521
skyscraper.

1168
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,960
They call it jet seven feet.

1169
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,710
And uh,

1170
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,100
doing well in the UFC has some pretty big
wins and then all of a sudden he has a

1171
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:15,911
heart condition,

1172
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:16,840
like a serious,

1173
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:18,070
legit heart condition.

1174
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,900
They don't know if he's ever
going to be able to fight again.

1175
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,160
So he,

1176
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,103
um,

1177
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,320
take some time off.

1178
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:26,200
I don't know what they did
to try to fix his situation.

1179
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:26,710
Surgery.

1180
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,000
He had surgery on his heart.

1181
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,990
Oh my God.

1182
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,850
It's surgery with these valves and stuff.

1183
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,710
Crazy stuff.

1184
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,970
Fuck in his home town.

1185
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,880
He had to get,

1186
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,580
he had to see like all these
doctors before one was like,

1187
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:36,731
yeah,

1188
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:37,570
let's do this.

1189
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,310
So anyway,

1190
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,850
um,

1191
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,810
he has his surgery.

1192
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,640
Takes how much time off was quite a while.

1193
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,211
Quite a while.

1194
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:43,530
Yeah.

1195
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,440
You're looking at more than a year?

1196
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,890
Yes.

1197
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,101
Oh,

1198
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:45,880
for sure.

1199
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,440
So he's off for a long time.

1200
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,340
And um,

1201
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,430
he's in the locker room getting ready for
his fight and his heart starts beating

1202
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:58,120
like really fast and he has
like an almost fainting spell,

1203
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,240
like essentially like his
body goes limp and they go,

1204
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,074
yeah,

1205
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,520
that's about it for you buddy.

1206
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,151
And they,

1207
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:04,271
uh,

1208
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,590
they pull them off the card.

1209
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,280
Like,

1210
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,061
what's your gift?

1211
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,230
An hour before you're supposed to do,

1212
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,450
can you imagine if that
happened inside the octagon?

1213
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:15,451
They announced his name and this giraffe
passes out and Kate's oldest magic

1214
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,870
about what he's taking the steps up to
the occupied just fucking Google apps is

1215
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,580
seven foot.

1216
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,360
No one's catching him son that's
breaking area on his neck when he falls.

1217
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:31,941
You know what I'm saying?

1218
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:32,430
And you don't,

1219
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,131
you don't want that.

1220
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:35,830
That's happened plenty of times on a
basketball court or somebody didn't live,

1221
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:36,131
you know?

1222
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:36,821
And so you can't,

1223
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:40,590
you can't play around with has true
big guys have a real hard time.

1224
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:41,424
Those really tall.

1225
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,580
There's a condition.

1226
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,241
Yeah,

1227
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,220
there's a condition and I
can't remember the name of it.

1228
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:45,551
Where,

1229
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,540
where you know,

1230
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:46,871
you just,

1231
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,460
people dropped dead of a heart attack.

1232
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,510
Well they don't live very long.

1233
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,703
Oh yeah.

1234
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,910
Little seven foot dudes.

1235
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,160
Well he has two strikes against them.

1236
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:56,050
One named the oldest fighter.

1237
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,530
You know,

1238
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,420
there's not a lot of
grandpas out the cauliflower,

1239
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:58,971
you know what I'm saying?

1240
00:28:58,971 --> 00:28:59,630
Or you know what I'm saying?

1241
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,460
It's just not.

1242
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,590
And then he's seven foot
tall with a little numb.

1243
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,281
I made that up.

1244
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:04,114
I don't know if has a little numb,

1245
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,931
but a little nub.

1246
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:05,501
Ridiculous.

1247
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,060
Yes.

1248
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,893
And why did you say it?

1249
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,843
I don't know.

1250
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,850
I have no idea.

1251
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,703
Calm down.

1252
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,980
It's already having a bad day

1253
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,010
with a little nub.

1254
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,690
So he's seven foot and he's a fighter.

1255
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:17,081
So yeah,

1256
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:17,531
he's,

1257
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,420
he's on the back nine of life for sure.

1258
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,320
That's the kind of insult.

1259
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:25,321
The guy with a giant Dick just throws
around [inaudible] got a little nub.

1260
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,480
Just you called them a giraffe and now
he's got a little giraffe is a perfect

1261
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:33,400
way to describe him because he's so long.

1262
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:33,700
Yeah.

1263
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,533
Gangly.

1264
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,250
I think metro would have beat him.

1265
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,760
Really.

1266
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,090
I do.

1267
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,440
I think it was a horrible matchup for him.

1268
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,620
Went cause we have the same
manager and when they took,

1269
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,411
he was telling me,

1270
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:41,621
he's like,

1271
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,190
yeah,

1272
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
uh,

1273
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,180
cause when I was looking
for a fight before our last,

1274
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,390
before the hunt fight fell off,

1275
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:46,871
they're like,

1276
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:47,890
Steve's going to be back man.

1277
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm like,

1278
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,330
I don't want to fight.

1279
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,310
The guy comes back from heart surgery.

1280
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,510
Everyone's going to hate me,

1281
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,020
man.

1282
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,430
I don't want to exactly.

1283
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:54,701
I'm like,

1284
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:56,050
I don't want him to die on me.

1285
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,310
I don't want to be known as that guy.

1286
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,420
That's a good point because
did you see adjusting gagey um,

1287
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,530
Nick Newell fight?

1288
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,131
I did.

1289
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:03,671
I heard gates.

1290
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,370
You just beat him like nick.

1291
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,400
Dude only has one arm.

1292
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,640
He's a one armed fighter and everybody's
like rooting for him cause he's a one

1293
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,070
armed paper hanger at KC kids.

1294
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,000
A bad motherfucker.

1295
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,660
He is.

1296
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,350
He's an animal.

1297
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,100
I started with gay,

1298
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,010
well I gate g his first
day in the gym I was there.

1299
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:19,450
We had the same head coach in Denver.

1300
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,590
He's an animal.

1301
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,281
He's an animal.

1302
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:24,340
All American wrestler in the
seventh at nationals bruise.

1303
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,550
It strikes to Stryker and
nick knows tough as shit,

1304
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,930
but I didn't see the fight.

1305
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,700
I don't date you like just manhandle him.

1306
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:30,941
Right.

1307
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,710
Beat him up to speed is yeah,

1308
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,300
but it's like that's the weird thing.

1309
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,810
It's like you're watching a guy beat
a guy up who has one arm and noodles.

1310
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:38,010
Uh,

1311
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,321
you know,

1312
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,600
it was very tough is no,

1313
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,480
no doubt about it.

1314
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,440
And it was very good.

1315
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,250
He's very tough.

1316
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,691
Now let's,

1317
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,850
let's say you've never seen them before
and you're like flipping through the

1318
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:46,530
channels.

1319
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:46,721
Like,

1320
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:46,871
oh,

1321
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:47,460
check it out.

1322
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:47,890
MMA,

1323
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,790
hold up.

1324
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,420
Yeah,

1325
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,120
this guy has one arm
getting his ass whooped.

1326
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,350
What does this make a wish?

1327
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,831
You know what I'm saying?

1328
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:54,850
Like this isn't cool.

1329
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,110
And then again,

1330
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,670
if a guy with one arm beats you,

1331
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,690
that's even more of a mind fuck to you
got to beat by a guy who was one fucking,

1332
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,510
I remember when in high
school we would wrestle guys.

1333
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,720
Sometimes we were deaf or blind and
there's always an interesting thing that's

1334
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,140
different.

1335
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,861
I had a buddy,

1336
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,350
he thought he was going
to be the next Frickin uh,

1337
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,213
you know,

1338
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,850
wrestling all star and he got paired
up with a girl and she beat him.

1339
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,940
He was crying classic.

1340
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,990
Well def does Shawnee.

1341
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,300
I wrestled a couple of guys who were
deaf and I wrestled a couple of guys who

1342
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,150
were blessed differently.

1343
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,750
Yeah.

1344
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,121
Death.

1345
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:26,230
They can see you grab a hold of you.

1346
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,110
What are know,

1347
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,680
how's he defend headquarters?

1348
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,790
A good question.

1349
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,900
It's a very good question.

1350
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,280
You know,

1351
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,680
there's a dude is like the best pool
player in the world who's deaf and when he

1352
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,580
plays pool with turns,

1353
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,770
his hearing aid office wasn't near Shit.

1354
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,210
You can talk all the shit you want.

1355
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,120
It goes into a zone and just fires.

1356
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:42,201
He,

1357
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,090
that's an advantage

1358
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,833
to me.

1359
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,410
So was saying with wrestlers at least
like they can't hear themselves breathe,

1360
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,270
which,

1361
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,840
which has deaf wrestlers because I
never thought about it has good or bad

1362
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,700
effects I guess a good effect
in the terms of it's not,

1363
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,670
it doesn't get freaked out.

1364
00:31:59,780 --> 00:31:59,940
Yeah.

1365
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,521
Don't freak out.

1366
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:04,780
You don't know your fatigue
on to something because
when I listen to music and I

1367
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:05,614
do conditioning,

1368
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll just going to say the music,

1369
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,991
I take it off.

1370
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,470
I'm all,

1371
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,131
Dang,

1372
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:09,661
I'm dry.

1373
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,361
Even son,

1374
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,410
I'm about to pass out,

1375
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,520
put the music back on.

1376
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm like,

1377
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:12,781
Oh,

1378
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:13,550
I'm straight.

1379
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,590
But when you're running,

1380
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:15,161
listen to music,

1381
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,590
you don't realize how tired you are.

1382
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,830
You just sweat and you feel good.

1383
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,191
Yeah.

1384
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,350
I think that you get better
cardio point when you,

1385
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,050
when you have the music change.

1386
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,073
Matter of fact,

1387
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,750
I've seen the clinical study where
music does help your endurance,

1388
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,470
stuff like that.

1389
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,550
I said seems like it would.

1390
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,600
It seems like good help you live.

1391
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,460
You're doing like strength
and conditioning workouts.

1392
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,643
It seems like it would really,

1393
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,870
the tiger guys on a loop downtown to his
eye of the tiger and I batch by batch

1394
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,290
hard.

1395
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,980
You know the eye of

1396
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,420
the tiger guy is the same guy
that is the bud light guy.

1397
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,490
Bud Light.

1398
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:45,951
You remember that?

1399
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:46,670
Those clearly,

1400
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,001
yeah.

1401
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:47,960
He would like sing it.

1402
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,711
No.

1403
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:49,544
Uh,

1404
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,990
they would have like these funny
things to you but like a to Mr. Kelly.

1405
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,943
Okay.

1406
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,933
Yeah.

1407
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,490
Mr Couch Karaoke guy.

1408
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,363
Yeah,

1409
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,071
he would be,

1410
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,120
he was a really nice guy,

1411
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:02,690
man.

1412
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,650
He was um,

1413
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,050
he was the guy from survivor
[inaudible] survivor.

1414
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,800
He was with us on the maxim comedy tour
when I did it with Charlie Murphy and

1415
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:10,634
John Heffron.

1416
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,810
Super Nice Guy.

1417
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,763
Great voice too.

1418
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,400
Yeah.

1419
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,881
Real quick.

1420
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,280
We got heavyweights up right now.

1421
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,860
Louis.

1422
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,130
Me,

1423
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,630
when we were in the
elevator with this guy,

1424
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,790
we were in the elevator
and he's easily chit giant.

1425
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,950
Much bigger than you'd
read and you were standing.

1426
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
He's got fuck out.

1427
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,650
King tattooed on his chest.

1428
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,653
There you go.

1429
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,840
It's kind of scary.

1430
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:27,171
Really.

1431
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,100
He was hanging out,

1432
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,240
hanging out.

1433
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,481
We were like,

1434
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:29,901
what are you doing?

1435
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:30,111
He goes,

1436
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:30,944
I'm fighting tonight.

1437
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,670
That's scary.

1438
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,960
This girl's ass is scary.

1439
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,100
This Brazilian chick,

1440
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,810
good googly Mowgli.

1441
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,560
She was,

1442
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,970
they had international fight week,

1443
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,660
so they had to like the
Brazilian girls walk in

1444
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,680
and someone needs a scrape,

1445
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:46,300
some DNA off those Brazilian
girls and Karen that here,

1446
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,260
here,

1447
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,093
I'll do it.

1448
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,370
Cologne cross.

1449
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,960
They can cross the desert
when I'm loading up camera.

1450
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,660
Heavy right hand from downtown.

1451
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,990
Know whatever they have that
grows acids like that in Brazil.

1452
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,940
Please preserve it.

1453
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,190
It's on,

1454
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,690
want to go out like the Dodo bird.

1455
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,980
[inaudible]

1456
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,881
wonderful.

1457
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:08,660
It's a mix of of Spanish
and black and everything.

1458
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,390
Well,

1459
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,670
it's such a melting pot.

1460
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:11,090
You know,

1461
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,740
they had all the wrinkles girls.

1462
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,410
I went into the green room and
I was literally like fins the,

1463
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,730
that little fans back there.

1464
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,990
I have to shut him down.

1465
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,471
I'm like,

1466
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,370
just give me a second.

1467
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,270
Literally trying to focus though.

1468
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:21,950
How about this?

1469
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,460
Um,

1470
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,940
you know,

1471
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,930
I change,

1472
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,340
I have to wear a suit where this
custom tailored suit to the UFC.

1473
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:28,911
Boy Goldie.

1474
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:29,930
Where's a three P's?

1475
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,400
Guess where I change?

1476
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,500
I change where the girls changed.

1477
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,280
Ooh,

1478
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,113
we're all buddies.

1479
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,351
Boehner.

1480
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,184
Patrol

1481
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,600
professional is shit.

1482
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,130
That's true.

1483
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,030
You keep your eyes.

1484
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,073
Do you think?

1485
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,020
Do you think I ever don't
flex when I'm in there?

1486
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,500
You're never let go my gut and just
stick it out like I'm pregnant.

1487
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,640
I was just,

1488
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,870
I was just in Mexico for three days.

1489
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,130
We'll walking around the
beach with no shirt on.

1490
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,760
I,

1491
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,570
my stomach hurt.

1492
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,040
I was holding it in the whole time.

1493
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,630
I doing everything I could.

1494
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,260
I got to go.

1495
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,360
If you hold it in,

1496
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,283
it doesn't matter.

1497
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,140
Hey Bro,

1498
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,960
you don't know.

1499
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,251
Look your,

1500
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:05,960
you're packing.

1501
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,793
I got a beautiful

1502
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,170
Derrick Lewis has got,

1503
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,033

1504
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,191
yeah.

1505
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,180
We should talk about the fights here.

1506
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,340
Gutow you know,

1507
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,300
sent day.

1508
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,971
That's his name.

1509
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:17,240
I don't,

1510
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,410
I've never even heard of this guy.

1511
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,760
Their,

1512
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,270
yeah,

1513
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,390
when he got no know heavyweights,

1514
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,560
it's got some old school
truck talking to Derek on the,

1515
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,400
on the elevator.

1516
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,420
No idea who he was like,

1517
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:27,110
what's up bro?

1518
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,580
How are you doing it?

1519
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,371
Because Brian went,

1520
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:32,030
stop fricking fantasize about

1528
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:37,770

Brian's gonna fuck with him.

1548
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,240
He needs to be careful of this guy.

1549
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,170
You've got to be careful just trying to,

1550
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,340
it's trying to get me fired.

1551
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,191
Protecting him.

1552
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:07,310
I'm protecting my friend
from Derek [inaudible].

1553
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,370
Last time you did this,

all time favorite fighters.

1559
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:16,680
Love the guy.

1560
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,491
I didn't challenge him.

1561
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,620

1562

I,

1588
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,510
I didn't think so.

1589
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:44,520
I didn't really know he did
the count because he's black.

1590
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,860
It.

1591

I was about to freak out.

1604
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,940

1605
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,260

1610
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:07,680
No,

1611
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,320
that's what he saw.

1612
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,153
Oh Shit.

1613
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,281

Beautiful job.

1616
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,160
In the transition,

1617
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,140
Derrick Lewis cracked and when the right,

1618
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,160
what's he doing with this terrible
celebration that was like a donkey.

1619
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,330
Oh my God.

1620
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:22,440
Towards you is gone.

1621
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,161

1622
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:23,461

1623
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:23,971

1624
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,560
And have been there.

1625
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,533
He'd say bell.

1626
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,300
Yeah.

1627
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,890
Be careful.

1628
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,700
He say belts spanning Brennan by him.

1629
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:30,534
Just by him large.

1630
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,040
It's doing the people line.

1631
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,701
Yeah.

1632
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,950
You don't even want to be in
the same room as Cain Velasquez,

1633
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:35,784
dude.

1634
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,770
I like the confidence the same.

1635
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,240
That's where you gotta go
back to stretch my man,

1636
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,193
Phil Baroni.

1637
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,120
When he knocked out Dave Manet's
like I'm the best of the best.

1638
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,720
He was so fired up.

1639
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,701
That by the way,

1640
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,070
is one of the best ever knockouts.

1641
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,610
True.

1642
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,220
He pinned him up to the cage with punches,

1643
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,810
kept him up with punches.

1644
00:37:57,811 --> 00:38:01,990
My name was out cold and Baroni was like
literally keeping his body standing up.

1645
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,510
A little story about Baroni.

1646
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,271
I was even fine.

1647
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,870
I was just a super fan
and pride came to Vegas.

1648
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,470
I've got all my money together to buy
these bullshit tickets on my best friend

1649
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,990
and they were taking pictures
outside the Caesar's palace,

1650
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,340
fade or Cro.

1651
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,060
Everyone's there.

1652
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm in.

1653
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,970
I got a boner and the
entire time I'm so excited,

1654
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:18,360

1655
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,691
I see.

1656
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,980
Brony my boy liked him and he and I didn't
want to take a picture of the broken

1657
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:22,711

1663
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,110

I said pick it was a Stuart
and I still have the picture.

1673
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,674
He takes a picture,

1674
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,490
but he's staring off at like some girls
ask and I'm looking at the camera and

1675
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,340
that's the first time
I ever met Phil Baroni.

1676
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,140
Did you just call me a prick?

1677
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:50,611
And I literally,

1678
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:50,890

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:08,750
Oh yeah.

1690
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,051
I've been,

1691
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:11,390
I was around him all week here
in the same room I was there.

1692
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,250
I was like already do.

1693
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,250
When you standing around that guy,

1694
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:13,451
what,

1695
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,390
what goes through your mind?

1696
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,760
I just want what he has.

1697
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:18,090
You know what I'm just like you want,

1698
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,540
do you want to be that bad guy?

1699
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,021
That's what I do.

1700
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:21,431
When I walked,

1701
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,011
when I walked down,

1702
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,120
let me fuck that guy.

1703
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,100
That's [inaudible] so
glad you're so honest.

1704
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,820
When I went to the uprights,

1705
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:35,010
it's,

1706
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,843
Oh boy,

1707
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,611
what's he gonna do?

1708
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:38,001
Fight me.

1709
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:38,331
Sure,

1710
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:39,710
let's do it man.

1711
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,970
Here more,

1712
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,350
more of this shit like
fuck a EA sports book.

1713
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,160
Fuck capable as fuck that guy.

1714
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,780
I love the purge.

1715
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,920
But you were just fucking around man.

1716
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,210
You know the EA sports stuff.

1717
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,020
Listen man,

1718
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,900
my feelings got hurt because
I'm not in the sports game.

1719
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,980
So they asked him,

1720
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,130
[inaudible] asked me when I
saw it of it and I give my,

1721
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,550
this is,

1722
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,211
that's how I feel,

1723
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:05,421
man.

1724
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:05,751
I was like,

1725
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,730
I think I sh I should be in the game.

1726
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,103
And so,

1727
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,350
uh,

1728
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:09,621
you know,

1729
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,180
I'm not going to say what I really said,

1730
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:11,710
but you know,

1731
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,450
I said some bad things about not being
the game because my feelings were hurt.

1732
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,710
But then I went and said,

1733
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,191
hey listen,

1734
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,024
finally kid fans,

1735
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,990
tweet ea sports and tell him how much
you love for me to be in the game.

1736
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:21,580
So,

1737
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,790
uh,

1738
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,210
of course headlines came out,

1739
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,400
shop says blank blank EA sports.

1740
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,110
Well that's a problem with podcasts.

1741
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:37,130
It's like you can take something that we
say add a context over the course of a

1742
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:42,131
long show fucking around and
talking shit and having fun and you,

1743
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:42,501
you know,

1744
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,750
you joke around and you're
like fuck this or fuck that.

1745
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,750
And when I say fuck,

1746
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:46,930
when,

1747
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,990
when I walked like,

1748
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,190
so there's a UFC party I went to at
some club and who knows in Vegas,

1749
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:52,520
right?

1750
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,353
I walk in,

1751
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,090
there's the table and it's Cain Velasquez.

1752
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,700
And when I say that,

1753
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,231
I'll walk in and say,

1754
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,100
fuck that guy.

1755
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,390
It's because I want what he has.

1756
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm not being disrespectful.

1757
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,020
Fuck that guy means I've
loved to fight them.

1758
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:03,471
I want one.

1759
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:06,440
He has and I worked
just as hard as he does,

1760
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:07,274
if not harder.

1761
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,140
And hopefully you're going to be,

1762
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,560
you'll see him one day across the ring
and you can't have reverence for him.

1763
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:15,680
So you got to know and hopefully one
day he comes into a party and says,

1764
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,580
looks at me and says,

1765
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:16,790
man,

1766
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,750
Fuck Brendan job,

1767
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,220
because he wants to fight me.

1768
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,093
That's what you want,

1769
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,003
right?

1770
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,350
Just

1771
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,741
that's it.

1772
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:24,181
That's all it is.

1773
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,260
If it comes to Derrick Lewis though,

1774
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,590
just just stay out of his way.

1775
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,600
It's just a thing where you know
when you take things out of context,

1776
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:31,360
I know.

1777
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,481
Oh,

1778
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:32,650
I get so comfortable.

1779
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,780
Like he hasn't boys were,

1780
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,060
it's,

1781
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,410
you know,

1782
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,020
we're in this room.

1783
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,700
It's all comfy at coffee.

1784
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,900
It's all warm.

1785
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,561
We're chilling.

1786
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:40,394
We're all friends.

1787
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,720
Got Mike's on.

1788
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:42,051
I don't know.

1789
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,520
I forget where I'm at sometimes.

1790
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,421
Yeah,

1791
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,350
it is what it is,

1792
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:45,950
man.

1793
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,950
It's one of those things
you're having fun.

1794
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:52,890
I mean to combine the two of them and
they're like the professionalism that we,

1795
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,730
this dome tone,

1796
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,663
one shot from that.

1797
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,240
Boom.

1798
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,960
He's six eight oh man.

1799
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,930
Six three Brian,

1800
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,250
he slouches when he's
six three standing tall.

1801
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:04,641
Look at that.

1802
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,560
It's got a t shirt of him himself.

1803
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:08,651
Yeah.

1804
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,150
He said he's been looking
at cane for awhile.

1805
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,271
A picture.

1806
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,320
Everybody as Cain.

1807
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,154
That's what he's saying.

1808
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,580
So he's trying to set himself
up for a title shot boy.

1809
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,473
Okay,

1810
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,351
hold,

1811
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:21,621
hold.

1812
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,310
I liked the dream though and
it's good to have a dream.

1813
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,360
Yeah.

1814
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,690
You know it's good to have a dream.

1815
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,610
You might want to wait a little bit.

1816
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,220
There's a lot of guys kind
of waiting in line and stuff.

1817
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,600
I want to wait a little brat.

1818
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,220
I want to homeboy.

1819
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,553
Ouch.

1820
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,010
I would be surprised if homeboy you got
knocked out cause the bone to the two oh

1821
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,240
five boom.

1822
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:41,811
Real small,

1823
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:42,760
heavy home.

1824
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,340
Damn herb dean.

1825
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,473
Him Love Herb.

1826
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,080
You got to love the
celebration and Blah Blah,

1827
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:51,914
blah.

1828
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,960
For sure.

1829
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,860
Some emotion though.

1830
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,280
Yeah,

1831
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,471
right.

1832
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:54,950
There we go.

1833
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,783
Kid hits hard.

1834
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,643
Got to give them that.

1835
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,560
No doubt about that.

1836
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,720
No doubt he's a giant.

1837
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:00,501
This Justin though.

1838
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,310
Every heavyweight hits
is Justin is Justin.

1839
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,230
If you don't have time for you,

1840
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,490
anywhere in your head has ever been
a heavyweight that doesn't hit hard.

1841
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,180
Garlic,

1842
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,380
a pillow fighting heavyweight.

1843
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,030
What does affidavit Jolla doing?

1844
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,270
What's gets here?

1845
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,290
This shit up.

1846
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,233
Crank that shit up.

1847
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,770
I just picture him in drag.

1848
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:22,880
Yeah,

1849
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,511
he's that weird.

1850
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:24,344
Can't,

1851
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,130
can't not.

1852
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,240
I'm not mad at him for that though.

1853
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,511
No,

1854
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:26,961
me neither.

1855
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:27,601
I responded to it.

1856
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:28,820
I respect them a little more volume.

1857
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:29,480
Jamie.

1858
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,313
I respect him more.

1859
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,423
Nope.

1860
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,730
I have to watch Bj Penn.

1861
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,540
He's one of my favorites.

1862
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:37,991
Oh,

1863
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,940
how cute is he selling us
on the fight right now?

1864
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,811
I think he is.

1865
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:43,810
They must be in some sort of a thing.

1866
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,740
It's a combination of sweet science,

1867
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:47,281
not God's.

1868
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:48,114
I love it.

1869
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,621
Well,

1870
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:50,410
and we certainly appreciate
your support now.

1871
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,100
Wednesday night here on Fox sports on it.

1872
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
You've got to golden boy for me.

1873
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,093
Oh Oscar.

1874
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,610
Like you'll see sweet.

1875
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,350
It looks fantastic by the way.

1876
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,810
He just got out of Rehab Man.

1877
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,540
A lot of guys that have long box and
careers start getting depressed and a lot

1878
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:16,541
of them start seeking help with their
dopamine levels using the wrong shit like

1879
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:22,510
alcohol and cocaine
and that will 100% BME.

1880
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,663
Right

1881
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,240
after our last year I was like,

1882
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,360
I might need to check myself.

1883
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,410
You'll be able to fight it to go to rehab.

1884
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,943
You felt it.

1885
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,210
Oh kidding me.

1886
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,960
What it's going to be.

1887
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,721
First of all,

1888
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:37,331
him and drag.

1889
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:37,981
You can't be mad.

1890
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:39,160
He's looking up some dime piece.

1891
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,571
She was like,

1892
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:40,140
listen,

1893
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,280
the only way you can hit this,

1894
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,590
if you put on these stockings
and put some lipstick on,

1895
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,070
guess what I'm putting on some
stock and some lipstick to hit that.

1896
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,820
You know what I'm saying?

1897
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,001
Well,

1898
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:51,780
she's rushing to and Russian stripper
bitches and merchant wild man.

1899
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,733
Whatever.

1900
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,913
Mercenaries.

1901
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,763
Mercenaries.

1902
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,660
Who is the guy?

1903
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,680
Where did we brought the girl
up and she had her phone,

1904
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,351
her iPhone.

1905
00:44:58,351 --> 00:44:59,380
She recorded the halls.

1906
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,240
What?

1907
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,073
What's the guy's name?

1908
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:01,831
Recorded?

1909
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:02,664
Everything he was saying.

1910
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,910
Who's that shakes.

1911
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:04,920
She kept it in her purse.

1912
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,821
Oh God.

1913
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,720
He had a TV show.

1914
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,330
What did he say about Jerry Springer?

1915
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,090
Let's all kinds of nasty stuff
when he was having sex with her.

1916
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,143
Hello man.

1917
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:13,760
Damn.

1918
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,593
This kid's good.

1919
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,910
Super Cool.

1920
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,770
Beautiful.

1921
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,880
That Austin trout fight.

1922
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,720
Look at God sad that fight with the kid.

1923
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,870
Can we get your boxing boots?

1924
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,500
The Austin Trout fight?

1925
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,790
I don't know if you won that one.

1926
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,841
That was tough,

1927
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,140
man.

1928
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,973
The trout fight.

1929
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,390
That one right there
that you just saw him.

1930
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,070
Did you see him drop him?

1931
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,600
But that was a close fight,

1932
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:34,080
man.

1933
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,780
And then all you do is see the highlights
because he's fighting Floyd Mayweather

1934
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,050
Knicks.

1935
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,690
They made it seem like
you just destroyed trout.

1936
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:40,620
He definitely did not.

1937
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,440
I would have to go back
and watch that again.

1938
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,201
I don't really want to see it.

1939
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:43,770
Yeah.

1940
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,870
And then Floyd Mayweather
split a clinic on him.

1941
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:46,501
It's too much.

1942
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:47,340
I think too much.

1943
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,853
He's too big.

1944
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,610
He's too big for that weight class.

1945
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,733
Canelo as you think.

1946
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,870
Well to fight Floyd Mayweather
at the weight they fought in.

1947
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,070
He didn't because he cuts too much.

1948
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,090
He's not fast enough.

1949
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,530
He's not fancy enough for Floyd.

1950
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,400
Yeah.

1951
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,330
That's interesting man.

1952
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:01,590
Floyd is fast as fuck.

1953
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,480
He's also just so smart.

1954
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,800
This is so smart.

1955
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,960
Intelligence defense is
the best in the world.

1956
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,001
Yeah.

1957
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,090
There's nothing like it.

1958
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:10,350
I've only seen him hit once.

1959
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,890
The only time I've ever seen
him hurt was Shane Mosley.

1960
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,930
Those the only time he got a little,

1961
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,290
uh,

1962
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:16,531
yeah,

1963
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:16,930
that's true.

1964
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,260
My tag them a little
bit by Donna tag them.

1965
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,310
They're rematching.

1966
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,660
I don't care about that rematch.

1967
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,440
I don't want to them.

1968
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,891
I don't see it.

1969
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:23,760
Every match their rematch.

1970
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,840
You want to see it really?

1971
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,973
I'm not into it.

1972
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,251
Well,

1973
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:28,590
I definitely want to see
the Floyd Mayweather sugar,

1974
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:29,630
Shane Mosley rematched.

1975
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,464
You know what I mean?

1976
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,450
That's all I meant.

1977
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,800
Sugar Shane Stk.

1978
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,070
Little Punchy,

1979
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,600
punchy,

1980
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,530
and that's what happens.

1981
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,390
What happens if a few years back,

1982
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,420
I ranted at Terry Norris at a boxing
event and it was super depressing.

1983
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,300
I hadn't seen him in forever and
all of a sudden I see what is,

1984
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,530
what's going on here with this guy?

1985
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:50,971
Oh,

1986
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,860
helping guys with the disability.

1987
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:55,250
Jury's coming off of a war problem.

1988
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,093
Yeah.

1989
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,740
He builds champions.

1990
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,790
This is a show.

1991
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,470
It's all just strength and conditioning.

1992
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,510
Everybody has to have astro turf now.

1993
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:07,500
American muscle,

1994
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:08,161
that's what it is.

1995
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:08,851
A new series.

1996
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:09,570
American muscle.

1997
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,010
I will 100% watch that.

1998
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,080
I will be into that for sure.

1999
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,630
South American muscle.

2000
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:16,201
How crazy is that?

2001
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:16,861
Didn't say a word.

2002
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,540
Then when that was there and
I was just super into it,

2003
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,910
you guys probably won't want that day.

2004
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,670
I'll watch your watch.

2005
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,150
Sure.

2006
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,340
They have shows now
about guys making pools.

2007
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,390
My friend who came up with new with this,

2008
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,160
by this show that my,

2009
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:30,100
I told you that I've got an ear
beating this weekend and this guy

2010
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,180
trying to tell me how,

2011
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,600
you know,

2012
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,391
how can I make the show?

2013
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:32,620
I'm like,

2014
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,240
I don't fucking wrong guy to talk to you.

2015
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,081
But he's like,

2016
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:35,861
do you think it could be a show?

2017
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:36,101
I'm like,

2018
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:36,370
dude,

2019
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,200
there's a show about a
guy that makes pools.

2020
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:38,760
That's it.

2021
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,040
Yeah.

2022
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,510
So anything's possible.

2023
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,170
Not only that,

2024
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,390
all those shows a
hundred percent bullshit.

2025
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,500
Like it's all scripted,

2026
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:44,740
right?

2027
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,140
Those pawn stars show not,

2028
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,560
not pawn star shows the um,

2029
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,410
the George source.

2030
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Then they fill those lockers up.

2031
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,930
They set it all up.

2032
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,100
There's a guy who,

2033
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:54,670
uh,

2034
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,670
got fired from one of those
shows and he ratted them all out.

2035
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,360
I'll tell you right now,

2036
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,920
if you tell me team moms script and I'm
going to freak out if pitchers getting

2037
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,860
pregnant just for the show.

2038
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:04,694
I'm about to freak out.

2039
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,231
I love that.

2040
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:05,630
Show me.

2041
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:10,600
I guarantee you there are some girls out
there that are young and dumb who would

2042
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:12,630
get pregnant to be on TV for sure.

2043
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,141
MTV,

2044
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,600
if you think that made people
not want to have babies,

2045
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:18,250
it did the exact opposite
these years like,

2046
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:18,700
hold up,

2047
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,960
I get more Instagram followers by getting
pregnant and on MTV 100% blow your

2048
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:23,500
load in me.

2049
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:23,741
Well,

2050
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:27,100
they're not doing it because
they're trying to save the world.

2051
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:30,230
I mean that I hate when they
were just trying to let everyone.

2052
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,100
Pixie is a serious
problem this day and age.

2053
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,490
Derrick Lewis and Gudo suntay.

2054
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,990
How do you say in so slow?

2055
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,460
I was just looking at Daniel core man,

2056
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:43,240
his suit and there's no reason that
you should be as tough as he as he just

2057
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:44,800
looks like the ups guy.

2058
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,090
What are you talking about?

2059
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,250
Daniel Cormier does not
look like the killer.

2060
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,360
I mean please shut your mouth.

2061
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:49,910
He does.

2062
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,130
He's wide as a house.

2063
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,591
He's not a,

2064
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:53,650
he's actually in a suit.

2065
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,300
He looks kind of like a thick guy.

2066
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,860
Just small.

2067
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,160
You're saying he's kind of small,

2068
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:01,720
doesn't look like so amazing and such
a killer and it has been so dominant.

2069
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:02,770
It's just not what you,

2070
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,240
when you look at them
in a suit you're like,

2071
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,610
well it looks like a thick guy.

2072
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:06,640
I've seen a lot of guys like that.

2073
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,040
You're so looking at her.

2074
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,460
You're such a string guy.

2075
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,323
That's so weird.

2076
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,250
I still see a little Jiu Jitsu guy.

2077
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:16,070
It'd be like would rip
your Dick Conan Conan.

2078
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:16,904
It looks like I'm,

2079
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,320
you know,

2080
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,160
like a monster.

2081
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,741
You know?

2082
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,050
What do you have any idea
with core me would do to Kona.

2083
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,240
I know now by no means a cock in the
morning standing outside smoking pizza

2084
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,484
place.

2085
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,090
And what does he five
maybe ten five 11 maybe.

2086
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:34,510
I don't know.

2087
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,120
I'll give him five 11 he's an animal.

2088
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,230
Well you know what he is?

2089
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,360
He's a world class athlete.

2090
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,510
Yeah,

2091
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,070
that's what he is.

2092
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,340
He's in the mind of a
world class wrestler.

2093
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:46,540
Like that is something that has
been never seems remotely nervous.

2094
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,010
He looks like he's going to buy milk.

2095
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,390
The only time I saw him nervous,

2096
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,224
Frank Mir.

2097
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,890
Really?

2098
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,400
Really?

2099
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:51,790
Yup.

2100
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,930
And he even admitted it.

2101
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,880
He admitted he had UFC jitters.

2102
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:55,714
When you flat man,

2103
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,340
he was like,

2104
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,070
fine.

2105
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,110
He actually talked about
that to UFC jitters.

2106
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,860
UFC jitters a real man 100% guess
what he didn't have with Dan fucking

2107
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:03,311
Henderson?

2108
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,450
Holy Shit.

2109
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:05,284
He didn't have him.

2110
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,710
God,

2111
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,180
he racked nobody's rack.

2112
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,190
I thought it was an
episode of bully beat down.

2113
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,491
I was like,

2114
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:09,611
oh,

2115
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:09,851
cool.

2116
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:10,130
Bully.

2117
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:10,511
Beatdown.

2118
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:10,810
Nope.

2119
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,660
UFC preview preview.

2120
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,970
Why did he pick him up and
body slammed him like that?

2121
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,710
Because he to Dan Henderson,

2122
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,151
you bastard,

2123
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:19,984
you killed Dan.

2124
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,700
Why did he do that to him though?

2125
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,860
Dan was all tan and shit
and choke them unconscious.

2126
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,800
Dan didn't even tap like a man.

2127
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,970
They don't like Brad said,

2128
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,420
couldn't better shape than
anybody in on the political.

2129
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:36,530
It was just so as tight as he got.

2130
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:36,780
I looked,

2131
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,581
I was grabbing his arms.

2132
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:37,851
I was like,

2133
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,930
are you ready to fight?

2134
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:39,141
He's like,

2135
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:39,910
I'm two weeks out.

2136
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:40,650
Right Dan?

2137
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,280
When guys wear three piece suits on TV,

2138
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:43,761
I don't know.

2139
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:44,061
It's like,

2140
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:44,894
what are we doing?

2141
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,100
You're going a funeral home.

2142
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:46,800
I'm sorry.

2143
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,770
They dominoes jackets and the
whole thing and they got me the,

2144
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,790
the collared shirts that are form fitted
in the pants that are fitted to my legs

2145
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,870
and all that shit and the jacket.

2146
00:50:56,871 --> 00:50:58,160
I wore it a couple of times and I'm like,

2147
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,300
this is just too cool.

2148
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:00,021
She's not you,

2149
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:00,380
Huh?

2150
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,250
I can't do it.

2151
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,020
They didn't want to put your
jacket on for this interview.

2152
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,260
Put your jacket on for this part.

2153
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:04,860
I'm like,

2154
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,230
it's going to make it better
if I have a jacket on.

2155
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,230
Ridiculous.

2156
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,500
It's not the three piece
suits to formal man.

2157
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,740
It's too much from behind me.

2158
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,230
People in their underwear
about to Shin kick each other.

2159
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,870
You want me to wear a jacket?

2160
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:19,220
Like I'm selling insurance.

2161
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,991
I don't get it,

2162
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:21,650
man.

2163
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,430
I don't get it.

2164
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,091
It's weird.

2165
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:23,924
It's too weird.

2166
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:25,881
It's a weird thing.

2167
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:30,380
Our cultural desires to all have
the same fucking outfits on.

2168
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:33,610
If we're being serious or
classy or doing formality,

2169
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,580
I have a suit on,

2170
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,960
so listen to what I'm saying.

2171
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:36,710
I know what I'm saying.

2172
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,130
Clearly I'm prepared for no nonsense.

2173
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:39,531
Nearly fell.

2174
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:40,460
Have a v neck on.

2175
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,480
I'm playing grab ass.

2176
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,711
Guess what?

2177
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:46,280
I'm playing grab ass all the
time then iron Mike productions.

2178
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,670
Yep.

2179
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,510
Oh my God.

2180
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:49,250
Mike Tyson has his own production.

2181
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:49,881
Oh my God.

2182
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:52,240
Mike Tyson most be bored
as shit he's doing.

2183
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,570
It's Wednesday and Thursday.

2184
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:53,900
Wow.

2185
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,400
I end Mike productions.

2186
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,480
Interesting man.

2187
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,050
Interested.

2188
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,790
You see a show and he
was doing Broadway stuff.

2189
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,091
No,

2190
00:51:59,091 --> 00:51:59,270
no,

2191
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,840
it was good.

2192
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,740
I heard it was awesome.

2193
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:01,540
It was all done with it.

2194
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,373
They stopped doing it.

2195
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,901
I think so.

2196
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:04,690
Cause he's doing that bullshit
promotion thing though.

2197
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,031
No,

2198
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,864
the fights.

2199
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,250
But he's done well.

2200
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:09,650
He's only got so many stories I guess,

2201
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:10,281
you know.

2202
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:11,420
I mean it's one of those things like,

2203
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:12,640
did you guys remember um,

2204
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,970
the defending the caveman
who was essentially like
a hot stand up comedy act?

2205
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,570
And it was like,

2206
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,820
I never know if he's made
so much money on that.

2207
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,520
Not only did he make so much
money out of Michael Chiklis,

2208
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,600
that guy from the shield,

2209
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,060
he actually performed it for awhile.

2210
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,300
He was selling it so
other guys can perform it.

2211
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:35,150
Like he had this act and guys would do it.

2212
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,500
It was like he would selling it as a
theater show and it was essentially like

2213
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,450
kind of a hacky standup comedy.

2214
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,980
It's still performed everywhere.

2215
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,390
Still making a fortune.

2216
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,201
It's so weird.

2217
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:46,280
It's the difference in men and women.

2218
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,373
It's definitive,

2219
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,870
but it's nothing groundbreaking.

2220
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,560
It's like,

2221
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:51,831
you know,

2222
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:52,160
I mean,

2223
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,470
I guess it's probably well
done if people enjoy it.

2224
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,450
I saw it on Broadway
actually think about it.

2225
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,350
I thought that it was,

2226
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:58,310
it was well written.

2227
00:52:58,311 --> 00:52:58,541
I,

2228
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,080
I didn't think he was a performer.

2229
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:01,200
He wasn't the,

2230
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:02,660
I saw the original guy who wrote it,

2231
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,321
do it.

2232
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:03,741
And then,

2233
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:04,010
uh,

2234
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,800
and so then now he's just licensed
it licensed licenses out to,

2235
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:07,100
uh,

2236
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,480
to other actors to scrubs.

2237
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,751
Yeah.

2238
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:09,370
But it's actually,

2239
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,203
it's,

2240
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,940
they have to have it from adjacently
draws the distinction being hunters and

2241
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,900
gatherers and when the differences,

2242
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,000
when men go to shop,

2243
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:17,490
for example,

2244
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:17,770
they,

2245
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:18,291
their linear,

2246
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,400
they want to go get their genes.

2247
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,010
They're going to find it and kill it
and take the genes and leave women when

2248
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:22,461
they go shop,

2249
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:23,330
they want to touch things,

2250
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:23,811
smell it,

2251
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,720
that they'd go through it.

2252
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:25,741
They're gathering.

2253
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:26,574
Well then Alma chain,

2254
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,320
there's a lot of truth to it.

2255
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,260
Yes you are.

2256
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,200
Don't you have a lot
of feminine energy bro?

2257
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:31,951
I liked,

2258
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:32,600
I liked my leg,

2259
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,433
my fashion man.

2260
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,300
I like liked the Russian
fucking grab genes from target.

2261
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:36,600
All right.

2262
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,433
Why did you look at my,

2263
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,270
why'd you look at my crime?

2264
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,060
It's in my face.

2265
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,893
There you go.

2266
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,990
You're like my Japanese
denim jeans from target.

2267
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,700
These are Japanese down
the ship out from charges.

2268
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,710
I buy 90% of my clothes online.

2269
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,280
Really?

2270
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,113
Yup.

2271
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,170
How's it fit?

2272
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,340
Cause you're not small dude.

2273
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:51,450
You have no weird dimensions.

2274
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,033
You do.

2275
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:53,701
Well,

2276
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:56,880
the reason I say no because
cause you're like thick.

2277
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,420
You know what I'm saying?

2278
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,110
You're in shape.

2279
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,291
Yeah,

2280
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:02,220
I buy you can't buy this like regular
sweatpants from fricking Sam's Club.

2281
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,260
I buy things that are like certain
brands that I could buy like lucky jeans.

2282
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,690
I buy like lucky jeans but is too big.

2283
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:10,560
Yeah.

2284
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,820
I have a 32 inch waist,

2285
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:13,920
so I buy like a 33 or 34 inch waist.

2286
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,630
See,

2287
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,580
so they took my legs nor on the planet,

2288
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:17,821
by the way.

2289
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:18,654
How's your snoring glass?

2290
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,010
No,

2291
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:20,700
it's pretty good.

2292
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,390
I couldn't sleep when do your hunting
didn't sleep for four days cause cause he

2293
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:26,690
was about two in the morning and just,

2294
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,083
I'm a little bit,

2295
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,020
a little bit of snore myself.

2296
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,101
I would do this to you.

2297
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:32,910
I go,

2298
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,560
I go and you and you go on,

2299
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,703
stop for a second,

2300
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,770
then you go,

2301
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:38,790
oh by the way,

2302
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:39,624
I got an interview,

2303
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,670
I got a new mouthpiece.

2304
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,890
You don't have to worry about that really.

2305
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,610
So we can cuddle a mouthpiece.

2306
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,400
It's amazing.

2307
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,160
Fantastic.

2308
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,320
A mouthpiece that presses my tongue down
and keeps my tongue from falling back

2309
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:49,951
in my mouth.

2310
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:50,621
So you don't smell it.

2311
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:50,761
Yeah,

2312
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:51,570
that's what it is.

2313
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,300
It's uncomfortable at first it feels
you're gonna throw out like someone's

2314
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:55,690
trying to put the dictum,

2315
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,043
trying to deep throat.

2316
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,530
My father's got really bad sleep apnea.

2317
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,290
He's got to have like a mask
and everything and yeah,

2318
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,060
but that's what I'm
trying to move void doing.

2319
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:03,860
Yeah.

2320
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,180
And then there's also a surgery that
you can get where they take out your

2321
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,120
tonsils in your ad.

2322
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:08,690
Yeah,

2323
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,610
it was a core.

2324
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,740
You just keep snoring.

2325
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,970
You go on with life.

2326
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,360
All right.

2327
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,631
Yeah,

2328
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:13,171
but you know what,

2329
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:14,670
dude say that as long recovery.

2330
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,740
They also say that about
the fucking nose thing.

2331
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,070
I that the deviated Septum kept
me from doing it for a long time.

2332
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,581
I had it done.

2333
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:21,390
It was easy.

2334
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:21,720
Yeah,

2335
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,440
it was great.

2336
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,640
I mean my nose is a little sensitive,

2337
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:27,490
but I was rolling six weeks later
and I was breathing gray up.

2338
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:28,231
Do you still breathe?

2339
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:28,431
Great.

2340
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:28,820
Cause my,

2341
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,530
my surgeon are pretty good.

2342
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,690
So good to my whole life.

2343
00:55:33,691 --> 00:55:34,530
I had a whack,

2344
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,910
knows I fell off.

2345
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,070
My surgeon was unsuccessful.

2346
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,830
Well you probably went back to the gym
like a week later and started getting

2347
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:41,381
punched in the face.

2348
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:41,671
I said,

2349
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,600
you went back a week later.

2350
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,853
I was rolling.

2351
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,640
No punches.

2352
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,060
You fell down the stairs
and broke her nose.

2353
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,923
That's five.

2354
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:47,551
Yeah.

2355
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:48,331
When I was five years old,

2356
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:49,200
smashed my nose,

2357
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:53,280
shattered it cement stare and
from then on it was useless.

2358
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:55,530
And then my whole life was wrestling,

2359
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,310
martial arts.

2360
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,210
I got hit in the face.

2361
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,370
Who knows how many times
I know I broke my nose.

2362
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:02,700
It least probably 10 to
a dozen times at least.

2363
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,900
And then there's all this scar tissue
build up and they take your turbinates,

2364
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:07,130
they,

2365
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,700
they trim your turbinates down.

2366
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,260
They,

2367
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,200
my nose actually got wider after
the surgery because when he,

2368
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,310
when he cut me open,

2369
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,140
this guy was a real wizard,

2370
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,440
he retired doctor Feinstein and in
Encino and he put these like these uh,

2371
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,221
form,

2372
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:25,570
they'd be saw these things,

2373
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:27,850
these plastic splints and shoved that.

2374
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,330
He's like,

2375
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,710
what is your main concern?

2376
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:30,431
And I explained,

2377
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:30,760
you know,

2378
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,080
look,

2379
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,200
I do martial arts and stuff and
I can't breathe out of my nose,

2380
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,110
all this different jazz.

2381
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,041
And he's like,

2382
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:36,221
you know,

2383
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:37,750
we're going to open it wide.

2384
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,100
We're going to really get in there.

2385
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:40,880
And we got trimmed down
at what's called a turban.

2386
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:41,830
And so the system for things,

2387
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,664
we're going to spread it out.

2388
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,340
So he like cut me open and,

2389
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,380
and took out all this scar tissue.

2390
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:50,800
And I mean he showed it to me at like a
plate of all the shit they pulled out of

2391
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:51,550
my nose.

2392
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:51,851
Oh,

2393
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:52,684
it was incredible.

2394
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,160
And then he stuffs these plastic things
in that sort of wedged my nose open.

2395
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,240
And then stuff,

2396
00:56:58,241 --> 00:56:59,590
these foam inserts,

2397
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:04,160
I had the same thing but minus collapsed
and he had to take a piece of cartilage

2398
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,240
and put it under my nose.

2399
00:57:05,241 --> 00:57:05,540
So,

2400
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,373
and this is,

2401
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,380
I have garbage with a cut it out.

2402
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:08,930
I don't know.

2403
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,180
He had to put an extra
piece and I'm telling you,

2404
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,220
what do you mean you don't
have to be for two weeks?

2405
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:13,941
My nose.

2406
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:14,780
Look my nose.

2407
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,770
I looked like a pig.

2408
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,610
Hold on.

2409
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,840
I know Brian had a nose job,

2410
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,353
those dry Brian.

2411
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,220
But they don't take Cartlidge from other
people's body and put it in [inaudible]

2412
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,160
from Mike from must
taking it from my nose.

2413
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:25,461
But he said,

2414
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:27,960
I didn't take up these cartilage
and put it under your nose cause it,

2415
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,710
I don't take cartilage from your
nose and put it in your nose.

2416
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,760
That doesn't make sense.

2417
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,580
So they just showed the,

2418
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,400
so they just showed the ultimate
fighter where the hometown,

2419
00:57:37,401 --> 00:57:38,660
where they go to their hometown show.

2420
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,530
When I,

2421
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,363
this is funny,

2422
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,090
when I was,

2423
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:41,720
uh,

2424
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,553
when I was on,

2425
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,080
I just passing over my nose.

2426
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,040
You for sure.

2427
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,280
[inaudible]

2428
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,940
I literally had to have [inaudible] class
and they had to put it under my nose

2429
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:53,691
was up like this.

2430
00:57:53,691 --> 00:57:54,191
As Patty,

2431
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:55,024
if it's called,

2432
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,431
it's called.

2433
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:55,791
And I said,

2434
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:57,010
is my nose is going to
come back to normal.

2435
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,261
He said,

2436
00:57:57,261 --> 00:57:58,160
it'll come back though.

2437
00:57:58,161 --> 00:57:59,200
They gave you a dick nose.

2438
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,350
Your nose looks like,

2439
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,660
and my nose a little more
turned up then it was,

2440
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,310
by the way,

2441
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,010
you used to have a nice
bend to my notes here.

2442
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,390
Was this 1980 no,

2443
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,310
19 1989.

2444
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,330
[inaudible] 98 I think.

2445
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,031
98.

2446
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:14,390
Yeah.

2447
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,740
Yeah.

2448
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,400
Um,

2449
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:15,840
there's,

2450
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,220
it's a great operation though if you
get it done correctly and it takes,

2451
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,300
God mind didn't take,

2452
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,220
but back then,

2453
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,220
so they showed the ultra,

2454
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:23,560
if I really go home town,

2455
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,950
when I was the ultimate fighter,

2456
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,080
this is how naive and stupid I was.

2457
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,460
This how cocky I was back then.

2458
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,350
So I had four fights made all the way
to the finale will open up a fire.

2459
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,610
They'd come to your hometown,

2460
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,001
your training,

2461
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:37,220
get ready for the fight
and they go into like your,

2462
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:37,491
you know,

2463
00:58:37,491 --> 00:58:38,121
your background,

2464
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:38,421
your life,

2465
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:39,254
stuff like that.

2466
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,540
And my thing on there,

2467
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,730
I was talking about how Roy Nelson,

2468
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,500
who was a former world champion,

2469
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:48,080
all these fights has never
found anybody like me.

2470
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,093
And that was my,

2471
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,080
that was my comment.

2472
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:50,331
I was like,

2473
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:50,721
don't worry,

2474
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:53,180
he's never finding when like
me and everyone on mine,

2475
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,481
I was like,

2476
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:54,140
Huh,

2477
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,410
fuck,

2478
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,490
I'm doing a lot of skew.

2479
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,530
He flopped frigging everybody.

2480
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,770
I just didn't take that into
account man back in the day.

2481
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,420
I was just talking Shit on mine.

2482
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:03,170
Yeah.

2483
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,100
Well you talk shit.

2484
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:05,930
But I love the fact that you
admit that you talk shit.

2485
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:06,800
Yeah,

2486
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,790
we came to do man.

2487
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,900
You gotta keep it real,

2488
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,011
keep it real.

2489
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:11,820
They should get back in
there and fight that.

2490
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,970
You're honest about the shit talk.

2491
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,710
It is important.

2492
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,070
It's important if you get
to talk shit to be honest.

2493
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,070
But let me see this.

2494
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:22,910
This is the strain is Guillermo del Toro.

2495
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,360
It was a really good book for
like three quarters of the way in.

2496
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:27,530
And then it became shit.

2497
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:27,950
Right.

2498
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:28,761
I wonder what they're gonna do.

2499
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:31,540
But the apparently the
whole time they were uh,

2500
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,450
making the book for a mini series.

2501
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,320
They were designing it as a mini series.

2502
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,210
It's about vampires.

2503
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,000
I hope they do a good job.

2504
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,060
Anything with Vampires,

2505
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,670
I watch you to vampires or zombies.

2506
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:45,800
But I've preferred to be a
vampire if I had to pick one.

2507
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,270
I don't know if he had that
about love me and monster movie.

2508
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,073
Love them.

2509
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,530
Farmers only this is offer a
dude's trying to date checks,

2510
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,630
but you have to have a farmer.

2511
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,530
Like can I get on that?

2512
00:59:56,531 --> 01:00:00,030
Even though I'm not a farmer just to
clean house with these farmer bitches,

2513
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,371
just like,

2514
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:02,120

2515
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,810
I know,

2516
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,430
I know you're looking for a farmer.

2517
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,080
Just send her a Dick pics from
Marina del Rey just on the Ocu.

2518
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:10,760
And overall it's just
cause all you all know,

2519
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,613
farmer,

2520
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,200
farmer farming,

2521
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,210
San Bish,

2522
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,590
farming sand and work on his
farm in San and growing loads.

2523
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,020
Like is there going to be
repercussions is I'm not a farmer.

2524
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:31,050
I'm trying to throw all these bitches on
farmers only know if you're in the date

2525
01:00:31,051 --> 01:00:31,850
and farmers,

2526
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,271
you know,

2527
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:35,360
like maybe the girls are not just in
the farmers are in a Dutch guys who like

2528
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:36,260
farmer girls.

2529
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,920
But is there like one farmer girl is
just a beast on there and none of these

2530
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,050
shitty pharmacy and get to her.

2531

And I do.

2532
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,540
I create a profile and they hate me.

2533
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,350
Maybe they come find me.

2534
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,550
Misha Tate looking farmer.

2535
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:49,960
Yeah.

2536
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,880
Right out there wearing mini skirts
and high heels pushing the bay.

2537
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,280
A horse to slot ass on a horse.

Just has no idea what's going on.

2549
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,190
Looks over her shoulder at you.

2550
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,700
I was like,

2551
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,851

2552
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:17,684

Just trying to be nice.

2555
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,180
Trying to be nice the whole time.

2556
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,481
Okay.

2557
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:24,350

Ray Longo,

2567
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,230
and then Diego Lema.

2568
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,370
Who's a Douglas Lema.

2569
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,740
Who's the Belo tore
champion bad motherfucker.

2570
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,530
That's his brother Daigle.

2571
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:39,290
Demod Suffolk.

2572
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,520
Good fights in the house.

2573
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,100
Three rounds in the UFC.

2574
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,450
We rounds.

2575
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,860
I flew in with Bruce Buffer.

2576
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:52,150
We had some interesting
conversations about dating.

2577
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,180
He was fun.

2578
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,340
Was it really?

2579
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,280
It's only a 40 minute flight.

2580
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,520
How many times did you talk
about Pussy and 40 minutes?

2581
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,890
The entire fort for 40 minutes.

2582
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,590
It was a Bruce and this
stuff is interesting.

2583
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,060
Have you ever seen the cover of fighters,

2584
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:08,841
magazine fighters?

2585
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:09,830
Only magazine with Bruce?

2586
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,490
No.

2587
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,890
Bruce would like lipstick
all over his face,

2588
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:14,800
like kisses all over his
face and two hot rods.

2589
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,100
He's got us covered ever
to like champagne bottles.

2590
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,590
Him.

2591
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,161
I said Jamie,

2592
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:20,910
Pella Shit.

2593
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,750
Oh Shit.

2594
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:22,920
I'm in the life.

2595
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:23,581
Yeah,

2596
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:24,414
it's um,

2597
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,130
it's quite ridiculous.

2598
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,300
Okay.

2599
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,710
He loved people have been,

2600
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:30,161
so you know,

2601
01:02:30,161 --> 01:02:33,460
someone that's definitely in fucked up
if they get knocked down because he does

2602
01:02:33,461 --> 01:02:34,450
not jump in early.

2603
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,900
Ed Levine comes into your
back room and he's like,

2604
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:38,261
you listen,

2605
01:02:38,261 --> 01:02:38,780
I'll be your ref.

2606
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,011
You're like,

2607
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:39,251
damn,

2608
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:40,084
I better be on it.

2609
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,560
I'm about to get my ass whipped.

2610
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:42,950
If he's not,

2611
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,190
he stopped the Alexis Davis fight the
right time when Ronda had her out.

2612
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:46,821
I agree.

2613
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:49,250
100% can assign,

2614
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,961
I'm just making a joke.

2615
01:02:49,961 --> 01:02:50,794
He's a great rep.

2616
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,880
Yes.

2617
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,340
Look at this.

2618
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,710
There's Bruce two different.

2619
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,220
Look at him.

2620
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,840
He's got the glass look.

2621
01:02:55,841 --> 01:02:56,630
The girls kissing him.

2622
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,910
He's got the two glasses.

2623
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:58,340
Oh,

2624
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:58,931
I love it,

2625
01:02:58,931 --> 01:02:59,560
man.

2626
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,320
Bruce just doing the living La Vida loca.

2627
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,300
That's cub Swanson.

2628
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,350
That's cub Swanson.

2629
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,430
If you scroll up,

2630
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:07,540
you can see what it says about Bruce.

2631
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:08,290
Buffer.

2632
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:08,861
Scroll down,

2633
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:09,700
scroll down now,

2634
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,880
popping bottles,

2635
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,030
kissing the models,

2636
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,800
the secret playboy lifestyle.

2637
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:15,621
Damn he,

2638
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:18,100
and it's like a tell all of course.

2639
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:19,310
All,

2640
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:19,820
all,

2641
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,710
but he just really all,

2642
01:03:20,711 --> 01:03:21,311
he doesn't hold anything.

2643
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:22,144
I love it.

2644
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:23,141
He told me,

2645
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:23,890
Brendan,

2646
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:27,040
why don't you get down to Malibu
and we'll find some bitches.

2647
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,150
All right.

2648
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,271
Yeah,

2649
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:29,620
that's exactly what he said.

2650
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,150
That's strange choice of words.

2651
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,140
Now I love it.

2652
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,280
Eddie Gordon and Diego Lima.

2653
01:03:33,281 --> 01:03:35,260
Let's get to this because
these are two good fighters.

2654
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,551
Gordon's a Banger,

2655
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,130
man hitting any coffee sharing.

2656
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,471
Oh Man.

2657
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:39,490
Looks like lean is a locked.

2658
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:40,121
Oh,

2659
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:40,810
he's tall.

2660
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,643
He's very tall.

2661
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:42,441
Oh,

2662
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:44,250
Gordon cracked him again.

2663
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,760
Oh,

2664
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,370
okay.

2665
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,203
I'm assuming he has PR.

2666
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:48,721
Oh,

2667
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:50,310
Hammer this ringing it son.

2668
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,690
I'm assuming he as good
Jujitsu train with Matt.

2669
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,440
So we cracked him with that
opera opera because behind there.

2670
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,311
Oh,

2671
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:58,110
he's Lima's in big trouble.

2672
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,010
Big trouble.

2673
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:00,130
Okay.

2674
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:00,930
Boom,

2675
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:01,561
boom,

2676
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:02,161
boom,

2677
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:02,480
boom.

2678
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,313
Oh he should.

2679
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:04,060
They should stop it.

2680
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,900
You are so right about
leaving the Levine cold,

2681
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:07,734
so right.

2682
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:08,680
Okay.

2683
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,513
They'll get that.

2684
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,061
Damn.

2685
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:11,700
What a performance by Eddie court.

2686
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,610
Oh Man.

2687
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,810
That kid can cry.

2688
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,960
I love that upper cut
through under the armpit.

2689
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,520
Who'd from the side see it.

2690
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,830
It's so hard to get out of
the way in which a nasty,

2691
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:21,664
especially when you're against it.

2692
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,690
Tom Henderson got knocked out by,

2693
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,840
I mean that's how I got
knocked out by Anderson man.

2694
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,123
Good.

2695
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,200
It's been rotten.

2696
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,200
Wrong Fella.

2697
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:31,531
Yeah,

2698
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:32,101
he brought it,

2699
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:32,701
planted it,

2700
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:33,720
built a forest with it.

2701
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:34,650
Cut The forest down,

2702
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:35,580
made houses with it.

2703
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:40,581
Hands on farmers.com right now walking
around two 20 it's interesting.

2704
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,590
I don't know Brian.

2705
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,180
He definitely had a little
bit of fat on his body.

2706
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,303
He's

2707
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,390
a little bit jiggling going on.

2708
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:51,120
Sarah.

2709
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,580
Very excited that we'd been over there.

2710
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,980
Weidman was names,

2711
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,410
Weidman,

2712
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,001
motherfuckers,

2713
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:56,910
a champ of the world.

2714
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,590
How good did he look?

2715
01:04:59,340 --> 01:04:59,820
Awesome.

2716
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,571
No one fucks up.

2717
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:01,810
Machita like look at that.

2718
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:02,411
Boom,

2719
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:05,110
would that right here
that appeared in the back.

2720
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,003
Boom,

2721
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:07,930
boom.

2722
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,763
Check this out.

2723
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:09,963
Boom.

2724
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,313
Oh Geez

2725
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:13,530
that he is.

2726
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,400
He is he hitting the
back of the head there,

2727
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,970
but if it's in head,

2728
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,520
boom,

2729
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:18,851
you'll see.

2730
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,780
Hits him in the back of the head.

2731
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,633
Yeah,

2732
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,340
right there.

2733
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,173
Boom.

2734
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,710
Well that was kind of behind the ear.

2735
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:24,920
I mean transitioning.

2736
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:25,391
You're good though.

2737
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:25,961
It doesn't matter.

2738
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:26,170
You know,

2739
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,190
they tell you that too.

2740
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,060
They tell you that name
transition you back.

2741
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,620
They go.

2742
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,700
If you're in transition,

2743
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:32,380
you turn your head and you
get held back in the head.

2744
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,121
Boom.

2745
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:35,830
These at least boom.

2746
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,723
Now he's loud.

2747
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,630
Boom,

2748
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,463
boom.

2749
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,180
Four that he probably shouldn't have,

2750
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,620
but I think it was perfect.

2751
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,521
Perfect,

2752
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,450
perfect stoppage.

2753
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,810
His arm went limp and when
it comes to back of the head,

2754
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,190
those head kicks.

2755
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,540
When you think about a head kick,

2756
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,560
your wrapping around,

2757
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:53,140
your completely targeting
the back of the head.

2758
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:53,891
The thing is though,

2759
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:54,491
like they said,

2760
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:55,600
it's in transition to eat.

2761
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,640
There's nothing to really do and I,

2762
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,091
like I said,

2763
01:05:58,091 --> 01:05:59,080
they tell you in the back,

2764
01:05:59,081 --> 01:05:59,351
they're like,

2765
01:05:59,351 --> 01:05:59,891
listen man,

2766
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:00,760
if it's in transition,

2767
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:01,241
you're moving.

2768
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:02,230
It hits you in the back of the head.

2769
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:03,670
It's your,

2770
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:04,503
it's on you.

2771
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:04,961
Why in minute?

2772
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,610
Anthony Bordain no last name.

2773
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,280
Do you watch that show

2774
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,670
what our case is shooting a lion.

2775
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:13,923
This is Hercules.

2776
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,160
The Rock is Hercules.

2777
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:15,401
Yes,

2778
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,590
he is hundred percent natural.

2779
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,760
45 years old.

2780
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,230
Never done a steroid and as low,

2781
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:21,123
not 45

2782
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,980
35 I think.

2783
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,640
Shut the shut down the
rocks making shit up.

2784
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:30,630
I was not 35 years every
bit of 40 something.

2785
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,780
Oh No,

2786
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:31,901
no,

2787
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:32,160
no.

2788
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,993
You're wrong.

2789
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,610
Why do you say you're wrong
when you don't know how?

2790
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,573
First of all,

2791
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,460
he's 42 dammit.

2792
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,423
It's insane.

2793
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,510
The thing is I don't even need to check.

2794
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:44,344
It's weird.

2795
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:45,660
Yeah,

2796
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,301
you're always wrong.

2797
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,110
Always wrong.

2798
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,100
Pretty much always wrong.

2799
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,570
I need give or take.

2800
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,240
I meant 35 and guys,

2801
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,640
what do we fucking splitting
hairs are accurate.

2802
01:06:58,990 --> 01:06:59,823
However,

2803
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,090
I just like being a,

2804
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:04,900
what is the word?

2805
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,920
Incendiary.

2806
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,570
If you've ever ridden a motorcycle man.

2807
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:08,591
Ah Yes.

2808
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,371
A long time ago.

2809
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:11,920
Never do you want to really,

2810
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:13,050
really bad fuck yet.

2811
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:13,730
Right?

2812
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,160
Heels got damn commercials.

2813
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,090
Looks like so much fun.

2814
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:16,421
I know.

2815
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,380
So dangerous though,

2816
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:17,770
right?

2817
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,450
If I just rode my bike through
Venice and I was scared as shit.

2818
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,473
Dangerous.

2819
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,200
Dangerous because you can't move.

2820
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:24,200
You can't like really bad.

2821
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,540
They get out away from shit,

2822
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:30,700
but they say you chances of crashing on
your bikes like 99% the first year you

2823
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:31,140
buy one.

2824
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:31,973
Yeah.

2825
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,360
Yeah.

2826
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,250
Motorcycle biker was,

2827
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:34,450
hey,

2828
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,201
it's a matter of time.

2829
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:36,070
You're going to crash.

2830
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:36,370
Yeah.

2831
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:36,761
It's just to,

2832
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,594
how bad is it?

2833
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,470
I saw a guy down there.

2834
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,341
I just don't,

2835
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:40,174
I just don't want to do it.

2836
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,470
I saw a really weird,

2837
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,080
he slid off his bike and
hit a curb and hit his head.

2838
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:44,540
Ooh.

2839
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,440
Was that you saw it?

2840
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,000
Yup.

2841
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,720
Whoa.

2842
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,291
What'd you do?

2843
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,840
Anything is dead stopped.

2844
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,490
I got out,

2845
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,241
Jack them off,

2846
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:53,260
jumped back in my car.

2847
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:57,100
I got out fucked him is
this it took his watch.

2848
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,050
Drove home with his wallet in my pocket

2849
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,600
and it's bad news.

2850
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,920
Gordon's a beast,

2851
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,370
man.

2852
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:03,760
Oh,

2853
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,680
I know how this guy in
the left feels right now.

2854
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,670
Losing the ultimate fighter.

2855
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:08,470
Do you think your life is over?

2856
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,071
I started

2857
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:14,071
applying@monstersdotcomputaresumeonaftertheultimatefighteronmonsters.com
what's

2858
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:15,440
monsters.com?

2859
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:18,950
It's where everyone's job search
place where you upload your resume.

2860
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:20,240
People tried to find you for a job.

2861
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:21,323
Man,

2862
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,281
I'm making that up.

2863
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:23,030
I didn't do that,

2864
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:24,020
but I felt like doing it.

2865
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,710
Look at this very exciting not matter.

2866
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,890
That ring card girl,

2867
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,433
I didn't notice

2868
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,290
that guy has got a future.

2869
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,190
He's got a future.

2870
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:35,940
They both do.

2871
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,400
Yeah,

2872
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:36,810
he does.

2873
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:37,410
You're right.

2874
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:38,820
Diego Luna has got a future too.

2875
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,901
What does that what?

2876
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:42,141
What?

2877
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:43,200
Diego Leymah now what?

2878
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:44,330
What does his contract say now?

2879
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:45,380
He still fights in the UFC.

2880
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:45,860
Yes.

2881
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,910
He'll get one more shot.

2882
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:47,541
You lose that one.

2883
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:47,990
You're done.

2884
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,230
Really scares fight I've
ever had lose the Roy Nelson.

2885
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:51,981
Then they tell me,

2886
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:52,221
oh,

2887
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:53,370
we want you to fight in your hometown.

2888
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,750
No pressure hometown for
I think four months later.

2889
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:01,520
Who did you find Chase Gormley and beat
the brakes off him and 40 37 seconds.

2890
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,740
37 seconds in front of home crowd.

2891
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,630
What's your next move?

2892
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,483
You're fine.

2893
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,880
I just like it was throwing like this.

2894
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:08,714
I was so nervous.

2895
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,700
I had no idea what I was doing.

2896
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:13,940
So nervous man.

2897
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,180
No most nervous I've ever been because I
thought if I lost that I want to have a

2898
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:17,790
career.

2899
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,430
Just kinda true.

2900
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,360
All that work kind of true.

2901
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:21,141
Yeah,

2902
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:21,940
it is kind of true.

2903
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,210
There's that won the UFC is,

2904
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:23,421
oh,

2905
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,254
we're good man.

2906
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,530
Has anybody ever gone from the UFC?

2907
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:28,311
Gotten cut,

2908
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,690
came from ultimate fighter?

2909
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,470
Yeah.

2910
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:34,070
Came back and like made a run at the title

2911
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:37,023
so far.

2912
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:37,421
Nobody,

2913
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:37,750
right.

2914
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:42,260
I can't think of anyone know who's like
the best guy that's been cut and look

2915
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,031
sensational.

2916
01:09:43,031 --> 01:09:44,500
And other organizations,

2917
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,810
probably Anthony Johnson.

2918
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:47,381
Well,

2919
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:51,370
at one point named Mark Hart who Could
Strike Force One and beat Tyron Woodley.

2920
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:52,121
Yeah.

2921
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,280
But he was in strike force.

2922
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,161
It's still like in the,

2923
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:55,210
the zoom for banner.

2924
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,840
That's true.

2925
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,021
Yeah.

2926
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:59,170
Cause they owned them at the
time I end game the title shot.

2927
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,060
Uh,

2928
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,740
and the second question
Anthony Johnson got caught.

2929
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,350
But that was mostly a weight issue thing.

2930
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,860
Lloyd issue man,

2931
01:10:05,861 --> 01:10:08,150
I don't East but God
damn did he look good?

2932
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:08,831
Think about it.

2933
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:11,230
When you get cut from
the UFC and you move on,

2934
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:11,951
especially a young guy,

2935
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:12,820
I'm trying to think who does.

2936
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:13,654
Well

2937
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,800
Melvin Gallard just one.

2938
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:18,510
But that's really his first one.

2939
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,070
Did Gallard when he did win,

2940
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,690
he missed weight though again.

2941
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,740
We did again.

2942
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:23,603
Yes.

2943
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,551
It's frustrating.

2944
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:24,650
It.

2945
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,600
Oh my God.

2946
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,450
Does that do not get any
person when that happens.

2947
01:10:27,451 --> 01:10:28,980
So you lose 20% of it.

2948
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,620
Oh the other guy gets 20% good.

2949
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,533
So,

2950
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:38,100
so interesting to see different guys and
the different weight cutting strategies

2951
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:38,880
and you know,

2952
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,720
some guys believe in drinking distilled
water and some guys say you shouldn't

2953
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:46,290
drink distilled water like to trying to
like read their body of electrolytes.

2954
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,970
So it's easy to look at this.

2955
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,260
Boom Gordon with the big
right hand and power the um,

2956
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,870
the idea behind it is that you rid
your body of all these electrolytes,

2957
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:03,090
keep pumping it with fluids and then the
fluids just flushed out of your system

2958
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,710
quicker and then you can
replenish them quicker.

2959
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:06,421
You know,

2960
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:10,050
I've got to have a dolce on and talked
to him about that shit would say whatever

2961
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:10,860
adultery is doing,

2962
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,500
probably stick to that everybody.

2963
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,853
Yeah.

2964
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,250
Yeah.

2965
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,920
Tiago Alvarez never looked
better in his last fight.

2966
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:17,371
That's another thing.

2967
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:20,370
A lot of guys are coming
in to like real light,

2968
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:25,790
like the week of like Mochida well Machita
walked around that 203 pounds when we

2969
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:28,290
just champ.

2970
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,460
When he's competing at two fives,

2971
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:30,570
203 pounds.

2972
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:31,563
It's tough for him.

2973
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,110
That's his natural weight.

2974
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:33,650
Yeah.

2975
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:34,100
What's your sweat?

2976
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:34,561
He does,

2977
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:37,230
you know he's thinking
to go into one 70 no.

2978
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:37,500
Yup.

2979
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,400
That's what he said in an interview.

2980
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:39,690
The way the week of the fight,

2981
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:40,930
they said he could go to one 70.

2982
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,880
I was asking them,

2983
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:42,840
I was in the locker room.

2984
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,063
The training room.

2985
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:44,680
Yeah.

2986
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,513
I see.

2987
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,121
That's the thing,

2988
01:11:46,121 --> 01:11:48,570
and people ask me about cutting
a two o two oh five all time.

2989
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,190
When you go down a weight class,

2990
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:51,700
everyone's skills get better.

2991
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,280
Everyone's way faster.

2992
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:54,680
So sometimes it like,

2993
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,060
so my advantage at
heavyweight is cardio speed,

2994
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:57,370
right?

2995
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,090
We are going to in two or
five now you're now you're,

2996
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:00,781
it's almost even,

2997
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:02,160
it doesn't become your advantage really.

2998
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:04,890
I don't think there's comes a
point of diminishing returns,

2999
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:05,650
right.

3000
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:06,090
Hits the,

3001
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:06,361
there was,

3002
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:07,194
you

3003
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,500
know,

3004
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,333
v

3005
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:11,520
Talk.

3006
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,840
It looks like he's wearing them.

3007
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:13,341
I honor him,

3008
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,440
but he's just got that
natural sort of dark,

3009
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,680
just a black eye all the time.

3010
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,190
The pure smoldering just
smoldering is right.

3011
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,530
Concentrate smoldering
little cutie on UFC.

3012
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:23,161
Now here it is.

3013
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:23,994
Here's your show again.

3014
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:32,470
Look at me picking up weights and
I'm doing it on some fake grass.

3015
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:33,661
Fake.

3016
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:35,250
Everybody has to have fake grass.

3017
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,920
He builds champions from the inside out.

3018
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,720
Dun,

3019
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:38,920
Dun,

3020
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,551
Dun Dun.

3021
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,310
It looked like that was Rashad Evans,

3022
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,580
these guys to running your
strength coach was having me,

3023
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,780
Loren Landow invited me to run,

3024
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,540
come run with the NFL.

3025
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,440
Some of the NFL.

3026
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:53,641
No I did not.

3027
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,780
It was I had to get on
a plane to go to Mexico.

3028
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,750
I don't want to get to humiliate it.

3029
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,980
Do you want to get humiliated?

3030
01:12:58,981 --> 01:12:59,251
By the way,

3031
01:12:59,251 --> 01:12:59,891
would it come up in this?

3032
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:01,470
She was to any way because guess what?

3033
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:03,600
I don't want to have to try to
run against the Denver Broncos.

3034
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,090
You're not running against them.

3035
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,030
You're jumping in working.

3036
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,221
Yes I am.

3037
01:13:09,221 --> 01:13:10,530
I'm in my mind.

3038
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:11,820
The mind of Brian Cowen.

3039
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,070
Yeah,

3040
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,903
he's running.

3041
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,570
Definitely don't show up or you
not going to be all you want,

3042
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,340
but their dicks and a slap in
the face as they run by it.

3043
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:20,130
Yeah.

3044
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,460
Dot.

3045
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,570
Definitely don't show up then.

3046
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,230
I thought you,

3047
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,610
I thought you're going as like a fan boy.

3048
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:24,211
It'd be cool for,

3049
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:24,811
even if I was,

3050
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:26,160
does it make me feel good about myself?

3051
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:26,491
How many,

3052
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:27,241
many times a week.

3053
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:28,074
Are you working out Brian?

3054
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,600
You talk a lot about
working at twice a day.

3055
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,180
Uh,

3056
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:31,970
I don't know if you know,

3057
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,030
not quite honestly.

3058
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,700
I just something almost every day.

3059
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:36,580
Really?

3060
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,413
Yeah.

3061
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,340
Say Really?

3062
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:42,420
You made up a nose job?

3063
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:44,583
I didn't make

3064
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,660
a weird thing to make up one.

3065
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:49,220
It why?

3066
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:52,300
Nobody definitely made up the part about
them taking cartilage out of your nose.

3067
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,721
Here's what they did.

3068
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:58,950
What Dr Dr Doctor Cartilage and
they put it under it right here.

3069
01:13:58,951 --> 01:13:59,784
Look,

3070
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,301
here's the problem.

3071
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:03,360
I think if you're a doctor,

3072
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:08,361
please write in about how they take a
plastic splint and they do put it right

3073
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:08,581
there.

3074
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,740
We were talking about sort
of keep that thing up.

3075
01:14:10,741 --> 01:14:11,710
They did to me too.

3076
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:12,280
They'd make,

3077
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,120
but it's plastic.

3078
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:13,790
It's not hard.

3079
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:15,010
This is exactly what he said.

3080
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:16,330
He said when you were under,

3081
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,310
you're under for a long time.

3082
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,193
Your nose,

3083
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,250
tons days,

3084
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:23,560
a hundred days in a techs
and stuff and I had to take,

3085
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,590
I had to add a piece of cartilage right
under here that's so calling his dick

3086
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:35,040
knows they have to probably
found inside of the spare car.

3087
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:35,680
Brian,

3088
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,250
there's no spirit.

3089
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:36,611
I don't know.

3090
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,140
I'm not a doctor guys on that,

3091
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:38,974
you know,

3092
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,520
long time ago build you
out and we're back on it.

3093
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,950
I tried bailing young guys 16 years ago.

3094
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:46,660
Things get real shaky and
he's talking about something.

3095
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,010
I have to stick to my guns here.

3096
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,660
I had cartilage in the nose.

3097
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:50,860
Um,

3098
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,230
I think I don't really
have a ton times defense.

3099
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:55,000
He is at the box to him all the time.

3100
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,171
He's there a lot.

3101
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:56,561
I'll give them,

3102
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:57,380
I believe that.

3103
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,530
I believe that blocks and a lot.

3104
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,573
I like working out.

3105
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,540
It's good for you and need it.

3106
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,530
I feel better if I'm not,

3107
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:03,380
I don't want to work at I.

3108
01:15:03,381 --> 01:15:04,214
I get a little crazy.

3109
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:04,960
Yeah.

3110
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,780
I like your boy.

3111
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:10,240
Lauren took me through a workout for an
hour and a in that Denver altitude and I

3112
01:15:10,241 --> 01:15:11,320
didn't get a lot of weights.

3113
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:12,543
Let me tell you something.

3114
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,331
I have trouble.

3115
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:14,770
I'm having trouble
walking around right now.

3116
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:15,011
Oh,

3117
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,240
this is supposed to be a good site.

3118
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,440
This happened earlier.

3119
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:20,470
A drowned on Martine's
humbly kicks in the nuts.

3120
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,380
The Rosie Martinez is the guy
that Donald Cerrone k code.

3121
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:25,040
He said,

3122
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:25,510
yeah,

3123
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:26,343
champion.

3124
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:26,691
Yeah,

3125
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:28,360
he's with a bad head kick.

3126
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,140
Mcnasty head kick.

3127
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:31,570
Yeah.

3128
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,250
It was a Shin Shin to the neck.

3129
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,170
It's just walking in Bang,

3130
01:15:35,171 --> 01:15:35,510
Bang.

3131
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:37,120
Just head movement.

3132
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:38,740
Not a lot of technique,

3133
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:42,430
just straight forward muscular
guys are just walking down.

3134
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,110
The dude has good striking
and could use Jitsu too.

3135
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:46,760
He's really good to just to mark.

3136
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,470
Definitely better.

3137
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,750
Definitely best or better than
the guy with the beard of the guy.

3138
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,613
Who were you talking about?

3139
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,240
The Guy Without the beard?

3140
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,260
Martine's he's the guy that
Serone KOD and his last fight,

3141
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,420
but he saw is when we ties.

3142
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,031
Very good too,

3143
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:01,864
man.

3144
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,490
There's so many good fighters now.

3145
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,420
It's just such a crazy time for the sport.

3146
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,110
Crazy.

3147
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:08,741
It's amazing.

3148
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:12,820
You mean you've seen these
guys on an other organizations,

3149
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:16,840
you've seen these guys and other
shows you're seeing every week.

3150
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,340
Like every time it was a new car,

3151
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:19,720
there's some new guy who's coming up.

3152
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,150
You know what was weird
is that at the UFC expo,

3153
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,410
obviously it's the UFT expo.

3154
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:23,980
So everyone's,

3155
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,510
they're looking for UFC fighters.

3156
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,040
I can't walk through.

3157
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:27,281
Right.

3158
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:27,911
It's a beast.

3159
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:28,840
You have to have security.

3160
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,190
Most UFC fighters do.

3161
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:31,120
If you're a popular fighter,

3162
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,963
you can't walk through,

3163
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,280
uh,

3164
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,500
Chandler from Bella.

3165
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,320
I saw him like he'll shit
this channeling I've,

3166
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:37,781
I've ever seen.

3167
01:16:37,781 --> 01:16:38,690
We're only understanding my belt.

3168
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,280
Not One person stopped him walk.

3169
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,520
I could walk straight through.

3170
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,900
That's the difference.

3171
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:44,883
Bell Tours.

3172
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,221
Oh,

3173
01:16:45,221 --> 01:16:46,670
you want to go to Bella toward God.

3174
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,643
Good luck.

3175
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,160
Good luck.

3176
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,000
No sponsors.

3177
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,050
No one knows who you are.

3178
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,280
People might kind of watch but not really
unless you're rampage Jackson for now.

3179
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,590
Do you think that it's bell
tours sticks around changes?

3180
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,850
It's Goofy fucking name.

3181
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:58,781
I think.

3182
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,220
Look there on Spike TV.

3183
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,151
Oh Nice.

3184
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:04,990
Elder Andrea and I think what's
the biggest move they've ever made?

3185
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:05,261
Hiram.

3186
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:06,094
Scott Coker.

3187
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:06,611
Oh yeah,

3188
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:07,444
that is nice.

3189
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,560
I like got to get some
young talent though,

3190
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:09,741
man.

3191
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,574
You can't be,

3192
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,350
I mean I love rampage but you need,

3193
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,670
you need to build your own.

3194
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,680
You can't have x UFC guys.

3195
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,040
Right.

3196
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,650
But that was how they
built that paper view.

3197
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:20,360
They sold 100,000 paper views.

3198
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,970
The reason why they did is because
the Tito Ortiz and cause a rampage.

3199
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,570
I agree.

3200
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:23,751
Yeah,

3201
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:24,350
that's,

3202
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:25,070
Oh,

3203
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:25,581
beautiful.

3204
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:26,570
Straight left.

3205
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,790
Oh and a kick to the sac or Rooney.

3206
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:29,360
Ouch.

3207
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,360
That's down tick shot down shot tech
shop that I talked to two group is about

3208
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,070
and Duke and del Grantee
says the same thing.

3209
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,810
He said you got to wear a tie cop,

3210
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,830
they'll steal Teichopsia they stay
fully [inaudible] they go through it.

3211
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,430
I got a diamond cutter love rate,

3212
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:45,920
right?

3213
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,490
Yeah.

3214
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:48,560
Protects this bill protects
it really protects you.

3215
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:50,060
Protects his nine piece of a Dick.

3216
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:53,480
I got dime piece only
the best for this thing.

3217
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:57,080
But this is what I was going to tell you
what telegraph they said and what uh,

3218
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,980
Duke Roufus said,

3219
01:17:57,981 --> 01:18:01,940
it's like the Thai cups are steel
and so when someone kicks you,

3220
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:03,170
it hurts foot.

3221
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,950
That make sense?

3222
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:04,281
Yeah.

3223
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:08,150
And it just like completely
snugs up against your junk.

3224
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:12,630
Just can't go [inaudible] like
snuffaluffagus in a ski mask.

3225
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,600
I mean you're tying it in place.

3226
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:16,460
You said it feels
uncomfortable and it wedges.

3227
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:17,840
Shapes.

3228
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,051
Yeah,

3229
01:18:18,051 --> 01:18:21,270
you tie it through like a wedge like
goes up your ass like a g string.

3230
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,320
But after the fight is over,

3231
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,041
first of all,

3232
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:28,630
the area near your butthole
must smell just rain.

3233
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,120
Maybe you can wear it to the mall.

3234
01:18:31,121 --> 01:18:32,510
They to watch him get ready to watch it.

3235
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,381
I'm telling you guys,

3236
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:34,101
you want to see this.

3237
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:34,400
You know what?

3238
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,150
I see this definitely.

3239
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:35,421
He goes,

3240
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:36,680
you kicked me in the nuts.

3241
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,120
You kicked me in the nuts.

3242
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:38,954
All right.

3243
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,210
Oh No,

3244
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:41,600
man,

3245
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,740
you Levine was on that one.

3246
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,110
All right.

3247
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,330
Very nice guys get upset when
he kicked him in the nuts.

3248
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:48,200
Pretty decent back.

3249
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:48,501
It's good.

3250
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:49,230
Call that Brandon.

3251
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:50,061
Good back structure.

3252
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:50,690
They're called it.

3253
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,890
What happened earlier today,

3254
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:52,724
Brian?

3255
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:53,960
Oh yeah,

3256
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,393
I know.

3257
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,530
I was just saying.

3258
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:01,570
Yeah.

3259
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,050
Do you remember the part where I said,

3260
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:05,370
I heard this was a good
fight and I said yes.

3261
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:06,560
So we just kicked in the nuts.

3262
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,080
Not a close listener guys.

3263
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:09,561
Not when.

3264
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:10,394
It's not about you,

3265
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:11,900
about details.

3266
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,731
If we're talking about you,

3267
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:13,210
you'd be both.

3268
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:13,810
Yeah,

3269
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:14,281
I get very,

3270
01:19:14,281 --> 01:19:15,114
I get,

3271
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,550
I can write here so,

3272
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:19,610
and we know Heinz world.

3273
01:19:19,611 --> 01:19:20,870
He had a nose job in the rocks,

3274
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:21,704
25 years old.

3275
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,550
I wasn't a nose job.

3276
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,690
It was a deviated septum.

3277
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:27,351
There is a difference,

3278
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:27,830
man.

3279
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,210
I can't tell you when I told people I was,

3280
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:29,811
we were going to do this,

3281
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:31,070
but we'll get that beautiful right hook.

3282
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:31,933
Oh my goodness.

3283
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,103
Go easy on me.

3284
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:33,390
Oh yeah.

3285
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:34,223
That's all they said.

3286
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:37,670
Do you understand Brian
counts like my brother.

3287
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:38,600
You fucking idiots.

3288
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,150
And people listening
because he brings lunch.

3289
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:44,690
Rock was 24 years old by the way.

3290
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:45,524
He deserves it.

3291
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:46,483
He deserves everything.

3292
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,650
He didn't have cartilage
putting his fucking nose.

3293
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,520
We all know that.

3294
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:50,570
He may let it stay up.

3295
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,370
I'll call the doctor right now.

3296
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,650
You guys probably really isn't
a black belt in taekwondo,

3297
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:55,160
but it's okay.

3298
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,993
That's what this shit

3299
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,630
is fucking what's his face as a wrestler?

3300
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,520
La Tanning chain.

3301
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:02,840
Him.

3302
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,300
Channing Tatum Hung Shannon

3303
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:07,140
one.

3304
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,130
Oh my goodness.

3305
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,830
This is that movie about
that fucking crazy ass hole.

3306
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,070
This is that movie about Sholtz.

3307
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,710
Yes.

3308
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,543
Oh boy.

3309
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,420
Dave Schultz and Mark Schultz about that.

3310
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,500
The guy who was a patron.

3311
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,161
Yeah.

3312
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:21,540
What the fuck was his name

3313
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:24,330
was?

3314
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:25,163
He was at Mac.

3315
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,160
He was a big mogul,

3316
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:26,460
uh,

3317
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,540
or came from a family.

3318
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:28,403
Um,

3319
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,010
damn it.

3320
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:29,843
Oh man,

3321
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,413
that was his name.

3322
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,873
I can't remember.

3323
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,943
Let's see.

3324
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:39,550
I'll pull it up right here.

3325
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:41,440
It was killed by dupont.

3326
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,150
John Haunt John Dupont.

3327
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,500
Really Rich Guy,

3328
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,610
like to wrestle with people and
Steve Carell's playing dupont.

3329
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,533
Wow.

3330
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:50,621
That'd be a good man.

3331
01:20:50,621 --> 01:20:52,990
Apparently he knocks him
out of a fucking park.

3332
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:53,500
Really?

3333
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:53,681
Yeah.

3334
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:54,131
By the way,

3335
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:56,380
Chan rounds the Channing Tatum dime piece.

3336
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,500
You need to make your
body look way better.

3337
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:00,790
If you went on to play Mark Schultz,

3338
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,360
bitch,

3339
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,360
how about he's a little chunky and
a 22 jump street and Chubby Joe.

3340
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,020
What's name Jonah Hill?

3341
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:08,980
Jonah Hill's valid.

3342
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:09,400
Great.

3343
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,233
Compared to join it.

3344
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,550
What?

3345
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,781
He's like,

3346
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:11,300
yeah,

3347
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,133
I kind of have it,

3348
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,580
but if you notice in 22 jump street and
this kind of stuff I know is cause I'm

3349
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:16,240
super vain.

3350
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,130
He had his shirt on the entire time.

3351
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,710
The other one that you'd take your
shirt off and from what I saw in that

3352
01:21:20,711 --> 01:21:21,041
preview,

3353
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:21,874
he looked all right.

3354
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,091
Well,

3355
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:22,420
yes.

3356
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,960
I mean in my opinion that's like offensive
to me because if you've ever seen

3357
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:27,250
what Mark Schultz looks like,

3358
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:28,031
Mark Schultz,

3359
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:30,970
the wrestler is a fucking animal beast.

3360
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:34,750
It'd be like the rock plain Hercules
and it's like a smooth build.

3361
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:36,990
That full is jack to play Herculean.

3362
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,460
She got,

3363
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,340
he's jacked.

3364
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,131
Well Schultz,

3365
01:21:39,131 --> 01:21:42,820
when he was in his prime to grab guys,

3366
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:45,160
he used to get guys in in illegal moves.

3367
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:45,680
Like he'd,

3368
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,260
he'd use cameras and he would hit a Komora
and just rip guy shoulders off while

3369
01:21:50,261 --> 01:21:51,190
I was taking them down.

3370
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,780
Mangled guys.

3371
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,140
Yeah.

3372
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,190
I mean he was a fucking,

3373
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,990
and I don't know the story of that movie,

3374
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:58,180
but I'll for sure buy a ticket to that.

3375
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:03,210
It's a fascinating story because these
guys were all broke and dupont would pay

3376
01:22:03,581 --> 01:22:05,830
these guys to come to his compound,

3377
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:09,580
built this wrestling thing and wrestle
with them and like roll around with them

3378
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:10,990
and get all sweaty and gay with them.

3379
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,450
And then you get game.

3380
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:14,430
Oh,

3381
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,230
is gay.

3382
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,150
Was He being funny or no?

3383
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:17,291
No,

3384
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,160
I'm not being funny at all.

3385
01:22:18,161 --> 01:22:18,970
It's totally true.

3386
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,691
And He,

3387
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:21,040
a wound up killing.

3388
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,700
Um,

3389
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,850
he wound up killing Dave Schultz
who was a great wrestler.

3390
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:25,733
I want to see a movie.

3391
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:26,571
I mean,

3392
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:27,700
me just told me the whole plot

3393
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:30,881
based on some shit.

3394
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:31,151
Yeah,

3395
01:22:31,151 --> 01:22:31,840
man.

3396
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:32,850
There's more to the movies,

3397
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:33,671
good movies,

3398
01:22:33,671 --> 01:22:34,630
different and the movie,

3399
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:35,830
he becomes a Werewolf.

3400
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:40,780
I'll tell you what I saw that
new horror movie with a Dui.

3401
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,000
Is anyone likes scary movies here?

3402
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:42,730
No.

3403
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:43,563
No.

3404
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,583
Scary.

3405
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:45,873
Eric Bana.

3406

Yeah.

3413
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,250
He's a cop and it supposed
to be a true story.

3414
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,710
Oh yeah.

3415
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,710

3417
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,040
Scariest movie of all time.

3418
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,113
The cadre,

3419
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,230

3420
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:03,063

3427
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,910
you're all of 60 years.

3428
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,850
Whatever conjuring.

3429
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:10,950
Actually cadre was scary.

3430
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:11,190

I'll give you that.

3433
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:12,600
It was scary.

3434
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:12,801
No,

3435
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:13,511

3436
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:14,100

3438
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,810
What does it deliver us from evil,

3439
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,790

3440
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:19,803
I'll tell you what.

3441
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,370
Definitely slept with my lights on.

3442
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:22,511
Yeah.

3443
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:23,021
I'm not afraid.

3444
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:23,370
A minute.

3445
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,280
I had my lights on.

3446
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,340
Did you?

3447
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,051
It was scary,

3448
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:26,620
man.

3449
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:26,861

man.

3453
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,610
Scariest movie of all time.

3454
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:31,444
I'll say that.

3455
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:32,831
I don't know.

3456
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:35,500
I mean not the home and
the almond was scary.

3457
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,240
I would have to think about that.

3458
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,630
I the angel heart scare
the shit out of me,

3459
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,350

3460
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,000
You guys think the only thing new Brian?

3461
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:43,451
No,

3462
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:43,910
I don't.

3463
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:44,230
Yeah.

3464
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:49,230
Anything Angel are scared
the shit out of me for real.

3465
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,920
The extremism is a cop out,

3466
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:51,320
man.

3467
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,230
It's X.

3468
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,060
Maybe greatest of all time though.

3469
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:57,810
Know what the grace of all time as
far as a scary movie horror movie.

3470
01:23:57,811 --> 01:23:58,030
Yeah.

3471
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,090
Oh No,

3472
01:23:59,440 --> 01:23:59,771
no.

3473
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:01,420
Because you've got to
put them in perspective.

3474
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:04,540
Like it might've been great
down then you watch it now.

3475
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,400
You're bored is fun watching
it now you're bored.

3476
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:07,541
Watching recently,

3477
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,260
about four years ago and I was
pretty damn scared in the middle.

3478
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:10,961
You'd washing it.

3479
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:13,400
You were tweeting and checking your back.

3480
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,510
Then I barely see.

3481
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,281
That's the thing.

3482
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:15,520
When I,

3483
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,470
when I saw it delivers from evil,

3484
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:17,731
when it,

3485
01:24:17,731 --> 01:24:18,580
when I saw that movie,

3486
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,880
I saw it at the marina theaters
where there's that dining experience,

3487
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,330
this fuck next to me's chewing on popcorn.

3488
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,070
He has like a Margarita.

3489
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,630
It fucks up the whole experience.

3490
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:30,970
I will be terrified.

3491
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,420
Chompy choppers over here is on Twizzlers
and sour patch kids balls deep in his

3492
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:36,940
girl.

3493
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:37,451
You know what I'm saying?

3494
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:37,661
I'm like,

3495
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:38,140
dude,

3496
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,760
reclining back and shit.

3497
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,630
It's not as scary.

3498
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,310
The shiny things,

3499
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,710
good one that's shining is a,

3500
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,630
it was scary as shit.

3501
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,630
That might be that my scary that
filmed in Colorado might jump.

3502
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,810
I might jump ship and say I might,

3503
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,440
I might.

3504
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,300
I don't have any characters too.

3505
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:55,690
I don't usually stick to my original,

3506
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,400
but I,

3507
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,100
I'd say the shining is a,

3508
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,500
with the conjuring,

3509
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:02,780
the Texas chainsaw massacre was pretty
fucking scary too because never really

3510
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:05,440
pictured the original one or the
one who Jessica Biel original.

3511
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:05,771
No,

3512
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:06,221
I liked the one.

3513
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:06,950
Just go Beal.

3514
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:07,600
Yeah.

3515
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,220
Well I loved it because of Jessica Biel.

3516
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,240
Me Too.

3517
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,320
I'll take it because of that.

3518
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,030
That was a scary goddamn movie.

3519
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,140
You know what else was scary,

3520
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:14,560
man,

3521
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,393
jaws.

3522
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,200
Jaws was fun.

3523
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,290
I then ruined me for the ocean to song.

3524
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,860
Got attacked by a great white
off the Manhattan beach.

3525
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:21,460
But I think,

3526
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,060
I think the guy,

3527
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,560
they were long distance swimmers right?

3528
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:24,080
And they,

3529
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,320
they had hooked the great
white as a seven footer.

3530
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:26,531
Hey,

3531
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:27,364
guess what?

3532
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,170
I don't give a fuck what happened.

3533
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:30,550
He got attacked by a great white,

3534
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,920
but they did say he was fishing and,

3535
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,570
and the guy caught a great white.

3536
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,020
Yeah,

3537
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:35,380
he was.

3538
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,550
He's going to do with it.

3539
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,503
What are you gonna do with it?

3540
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:38,311
He was really going to,

3541
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:39,071
in 40 minutes later,

3542
01:25:39,071 --> 01:25:43,570
the slums and swimmers swim between
the Rod and basically the shark and the

3543
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:44,201
shark bit.

3544
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:45,250
The dude in the torso.

3545
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:46,084
He's fine though.

3546
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,380
Gangster Tattoo.

3547
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:48,760
That's right.

3548
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,480
Super Cool.

3549
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,313
Tattoos.

3550
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,041
I just want to get bit,

3551
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:52,090
just got until the story.

3552
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,551
Yeah.

3553
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:55,420
Jarls was scary though.

3554
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:55,811
I'll give you,

3555
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:56,860
that was a scary one.

3556
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:57,101
Yeah,

3557
01:25:57,101 --> 01:25:57,721
that was very,

3558
01:25:57,721 --> 01:25:58,331
so I'm guessing.

3559
01:25:58,331 --> 01:25:59,320
No one seeing the country.

3560
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:00,281
I have,

3561
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:00,731
I saw it.

3562
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:03,770
Here's another one that was
curious character 28 days later.

3563
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,190
That was scary.

3564
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:05,380
See,

3565
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:08,270
that's rom to save removing
that does nothing for me.

3566
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:10,670
You know what scared me was,

3567
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:11,060
uh,

3568
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:11,850
uh,

3569
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:12,170
uh,

3570
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:13,003
what was that movie?

3571
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,540
Paranormal activity.

3572
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:15,140
The first one.

3573
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,410
The first one is real.

3574
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,440
I saw the Blair witch project.

3575
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:19,070
You see that?

3576
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:19,340
Yeah.

3577
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,061
I thought it was real.

3578
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:20,900
I was super skinny.

3579
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:22,450
He thought it was real.

3580
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,110
It was a home camera man.

3581
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,761
The way they filmed it,

3582
01:26:24,761 --> 01:26:26,030
it was pretty genius in that sense.

3583
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:26,750
But I didn't,

3584
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,583
I didn't really,

3585
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,500
but a Blair witch project
scared me a little bit.

3586
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:32,090
And so did the second one,

3587
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:32,620
Blair,

3588
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,410
which scared me.

3589
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,660
I saw Blair witch with
my buddy Chris Mcguire.

3590
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:36,710
We went to a,

3591
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:38,390
we were working in Houston.

3592
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,260
It was doing the laugh,

3593
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:39,870
laugh,

3594
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:40,250
stop,

3595
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,450
which doesn't exist anymore.

3596
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:46,220
And these kids that worked at the movie
theater across the street came to the

3597
01:26:46,221 --> 01:26:47,300
show and they said,

3598
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:47,810
hey,

3599
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,210
do you guys want to go see
the Blair witch project?

3600
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,950
Just all of us in the movie theater.

3601
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,270
We have the keys.

3602
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:53,691
And we were like,

3603
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:54,860
are you fucking kidding me?

3604
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,720
And so we did a show,

3605
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:58,250
I think it was like a Thursday night show.

3606
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:00,590
So we did like eight
o'clock show after show,

3607
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:00,951
you know,

3608
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:02,000
say goodbye to everybody,

3609
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:02,930
go across the street.

3610
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:03,291
And we,

3611
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:03,440
uh,

3612
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,760
they turned on the movie theater.

3613
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:05,571
They turned on the lights,

3614
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:06,404
lock the door.

3615
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,273
We went in,

3616
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,180
they turned on the fucking the theater
and we sat down and watched Blair witch

3617
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,380
and it scared the piss
out are super skid us.

3618
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,470
Well first I was like,

3619
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:17,240
this is fucking a tie was him.

3620
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,710
It was so low budget,

3621
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,250
so low budget and then I saw it again
in a movie with a bunch of people and it

3622
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:23,390
was whack when they felt,

3623
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:25,930
when they found it was titan.

3624
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,420
Yeah,

3625
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,110
you need to be alone.

3626
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,621
That's a really,

3627
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:28,460
that's scary setting.

3628
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:31,790
Some guy brought his three years
old during the whole movie.

3629
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,380
If you're alone in a big movie theater,

3630
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,640
you could die right there.

3631
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,110
That can be a trap he's setting.

3632
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,030
It's true.

3633
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,820
It's an na.

3634
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,653
They were,

3635
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,513
you know,

3636
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,700
one kid thing like that.

3637
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:42,440
It was ring and he weighed 80 pounds.

3638
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:46,910
It was a girl that was overweight like
no one was getting her if anybody's

3639
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:47,271
getting hurt.

3640
01:27:47,271 --> 01:27:48,104
It was funny though,

3641
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,180
but they were nice.

3642
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:51,650
It was cool that they did that for us.

3643
01:27:51,651 --> 01:27:52,640
That was really fun.

3644
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,241
Oh by the way,

3645
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:53,570
I'm,

3646
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:54,650
I will be there.

3647
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:56,230
You're going to plug your fucking dates.

3648
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,220
July 19th.

3649
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:00,080

3650
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:02,450

So we officially hunting

We do you down for Alaska last week.

3655
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:11,420
I thought you said first week.

3656
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:13,040
Now you're changing it like an idiot.

3657
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:14,660
You're changing the dates.

3658
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,290
I know you.

3659
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:15,711
No you didn't.

3660
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:16,430
You didn't give me an injection.

3661
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,151
I have the text here.

3662
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:17,990
Don't make me pull it up.

3663
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,360
Please pull it up because
that was the last week.

3664
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,080

What do you guys go on a hunt again?

01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:27,050

01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:27,740

Are you around the end of September?

3677
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:37,850
Shit,

3678
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,190
I told Joe the answer is yes.

3679
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:40,791

3683
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:43,701
So,

3684
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:44,300
uh,

3685
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,620
it'll be like,

3686
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,483
I think,

3687
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,280
I think,

3688
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:50,781

3689
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:50,901

the dates he gave me are like,

3691
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,340

3692
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:56,060

3693
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:59,600

3699
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:04,710
Bazookas or some no rifles,

3700
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:05,370

3701
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:05,670
Bro.

3702
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,810
And maybe even a bone arrow.

3703
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,560
Animal Lover.

3704
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,393
I'm bringing my ball.

3705
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:08,701
Yeah.

3706
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:09,840
Well guess who's going to shoot it?

3707
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:10,201
Oh,

3708
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:10,590
that's not,

3709
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:11,423
I

3710
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,000
can't pull it back to Jim's son.

3711
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,721
I don't want to talk about it.

3712
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:17,820
I am in the gym all the
time with Martin Landau.

3713
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,470
I'm saying,

3714
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,140
I'm saying get,

3715
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,040
get on a bench press.

3716
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:20,610
Hey Bro.

3717
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,600
How many pull ups that I do?

3718
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:22,050
Yeah,

3719
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:23,270
but you weigh eight pounds.

3720
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,150
How many pull ups?

3721
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,200
You keep saying that,

3722
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:26,690
but what you do are kicking your leg.

3723
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,340
You don't weigh a lot.

3724
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,650
So make that motion,

3725
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:32,240
Bro.

3726
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,150
That's all he kept doing.

3727
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:34,980
See you talk about how
many pull ups you do,

3728
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:35,970
but what do you weigh?

3729
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:41,060
I weigh 170 pounds or you (716) 516-0301
70 and how many chin ups can you do?

3730
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,120
31 he did 31 I'll get 31 yeah.

3731
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,470
It was like use like throwing is,

3732
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,230
what do you call it kip in
pro give that money goes.

3733
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,290
It's like crossfit.

3734
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,041
I did at crossfit.

3735
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:57,000
I said one friend,

3736
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:59,850
you're suspended from being my friend
for two days cause he said crossfit.

3737
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:00,001
Yeah.

3738
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:01,890
Well Brian You keep those aren't chin ups.

3739
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:04,110
Those are kipping Chin ups
and those guys who do those,

3740
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:05,970
they do like a hundred well I did,

3741
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,630
I know like fade or when
he was a heavyweight you
still like a hundred really?

3742
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,480
Oh God.

3743
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,840
There's a video of fate
or doing kipping Chin ups.

3744
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:16,400
It's a frightening always in
like the wilderness of Russian.

3745
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,380
He's like Kevin Woods

3746
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:24,750
Champs and he's in a single like some
white Whitey tighties just fucking doing

3747
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,680
work.

3748
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,090
Well he used to wear like black socks
and fucking running shoes from like from

3749
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:34,200
the 80s some new balances with
black socks and his Whitey tighties.

3750
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,580
But no one said shit cause
he's such a bathroom.

3751
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:37,414
I was like,

3752
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:37,921
thank him.

3753
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:39,850
The Gym and guys are in
black socks and white.

3754
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:40,201
He tied,

3755
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,400
he's trying to do the same shit.

3756
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,720
It's not like they have foot locker,

3757
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:43,620
the middle of Russia

3758
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,970
where you get your sneakers yourself,

3759
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,770
you steal them from people
who are running by you

3760
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:52,620
tack on it then yeah,

3761
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:54,750
he uses it like a lot of
old school training methods.

3762
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:58,440
Like you put like caught up hand weights
and throw punches kind of caught up.

3763
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,820
Well you know where it caught up with him.

3764
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,290
I was,

3765
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:02,670
it's interesting because I was
watching some old fade or fights.

3766
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,370
Huge fade or fan and who's not.

3767
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:05,851
If you're not,

3768
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:06,900
you're not an MMA fan.

3769
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,010
Him and Sakuraba.

3770
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,491
Yeah.

3771
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:10,360
Well was just a different thing than,

3772
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:11,490
he was a totally different thing.

3773
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,040
But I used to go back and watch his fight.

3774
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:18,360
I was watching his fights recently and
he was much bigger back in the day.

3775
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:19,560
Physically bigger,

3776
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,760
stronger about two 30 you mean bigger
than watch other guys you mean or what do

3777
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:23,821
you,

3778
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:26,520
more muscle than he did at the
end of his career and his crew.

3779
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,040
Stop lifting weights
done with the weights.

3780
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:30,300
It was just doing fight training.

3781
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:33,870
But if you go back to like the
Fujita fight being be thick traps,

3782
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:38,520
big shoulders was fucking strongly shit
and somewhere along the line they just

3783
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:39,630
get tired of lifting weights.

3784
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:40,021
I think.

3785
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:40,561
I mean I don't,

3786
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:41,580
I don't know what it was.

3787
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,950
What led him to the side or older.

3788
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:45,720
Right and started losing
muscle mass maybe?

3789
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:46,291
No,

3790
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:46,710
no.

3791
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,660
He stopped lifting weights
like he talked about it.

3792
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:51,360
He just did fight training
only later on in his career.

3793
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,270
I think he thought the technique was
more important than physical strength,

3794
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,060
which is true for the most part.

3795
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:59,290
I've gone towards that
route toward personally.

3796
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,243
Yeah.

3797
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:01,150
Let's see.

3798
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:04,260
I'm going to go in the gym and
spend an hour lifting weights,

3799
01:32:04,261 --> 01:32:06,970
don't out weights or I can be on the mat,

3800
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,580
work on my boxing technique
or Jujitsu and wrestling.

3801
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,780
I'm going to go do Jujitsu to know what
Steve Maxwell's thought on that is.

3802
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:14,980
It was a really interesting cause.

3803
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:19,120
Maxwell spent a lifetime with strength
and conditioning working with athletes.

3804
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,700
He thinks that if you're going
to lift weights for sports,

3805
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:23,800
you shouldn't lift weights like
strength and conditioning style.

3806
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,770
He thinks if you're doing
like Mike Martial arts,

3807
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:29,260
if you're in the middle of
like training technique,

3808
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:29,951
he goes,

3809
01:32:29,951 --> 01:32:31,420
you should do like sets,

3810
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:33,580
like do sets of dead lifts,

3811
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:35,290
do sets of bench two sets.

3812
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,470
She likes to incorporate lights at
the rounds now just to get stronger.

3813
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:38,861
I was like,

3814
01:32:38,861 --> 01:32:40,360
you shouldn't work on your endurance.

3815
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:43,150
Like you shouldn't be like doing these
fucking crazy strength and conditioning

3816
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:45,310
workouts while you're in
camp working out for fights.

3817
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:45,971
He's like,

3818
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:46,804
if you're,

3819
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,321
he goes,

3820
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:50,410
you should lift weights to keep your
muscle mass and to keep your strength,

3821
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,110
but all your conditioning should
come from your kickboxing,

3822
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:54,170
should come from your wrestling.

3823
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,480
That should come from Egypt.

3824
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:56,090
Actually,

3825
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:59,410
I'm actually going to Arizona on
Thursday and meet with this new,

3826
01:32:59,411 --> 01:32:59,710
uh,

3827
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,260
this new strength conditioning
coach who Tim Teebo works with.

3828
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:03,363
And uh,

3829
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:03,911
yeah,

3830
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:07,720
I'm going out there with Tim and he said
the exact same thing and this guy works

3831
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:08,380
with everyone.

3832
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,191
He said that he's like,

3833
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:11,800
you shouldn't have a session
where you're working,

3834
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,300
you know,

3835
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,450
reps and stuff like that.

3836
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:14,970
He's said exactly what you just told me.

3837
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:18,370
These guys are saying that your skills
are the most important thing and your

3838
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:22,480
strength and you all your your physical
strength like the mass it's size that

3839
01:33:22,481 --> 01:33:23,650
you could put on and maintain.

3840
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:25,330
He's like you should maintain that,

3841
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:26,380
you should get strong,

3842
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:30,370
you should do all that but don't do like
strength and conditioning like while

3843
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:31,050
you were in a fight,

3844
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,480
like the crossfit stuff afterwards.

3845
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,470
Don't do that because you're not going
to have the same energy to do your

3846
01:33:35,471 --> 01:33:36,304
Jujitsu work.

3847
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,710
Like when I was doing
Jujitsu all the time,

3848
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:41,260
if I would lift weights I could
lift weights in the morning.

3849
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:42,190
And did you do to at night?

3850
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:42,880
You know why?

3851
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,260
Because I would do like a set of bench
and then I would sit around me and I,

3852
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:48,150
Bravo would talk shit for fire,

3853
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:52,330
laugh and goof off and then
we'd do another set so we
would get all the strength

3854
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:55,150
workout in but I still had
energy to train at night.

3855
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:59,140
Whereas like if I do my kettle bell
routine than I do if I do that shit,

3856
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,100
that's a wrap.

3857
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:00,640
You're done.

3858
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,270
I'm done.

3859
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,170
That's interesting man.

3860
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,760
That when you do strength training,

3861
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:05,830
do you do it twice a week
when you're in camp and camp?

3862
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:06,191
I do it.

3863
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:07,030
I do it twice a week.

3864
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:07,390
Yeah.

3865
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,230
But how to camp,

3866
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:09,760
like now I lift four or five times.

3867
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:11,560
I kept trying to get bigger,

3868
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:11,950
stronger.

3869
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:12,850
So when I go and camp,

3870
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:14,740
my body's going to break
down and we lose some size.

3871
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:15,670
I just try to keep it,

3872
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:16,504
you know what I'm saying?

3873
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:19,990
But like people asked me like,

3874
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:20,290
uh,

3875
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:22,360
even younger fighters at
rain or Grace Academy,

3876
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:22,720
like,

3877
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,141
oh,

3878
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:23,750
like what,

3879
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,260
what should I be doing in the weight room?

3880
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,751
Stuff like that.

3881
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:27,250
So if you're younger fighter,

3882
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,320
you shouldn't really waste
your time in the weight room.

3883
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:32,290
You don't get paid to bench
and squat and power clean.

3884
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:32,740
Right.

3885
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,630
Paid to submit bitches and knock them out.

3886
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:34,811
Right.

3887
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,580
So work on summit and
knocking bitches out.

3888
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:38,080
Here's the finals.

3889
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,820
This is the light heavyweight finals,

3890
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:40,320
right?

3891
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:40,491
Yeah,

3892
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:40,641
that's,

3893
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:40,930
yeah.

3894
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:42,700
Those are those breasts or yeah,

3895
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:43,211
those are,

3896
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:43,590
um,

3897
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:43,910
Gyno,

3898
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,990
mastercard got him Asca
and Corey Anderson,

3899
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,320
Matt Van Buren set of Nipples on him.

3900
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,470
Then that dude,

3901
01:34:50,471 --> 01:34:51,070
the other dude,

3902
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:52,240
the other dude does not him.

3903
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:52,901
That dude straight.

3904
01:34:52,901 --> 01:34:53,230
Yeah,

3905
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:53,710
him.

3906
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:55,300
I kind of yarn as a fucking animal.

3907
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,320
So it was Corey.

3908
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,153
This is a good fight.

3909
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,003
Really good fight.

3910
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:01,010
And this is like when we're
talking about like this,

3911
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,230
the high level of guys that are coming up,

3912
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:03,950
man,

3913
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:04,970
these guys that are fighting,

3914
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:05,840
I mean we,

3915
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:09,440
you go back to the day will like when
Forrest was fight and Stephan Bonner and

3916
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:11,300
then look at these guys and you're,

3917
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:11,571
you know,

3918
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:13,550
you're dealing with some
pretty high level guys now.

3919
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:13,710
There,

3920
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,070
there are lots of well rounded,

3921
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,580
a lot more well rounded.

3922
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,731
Well first of all,

3923
01:35:18,731 --> 01:35:18,940
dude,

3924
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:19,391
six,

3925
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:20,224
five,

3926
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:20,951
two a five.

3927
01:35:20,951 --> 01:35:21,610
That's insane.

3928
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:21,740
No,

3929
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:22,630
he's next door.

3930
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:23,420
Big Boy.

3931
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,540
Oh,

3932
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:25,660
trouble.

3933
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,680
Cory's cracking him.

3934
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:26,891
Oh,

3935
01:35:26,891 --> 01:35:27,641
he's rocked man.

3936
01:35:27,641 --> 01:35:28,330
He's out of it.

3937
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:28,990
He's out of it.

3938
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:29,410
Oh yeah.

3939
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,970
He's to cover it up.

3940
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,110
I was super out of it.

3941
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:32,811
He's taken it.

3942
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:33,644
They show they should.

3943
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,430
Oh No,

3944
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:35,651
look,

3945
01:35:35,651 --> 01:35:36,341
he's coming back.

3946
01:35:36,341 --> 01:35:36,461
No,

3947
01:35:36,461 --> 01:35:36,821
he's not.

3948
01:35:36,821 --> 01:35:36,971
No,

3949
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:37,660
he's not out of,

3950
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:38,320
might be done.

3951
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,400
He's super out of it.

3952
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,030
He didn't.

3953
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:40,840
Wow.

3954
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,673
Wow.

3955
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,120
I'm always coming back.

3956
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:43,530
Oh.

3957
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,800
But he's still trading.

3958
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:46,420
Oh my goodness.

3959
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:47,440
In the ISO.

3960
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,110
It's over.

3961
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,580
It's over.

3962
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,600
It's super over.

3963
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,160
Pours all over him.

3964
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:51,701
No.

3965
01:35:51,701 --> 01:35:52,241
Why take him?

3966
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:52,540
See,

3967
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:53,860
I just smash them.

3968
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:54,760
Look at this.

3969
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,121
Nah,

3970
01:35:55,121 --> 01:35:56,110
he should have kept it on the feet.

3971
01:35:56,170 --> 01:35:56,820
I Dunno.

3972
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,670
You can recover right now.

3973
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,570
You can recover this.

3974
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,411
Not like this.

3975
01:35:59,411 --> 01:36:00,760
A lot more than when you're on the feet.

3976
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:01,810
Mario's going to stop it.

3977
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,500
That's it.

3978
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,333
That's it.

3979
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,700
That's how you get Corey.

3980
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:06,340
Corey,

3981
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,280
two tough ones have just
been some whoopings son.

3982
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:13,710
Corey Anderson can crack
power the nipple sun.

3983
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,693
That's what it is.

3984
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:16,733
Yeah.

3985
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:17,911
People don't know.

3986
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:19,680
There's a bunch of different
ways to get those nipples.

3987
01:36:19,681 --> 01:36:20,880
It doesn't mean you did steroids.

3988
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:21,180
No,

3989
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,140
not at all really,

3990
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:23,401
but a lot of times.

3991
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:24,234
What are the other ways?

3992
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,490
A lot of times it means

3993
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,700
not to put you on the spot.

3994
01:36:26,701 --> 01:36:27,534
What are the other ways again,

3995
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:29,883
real quick,

3996
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,711
real quick,

3997
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:31,290
how it go.

3998
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,130
How do I avoid,

3999
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:34,330
I like Joe Scott really quiet.

4000
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:36,810
I'd like to hear everyone
just got quiet about it,

4001
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:37,890
but nobody's pointing fingers.

4002
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:38,730
I didn't see any nails,

4003
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,100
bro.

4004
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:39,933
Try to be nice.

4005
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:40,973
We had a gun.

4006
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:43,190
One guy that fought in the
UFC wants that was like,

4007
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:47,570
those are close up on the nipples are one
guy fought in the UFC wants a that had

4008
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:51,440
like a serious problem like when he was
younger I guess he did a lot of steroids

4009
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:55,340
and like he was jumping up and
down inside the octagon and he's,

4010
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,810
his boobs were like,

4011
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,830
oh no hopping.

4012
01:36:57,870 --> 01:36:57,981
Oh,

4013
01:36:57,981 --> 01:36:59,360
like flopping flopping.

4014
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:00,194
And he was fighting.

4015
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:02,520
He was fighting one 70.

4016
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:02,960
Damn.

4017
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,771
Corey can crack.

4018
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:07,580
Look at this beautiful striking
straight through the middle.

4019
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:08,331
Boom.

4020
01:37:08,331 --> 01:37:09,230
Great straight shot.

4021
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:10,790
Boom,

4022
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:12,223
boom.

4023
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,680
But when that fight was about 15 seconds
long and his hand wraps came apart,

4024
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:17,210
who fucking wrapped his hands?

4025
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,200
Look at that.

4026
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,130
It's that war tape.

4027
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:20,023
Yeah,

4028
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,380
on the thumb it stuff.

4029
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:22,543
Um,

4030
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,181
yeah.

4031
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,080
You never want to set it to,

4032
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:24,681
it's like that.

4033
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:26,110
You don't want nipples like that.

4034
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,221
Not that bad.

4035
01:37:28,221 --> 01:37:29,054
I mean

4036
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,820
it doesn't take away from
his great performance.

4037
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:32,990
Go to Gold's gym.

4038
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:33,280
He went,

4039
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,450
guys don't go to those jams.

4040
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,290
Oh my god Bro.

4041
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:37,130
Get a brawl on,

4042
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:39,110
what'd you say that correct
me if I'm wrong in that place.

4043
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:41,790
Last time I worked out there smells like

4044
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,121
protein farts.

4045
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:45,080
It's exactly what it smells like.

4046
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:45,840
Yeah.

4047
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,690
This is niche burnables Mel Gibson,

4048
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:51,780
so work I love it.

4049
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:57,260
Played a bad guy to working around
doubles as my boy Wesley Snipes.

4050
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,240
These expendables movie America loves him.

4051
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,030
There's a little talk about you fighting
now unless they a long time ago,

4052
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,150
it was a long time ago.

4053
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,130
What happened on that?

4054
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:10,260
He decided not to get his ass kicked.

4055
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:11,240
It was that,

4056
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,900
what's the story is
actually going to go down.

4057
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:13,560
Yeah.

4058
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:13,801
Yeah.

4059
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:15,240
We had lawyers involved and everything.

4060
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:15,901
What happened?

4061
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:16,590
Contract.

4062
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,423
He changed his mind.

4063
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,530
He called you out.

4064
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:21,780
How did you stars Campbell Mclaren,

4065
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:25,530
who was the guy who was the original
producer for the ultimate fighter?

4066
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,290
Calls me up out of nowhere and says,

4067
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,610
this is gonna sound crazy,

4068
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:33,270
but would you be interested
in fighting Wesley's times?

4069
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,870
I want it.

4070
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:34,740
What are you talking about?

4071
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,710
And so then they start explaining
what's going on and I was training,

4072
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:38,930
how long ago was this?

4073
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,610
2006 so blade was,

4074
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,283
he did make blade.

4075
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:43,780
He,

4076
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,870
that would scare me out of the fight,

4077
01:38:44,871 --> 01:38:45,360
I think.

4078
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,193
What was going on?

4079
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:49,290
I think what was going on was that he,

4080
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:52,410
the IRS was coming down on them
hard and he's looking for cash.

4081
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:52,770
Yeah,

4082
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,880
he was looking at trialing
unathletic by the,

4083
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:55,140
no,

4084
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:59,520
he knows martial arts but
never competed and no Jujitsu.

4085
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:04,260
And I think he just thought it was just
a wrapper and then somewhere along the

4086
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:04,890
line,

4087
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:05,760
I don't know what happened,

4088
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:07,290
but he just decided not to do it.

4089
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,580
You know,

4090
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,400
I think if you've never competed your
whole life and you have these ideas,

4091
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,490
plus I think he's probably hanging around
with a bunch of dudes who are taking

4092
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:16,140
Bolivian marching powder and like,

4093
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:16,740
you know what,

4094
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:20,580
he's going to have fucking
time to make your money money.

4095
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,840
There's a lot of motherfuckers
out there doing that karate,

4096
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:26,160
doing all kinds of martial arts,

4097
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,121
but they don't know what,

4098
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:27,840
you know,

4099
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,410
you got something
special inside you broke,

4100
01:39:29,411 --> 01:39:30,780
this is your time to shine.

4101
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:35,160
Heart of a lion and trunk from blade
and doing all these stunts was like,

4102
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:35,711
fuck yeah,

4103
01:39:35,711 --> 01:39:36,240
I'll do it.

4104
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:39,960
Well if you talked to pat and Oswald
Patton Oswald did blade with him and

4105
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:44,660
apparently there was just bags of
cocaine involved making of that.

4106
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:45,130
Yeah.

4107
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:46,520
Panopto has a hole a bit.

4108
01:39:46,521 --> 01:39:47,220
He does about it.

4109
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:47,611
Wow.

4110
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:48,780
About being on the set with,

4111
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,230
with,

4112
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:49,891
with Wesley.

4113
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:50,790
Like how fucked up.

4114
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,310
He was like he went
through some dark periods,

4115
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,510
three lines in them.

4116
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,250
[inaudible] just killed
vampires don't stop.

4117
01:39:57,251 --> 01:39:57,370
No,

4118
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:58,161
they parade moving.

4119
01:39:58,161 --> 01:39:59,550
They pulled the lines from him,

4120
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,950
hired a double to do all the scenes.

4121
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:03,060
There was another guy,

4122
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:04,120
so he did nothing movie.

4123
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,010
So he did nothing.

4124
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:05,881
I don't know what happened,

4125
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:09,300
but half that movie like Patton Oswald
has a whole bit about how they brought in

4126
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:12,150
the way cooler black guy
to pretend to be played.

4127
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,620
But that guy didn't get a talk.

4128
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:14,881
They headed west.

4129
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:15,780
I had some struggles with,

4130
01:40:15,781 --> 01:40:16,430
uh,

4131
01:40:16,430 --> 01:40:17,150
he had some issue.

4132
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:20,040
Well also I had some issues at a bunch
of questionable characters that told them

4133
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:21,060
not to pay taxes.

4134
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:21,480
Let me,

4135
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,350
let me get this straight,

4136
01:40:22,351 --> 01:40:22,650
Joe.

4137
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:27,650
So you weren't scared at all about a
coked up Wesley snipes that just got done

4138
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:28,794
doing blade?

4139
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,340
No,

4140
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,173
not at all.

4141
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,920
Coming at you like a spider.

4142
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:33,230
Nothing.

4143
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:35,900
No clinch to ground ground,

4144
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:36,840
squeeze,

4145
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,100
dap or sleep.

4146
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,360
But when he's,

4147
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,500
when he's all coked up,

4148
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:41,580
just like fidgeting,

4149
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:42,391
like freaking out,

4150
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:43,224
worried about the

4151
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,840
gas out pretty fast.

4152
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,710
Um,

4153
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:49,260
I a guy who has never done Jujitsu,

4154
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,270
who gets 170 pounds.

4155
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,280
If he's not,

4156
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,160
he's not,

4157
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,993
he's not.

4158
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:56,043
Trust me.

4159
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,401
You always do this.

4160
01:40:57,401 --> 01:40:58,211
You always do it.

4161
01:40:58,211 --> 01:40:59,890
She's not big at all.

4162
01:40:59,891 --> 01:41:02,080
He's not thinking I've seen him in person.

4163
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:02,680
Really?

4164
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,513
Yeah,

4165
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:05,380
please.

4166
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,190
He's heavier than I know.

4167
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:07,170
I don't think there'll be,

4168
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,141
I get this,

4169
01:41:08,141 --> 01:41:10,300
the gable grip around
the west and then that's

4170
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:15,490
when you're like this and then on top
of you and then what you're going to do,

4171
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:16,360
you're going to make mistake,

4172
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,110
mistake Japanese or sound
like an old Japanese

4173
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,270
Brazilian to jasmine.

4174
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,850
I when he's on that devil's
Dandruff and he's all coked up.

4175
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:29,320
You can't get ahold of him even better.

4176
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:31,780
I was planning on failing
every drug test partner.

4177
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:37,450
I mean if they tested me for
being like wandering and chill.

4178
01:41:37,451 --> 01:41:38,320
You guys have been great.

4179
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,820
I do all my training high,

4180
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:41,470
so I was trying to figure out
whether I was going to fight.

4181
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:43,180
You always train high Jujitsu?

4182
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:44,014
Yeah.

4183
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,220
Why?

4184
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,290
I don't always know why I like it.

4185
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:49,180
I like doing Jujitsu high,

4186
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:53,080
like to smoke they here
for and what I really like.

4187
01:41:53,081 --> 01:41:53,914
I like eating it,

4188
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:55,510
eating it and enrolling.

4189
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,090
I think it makes me more sensitive.

4190
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:59,890
It makes me more aware of what's going on.

4191
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:00,681
Makes some more focused.

4192
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:01,810
I completely zone in.

4193
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,310
A lot of guys do Jujitsu.

4194
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:04,750
I'm a lot of guys.

4195
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:05,161
Yeah,

4196
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:05,310
I'm,

4197
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:06,143
I'm aware.

4198
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:07,030
It's just what your,

4199
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:08,040
I've never right.

4200
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:09,520
Remember Bro,

4201
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:10,750
I'm telling you if you did it,

4202
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:11,290
you might not.

4203
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:11,890
Never.

4204
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:15,160
If you have some time off
and you're do Jujitsu,

4205
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,760
you do.

4206
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,260
And so you know you're
not going to get tested.

4207
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:20,710
You're not really going to smoke pot
and it was all just joking around.

4208
01:42:20,711 --> 01:42:21,010
Right.

4209
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,660
Kind of joking around on the five cats.

4210
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:23,290
Try once.

4211
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:24,790
I'm telling you you'd love it.

4212
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:25,391
I mean,

4213
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:26,440
I don't know if you'd love it,

4214
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,760
but I would assume you'd love it.

4215
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:28,360
Yeah.

4216
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:28,880
Eddie Bravo.

4217
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,010
Those that every goddamn time.

4218
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,500
Bj Penn and it was a
little high and last night

4219
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,240
I was talking about
the Shitty dad stories,

4220
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:39,770
which I had nothing to
contribute to homeboys.

4221
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:40,241
One story.

4222
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:41,380
It was awful.

4223
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,820
He had a great damn long hair.

4224
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,220
He kept trying to bring a story into it.

4225
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:45,491
Oh,

4226
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:46,001
that dude.

4227
01:42:46,001 --> 01:42:46,380
Yeah,

4228
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,070
it's horrible story.

4229
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:47,770
I kept looking at it.

4230
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,401
I kept looking for it.

4231
01:42:48,401 --> 01:42:50,650
It's like how often you talk to
your dad and he goes every day.

4232
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:51,430
But then I was like,

4233
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:51,701
Oh,

4234
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:53,530
well your dad's very much in your life.

4235
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:53,861
He goes,

4236
01:42:53,861 --> 01:42:54,071
no,

4237
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:56,030
but my dad's all success when he calls me.

4238
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,030
He tries to give me tips
and shit as a nice guy.

4239
01:42:58,031 --> 01:42:59,980
So let's not talk too
much about giving names.

4240
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:00,410
It was,

4241
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:01,960
there was a little horrible story.

4242
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,291
It was.

4243
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:02,890
It was,

4244
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:03,221
yeah.

4245
01:43:03,221 --> 01:43:04,930
There's sometimes dudes get around,

4246
01:43:04,931 --> 01:43:08,770
guys like you guys to tell great stories
and they try to throw their own story

4247
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:10,410
in it and they don't
realize their stories.

4248
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:11,500
You know,

4249
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,490
you're dealing with Eddie Bravo,

4250
01:43:12,491 --> 01:43:14,560
who's a great dose story
telling my Buddy Justin,

4251
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:15,280
who's a great stuff.

4252
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:15,921
Justin's story.

4253
01:43:15,921 --> 01:43:17,770
It was depressing as fuck my buddy Justin.

4254
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:18,743
It got dark,

4255
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,271
dark,

4256
01:43:19,271 --> 01:43:19,571
dark.

4257
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:19,781
You know,

4258
01:43:19,781 --> 01:43:20,020
my,

4259
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,130
my story is not as bad as
his story is pretty dark.

4260
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,260
It's bad.

4261
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,340
It's bad that,

4262
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:25,170
that not,

4263
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:25,931
you know me I liked,

4264
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:26,430
I liked,

4265
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:28,450
I'll talk your frickin air off.

4266
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:29,830
I didn't say a word last night.

4267
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,690
I can't contribute.

4268
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:31,940
Yeah.

4269
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:33,130
Can't contribute to the story.

4270
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,060
So I'm not doing,

4271
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:37,030
nothing's worse when then someone doesn't
know what they're talking about and

4272
01:43:37,031 --> 01:43:37,301
they are,

4273
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:39,100
especially with experiences like that,

4274
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:39,521
my parents,

4275
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:41,740
my dad loved the shit
out of me straight up.

4276
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:44,230
So when you guys talk about
these shitty childhoods,

4277
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:45,520
I can't really jump in.

4278
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:45,850
Right.

4279
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:46,930
There's nothing worse when we got it.

4280
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:47,261
Oh,

4281
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:48,130
I hear that Bro.

4282
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,090
I hear that.

4283
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:50,590
One time I went to Mcdonald's.

4284
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:50,670
He,

4285
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:52,130
my dad buy me a fucking

4286
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:52,820
happy meal.

4287
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,720
I feel you bro.

4288
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,490
I always presents at Christmas.

4289
01:43:55,491 --> 01:43:55,850
I was like,

4290
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:56,230
no.

4291
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,000
There was no,

4292
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,231
I was like,

4293
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,220
this is too much.

4294
01:43:58,710 --> 01:43:59,120
Yeah.

4295
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,130
Depressing childhood stories are rough.

4296
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,001
They're hard to deal with.

4297
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:02,241
But yeah,

4298
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:02,931
the one dude's story,

4299
01:44:02,931 --> 01:44:03,830
it was not so good.

4300
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,050
They compare it to me.

4301
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,200
Justice was horrible.

4302
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:07,370
Mine wasn't the best,

4303
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:08,290
and he's just horrible.

4304
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,153
Trying not to laugh.

4305
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,340
I can't hide when I'm,

4306
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,390
when I think something's funny.

4307
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,660
I was trying to not laugh at his
story and he kept bringing it back in,

4308
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:16,143
even as frank,

4309
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:17,910
hey bro,

4310
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:18,200
uh,

4311
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:18,430
maybe,

4312
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,041
maybe pipe down.

4313
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:19,350
He goes,

4314
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:19,700
no,

4315
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:20,241
no man.

4316
01:44:20,241 --> 01:44:20,930
Fuck that.

4317
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:23,240
It sucks when Your Dad's
disappointed in you.

4318
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:28,160
Sober up spilled spilled
half a drink on my change.

4319
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:31,310
As the day went on,

4320
01:44:31,311 --> 01:44:32,270
he got even more drunk.

4321
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:35,810
Really trying to explain something
to me later on that night.

4322
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:36,980
And it was tough.

4323
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:37,431
It was like,

4324
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:39,560
he was like waking up from anesthesia

4325
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:42,183
something to me.

4326
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:43,520
I was like,

4327
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,490
it's okay man.

4328
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:45,231
I got it.

4329
01:44:45,231 --> 01:44:45,651
I get it.

4330
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:46,011
I get it.

4331
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:46,640
I get it again.

4332
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,580
Happens in Vegas about about
three 30 in the morning.

4333
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,730
You'll get cornered by small.

4334
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,520
I don't hang out with anyone
that I can't get down with it.

4335
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,151
Uh,

4336
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:53,984
so did,

4337
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,740
did you know him from before
and now he's my buddy Justin,

4338
01:44:56,741 --> 01:44:57,574
his pal.

4339
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:58,520
He's a good dude.

4340
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:00,290
He's just got hammered
and you know what happens,

4341
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:00,740
man?

4342
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,311
Like I said,

4343
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:02,121
when people are around,

4344
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:05,570
guys like you guys had tell great stories
and they want to contribute and tell a

4345
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:06,530
great story too,

4346
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:08,410
and they're just not
used to don't do that.

4347
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:09,021
You know,

4348
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:12,580
you're around a fucking worldclass
standup comedian like Brian Cowen.

4349
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:16,010
It tells great fucking stories and
you want to throw yours into the mix.

4350
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,320
Good luck.

4351
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,111
He came though,

4352
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:18,501
Bro.

4353
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:19,334
He doesn't have any,

4354
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:22,000
he had this false sense of
reality because he's drunk.

4355
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,440
Nothing like being around Joey
Diaz when he starts talking.

4356
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:25,971
I've never met him,

4357
01:45:25,971 --> 01:45:26,181
man.

4358
01:45:26,181 --> 01:45:27,410
I hear him on your podcast.

4359
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,293
He's dope.

4360
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,780
He's 20 scratch ever lived.

4361
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,490
I've been a lot of funny.

4362
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,830
Why can't you bring him
or one the fight anytime.

4363
01:45:33,831 --> 01:45:34,730
I'll do it next time.

4364
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:35,510
Next one we do.

4365
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:36,980
He'll do it if he's in town.

4366
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:38,810
He wants to do the fighter and the kid.

4367
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:40,090
I talked to him two days ago.

4368
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,450
He's the funniest guy that's ever lived.

4369
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,343
Are you serious?

4370
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:42,651
Yeah.

4371
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:44,000
I've met a lot of funny guys.

4372
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:44,800
Sopranos,

4373
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,230
is that,

4374
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:45,550
no,

4375
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:45,690
no,

4376
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:45,811
no,

4377
01:45:45,811 --> 01:45:45,921
no.

4378
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:48,460
He looks like the guy from big pussy.

4379
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,190
Yes.

4380
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:49,941
He's not at all.

4381
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:50,391
Not really.

4382
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:51,300
If you saw big pussy,

4383
01:45:51,301 --> 01:45:51,741
I saw him.

4384
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:53,090
He looks working on as an actor though,

4385
01:45:53,091 --> 01:45:53,720
man.

4386
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,501
He's worked a lot.

4387
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:55,011
But you know what,

4388
01:45:55,011 --> 01:45:57,830
he's making more money now with his
standup than ever and it's all because of

4389
01:45:57,831 --> 01:45:58,480
the Internet.

4390
01:45:58,480 --> 01:45:59,720
So because of podcast,

4391
01:45:59,721 --> 01:46:00,710
cause he can be himself.

4392
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,310
He just never runs out of stories and
he's got a fucking personality that goes

4393
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:05,144
on for days.

4394
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:07,460
This is Bj Penn and Frankie
Edgar and I'm going to Piss.

4395
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:08,620
So please uh,

4396
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:11,280
be kind when I leave
the room we're going to,

4397
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,910
we're about to see two fucking
legends go down real quick.

4398
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,180
Uh,

4399
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:14,640
I was getting there.

4400
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,570
I look at the apartment.

4401
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:16,723
Please look at him.

4402
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:17,890
Come on.

4403
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:21,640
I couldn't look more normal car
look more like the nine to five.

4404
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:22,640
He looks like a nine to fiver.

4405
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,860
How he does it certainly does.

4406
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:25,670
And I love,

4407
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:26,700
you know how much I love him,

4408
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,450
how much I pick them every time I've just,

4409
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:30,410
I just find it amazing.

4410
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,690
He's having a knee surgery and
then waiting for his title.

4411
01:46:32,691 --> 01:46:33,030
Shot,

4412
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,561
smart move.

4413
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:34,394
I think

4414
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,141
this was a,

4415
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:37,070
this was a mistake right?

4416
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:38,120
In his hands weren't up right.

4417
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:38,580
Is that what,

4418
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:38,790
what,

4419
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:39,770
what was going on with that?

4420
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:42,080
Hold,

4421
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:42,530
hold,

4422
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:42,921
hold,

4423
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:43,281
hold.

4424
01:46:43,281 --> 01:46:44,060
Blight.

4425
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:44,960
I don't give a fuck.

4426
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,550
We just already saw that man.

4427
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:47,390
Oh,

4428
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,050
what happened?

4429
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:49,410
He got punched in the face very,

4430
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:50,244
very hard.

4431
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,530
He got disoriented and
then more punches happen.

4432
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:52,891
Well,

4433
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:53,191
okay.

4434
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:54,090
Thanks a lot doctor.

4435
01:46:54,091 --> 01:46:54,924
No help.

4436
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:55,231
I mean,

4437
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:58,050
what do you want me to tell you may
have punched directly in the face.

4438
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:58,650
Yeah,

4439
01:46:58,650 --> 01:46:59,550
but his hands should have been out.

4440
01:46:59,551 --> 01:46:59,910
Right?

4441
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:00,511
It's tough,

4442
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:00,751
man.

4443
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:01,584
Shit happens.

4444
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:07,020
I love Brian Stann cause
everyone does nothing.

4445
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:07,950
Not to love about the gay.

4446
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,553
Okay.

4447
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:14,390
Square jawed marine could,

4448
01:47:14,391 --> 01:47:15,740
he'd look anymore American.

4449
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:17,023
He should be,

4450
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,940
you should took to be a US citizen.

4451
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:21,020
You should have to know who Brian is.

4452
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:23,990
He's saying he can run for president.

4453
01:47:23,991 --> 01:47:24,130
Yeah.

4454
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:24,963
Fucking wind by,

4455
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,130
I would vote for him.

4456
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,230
I think Chael Sonnen could too.

4457
01:47:27,231 --> 01:47:27,600
If both.

4458
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:27,891
No,

4459
01:47:27,891 --> 01:47:28,071
no,

4460
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:28,251
no.

4461
01:47:28,251 --> 01:47:29,750
Before all on more lion.

4462
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:33,740
Before we went in a time
machine to six months ago.

4463
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:34,211
I'm chill.

4464
01:47:34,211 --> 01:47:35,044
A felon,

4465
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,310
let's say before he's a felon.

4466
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:38,683
I love it.

4467
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,451
I love chair.

4468
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:40,284
I'd vote for him too.

4469
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,260
I want to talk his way into it.

4470
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:44,090
Loving Chels better talk to them Brian.

4471
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:44,580
Oh,

4472
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:49,580
I he finds more clear because he was
in fricking doing tours and kill them

4473
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:50,211
bitches.

4474
01:47:50,211 --> 01:47:51,110
So it's a lot more clear.

4475
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:52,370
You get real clear.

4476
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:53,420
We started killing bitches.

4477
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,760
There's no stuttering
when you're ordering Stan.

4478
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:56,900
Stan is very direct,

4479
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,240
I guess that going over the final,

4480
01:47:59,241 --> 01:48:01,670
they're going to show Eddie
Gordon and Diego Lima again.

4481
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:02,331
Why are they showing that?

4482
01:48:02,331 --> 01:48:03,330
We did and they just showed us the,

4483
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,351
they're killing a little.

4484
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:06,230
I just solid why you be showing this?

4485
01:48:06,231 --> 01:48:08,240
Because the last fight was
a one round knockout too.

4486
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,400
You know there's a lot
of knockouts on this guy,

4487
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:10,730
right?

4488
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,241
Boom.

4489
01:48:11,241 --> 01:48:12,310
Gordon cracks

4490
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,320
and tell you what man,

4491
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:16,910
Diego Lima is tough as shit.

4492
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:20,360
You know the the kind of punishment to
watch your head containing going to be

4493
01:48:20,361 --> 01:48:20,810
fun,

4494
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:21,291
angry.

4495
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:22,820
This is where it should
have stopped right there.

4496
01:48:22,821 --> 01:48:24,290
I think Gordon looks so angry.

4497
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:25,210
This is like a,

4498
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,700
if you wanted to like talk
about how evil cage fighting is.

4499
01:48:28,701 --> 01:48:29,170
Look at this.

4500
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:30,030
Wow.

4501
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:36,440
Was the end of the world in the future
when they started looking at that scared

4502
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:36,651
me.

4503
01:48:36,651 --> 01:48:37,040
I was like,

4504
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:37,430
yeah,

4505
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:40,790
when they will start looking back in the
future about when society crumbled and

4506
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:45,170
when this is like the first steps they
were talking about rolling return to the

4507
01:48:45,171 --> 01:48:46,004
clad or yeah,

4508
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:46,843
the coliseum.

4509
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:48,860
I mean tell me this isn't
the similar to the calcium.

4510
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,700
Tell me that reality shows on similar
to what you had a good answer when

4511
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:53,120
somebody said,

4512
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,140
why is it so popular?

4513
01:48:54,141 --> 01:48:55,340
Why is I'm amazed as popular.

4514
01:48:55,341 --> 01:48:59,060
And you said it's the closest you can
come to watching two men kill each other

4515
01:48:59,061 --> 01:48:59,900
with their bare hands.

4516
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:00,340
Yeah.

4517
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:00,951
Cause guess what?

4518
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:04,910
If leave eve Levine or her deans
on in there and no one stops it,

4519
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,780
someone's dying.

4520
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,660
You got the guys out cold and you're
stomping his head towards Jello.

4521
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,570
Yes.

4522
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,010
Yeah.

4523
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:13,280
Unfortunately only reason why the ref
is there is to make sure that doesn't

4524
01:49:13,281 --> 01:49:13,870
happen.

4525
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:14,450
Yeah.

4526
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:14,730
Damn.

4527
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:15,800
Lot of empty seats back there.

4528
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:16,070
Huh?

4529
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:17,150
Super Empty.

4530
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:20,420
Well was fort just what gets the
Sunday in Vegas after 4th of July?

4531
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:21,620
I don't even,

4532
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:24,410
I'm not even a party or
I'm fucking exhausted.

4533
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:28,280
I was thinking that this morning cause
I left this morning and when I flew out,

4534
01:49:28,281 --> 01:49:29,150
man it was,

4535
01:49:29,151 --> 01:49:32,150
the airport was mobbed.

4536
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,850
Vegas looked like it was full of zombies.

4537
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,200
The airport looked like Zombie.

4538
01:49:36,201 --> 01:49:40,730
You gotta you gotta you got about an
hour of sleep to kid takes vitamins.

4539
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,611
She seen my piss.

4540
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:43,370
It's bright orange.

4541
01:49:43,371 --> 01:49:43,651
Really?

4542
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:44,600
You're glowing vita.

4543
01:49:44,601 --> 01:49:47,800
Who doesn't do well if I
don't get hours of sleep.

4544
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:48,910
Yeah.

4545
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:50,410
Well you trained hard man.

4546
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:51,610
Don't do well.

4547
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:52,600
This is a good weekend man.

4548
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:56,560
I got to real solid workouts and it worked
out with della Grog Day and yesterday

4549
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:57,570
I lifted it,

4550
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,170
worked out with the um,

4551
01:49:59,380 --> 01:49:59,711
uh,

4552
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:03,410
the same time as Rhonda is
girl Marina Marina Shit.

4553
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,443
Very cool.

4554
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:07,520
Very cool chick works out hall.

4555
01:50:07,521 --> 01:50:08,500
She's a beast man.

4556
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,860
She's a little beat Rhonda,

4557
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,890
his best friend and protege,

4558
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:11,570
she's a bi.

4559
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,450
You could tell she's a one 45 or though,

4560
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:13,901
yeah,

4561
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:15,820
she was putting in her strength
and conditioning workouts.

4562
01:50:15,821 --> 01:50:16,750
She had like a fucking,

4563
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:20,110
like a phone in front of her with
all of our routines and stuff.

4564
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,060
She put in some fucking work.

4565
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:22,900
I was impressed.

4566
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:24,221
So here it gives,

4567
01:50:24,221 --> 01:50:26,910
we're going to watch Frankie
Edgar and time I believe,

4568
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,710
kit now against Bj Penn.

4569
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,781
Bj Penn,

4570
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:32,980
Frankie Edgar's wife,

4571
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:33,730
Frankie Edgar,

4572
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:35,490
Mom Frankie had Chris' Dad.

4573
01:50:35,491 --> 01:50:36,430
I love Frankie Edgar.

4574
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,850
I love Frankie.

4575
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,700
Went down to Jose Aldo is camp,

4576
01:50:39,701 --> 01:50:39,971
I guess,

4577
01:50:39,971 --> 01:50:40,440
right?

4578
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:40,630
Well,

4579
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:43,960
he did a little bit of training at Nova
Uniao but he did most of the training in

4580
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:45,710
Hawaii for this always.

4581
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:46,661
Yeah,

4582
01:50:46,661 --> 01:50:47,111
I mean,

4583
01:50:47,111 --> 01:50:47,560
uh,

4584
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,221
Ian Mccall,

4585
01:50:48,221 --> 01:50:48,521
who,

4586
01:50:48,521 --> 01:50:49,150
uh,

4587
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:49,541
was,

4588
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:49,750
uh,

4589
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:52,600
he went with Bj down to down to,

4590
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:52,721
uh,

4591
01:50:52,721 --> 01:50:53,830
Hilo to train with them.

4592
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:54,320
Does it train?

4593
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,080
He said Bj's in incredible shape.

4594
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,400
He said Ian has fantastic endurance.

4595
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:01,960
And he said Bj was,

4596
01:51:01,961 --> 01:51:02,260
uh,

4597
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,130
was out working at me.

4598
01:51:03,131 --> 01:51:05,470
He said he was blown away
by how good a shape Bj's in.

4599
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:05,861
Now,

4600
01:51:05,861 --> 01:51:07,410
I've heard this a million fucking times.

4601
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,220
We find out here this
literally every fight,

4602
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:10,300
every time.

4603
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:13,420
But what blew me away about
this is that first of all,

4604
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:14,650
they're going to fight at one 45.

4605
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:15,820
That's going to be a disaster.

4606
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:20,050
Bj Soria Zombie was making
one 55 but whatever he did,

4607
01:51:20,051 --> 01:51:21,310
I don't know what he adjusted.

4608
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:24,130
I would love to talk to him
about how he changed his body.

4609
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:28,780
But he got down where he was walking
around like under one 60 I got a regular

4610
01:51:28,781 --> 01:51:33,781
basis and then the fight week he was
one 49 fight week without any cutting.

4611
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:34,931
Yeah.

4612
01:51:34,931 --> 01:51:39,931
And then he easily made one 45 Frankie
weighed one 45.5 BJ weighed one 45 on the

4613
01:51:40,421 --> 01:51:40,751
nugget.

4614
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:42,490
Look good at the weigh ins and chase.

4615
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:43,280
You know what I mean?

4616
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,110
It look skinny,

4617
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:47,110
but he had trouble making 55
beats and then I didn't know that.

4618
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:48,110
Oh yeah.

4619
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:49,320
He's not taught well.

4620
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:51,040
That's why I fought one 70 all the time.

4621
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:52,390
He fought Nick Diaz,

4622
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:52,781
any fought.

4623
01:51:52,781 --> 01:51:53,441
Rory Macdonald,

4624
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:54,271
two big ones.

4625
01:51:54,271 --> 01:51:56,320
Seventies Roy MacDonald
fight was hard to watch.

4626
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:56,740
And Boys,

4627
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:59,020
my boy that was on such a reach advantage.

4628
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,033
Bj Penn,

4629
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:00,731
Bj Penn,

4630
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:01,564
as far as,

4631
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,370
he's a super star,

4632
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:07,060
he is up as big as they get
superstar the most down to earth.

4633
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,340
Nicest Guy I've ever met in the UFC.

4634
01:52:09,341 --> 01:52:10,530
Hands Down Bj.

4635
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:13,540
He's assaulted the earth
and these are real warrior,

4636
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:14,374
but you know what man,

4637
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,660
he's a guy that has an incredible
amount of pride and you know he,

4638
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,523
he,

4639
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,100
he's got a lot of ego.

4640
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:22,120
He's got a lot of pride.

4641
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:22,970
He loves he,

4642
01:52:22,971 --> 01:52:23,231
you know,

4643
01:52:23,231 --> 01:52:26,290
he wants to get in there and
be the Bj that he used to be.

4644
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,010
Well that's why.

4645
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:28,000
That's why he is who he is.

4646
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:29,470
He don't get to that point
where they'll have an ego.

4647
01:52:29,471 --> 01:52:29,860
Listen,

4648
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,660
everyone who fights in the EOC has an ego.

4649
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:36,430
But if he could use that and motivate
himself to get back in and kind of shape

4650
01:52:36,431 --> 01:52:36,521
that.

4651
01:52:36,521 --> 01:52:38,750
He was back when he
fought Diego Sanchez back.

4652
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:42,910
We fought Sean Sherk and he
was in insane condition back.

4653
01:52:42,911 --> 01:52:43,780
How old is he now?

4654
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:44,531
He's trying to,

4655
01:52:44,531 --> 01:52:46,220
35 six how

4656
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,300
old do you think he's 42 he's Dwayne.

4657
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,280
Brian Thinks Bj Penn's 21 years old.

4658
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:53,733
He's the rock scene.

4659
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,540
I don't think he was 36 right?

4660
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,860
I would say 30 thirties for sure.

4661
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,040
Maybe find a long time.

4662
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,290
Yeah,

4663
01:53:02,290 --> 01:53:03,260
it's been a while.

4664
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:04,840
The WFC,

4665
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,451
by the way,

4666
01:53:05,451 --> 01:53:07,310
the UFC website is dog shit.

4667
01:53:07,311 --> 01:53:08,210
It's horrible.

4668
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:09,010
They,

4669
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:12,470
you can't go to the fighter
until their fight is on.

4670
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:15,200
Like if you try to go to the fighter when,

4671
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:15,650
um,

4672
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,760
there are fights not on,

4673
01:53:16,761 --> 01:53:19,460
it takes you to the
previous fight like you,

4674
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:23,630
like if the like to go to the card and
when you go to the card it shows like the

4675
01:53:23,631 --> 01:53:25,520
fighters and he tried to,

4676
01:53:25,521 --> 01:53:26,354
uh,

4677
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:30,080
read the bio on them and it just like,

4678
01:53:30,081 --> 01:53:32,200
it doesn't like even
allow you to click on it.

4679
01:53:32,201 --> 01:53:34,520
It actually takes you back to,

4680
01:53:34,521 --> 01:53:35,180
uh,

4681
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:36,013
the other fight.

4682
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,113
It's weird.

4683
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:39,560
It's weird.

4684
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:39,741
Okay.

4685
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:41,240
Let's see if I can search fighters.

4686
01:53:41,241 --> 01:53:41,930
Pj Pen.

4687
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:42,763
I'm saying Bj,

4688
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,960
Bj age and Google.

4689
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:46,190
I'm saying 34.

4690
01:53:46,191 --> 01:53:47,210
I'm gonna say 36.

4691
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:47,601
Okay,

4692
01:53:47,601 --> 01:53:48,434
let's try here.

4693
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:49,881
Let's see.

4694
01:53:49,881 --> 01:53:54,530
Bj Penn Doo Doo Doo Doo to 35.

4695
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:55,220
Wow.

4696
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:55,791
35.

4697
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:56,830
He low how?

4698
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,280
35 so for B,

4699
01:53:59,570 --> 01:53:59,841
this is,

4700
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:00,674
you know,

4701
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,590
last chance for romance
at the lighter weights.

4702
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:04,251
Especially,

4703
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:04,491
you know,

4704
01:54:04,491 --> 01:54:06,710
heavier guys can last longer.

4705
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,011
You know,

4706
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:07,251
they,

4707
01:54:07,251 --> 01:54:08,330
they oftentimes like,

4708
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,320
especially heavyweights.

4709
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:09,920
Yeah.

4710
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,740
Mature a little bit later
and are still effective to,

4711
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,200
I take my Flintstone vitamins,

4712
01:54:15,201 --> 01:54:15,861
word,

4713
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:16,460
word up,

4714
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,750
or listen,

4715
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:18,531
I'm rooting for Bgi.

4716
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:19,160
Wam to win.

4717
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,900
I don't think he stands a chance.

4718
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:21,530
Really.

4719
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:21,981
I don't,

4720
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:22,820
it hurts to say,

4721
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:23,710
cause I love Bj.

4722
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:24,620
Know what the odds arm.

4723
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,011
No,

4724
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:25,490
I don't.

4725
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:27,770
They they opened up at 10 to one.

4726
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:28,753
Frankie.

4727
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,950
Frankie is the makes sense.

4728
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:32,150
It makes sense.

4729
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:33,050
Frankie's is outstanding.

4730
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:33,261
I mean,

4731
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:34,130
he's just a fucking,

4732
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,083
he's a stud.

4733
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,290
He's a fucking stud.

4734
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,850
He's an outstanding athlete.

4735
01:54:37,851 --> 01:54:39,860
He's got some of the
best footwork in the UFC,

4736
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:40,813
I would say.

4737
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:41,180
Yeah.

4738
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,140
I'd say if not the best.

4739
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:43,250
No one's got a bigger heart.

4740
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,510
No one's got a better chin.

4741
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,880
No one's more of a fucking a Gamer.

4742
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:47,893
And Frankie,

4743
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,681
he's his game.

4744
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:49,370
It's fuck.

4745
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:50,800
Take those gray Maynard fights.

4746
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:52,640
Jesus Christ,

4747
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:52,881
Bro.

4748
01:54:52,881 --> 01:54:53,661
Hit his coach.

4749
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:54,630
Mark Henry I worked with,

4750
01:54:54,631 --> 01:54:55,520
before I fought cro cop,

4751
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,170
I flew up to New Jersey with his camp.

4752
01:54:57,171 --> 01:54:58,480
I was with recall Amita,

4753
01:54:58,690 --> 01:54:58,941
uh,

4754
01:54:58,941 --> 01:55:01,400
his striking coach Mark Henry and uh,

4755
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,710
it's insane.

4756
01:55:03,711 --> 01:55:05,120
I've never seen anything like it.

4757
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:06,560
If you watch Mark Henry in the corner,

4758
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:09,380
he's drenched in sweat
by the end of the fight.

4759
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:14,240
It's literally like he has a control
stick and he's doing this with Frankie.

4760
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,890
He just shouting out Frankie.

4761
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:18,110
They have a whole system and code.

4762
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:19,220
He'll go one three,

4763
01:55:19,221 --> 01:55:19,401
four,

4764
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:19,731
five,

4765
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:20,061
one three,

4766
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:20,271
four,

4767
01:55:20,271 --> 01:55:23,150
five and it changes every fight
so he can't pick up on it.

4768
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:28,100
It's like his coach is Peyton manning
and is running the offense and he's so

4769
01:55:28,101 --> 01:55:31,790
nervous before the fight because he
feels like it's banking on him because he

4770
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:33,470
calls every combination.

4771
01:55:33,471 --> 01:55:34,060
You see.

4772
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:34,670
Wow.

4773
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:34,940
Nope.

4774
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:37,610
There's no one else like him
in the UFC coaching wise.

4775
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:38,810
Yeah man.

4776
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:39,321
Mark Henry,

4777
01:55:39,321 --> 01:55:40,460
interesting beast.

4778
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:42,080
Did you get a lot out of working with him?

4779
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,453
A ton.

4780
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,313
Real aton

4781
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:45,690
cause you're thinking
about moving to New Jersey?

4782
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,700
I did really and I
thought it held you back.

4783
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:49,230
The checks accents

4784
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:52,080
who's with gold chain?

4785
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:54,061
No.

4786
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:55,410
Jersey shore came out and was like heat.

4787
01:55:55,411 --> 01:55:57,480
So that Jersey shortcut
when MTV and on it,

4788
01:55:57,481 --> 01:55:58,314
I'm good.

4789
01:55:58,380 --> 01:55:59,213
I'm all set.

4790
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,990
If they all look like sneaky,

4791
01:56:00,991 --> 01:56:01,290
I'm,

4792
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,060
I'm all set.

4793
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:02,651
That's where I was like,

4794
01:56:02,651 --> 01:56:03,484
I came to la,

4795
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,343
that's where I was born.

4796
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:04,580
Yeah.

4797
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:04,741
Yeah.

4798
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:04,990
Mark.

4799
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:05,551
And he's a beast,

4800
01:56:05,551 --> 01:56:06,300
man.

4801
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,230
I was working his basement.

4802
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:08,280
I worked with them so much.

4803
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:09,293
Uh,

4804
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:12,680
the calluses on my feet were ripping
off because I'd worked in his basement

4805
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:13,590
nonstop at night.

4806
01:56:13,591 --> 01:56:15,900
I only did the guy's work ethic is insane.

4807
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,140
I don't think there's another coach in
the world who works hard in the Markin.

4808
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:20,101
Wow.

4809
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:20,820
So what,

4810
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,151
I mean,

4811
01:56:21,151 --> 01:56:22,440
so you really get enough credit.

4812
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:23,160
No kidding.

4813
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:23,850
You don't get enough credit.

4814
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:24,690
I was getting it from you.

4815
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,760
Did you think about moving
down that you really did?

4816
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,540
I did.

4817
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,260
I did,

4818
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:29,460
but there wasn't big guys.

4819
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:31,500
There was no big guys around anyone.

4820
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,040
That's a,

4821
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:32,821
that's a big thing.

4822
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:33,654
And that's a bummer.

4823
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,613
A super bummer.

4824
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:37,770
Do you base where you trained
by the size of the guys?

4825
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,000
Uh,

4826
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,650
I base on it on,

4827
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:41,070
on,

4828
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:41,903
uh,

4829
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:46,440
the coaches first I find the coaches
and then I always think that at least if

4830
01:56:46,441 --> 01:56:47,670
there's big guys in the area,

4831
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:47,990
I'll,

4832
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,770
I'll at least get to him somehow.

4833
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,340
And honestly I thought me and for
doing would work together more.

4834
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,990
And then,

4835
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,420
uh,

4836
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,910
when I first came out to
give it like a trial run,

4837
01:56:57,150 --> 01:56:58,900
there was word that means we're doing,

4838
01:56:58,901 --> 01:56:59,581
we're gonna fight each other.

4839
01:56:59,581 --> 01:57:01,830
And me and him started talking shit to
each other on Twitter and got out of

4840
01:57:01,831 --> 01:57:02,070
hand.

4841
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:03,180
He texts me or tweeting me,

4842
01:57:03,181 --> 01:57:03,600
like,

4843
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,010
I'll fight you on the moon.

4844
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,150
And I put okay,

4845
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:07,650
or we can just do in Las Vegas.

4846
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:08,700
September 21st,

4847
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:09,540
not the moon.

4848
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:10,373
Save your money.

4849
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,070
You know,

4850
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:13,140
like rockets are expensive.

4851
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:13,590
Yeah,

4852
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:14,191
that's what I said.

4853
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:14,421
I said,

4854
01:57:14,421 --> 01:57:15,100
rocket fuel,

4855
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,070
super expensive.

4856
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,610
You can't just do it in Las Vegas,

4857
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:18,444
Bro.

4858
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,880
Definitely won that battle.

4859
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:21,973
Awkward.

4860
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:22,471
Yeah,

4861
01:57:22,471 --> 01:57:23,580
but so we're going to fight.

4862
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:24,241
But then he was like,

4863
01:57:24,241 --> 01:57:24,811
Nah man.

4864
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:26,340
Like we might have fight.

4865
01:57:26,341 --> 01:57:27,390
So he doesn't want to work together.

4866
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,673
Great guy though.

4867
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,121
How about now?

4868
01:57:30,121 --> 01:57:30,511
Would you be,

4869
01:57:30,511 --> 01:57:31,710
would you fall?

4870
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:32,820
They still might have to fight,

4871
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:33,031
dude.

4872
01:57:33,031 --> 01:57:34,560
They're both in the
heavyweights in the UFC.

4873
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:35,550
Are you paying attention?

4874
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:36,960
But you hear the train with him?

4875
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:37,951
I would work with them.

4876
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:38,784
Yeah.

4877
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:39,451
Bj is,

4878
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:41,010
it's kind of weird
looking at 'em all skinny.

4879
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:42,830
I don't,

4880
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:43,531
I love his wife.

4881
01:57:43,531 --> 01:57:45,270
His out to my favorite in the UFC.

4882
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:47,091
How about he?

4883
01:57:47,091 --> 01:57:49,230
He gets so emotional sometimes
he cries when he walks out.

4884
01:57:49,231 --> 01:57:50,064
Huh?

4885
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:51,023
Look at that.

4886
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,740
He didn't get me fired up man.

4887
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,470
Looking at them just looking
at his face gets me fired up.

4888
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,040
I love it.

4889
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,270
I'm a huge Bj Penn.

4890
01:57:57,271 --> 01:57:58,170
Fair to man.

4891
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,033
God Damn.

4892
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:01,663
And Frankie Edgar.

4893
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:04,340
They could not live in
more contrast in places.

4894
01:58:04,341 --> 01:58:04,730
Right.

4895
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:06,230
One of them lives in paradise.

4896
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:07,970
The other one lives in fucking jersey.

4897
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:13,880
Okay.

4898
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,830
That's Mark Henry right there.

4899
01:58:14,831 --> 01:58:15,011
Yeah.

4900
01:58:15,011 --> 01:58:15,920
So I like those,

4901
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:16,100
uh,

4902
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,330
those gloves too.

4903
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,800
Big thick padded gloves.

4904
01:58:18,801 --> 01:58:19,910
But they still have Tony,

4905
01:58:19,911 --> 01:58:22,070
I don't know if you'd be able
to pick it up on the broadcast,

4906
01:58:22,071 --> 01:58:25,790
but you'll literally here march
shouting the entire rounds.

4907
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:26,420
Four,

4908
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:26,631
five,

4909
01:58:26,631 --> 01:58:26,901
six,

4910
01:58:26,901 --> 01:58:27,380
seven,

4911
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:27,621
nine,

4912
01:58:27,621 --> 01:58:27,891
nine,

4913
01:58:27,891 --> 01:58:28,240
nine.

4914
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,610
Just those are all combinations and they
change it every camp cause they don't

4915
01:58:31,611 --> 01:58:32,720
want people picking up on it.

4916
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,190
That's just smart.

4917
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:35,024
Frankie is to,

4918
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:37,070
well it shows you how much
work they put in there.

4919
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:37,790
Oh,

4920
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:38,390
Mark Henry,

4921
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:39,223
just off me.

4922
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:40,490
Just when we work together.

4923
01:58:40,670 --> 01:58:41,500
I'm talking this,

4924
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,070
this notebook

4925
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,903
right here.

4926
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,650
Completely full notes.

4927
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:45,400
Wow.

4928
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,300
It was overwhelming.

4929
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:46,631
I was like,

4930
01:58:46,631 --> 01:58:46,880
damn,

4931
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:47,051
no,

4932
01:58:47,051 --> 01:58:49,030
you need to go study
this for about a year.

4933
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,150
What does it feel like when you leave
that and you train with someone else and

4934
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,200
you don't have all that?

4935
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:54,034
You must feel like,

4936
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:54,641
what the fuck?

4937
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:56,140
I'm not maximizing my potential.

4938
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:56,411
Nope.

4939
01:58:56,411 --> 01:58:59,770
I got a guy now here in la
because we share the same shit.

4940
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,270
Really does the same shit,

4941
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:02,680
but he's just boxing.

4942
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:03,850
You know what I'm saying?

4943
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:04,390
Yeah.

4944
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:05,240
We've talked about that.

4945
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:07,330
We need to talk about
that when shut this off.

4946
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:07,781
You know,

4947
01:59:07,781 --> 01:59:08,614
talking to us on it.

4948
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:10,330
I've got some new information for you.

4949
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:11,253
All right.

4950
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:12,183
We'll talk some more,

4951
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:13,203
but here it is.

4952
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:14,770
It's going down right now,

4953
01:59:14,771 --> 01:59:15,160
man.

4954
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:15,461
Oh,

4955
01:59:15,461 --> 01:59:16,840
I'm so excited about this fight.

4956
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:19,480
I almost thought about staying
in Vegas just for this fight.

4957
01:59:19,481 --> 01:59:19,661
Wow.

4958
01:59:19,661 --> 01:59:20,740
That place filled up.

4959
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:21,881
That's shows you,

4960
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:22,714
man.

4961
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:23,591
I'll tell you right now.

4962
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:25,480
Fade or it could be fight in in the prime,

4963
01:59:25,481 --> 01:59:28,810
could be fighting a prime frickin whoever
and I wouldn't have stayed in babies.

4964
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:29,620
I would've said,

4965
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,640
well man,

4966
01:59:30,641 --> 01:59:31,030
I dunno.

4967
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,250
I would have fade or I would
have stayed for not me.

4968
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,980
Fade work had been fighting
cro cop in their prime.

4969
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,360
I would have went home
to la right and know me.

4970
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,350
I would have told my wife,

4971
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:39,190
listen bitch,

4972
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:40,570
Mike told Jay in the background,

4973
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:43,300
I'll see you in a day.

4974
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,490
It's not going to watch
free to air and Cro cop,

4975
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,503
not me.

4976
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:49,660
I would have paid double for my
air ticket today to get home.

4977
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:50,650
That's funny.

4978
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:53,020
But are all the fighters
that I wish I'd seen live?

4979
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:56,770
He's never one fader who I saw them live
when he beat up Mark Coleman in Vegas.

4980
01:59:57,210 --> 01:59:57,760
I never saw him.

4981
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:58,593
Real ass whooping.

4982
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:00,090
That was a real ass weapon.

4983
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:00,990
That was hard to watch.

4984
02:00:00,991 --> 02:00:01,690
A horrible,

4985
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:03,720
does it sound like they're bunum or no,

4986
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,001
no,

4987
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:04,720
no,

4988
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,553
no way.

4989
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:07,300
No one's blue and Bj Penn Bro.

4990
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,180
Fucking hey man,

4991
02:00:10,181 --> 02:00:11,140
this is wild.

4992
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:12,393
Look at him.

4993
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:13,451
He looks thinner,

4994
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:13,691
man.

4995
02:00:13,691 --> 02:00:16,050
He looks like he's way thinner
and they're finding it.

4996
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:19,000
One 45 you know Bj fought heavyweight.

4997
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,160
He fought Leo Machida over
tall five it's called the ROC,

4998
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:24,850
correct?

4999
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,170
No promotion the Rock,

5000
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:27,251
right and heavyweight.

5001
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:27,431
No,

5002
02:00:27,431 --> 02:00:28,000
he fought.

5003
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,590
I mean he did fight in Hawaii,

5004
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:30,370
rumble on the rock.

5005
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:31,210
There was on the rock.

5006
02:00:31,211 --> 02:00:32,160
That's those promotion.

5007
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:33,640
But that's not when he fought the Yoda.

5008
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:34,900
He fought Liotta in Japan.

5009
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,173
He fought,

5010
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:39,220
he fought Gomi in um,

5011
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,331
in Hawaii.

5012
02:00:40,331 --> 02:00:44,170
Went Gomi was a legend and he
beat the piss out of gummy.

5013
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,300
It's when [inaudible] was at its best.

5014
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,970
I get that Bj Penn.

5015
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:50,110
God Damn,

5016
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:54,550
look at this amazing and I wish,

5017
02:00:54,610 --> 02:00:55,350
I wish I get here.

5018
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,570
Walk.

5019
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:57,190
That's a living legend right there folks.

5020
02:00:57,191 --> 02:00:57,790
Straight up.

5021
02:00:57,790 --> 02:00:59,200
He is a living legend.

5022
02:00:59,830 --> 02:00:59,951
Oh,

5023
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:00,701
you like Bruce Lee.

5024
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:00,821
Yeah,

5025
02:01:00,821 --> 02:01:02,440
we got Bj Penn fight right now.

5026
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,740
Yeah,

5027
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:03,670
he's actually competing.

5028
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:05,710
I'm a big fan of Bruce Lee too,

5029
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:08,260
but I think all this Bruce
Lee talks getting out of hand.

5030
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,480
I agree with my song in the octagon.

5031
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:10,991
It was,

5032
02:01:10,991 --> 02:01:12,430
people were saying he's greatest,

5033
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:12,641
this,

5034
02:01:12,641 --> 02:01:12,921
the gray.

5035
02:01:12,921 --> 02:01:16,210
So He's a very good actor at some really
good ideas that marsh did some great

5036
02:01:16,211 --> 02:01:16,660
stuff,

5037
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,250
did some great stuff with g Condo,

5038
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:19,084
but however,

5039
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:21,190
he never officially competed.

5040
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,570
There's nothing on record.

5041
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:23,873
Last I said,

5042
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,460
I think I said this on my podcast,

5043
02:01:25,461 --> 02:01:26,590
the fight fighting the kid or in yours,

5044
02:01:26,591 --> 02:01:27,160
I forget.

5045
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,480
People bombard me with tweets,

5046
02:01:28,481 --> 02:01:28,601
like,

5047
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:29,434
how dare you.

5048
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,041
No Man,

5049
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm stating the facts.

5050
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,140
I'm sure he's great.

5051
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,131
He's great.

5052
02:01:33,131 --> 02:01:35,140
One of the best ever did I where?

5053
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:36,370
Bruce Lee t shirts all the time.

5054
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:37,613
I love to sleep.

5055
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,490
However,

5056
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:40,180
talk about Heman and Bj Penn.

5057
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:40,701
Same Cynthia.

5058
02:01:40,701 --> 02:01:41,261
Exactly it.

5059
02:01:41,261 --> 02:01:41,950
Keep it.

5060
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:42,930
One's a warrior.

5061
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:43,731
One's an actor.

5062
02:01:43,731 --> 02:01:44,564
One's a warrior.

5063
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:44,860
Yeah,

5064
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:45,150
I'm,

5065
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:46,220
and again,

5066
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:47,720
he was hugely important.

5067
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,280
Bruce Lee's hugely important.

5068
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:50,540
I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan.

5069
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:53,510
He was the original mixed martial artists.

5070
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:58,511
He was the first guy and when I came along
in the 1980s when I was doing martial

5071
02:01:58,851 --> 02:01:59,061
arts,

5072
02:01:59,061 --> 02:01:59,894
when I first started,

5073
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:03,590
they still had this issue where
people were loyal to their style,

5074
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,150
who still got a lot of that man.

5075
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:09,050
And Bruce Lee was the very first guy
and it was even before I was started

5076
02:02:09,051 --> 02:02:09,620
training.

5077
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:11,480
The very first guy who
came along and said,

5078
02:02:11,481 --> 02:02:12,590
that's all nonsense,

5079
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:14,300
like you should use what's useful.

5080
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:18,260
And he built his own style that was based
on incorporating all these different

5081
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:20,780
martial turn martial arts into a business.

5082
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,760
And then the dragon,

5083
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:24,140
he actually does an arm bar too.

5084
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:24,681
Oh yeah,

5085
02:02:24,681 --> 02:02:25,101
he does.

5086
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:25,251
Well,

5087
02:02:25,251 --> 02:02:26,630
he worked out a lot with gene,

5088
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:30,770
a gene Lebell Gene Lebell labelle's on
the podcast told me some great stories.

5089
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:31,911
That's classic.

5090
02:02:31,911 --> 02:02:32,480
Yeah,

5091
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,081
tiny guy.

5092
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:33,291
Right.

5093
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:38,291
And he was like 530530557 35 they
still really don't know how he died,

5094
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:39,351
right.

5095
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:41,360
They say mixed like
hamstring with painkillers.

5096
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,740
I get a head injury apparently.

5097
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:44,330
Okay.

5098
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:45,980
Like some sort of annual
or something guys,

5099
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:47,660
I know that Chinese mouth.

5100
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:48,560
Let's find out.

5101
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:48,900
Yeah,

5102
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:49,733
I know.

5103
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:50,571
I literally,

5104
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:54,190
I Google it because I was getting so
much heat about Bruce Lee and [inaudible]

5105
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:56,570
said he was at like some director's house.

5106
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:57,441
He had a headache.

5107
02:02:57,441 --> 02:02:58,850
He took aspirin and then we went home.

5108
02:02:58,851 --> 02:03:00,410
He took a painkiller and it killed him.

5109
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:02,490
Okay.

5110
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:03,060
Look at Frank.

5111
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,640
He always runs in and you'll see
Mark Henry running right behind him.

5112
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:07,440
You see him trying to keep up?

5113
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:10,281
There he is.

5114
02:03:10,281 --> 02:03:10,610
Look,

5115
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:13,170
you know there's your
Nintendo controller here.

5116
02:03:13,171 --> 02:03:15,770
He comes in Tyndall 64 in the house.

5117
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:19,440
Damn Frankie Edgar.

5118
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:20,221
Holy Shit.

5119
02:03:20,221 --> 02:03:21,054
Here we go.

5120
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:25,810
Here we go.

5121
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:29,310
Real is Frankie Ben Henderson fights.

5122
02:03:29,370 --> 02:03:30,360
Those are so close.

5123
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:31,980
I'd Frankie beating Ben in Denver.

5124
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:33,300
Okay.

5125
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:33,541
Yeah.

5126
02:03:33,541 --> 02:03:34,230
I thought he won.

5127
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:34,680
Let me too.

5128
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:35,760
I thought it was very close,

5129
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:36,990
but I thought Frankie one

5130
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:40,841
man,

5131
02:03:40,841 --> 02:03:42,520
I can't believe this
fight's about to go down.

5132
02:03:42,521 --> 02:03:43,450
This is so exciting.

5133
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,051
I can't believe that.

5134
02:03:44,051 --> 02:03:44,884
Fighting it again.

5135
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:46,000
All right.

5136
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,410
Death League collapsed in Golden Harvest
Studios and Hong Kong while doing

5137
02:03:50,411 --> 02:03:54,370
dubbing work for enter the dragon
suffering from seizures and headaches.

5138
02:03:54,371 --> 02:03:58,120
He was immediately rushed to Hong Kong
Baptist hospitals where doctors treated

5139
02:03:58,121 --> 02:04:00,100
him with chicken bones and Voodoo.

5140
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:00,400
No.

5141
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:00,910
Well there's your,

5142
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:03,370
a diagnosis of cerebral edema.

5143
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:08,710
Like why Hong Kong Baptist Anura as I
listen to that Hong Kong Baptist hospital.

5144
02:04:08,711 --> 02:04:09,544
Okay.

5145
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,030
Um,

5146
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:11,830
he had a cerebral edema.

5147
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:13,570
They were able to reduce the swelling.

5148
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:15,040
Um,

5149
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,371
wow.

5150
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:17,260
So he had bleeding in the brain,

5151
02:04:17,261 --> 02:04:18,094
man.

5152
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,241
Wow.

5153
02:04:19,241 --> 02:04:20,020
That's fucked up.

5154
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:21,110
And then when they reduced the,

5155
02:04:21,111 --> 02:04:22,240
so that was in May,

5156
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:23,260
um,

5157
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:28,260
the same symptoms that occurred in his
first collapse where a repeated on the

5158
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:30,580
day of his death in 1973,

5159
02:04:30,581 --> 02:04:33,070
Lee was in Hong Kong to have
dinner with James Bond Start,

5160
02:04:33,071 --> 02:04:34,240
George Lazenby,

5161
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:36,190
whom he intended to make a film.

5162
02:04:36,190 --> 02:04:37,060
According to Lee's wife,

5163
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,270
he met with producer
Raymond Chow at 2:00 PM,

5164
02:04:39,271 --> 02:04:40,620
discussed the making of the film.

5165
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,340
They worked until 4:00 PM,

5166
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,970
drove together at home
to the home of Lee's,

5167
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:46,020
a colleague,

5168
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:46,431
Blah Bubba,

5169
02:04:46,431 --> 02:04:46,541
blah,

5170
02:04:46,541 --> 02:04:46,620
blah,

5171
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,400
blah.

5172
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:50,820
Three went over the script and then
Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.

5173
02:04:50,821 --> 02:04:52,020
Lead complained of a headache.

5174
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,090
Teen gave him a,

5175
02:04:54,091 --> 02:04:59,091
an analgesic painkiller which contained
aspirin and a monk's muscle relaxing

5176
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:01,500
around seven 30 went
to lie down for a nap.

5177
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,000
He did not turn out for dinner.

5178
02:05:03,001 --> 02:05:06,180
She came to the apartment but could
not wake him up at doctor was summoned,

5179
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:10,260
spent 10 minutes attempting to revive
him before sending him to an ambulance.

5180
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,480
He was dead at the time
we reached the hospital.

5181
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,310
There's no visible external injury.

5182
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:14,641
However,

5183
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:16,140
according to autopsy reports,

5184
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:18,210
his brain had swollen considerably.

5185
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,880
So it was probably from
fucking brain injuries from,

5186
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:24,930
from getting a beating like
concussion style could Bei man,

5187
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:25,973
hey.

5188
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:27,060
Oh,

5189
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:27,893
okay.

5190
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:32,240
The doctor stated that he had died from
an allergic reaction to the muscle relax

5191
02:05:32,241 --> 02:05:37,241
and which he described as a
common ingredient in painkillers.

5192
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:40,170
When a doctor's announced Lee's death,

5193
02:05:40,171 --> 02:05:44,810
officially it was rural death
by misadventure misadventure.

5194
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:45,510
So in other words,

5195
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:48,270
misadventures in a recreational
use of drugs or something.

5196
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:50,730
Can this term misadventure well,

5197
02:05:50,731 --> 02:05:51,930
that's trying to have an adventure.

5198
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:53,700
And that's what the Bj look at bt.

5199
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:54,451
You can see his abs.

5200
02:05:54,451 --> 02:05:55,231
Never seen that before.

5201
02:05:55,231 --> 02:05:55,890
I'm Bj.

5202
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:56,161
Well,

5203
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:57,060
when he fought on the,

5204
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:57,840
the four.

5205
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,500
Yeah.

5206
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:58,771
Yeah.

5207
02:05:58,771 --> 02:06:00,060
But he's obviously in good shape,

5208
02:06:00,110 --> 02:06:00,943
man.

5209
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,100
This is so interesting.

5210
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,180
Definitely going for Bj.

5211
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:04,551
Never root against,

5212
02:06:04,551 --> 02:06:04,861
I'm Jay.

5213
02:06:04,861 --> 02:06:06,320
I'm so fascinated right now.

5214
02:06:06,321 --> 02:06:06,660
Me Too.

5215
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:07,800
And I love his shorts.

5216
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:09,450
Yeah.

5217
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:10,283
Love them

5218
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,940
to a prodigy.

5219
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:18,370
I think it was one of the fast
ever gives blackbelt correct.

5220
02:06:18,371 --> 02:06:19,120
Four years,

5221
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,541
three years.

5222
02:06:19,541 --> 02:06:20,300
Three years.

5223
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:21,310
Not just black belt.

5224
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:24,420
One won the world
championships every year.

5225
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,140
Y'alls as a black belt.

5226
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:28,510
Three years after he began training.

5227
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:29,403
That's insane.

5228
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:30,640
That's insane.

5229
02:06:30,641 --> 02:06:31,360
It's amazing.

5230
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:31,541
Well,

5231
02:06:31,541 --> 02:06:31,691
he,

5232
02:06:31,691 --> 02:06:31,840
oh,

5233
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,070
he had an incredible,

5234
02:06:33,071 --> 02:06:34,960
always had incredible flexibility.

5235
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:35,651
You know,

5236
02:06:35,651 --> 02:06:36,401
that's one of the,

5237
02:06:36,401 --> 02:06:36,810
the,

5238
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:38,980
the benefits that he's always had.

5239
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:41,290
Dexterity and flexibility and his legs.

5240
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:43,690
So instead of just being able
to hold you with his arms,

5241
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,790
he holds dudes with his legs swell.

5242
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,300
Yeah.

5243
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:46,961
Amazing.

5244
02:06:46,961 --> 02:06:47,480
Wec,

5245
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,580
I guys who roll with them,

5246
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:49,780
they always come back and I go his,

5247
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:53,380
his ground game is so freaky
because it was his legs.

5248
02:06:53,410 --> 02:06:54,700
He's on such another level.

5249
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,620
Have you ever enrolled with them or no?

5250
02:06:56,621 --> 02:06:56,981
No.

5251
02:06:56,981 --> 02:06:57,220
No.

5252
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,053
Never have.

5253
02:06:58,870 --> 02:06:59,531
Here we go.

5254
02:06:59,531 --> 02:07:00,071
Here we go.

5255
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:00,700
This is it.

5256
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:01,720
Oh my goodness.

5257
02:07:01,810 --> 02:07:02,230
Oh boy.

5258
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:02,980
Oh my.

5259
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:03,161
What?

5260
02:07:03,161 --> 02:07:05,140
Eddie Bravo has got the freakiest legs.

5261
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:06,880
You want to talk about Lego Sturdy?

5262
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,691
Oh my goodness.

5263
02:07:07,691 --> 02:07:10,510
He can do the craziest shit with his legs.

5264
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:14,230
Put them in places without things that
put things that like other people have to

5265
02:07:14,231 --> 02:07:14,651
do what?

5266
02:07:14,651 --> 02:07:17,130
You have to grab your foot and
put it in editing and just do it.

5267
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:19,490
Like you can do it like a hand.

5268
02:07:19,491 --> 02:07:19,870
Damn.

5269
02:07:19,870 --> 02:07:20,141
His,

5270
02:07:20,141 --> 02:07:22,240
his flexibility is ridiculous.

5271
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,840
That's cool.

5272
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:23,740
In certain positions,

5273
02:07:23,741 --> 02:07:24,221
but it's weird.

5274
02:07:24,221 --> 02:07:25,530
It doesn't have like flexible hamster.

5275
02:07:25,531 --> 02:07:26,050
We got kids.

5276
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:26,860
Here we go.

5277
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:27,280
Here we go.

5278
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:27,521
Jays,

5279
02:07:27,521 --> 02:07:28,660
opening out which strikes.

5280
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:28,830
Okay.

5281
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:29,290
This,

5282
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:32,830
you know how Freddie Roach has worked
with all these MMA tall BJ standing.

5283
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:33,790
Look how tall he standing.

5284
02:07:33,791 --> 02:07:34,624
It's weird.

5285
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:35,960
I don't think worried
about getting taken down.

5286
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:36,701
Look,

5287
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:37,534
how tall are you standing?

5288
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,500
Never seen him do that.

5289
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:39,281
It's weird.

5290
02:07:39,281 --> 02:07:40,114
Weird.

5291
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:43,690
Freddie Roach said Bj has the best
box and he's ever seen for MMA guy.

5292
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,583
Yeah,

5293
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:45,910
look at this man.

5294
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,140
Ooh,

5295
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,620
nice left hook there by Bj.

5296
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,340
Dude.

5297
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:50,140
Bj looks really tall.

5298
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:51,460
This is really strange.

5299
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:54,980
Standing right there
and the pocket does it.

5300
02:07:55,010 --> 02:07:55,211
I mean,

5301
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:56,260
does he want to get taken down?

5302
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:56,500
Dude,

5303
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,740
he looks different than
I've ever seen ever before.

5304
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,670
So strange.

5305
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,861
Wow.

5306
02:08:02,861 --> 02:08:03,170
Asleep.

5307
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:03,591
She's looking,

5308
02:08:03,591 --> 02:08:05,780
he's putting price leg kick by by,

5309
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:06,491
when you're that tall,

5310
02:08:06,491 --> 02:08:08,260
the leg kicks there all night.

5311
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:09,280
So the tank towns,

5312
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:09,790
right.

5313
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:10,271
Take downs,

5314
02:08:10,271 --> 02:08:11,840
especially back and leg
kicks are just that.

5315
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:14,770
They're super tall on his tippy toes,

5316
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,910
standing up straight.

5317
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,110
Literally on his tippy toes.

5318
02:08:17,111 --> 02:08:17,944
Yeah.

5319
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:19,990
It's so weird.

5320
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:20,824
It's weird.

5321
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:21,641
He's like,

5322
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:22,960
he's changed his style.

5323
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,680
Yeah.

5324
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:24,990
Frank,

5325
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,920
he's looking for a take down.

5326
02:08:25,921 --> 02:08:27,840
He gets it maybe wanting
to go to the ground.

5327
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,990
Maybe that's the only explanation.

5328
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:31,170
As the feed on the hips,

5329
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,200
Bj pushes him off

5330
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:40,730
leg kicks by Frankie.

5331
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:41,570
Wow.

5332
02:08:41,570 --> 02:08:42,740
This is crazy to watch.

5333
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:45,050
Super interesting.

5334
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:45,781
Yeah.

5335
02:08:45,781 --> 02:08:47,360
I feel like Bj wants him down there.

5336
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:48,950
I'm excited that it's five rounds.

5337
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,950
That's VJ wants to submit them.

5338
02:08:53,951 --> 02:08:55,230
Like he went right back to it.

5339
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,093
You think so?

5340
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:57,600
I do.

5341
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,250
Why else would you be I tippy toes?

5342
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:00,430
Inviting a take down.

5343
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:01,710
I don't know if that's it.

5344
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:02,150
I don't eat,

5345
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:02,760
I believe.

5346
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,500
And he's not kicking the get up either.

5347
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:05,660
Izzy?

5348
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:06,493
No.

5349
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:08,310
Did you notice that work
when he was throwing punches?

5350
02:09:08,311 --> 02:09:09,091
When he's hitting the,

5351
02:09:09,091 --> 02:09:09,171
uh,

5352
02:09:09,171 --> 02:09:11,070
the pads in the preview?

5353
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:13,380
He was like standing
straight up to it was weird.

5354
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:13,490
Yeah.

5355
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:15,660
I just thought it was because
it was just fucking around,

5356
02:09:15,661 --> 02:09:15,841
right?

5357
02:09:15,841 --> 02:09:16,140
Yeah.

5358
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:16,560
Yeah.

5359
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,341
I thought so too.

5360
02:09:17,341 --> 02:09:20,150
But it's almost like he's
changed his style a little bit.

5361
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,200
I wonder if he brought in
someone new to work with it.

5362
02:09:22,201 --> 02:09:23,520
He's got a philosophy behind it.

5363
02:09:23,521 --> 02:09:24,570
You'd have to write.

5364
02:09:24,571 --> 02:09:26,370
You can't just switch it up for no reason.

5365
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:26,761
I don't know.

5366
02:09:26,761 --> 02:09:27,750
Maybe he had a vision.

5367
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:29,240
Okay.

5368
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:29,810
Maybe said,

5369
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:30,860
come on down to the ground,

5370
02:09:30,861 --> 02:09:31,694
son.

5371
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:32,533
I was in the ocean.

5372
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:33,373
I had a vision.

5373
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:40,940
I took our rock and went under the
water then that now your sound.

5374
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:41,201
No,

5375
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:42,410
I'm trying to hasten Brazilian.

5376
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:42,900
No,

5377
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,710
no,

5378
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:44,260
no.

5379
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:45,093
Roger.

5380
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:47,050
So he's not trying to get out.

5381
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,690
No,

5382
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:48,523
no he's not.

5383
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:50,210
But Frankie's not trying
to let them up either.

5384
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:53,390
It's weird friends to try
to turn that corner back in.

5385
02:09:53,391 --> 02:09:56,330
The guard is trying to pass this
butterfly and Jay has good luck with that.

5386
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:59,480
Detail is scarred
ridiculous guard to pass,

5387
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:00,831
but you know,

5388
02:10:00,831 --> 02:10:02,330
it doesn't get a lot of triangles,

5389
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:02,670
you know?

5390
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:03,030
Definitely.

5391
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:03,863
It

5392
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:06,860
usually gets people's morale of the icon.

5393
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:10,400
There's a lot of room to move while
he's sweeps guys and takes their back.

5394
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:10,671
Yeah,

5395
02:10:10,671 --> 02:10:11,540
he always gets their back.

5396
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:12,410
Yeah.

5397
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:13,161
I mean that's,

5398
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:14,060
he's known for that.

5399
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:14,310
Yup.

5400
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:17,030
And locking guys up with one arm trapped.

5401
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,460
He's a master at that one arm trapped.

5402
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:19,640
Why?

5403
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:22,640
He's got your back Frankie Passes
Butterfly and be impressed.

5404
02:10:22,670 --> 02:10:23,390
Yeah.

5405
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:23,960
Look at that.

5406
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:25,100
So you could get up right there.

5407
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:26,540
He could literally get up right then.

5408
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:27,310
It seems like he doesn't want,

5409
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:28,143
oh,

5410
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:28,970
that was bad ass.

5411
02:10:28,970 --> 02:10:29,590
That's ensign.

5412
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:29,841
Anyway.

5413
02:10:29,841 --> 02:10:31,580
Style old school.

5414
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:36,620
You ever see that fight and Randy couture
and send through some gangster kicks

5415
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:41,030
off of his back from the butts
scoot and then any arm barred Randy,

5416
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:42,900
you.

5417
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,570
That's Frankie trying
to get back in there.

5418
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:47,330
Back in there again.

5419
02:10:47,331 --> 02:10:47,840
The same.

5420
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,720
Look at trying to get him to try
to pass 800 cents in a new way.

5421
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:51,554
A Samoan?

5422
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,161
No,

5423
02:10:52,161 --> 02:10:52,770
he's trying to,

5424
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:54,470
Jeff's big Japanese guy.

5425
02:10:54,490 --> 02:10:55,323
Is he a black guy?

5426
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:59,270
Dops six foot seven.

5427
02:10:59,271 --> 02:10:59,841
You anyway.

5428
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,240
Could be shifting.

5429
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:02,150
He was just so thick.

5430
02:11:02,151 --> 02:11:03,810
He has to be something else besides job.

5431
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:05,930
There's a lot of thick Japanese guys.

5432
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:08,110
Look with Fujita switch.

5433
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:08,771
Kick us.

5434
02:11:08,771 --> 02:11:09,470
Fuck it.

5435
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:10,220
Easy.

5436
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,770
Yeah.

5437
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:11,540
So Toshi,

5438
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:13,310
she's a fucking real thick dude.

5439
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:14,340
Judo Champ.

5440
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:15,230
Oh by the way,

5441
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:15,951
don't call me.

5442
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:17,420
She likes to be referred to us.

5443
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,273
So Toshi,

5444
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:18,411
oh,

5445
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:18,740
really?

5446
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:20,450
Learned that after two
years of training with them.

5447
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,370
What is Satoshi?

5448
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:21,721
Was He,

5449
02:11:21,721 --> 02:11:22,580
she is first name,

5450
02:11:22,581 --> 02:11:23,121
is that what it is?

5451
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:24,510
And Toshi is his last name.

5452
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,360
Satoshi is his first name.

5453
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,571
He,

5454
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:26,811
she,

5455
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:27,140
I dunno,

5456
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,973
like sewing gay.

5457
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:28,880
I don't know how it works.

5458
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,750
He was just trying to explain Bj backup.

5459
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:34,650
Let's say this upright again.

5460
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:36,690
Straight up and just kind of there.

5461
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:38,451
We're good.

5462
02:11:38,451 --> 02:11:39,830
Kick to the body by Frankie.

5463
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:40,551
Nice switch.

5464
02:11:40,551 --> 02:11:43,430
Kick my Franklin to throw more low kicks.

5465
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,253
There we go.

5466
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:46,213
Checked one.

5467
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:50,510
Great footwork.

5468
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:51,343
Look at Frankie man.

5469
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:54,330
I wish we could hear Mark Henry Right now.

5470
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:55,680
So strange.

5471
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:57,160
It is so aware.

5472
02:11:57,161 --> 02:11:58,100
So strange scene.

5473
02:11:58,101 --> 02:11:59,070
This style from him.

5474
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:00,600
Light on his toes.

5475
02:12:00,870 --> 02:12:02,280
Very narrow stance.

5476
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:06,750
Very now it's the most narrow I've ever
seen in the UFC besides the kid who just

5477
02:12:06,751 --> 02:12:08,100
got knocked out who's six months,

5478
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:08,461
right?

5479
02:12:08,461 --> 02:12:08,970
Strange.

5480
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:09,121
No,

5481
02:12:09,121 --> 02:12:10,590
he's more narrow than that guy.

5482
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:11,341
I don't know.

5483
02:12:11,341 --> 02:12:12,840
Like I was straight upright.

5484
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:13,111
Yeah,

5485
02:12:13,111 --> 02:12:15,780
but Bj's got its feet
practically touching each other.

5486
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:16,210
Bj,

5487
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:18,120
its feet are touching
you and he's tippy toes.

5488
02:12:18,450 --> 02:12:18,750
Yeah.

5489
02:12:18,750 --> 02:12:19,110
Ooh,

5490
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:20,370
nice left hook by Frankie.

5491
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:21,270
Good combination.

5492
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:22,320
Just what's going to happen tomorrow.

5493
02:12:22,321 --> 02:12:22,531
Kids.

5494
02:12:22,531 --> 02:12:23,880
He me in the gym on their tippy toes.

5495
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:26,040
Probably Guaranteeing Copycat League,

5496
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:27,360
man,

5497
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:27,840
pee break.

5498
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,750
Really interested to
see how this plays out.

5499
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:33,060
It's weird to get that
first round of Frankie.

5500
02:12:33,061 --> 02:12:36,660
Frankie took them down 100% Frankie
definitely landed more shots.

5501
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:40,020
Bj was able to stifle him in the guard,

5502
02:12:40,021 --> 02:12:41,730
but Frankie kick the shit out of his legs.

5503
02:12:41,731 --> 02:12:44,430
I Frankie's landed more kicks take down,

5504
02:12:44,431 --> 02:12:45,510
controlled him on the ground.

5505
02:12:45,511 --> 02:12:46,470
Although he's trying to pass.

5506
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:47,313
Didn't happen.

5507
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:48,323
See how did,

5508
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:51,900
let's see how if you're a judge
when it goes to the ground,

5509
02:12:51,901 --> 02:12:53,730
you can't pass and no damage.

5510
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,170
Yeah.

5511
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:57,270
Bj gets no recognition for that.

5512
02:12:57,271 --> 02:12:58,620
Zero as a judge.

5513
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,220
Yeah,

5514
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,030
totally true.

5515
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:00,863
Yeah.

5516
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:01,500
Yeah.

5517
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,331
It doesn't mean any,

5518
02:13:02,331 --> 02:13:02,760
I mean,

5519
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,320
but defense nothing in a fight.

5520
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:04,890
Yeah.

5521
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:05,251
However,

5522
02:13:05,251 --> 02:13:06,000
I'm just saying,

5523
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:06,390
right.

5524
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:07,223
I know you're saying,

5525
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:07,531
well,

5526
02:13:07,531 --> 02:13:08,520
you know what it really is,

5527
02:13:08,521 --> 02:13:08,851
man,

5528
02:13:08,851 --> 02:13:11,250
the system should be 30 points.

5529
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:12,480
It shouldn't be a 10 point system.

5530
02:13:12,490 --> 02:13:16,080
You should really write a 30 point
system and they should take into account

5531
02:13:16,081 --> 02:13:19,290
striking grappling submissions.

5532
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:19,471
You know,

5533
02:13:19,471 --> 02:13:24,060
all those three things should
be taken into account and that,

5534
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:24,780
you know,

5535
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:26,790
in the maybe 10 points each side,

5536
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,450
like maybe one guy gets
10 points for grappling,

5537
02:13:30,451 --> 02:13:32,460
the other guy gets it's 10 points.

5538
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:33,860
You know what I mean?

5539
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:34,693
Yeah.

5540
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:37,350
At what point are they
going to make the change?

5541
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:37,891
I don't know.

5542
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:38,940
I don't think in my life then.

5543
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:39,990
I think so.

5544
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:40,681
Yeah.

5545
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:41,514
I think so.

5546
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:45,510
They're actually looking at some
alternative scoring methods now they've,

5547
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,380
they've discussed it.

5548
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,970
I mean the UFC is very aware of it.

5549
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:49,020
I would like to see them do something.

5550
02:13:49,070 --> 02:13:51,450
It can you see Mark Henry
in the back yelling?

5551
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:51,751
No,

5552
02:13:51,751 --> 02:13:52,584
I can't see.

5553
02:13:52,650 --> 02:13:52,840
Yeah,

5554
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:52,991
yeah,

5555
02:13:52,991 --> 02:13:53,221
yeah.

5556
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:54,180
He's calling nonstop.

5557
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:55,950
He wants like cakes.

5558
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,010
Interesting fight man.

5559
02:13:59,011 --> 02:13:59,581
Interesting.

5560
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:00,414
So far.

5561
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,220
Let me see if Bj gets it.

5562
02:14:02,221 --> 02:14:02,641
His groove.

5563
02:14:02,641 --> 02:14:03,391
He's in good shape.

5564
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:05,050
I'll tell you that man
in this second round.

5565
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:05,913
Still looking good.

5566
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,290
Good overhand right with Frankie.

5567
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:07,801
I like our,

5568
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:10,060
Frankie does that goes
to the single makes look,

5569
02:14:10,061 --> 02:14:10,950
he's going to struggle for it.

5570
02:14:10,951 --> 02:14:14,550
Disengages and Mark Henry's thing and
they did it the first time BJ fought.

5571
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:15,151
What would they do?

5572
02:14:15,151 --> 02:14:16,830
He's so good at defend that single leg.

5573
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:20,250
They're just attempting it so Bj
reacts so they can land a left hook.

5574
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:21,121
Oh,

5575
02:14:21,121 --> 02:14:22,050
we tagged them in the right.

5576
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:24,661
Interesting.

5577
02:14:24,661 --> 02:14:25,650
Very interesting.

5578
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:28,410
If you're Bj though,

5579
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:29,273
what are you telling them?

5580
02:14:29,330 --> 02:14:30,410
What's your corners?

5581
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:32,000
Just like he just,

5582
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:33,000
just walking them down.

5583
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:34,770
It's interesting he's
putting the pressure on,

5584
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:36,390
but if I say interesting one more time,

5585
02:14:36,391 --> 02:14:39,180
I hit myself fucking mad at myself.

5586
02:14:39,181 --> 02:14:40,140
This fight is interesting.

5587
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:45,420
It is the best way to put it is upright
and just kind of walk in for kind of,

5588
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:46,810
I don't know,

5589
02:14:46,810 --> 02:14:49,230
Eaton leg kicks and it's very odd.

5590
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:50,700
Well he's checked a
lot of them too though,

5591
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:50,950
man.

5592
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:51,690
Doing a great job.

5593
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:52,860
I just don't care about that.

5594
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:53,550
No,

5595
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,170
no.

5596
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:55,770
There's that right hand again by Frankie.

5597
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,180
But BJ's walking them down,

5598
02:14:57,181 --> 02:14:57,451
man.

5599
02:14:57,451 --> 02:14:58,201
Walking him down,

5600
02:14:58,201 --> 02:14:59,010
walking them down.

5601
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:00,090
You ready for my prediction?

5602
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:02,011
Fourth Round.

5603
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:03,000
Tko Frankie Edgar,

5604
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:04,350
another take down right hand.

5605
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,633
Right hand.

5606
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:07,380
What makes you say that?

5607
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:08,670
I just see some stuff.

5608
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,451
That's what I think.

5609
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:09,870
Wow.

5610
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:11,480
What do I know that's a big prediction.

5611
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:13,090
Doing it is the old tasks are,

5612
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,400
you are bold of Brendan Schaub if
you're anything your bowl like that.

5613
02:15:17,401 --> 02:15:21,000
A one sauce but Doug spicy

5614
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:23,821
again,

5615
02:15:23,821 --> 02:15:24,750
the feed on the hips.

5616
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,340
See I see this and I'm like,

5617
02:15:26,341 --> 02:15:26,610
damn,

5618
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:27,421
that's so dope.

5619
02:15:27,421 --> 02:15:30,180
Bj can control in there and
he can't pass everyone else.

5620
02:15:30,181 --> 02:15:32,250
Like damn be just getting his ass whooped.

5621
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:33,330
The problem that weird.

5622
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,970
He doesn't do anything
offensive from his guard.

5623
02:15:35,971 --> 02:15:36,721
It's very rare.

5624
02:15:36,721 --> 02:15:40,710
I don't think he has a single arm bar
victory from the guard in his career.

5625
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:42,720
What he does is control guys,

5626
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:43,351
stifled them,

5627
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:47,820
sweeps them and then takes their back
and choke something like [inaudible] all

5628
02:15:47,821 --> 02:15:48,660
his submissions.

5629
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,201
What are they?

5630
02:15:49,201 --> 02:15:51,290
They're almost all rear naked choke.

5631
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:52,110
You get your back.

5632
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:52,943
Yeah.

5633
02:15:54,490 --> 02:15:55,980
Frankie landed a nice right hand.

5634
02:15:55,981 --> 02:15:58,660
They're in that weird Bj.

5635
02:15:58,661 --> 02:15:59,880
Such a BJJ

5636
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:05,340
ridiculous skills and he really ruined
nakeds guys like you're not seeing

5637
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:06,540
armbars leg attacks.

5638
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:09,480
He knows them 100% he knows all of them,

5639
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:10,560
but you have your,

5640
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:14,340
your kind of your niche that you do and
you get comfortable with doing it and

5641
02:16:14,341 --> 02:16:14,880
then weird.

5642
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,340
This is also weird for him to be
sitting on his back like this.

5643
02:16:17,341 --> 02:16:18,030
I don't know.

5644
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:19,440
Some guys just do that.

5645
02:16:19,441 --> 02:16:22,920
Like Marcella Garcia known
for rear nakeds and gay teens.

5646
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:28,100
Very rarely do you see Marcelo attempt
an Armbar are though he did leg lock Rico

5647
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:31,120
Rodriguez and the absolute crazy crazy.

5648
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:32,560
We're ricoh is terrified of him.

5649
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:37,390
Remember when he had Rico's back and Rico
threw himself back on top of Marcello

5650
02:16:37,391 --> 02:16:37,680
tried.

5651
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:38,050
Yeah.

5652
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:39,520
250 pounds of Rico.

5653
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,180
Yeah.

5654
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:40,930
Slammed him.

5655
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:41,201
Yeah.

5656
02:16:41,201 --> 02:16:42,250
Which is kind of fucked.

5657
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:43,323
Um,

5658
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:43,601
yeah.

5659
02:16:43,601 --> 02:16:44,311
I think it's weird,

5660
02:16:44,311 --> 02:16:44,490
man.

5661
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:45,323
It just is.

5662
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:46,630
It's so strange.

5663
02:16:46,631 --> 02:16:47,350
Like you,

5664
02:16:47,350 --> 02:16:47,950
you just,

5665
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,783
you get good.

5666
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:52,420
You probably have two moves in your
back pocket that are your go tos.

5667
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,560
You know the rest,

5668
02:16:53,561 --> 02:16:54,550
you know how to defend them,

5669
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:56,020
but they're not your go tos.

5670
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:56,261
Yeah.

5671
02:16:56,261 --> 02:16:58,480
There are certain guys
that do that over and over.

5672
02:16:58,481 --> 02:16:59,940
Well they'll get Rhonda and our armbars.

5673
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:02,410
Rhonda is arm bars are fucking ridiculous.

5674
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:04,000
Like when she fought me ship Tate,

5675
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:05,580
when they did the ultimate
fighter together and said,

5676
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:07,050
better get used to wiping your ass.

5677
02:17:07,051 --> 02:17:07,750
On the other hand,

5678
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:08,740
she's telling her,

5679
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,960
I'm going to arm bar you
and what does she do?

5680
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:11,400
Yeah.

5681
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,600
Armbars are incredible.

5682
02:17:13,850 --> 02:17:15,550
[inaudible] it's crazy,

5683
02:17:15,551 --> 02:17:16,150
man.

5684
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:16,570
Yeah.

5685
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:16,841
When,

5686
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:18,020
when someone has it like you,

5687
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:19,360
you remember Paul Sas?

5688
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,110
Oh yeah.

5689
02:17:20,110 --> 02:17:21,310
Really good triangles.

5690
02:17:21,311 --> 02:17:21,431
Like,

5691
02:17:21,431 --> 02:17:21,600
yeah,

5692
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:22,433
great triangles.

5693
02:17:22,450 --> 02:17:24,730
He had something like nine
triangle victories in a row.

5694
02:17:25,550 --> 02:17:26,350
Look at chocolate though.

5695
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:28,540
My arms crossed just not into it.

5696
02:17:28,590 --> 02:17:29,423
Just like

5697
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:33,640
it's probably not out and we sees
chuck not out in the background.

5698
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,673
If you fucked,

5699
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:38,591
boy,

5700
02:17:38,591 --> 02:17:40,270
this is not the most exciting.

5701
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:40,600
Yeah.

5702
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:42,910
Bj's gotta be thinking he's two
rounds in the hole here though.

5703
02:17:42,911 --> 02:17:43,600
No,

5704
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:46,260
I mean Frankie on top of
them two rounds in the hall.

5705
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:47,540
Oh,

5706
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:48,311
he's gonna sweep him.

5707
02:17:48,311 --> 02:17:48,491
Oh,

5708
02:17:48,491 --> 02:17:49,750
we got blasted right there.

5709
02:17:49,930 --> 02:17:50,620
Lasted,

5710
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:51,880
took some serious shots.

5711
02:17:51,881 --> 02:17:56,350
You see some ground and pound
dexterity of his legs were ridiculous.

5712
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,890
So few people can move around like
that off their back with their legs.

5713
02:17:59,891 --> 02:18:03,250
But the bottom line is
he's taking a beating man.

5714
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:06,250
Frankie's on top of them elbow
and the shit out of him here.

5715
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:06,760
Yeah.

5716
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:07,600
Oh Damn.

5717
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:09,100
Frankie's relentless.

5718
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:10,063
Frankie.

5719
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:10,990
I hate seeing this.

5720
02:18:10,991 --> 02:18:11,621
Look at the hate.

5721
02:18:11,621 --> 02:18:13,000
Seen Bj Penn get beat up.

5722
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,670
He is getting beat up too,

5723
02:18:15,671 --> 02:18:16,000
man.

5724
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,833
Two rounds.

5725
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:18,490
BJ's got to come on strong.

5726
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,600
Look at this.

5727
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:20,440
Oh my goodness.

5728
02:18:20,441 --> 02:18:22,750
BJ's getting rocked
here with these elbows.

5729
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:24,940
He's staying calm and everything.

5730
02:18:27,210 --> 02:18:28,560
See like here did you can,

5731
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:29,670
I mean his level,

5732
02:18:29,671 --> 02:18:33,210
you can go for likes here
and you can go for ankles.

5733
02:18:33,211 --> 02:18:33,680
He doesn't,

5734
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:34,590
your options there.

5735
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:35,453
He doesn't do it.

5736
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:37,400
You know,

5737
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,760
I'd like to see him in his corner.

5738
02:18:38,761 --> 02:18:38,971
Look at,

5739
02:18:38,971 --> 02:18:40,590
he's tired and I'd love
to hear the corner.

5740
02:18:40,770 --> 02:18:41,371
Not this one.

5741
02:18:41,371 --> 02:18:42,204
The other one.

5742
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:46,240
Yeah.

5743
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:47,073
Interesting.

5744
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:50,710
Ricardo made is in his corner too.

5745
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:51,460
Great.

5746
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:52,360
Give us a little volume there,

5747
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:53,194
Jamie.

5748
02:18:55,170 --> 02:18:57,510
Please give us be djs
all busted up a little.

5749
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:59,093
His cheek.

5750
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,660
He's taking big deep breaths now.

5751
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:04,420
Two rounds in the hole
for Frankie am I Ricardo?

5752
02:19:04,430 --> 02:19:05,630
When he was 17 at hands,

5753
02:19:05,631 --> 02:19:09,440
US walking around speed and
everybody up at 17 and big.

5754
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:10,333
Oh yeah.

5755
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:12,860
Let me hear.

5756
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:13,693
Let me hear this opponent.

5757
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:15,713
Stay busy.

5758
02:19:17,060 --> 02:19:18,660
Did his face looks like fuck it.

5759
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:19,703
I'm going to be honest.

5760
02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:20,401
That's a face of,

5761
02:19:20,401 --> 02:19:20,791
you know what?

5762
02:19:20,791 --> 02:19:21,624
Fuck this.

5763
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,073
Don't worry about that

5764
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:25,190
right now.

5765
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:26,060
Just win this round.

5766
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:26,440
That's,

5767
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,273
that's not

5768
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,550
just win this round.

5769
02:19:29,610 --> 02:19:30,290
He wasn't going to,

5770
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:31,123
what should he say that?

5771
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:31,281
Joe?

5772
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:32,150
What can you say?

5773
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:32,690
Well,

5774
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:33,170
hey bro,

5775
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:35,150
you are completely
getting your ass kicked.

5776
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:37,670
Let's try and revamp everything.

5777
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:39,410
You can't just took a big deep breath too.

5778
02:19:39,411 --> 02:19:39,591
Well,

5779
02:19:39,591 --> 02:19:43,120
you know what he's got to do is he's got
to keep the fight standing or he's got

5780
02:19:43,121 --> 02:19:44,750
to take Frankie down
and get on top of him.

5781
02:19:44,810 --> 02:19:45,050
I mean,

5782
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,100
if Bj gets on top,

5783
02:19:46,101 --> 02:19:47,480
his top game is nasty,

5784
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:51,160
but he just can't hold him in his guard
and put his feet on the hips like that.

5785
02:19:51,161 --> 02:19:51,350
Right.

5786
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:52,400
Hand's going to do nothing.

5787
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:55,910
Right hand is going to drop
Bj and they seem to get t code

5788
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,110
is getting,

5789
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:04,250
this isn't as cool as it's changing now.

5790
02:20:04,251 --> 02:20:05,270
I'm super depressed.

5791
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:05,421
Yeah,

5792
02:20:05,421 --> 02:20:06,141
that was a beating.

5793
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:06,974
He was all,

5794
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:09,650
oh right hand by Frankie.

5795
02:20:10,390 --> 02:20:11,840
Frankie's just more active,

5796
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:12,950
more accurate,

5797
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:16,490
more unpredictable and more successful.

5798
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:17,000
So far.

5799
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,450
Look at that.

5800
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,040
Nice kick on the transition.

5801
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:20,270
Looks like he's pulling away.

5802
02:20:20,271 --> 02:20:21,470
Boom lands that kick.

5803
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,150
He does things like,

5804
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:23,421
you know,

5805
02:20:23,421 --> 02:20:23,870
like he'll,

5806
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:27,110
he'll shuffle in for the punches and
then the second time he shuffles out,

5807
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:28,550
he's throws a hard kick,

5808
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,211
you know?

5809
02:20:29,211 --> 02:20:32,610
Or he looks like he's going to do what
he just did and he goes for a takedown

5810
02:20:32,750 --> 02:20:33,171
mix.

5811
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:35,120
That shit up so well it mixing it up.

5812
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:36,990
Yeah.

5813
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:38,280
And you think that's all his coach,

5814
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:38,880
Huh?

5815
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:39,661
A big part of it,

5816
02:20:39,661 --> 02:20:39,840
Huh?

5817
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:40,680
Huge part of it.

5818
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:43,040
Very interesting now
because when they hit myth,

5819
02:20:43,050 --> 02:20:43,770
they do it.

5820
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:46,230
I'd love to watch those guys train to see.

5821
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:49,170
I loved his fight with Allavara.

5822
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:49,561
Charles,

5823
02:20:49,561 --> 02:20:51,240
all of your great fight.

5824
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:54,480
Oliveira very underrated guy dude.

5825
02:20:54,481 --> 02:20:55,081
What happened in gray?

5826
02:20:55,081 --> 02:20:55,914
Maynard?

5827
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:56,680
Uh,

5828
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:56,980
it's,

5829
02:20:56,980 --> 02:21:00,660
he got knocked out by a
couple different guys.

5830
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:03,000
Nate Diaz knocked him out.

5831
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,050
Um,

5832
02:21:04,050 --> 02:21:05,070
but you don't hear from him,

5833
02:21:05,071 --> 02:21:05,371
right?

5834
02:21:05,371 --> 02:21:07,770
You don't really hear that much lately.

5835
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,133
What's a grid?

5836
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,890
It's name that was going
to fight for the title.

5837
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:13,230
I'm just watching this.

5838
02:21:13,231 --> 02:21:16,110
I'm trying to pay attention
while I'm watching this man.

5839
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,180
Tj grant teacher grant
knocked them out to them.

5840
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:21,500
Their elbow standing elbow.

5841
02:21:22,450 --> 02:21:25,350
He's a few chaos and that was
after frank and knocked him out.

5842
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:28,230
So it was like finding a home man.

5843
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:29,970
Beautiful combinations by Frankie.

5844
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,370
The movement was just so good.

5845
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:33,940
He's not there for a recoil.

5846
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:37,170
Just ragdoll Bj to the ground there.

5847
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,720
Crazy.

5848
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:40,860
We just got to do something,

5849
02:21:40,861 --> 02:21:41,161
man.

5850
02:21:41,161 --> 02:21:45,630
He can't just lay here with him
in his guard like he's been doing

5851
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:48,573
okay.

5852
02:21:48,770 --> 02:21:49,101
Frankie.

5853
02:21:49,101 --> 02:21:50,150
Trying to pass again,

5854
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:52,580
like Bj so comfortable in this position,

5855
02:21:52,581 --> 02:21:54,200
but it's a terrible position for him.

5856
02:21:54,201 --> 02:21:57,470
It's almost bad that he's that comfortable
here because you're just losing the

5857
02:21:57,471 --> 02:21:58,370
fight can beat up.

5858
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:02,090
But it's so weird cause you know
he doesn't have an offensive guard.

5859
02:22:02,091 --> 02:22:04,520
He doesn't have a guard where
he's attacks off his back,

5860
02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:05,990
tries to lock up triangles.

5861
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:10,600
He's just impossible to pass
until Frankie's half past here.

5862
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,151
He's about to,

5863
02:22:11,151 --> 02:22:12,470
if he can clear that other foot,

5864
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,010
we'll look.

5865
02:22:13,010 --> 02:22:13,650
Nope.

5866
02:22:13,650 --> 02:22:16,250
Awesome dexterity is and credit recovery.

5867
02:22:16,310 --> 02:22:16,941
It really is.

5868
02:22:16,941 --> 02:22:17,660
I love seeing it.

5869
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:18,381
It is impressive.

5870
02:22:18,381 --> 02:22:21,140
But everyone else lives in this
like this is the most bullshit.

5871
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:24,140
[inaudible] smashing on more elbows,

5872
02:22:24,141 --> 02:22:24,771
more elbows,

5873
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:25,170
boom,

5874
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:25,471
boom,

5875
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:26,304
boom.

5876
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:28,530
How's Bj ob just cut bowed now.

5877
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:30,240
How's Bj gonna go?

5878
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:30,660
Always.

5879
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:31,830
He's lightened him up.

5880
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,290
He's like,

5881
02:22:32,290 --> 02:22:32,610
no mom.

5882
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,091
That's what you get.

5883
02:22:33,091 --> 02:22:33,750
That's nasty.

5884
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:34,583
Look at it.

5885
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:35,880
It's going into his eye now.

5886
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:37,390
I would be surprised if he hears corner.

5887
02:22:37,391 --> 02:22:38,224
You throw in the towel.

5888
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,930
You already dealing
with a legend like this.

5889
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:41,670
We'll get that blood.

5890
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:42,503
Oh Geez.

5891
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,280
That's the bloodiest who've ever seen Bj.

5892
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:45,863
Yes.

5893
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:48,420
He doesn't really cut a lot
when he's cutting a lot now.

5894
02:22:48,421 --> 02:22:52,370
Frankie keeps targeting that same
spot with elbows and beaches.

5895
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:54,090
Got Two more minutes of this to deal with.

5896
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:54,361
Oh,

5897
02:22:54,361 --> 02:22:55,650
another one on the same spot.

5898
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:57,090
All my goodness.

5899
02:22:57,091 --> 02:22:58,320
BJ's getting fucked up,

5900
02:22:58,321 --> 02:22:58,501
dude.

5901
02:22:58,501 --> 02:22:59,370
Herb Dean might stop.

5902
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:01,650
This fight is to get to look at the cup.

5903
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:03,353
Wow.

5904
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,670
Uh Damn man.

5905
02:23:06,290 --> 02:23:07,860
But he just doesn't have an answer.

5906
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:09,000
It does not have an answer.

5907
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:12,000
And Frankie's been saying,

5908
02:23:12,030 --> 02:23:12,661
Oh God,

5909
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:13,590
he's pounded on him.

5910
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,660
He's going to mountain view.

5911
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:18,990
He's got a crucifix or that fix
and Bj and finished and like that.

5912
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:20,430
They're just not going to happen.

5913
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:22,120
Getting hit in the head.

5914
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:22,560
Bang,

5915
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,000
Bang.

5916
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,060
Just don't just stop.

5917
02:23:24,070 --> 02:23:24,920
Other than that,

5918
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,610
he's pounding a man.

5919
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:29,040
What a Frankie submits them crazy.

5920
02:23:29,041 --> 02:23:29,970
What if he gets the mount?

5921
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:31,253
Yeah.

5922
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:32,103
Yup.

5923
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:33,961
Oh my God.

5924
02:23:33,961 --> 02:23:34,591
He's crushed.

5925
02:23:34,591 --> 02:23:37,800
He's going back to this butterfly
gardens doing nothing thing.

5926
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:40,050
Oh elbow and other one.

5927
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:41,490
He's getting worked.

5928
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:43,380
This is crazy to watch.

5929
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:46,140
This is not cool,

5930
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:47,311
frank.

5931
02:23:47,311 --> 02:23:48,270
He's a monster man.

5932
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:49,590
He is a monster.

5933
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:54,020
Look at him just fucking for
Roche's with these punches.

5934
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:54,670
Elbows.

5935
02:23:54,670 --> 02:23:56,010
Herb is going to stop the fight,

5936
02:23:56,011 --> 02:23:56,280
man.

5937
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:56,760
That's it.

5938
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:57,690
Holy Shit.

5939
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:58,471
That's it.

5940
02:23:58,471 --> 02:23:59,071
Bj Penn.

5941
02:23:59,071 --> 02:23:59,904
Wow.

5942
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:02,850
Frankie Edgar puts bi pan away.

5943
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:03,660
Wow.

5944
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:04,380
Wow.

5945
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:05,213
Look at that.

5946
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:07,380
That is crazy.

5947
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:09,421
Wow.

5948
02:24:09,421 --> 02:24:13,800
That was a route that it was a
three route was great for Frankie.

5949
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,200
Amazing performance.

5950
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:16,470
That's why he's a 10 to one favorite.

5951
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:19,200
I would guess ten one favorite.

5952
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:19,420
Yeah.

5953
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:20,700
Well the opening line,

5954
02:24:20,701 --> 02:24:20,851
I mean,

5955
02:24:20,851 --> 02:24:23,340
I don't know what it was when
the actual fight went down,

5956
02:24:23,341 --> 02:24:23,701
but man,

5957
02:24:23,701 --> 02:24:26,190
that's hard to watch our to watch.

5958
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:27,720
Hard to watch.

5959
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:28,981
It's crazy,

5960
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:29,640
man.

5961
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:31,020
They all go down,

5962
02:24:31,021 --> 02:24:31,441
man.

5963
02:24:31,441 --> 02:24:32,340
They all go to one.

5964
02:24:32,341 --> 02:24:35,370
Does hate to tell you your favorite
fighter that's going to happen to him one

5965
02:24:35,371 --> 02:24:37,620
day unless he gets out
before that happens.

5966
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:38,281
Yeah,

5967
02:24:38,281 --> 02:24:38,630
man,

5968
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:42,660
I hope that we've seen the
last of certain guys like GSP.

5969
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:44,160
I don't want to see him go down.

5970
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,560
I don't see Emerson go down like this.

5971
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:47,250
Nope.

5972
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:48,083
Yeah.

5973
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:48,930
Do you think it's going to,

5974
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:50,280
he's going to go down like this again.

5975
02:24:50,310 --> 02:24:52,620
You think Anderson's gonna
wind up fighting again?

5976
02:24:52,621 --> 02:24:53,490
If I need someone else,

5977
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:54,660
look at this boom,

5978
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:55,793
boom.

5979
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,450
Cause they're going to give him a fight.

5980
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,010
Probably be in his favor.

5981
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:03,300
He'll win that one and then you get some
demon who is not going to be down like

5982
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:03,541
that,

5983
02:25:03,541 --> 02:25:03,930
you know?

5984
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:04,061
Would,

5985
02:25:04,061 --> 02:25:05,880
do you remember when he was
coming out for the Wyman fight?

5986
02:25:05,881 --> 02:25:08,220
The second fight and he
paused during his walk.

5987
02:25:08,230 --> 02:25:08,761
He was weird.

5988
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:09,780
He got down on his knees.

5989
02:25:10,230 --> 02:25:11,040
He squatted.

5990
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,680
It was just like sat there like almost
like he's having a hard time breathing.

5991
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:15,130
Trying to keep it together.

5992
02:25:15,390 --> 02:25:16,260
Collect himself.

5993
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:17,130
Yeah.

5994
02:25:17,130 --> 02:25:18,900
Well just to fucking nerves man.

5995
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:21,840
Knowing that you're about to go in there
and against this dude is made out of

5996
02:25:21,841 --> 02:25:22,674
concrete.

5997
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,470
No.

5998
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:24,230
Tell me about

5999
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:24,460
it.

6000
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:25,360
Especially at heavyweight.

6001
02:25:25,361 --> 02:25:28,630
I feel like I'm not saying it but it is.

6002
02:25:28,631 --> 02:25:30,130
I am saying it's different heavyweights.

6003
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:33,060
Different cause they can crack it
with one shot because you're going in,

6004
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:33,461
you just like,

6005
02:25:33,461 --> 02:25:33,701
all right,

6006
02:25:33,701 --> 02:25:35,560
well this guy is 265 pounds.

6007
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:36,460
I literally,

6008
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:39,040
if I make an error it's over
and I'm going to get really,

6009
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:39,760
really hurt.

6010
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,241
So what have you.

6011
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:41,400
It's just different man.

6012
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:42,430
Like the nerves are different.

6013
02:25:42,431 --> 02:25:43,264
You're dealing with,

6014
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:44,523
that's scary.

6015
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:48,100
What's the guy that hit you the
hardest you think hardest in my life.

6016
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:49,240
You know,

6017
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:49,931
everyone says you know,

6018
02:25:49,931 --> 02:25:52,570
like Roy Nelson who I got knocked
out by hit me behind the ear.

6019
02:25:52,571 --> 02:25:53,620
So it wasn't that hard.

6020
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,120
A same with Nogueira.

6021
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:56,200
I would say

6022
02:25:58,770 --> 02:25:59,510
no,

6023
02:25:59,510 --> 02:25:59,860
no,

6024
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:01,180
that's the lightest I've ever been hidden.

6025
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:01,630
Went out.

6026
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:04,450
And the reason was I was sparring with
Shane Carmen the week before and got

6027
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:08,650
wobbled with a left hook or almost
knocked out basically and then fought.

6028
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:10,120
That's why that shut.

6029
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:10,983
Wow.

6030
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:13,450
Cause if you look Rothwell
really doesn't hit me that hard.

6031
02:26:13,451 --> 02:26:13,720
He's,

6032
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:17,500
I'm like flailing trying to put them away
and he just like clips me in the back

6033
02:26:17,501 --> 02:26:18,610
of the air and I'd fall down.

6034
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:20,410
I was rocked before that fight.

6035
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:21,250
Wow.

6036
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:22,300
That happens all the time.

6037
02:26:22,301 --> 02:26:22,511
Right.

6038
02:26:22,511 --> 02:26:23,140
All the time.

6039
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:24,520
And at heavyweight to different bird.

6040
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:25,031
Uh,

6041
02:26:25,031 --> 02:26:26,080
I would say who rocked me,

6042
02:26:26,081 --> 02:26:30,220
where I kept going would be probably
Lavar Jonathan hit me with the upper cut

6043
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:32,320
and it literally almost
ripped my lips off.

6044
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:34,570
Good Lord.

6045
02:26:34,810 --> 02:26:35,680
Who's a Banger,

6046
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:36,240
Huh?

6047
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:36,530
Yeah,

6048
02:26:36,530 --> 02:26:37,260
Bang.

6049
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:38,093
Hit.

6050
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:40,150
He was like put on this
earth to knock bitches out.

6051
02:26:40,190 --> 02:26:41,380
He's a strong motherfucker.

6052
02:26:41,470 --> 02:26:42,550
Might have been a boring fight,

6053
02:26:42,551 --> 02:26:44,980
but it put a rustling
clinic on his big ass.

6054
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,020
Positive for steroids.

6055
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,311
Yeah,

6056
02:26:48,311 --> 02:26:49,144
he did.

6057
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,591
Well that's it.

6058
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:51,610
Wrestling One oh one

6059
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:52,090
Andy,

6060
02:26:52,090 --> 02:26:53,400
the Bj Penn career.

6061
02:26:53,401 --> 02:26:53,641
Man.

6062
02:26:53,641 --> 02:26:55,740
I think we've seen the,

6063
02:26:55,860 --> 02:26:56,610
the end right.

6064
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:59,010
Well now I'm super depressed or him.

6065
02:26:59,620 --> 02:26:59,850
No,

6066
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:00,810
it wasn't fun to watch.

6067
02:27:00,811 --> 02:27:01,740
Was it cool to watch?

6068
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,140
I was on a high note.

6069
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:07,590
I was hoping it would be a competitive
fight that don't want to see that man.

6070
02:27:07,591 --> 02:27:08,790
That shit sucks.

6071
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:09,451
Yeah,

6072
02:27:09,451 --> 02:27:09,920
it was a,

6073
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,670
that was a whole lot
of bulletproof coffee.

6074
02:27:11,671 --> 02:27:13,440
Bj Penn Law got his ass whooped.

6075
02:27:13,441 --> 02:27:14,140
Thing of that.

6076
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:14,880
Yeah,

6077
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:15,301
I know.

6078
02:27:15,301 --> 02:27:15,810
I got this.

6079
02:27:15,810 --> 02:27:16,860
I got to sleep tonight.

6080
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,190
I want to zoom.

6081
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,320
Manny did some weird stuff.

6082
02:27:19,321 --> 02:27:20,154
I need sleep.

6083
02:27:20,850 --> 02:27:21,683
I need sleep,

6084
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:23,713
man.

6085
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:24,360
Ah,

6086
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:25,230
it's tough to watch.

6087
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:27,180
When I was a kid,

6088
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:27,990
um,

6089
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,560
I uh,

6090
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:29,580
watched Donald Curry,

6091
02:27:29,581 --> 02:27:31,770
who's a big fan of mine
fight Mike Mccallum.

6092
02:27:31,771 --> 02:27:32,670
You remember Mike Mccallum,

6093
02:27:32,671 --> 02:27:33,540
the body snatcher?

6094
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:34,200
No,

6095
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:34,800
you don't remember him?

6096
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:35,610
No.

6097
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:37,260
Middleweight champion bad mother fucker.

6098
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:38,071
And He,

6099
02:27:38,071 --> 02:27:43,071
Mike Mccallum hit Donald Curry with a
left hook to the body and then a left hook

6100
02:27:43,351 --> 02:27:45,480
and knock Donald Curry the fuck out.

6101
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:50,010
Donald Curry went out flat on
his back and I was so depressed.

6102
02:27:50,011 --> 02:27:52,020
I just put on my fucking
shoes and went running.

6103
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:53,551
It was cold.

6104
02:27:53,551 --> 02:27:54,001
I was like,

6105
02:27:54,001 --> 02:27:56,670
I was living in Boston
and ran down the street.

6106
02:27:56,870 --> 02:27:57,930
It's just running,

6107
02:27:57,931 --> 02:27:58,231
running.

6108
02:27:58,231 --> 02:27:58,981
I couldn't take it.

6109
02:27:58,981 --> 02:28:00,180
I was just so depressed.

6110
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:03,030
And then I remembered the
deciding at that moment,

6111
02:28:03,090 --> 02:28:05,910
I'm never going to get depressed
when a fighter loses ever again.

6112
02:28:05,911 --> 02:28:07,600
I'm never going to invest in.

6113
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:08,580
Let it affect you that way.

6114
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:09,000
That would,

6115
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:09,540
I can't,

6116
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:10,920
I can't let it affect me like that.

6117
02:28:10,921 --> 02:28:13,470
I remember deciding that
because I was so bombed out.

6118
02:28:13,471 --> 02:28:13,831
I took it.

6119
02:28:13,831 --> 02:28:14,670
So personally,

6120
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:16,500
that happens to a lot of people.

6121
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,910
It happens to me like when,

6122
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:18,870
when I found out,

6123
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:19,590
um,

6124
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:21,470
or loss to get the main
event against foot,

6125
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:22,160
I wouldn't run

6126
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:23,120
probably six miles.

6127
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:27,200
I get super stressed out and sad about
it because w that should have been me.

6128
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:28,370
I didn't know what to do,

6129
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:29,690
so I just went hit the gym running.

6130
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:32,840
Let's talk about that because
big foot's a weird situation man.

6131
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:36,020
Cause big foot has a real issue.

6132
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:39,050
Like he's got a tumor
on his pituitary gland.

6133
02:28:39,051 --> 02:28:43,890
He has giantism gigantism
I guess which made him um,

6134
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:47,680
I mean they had to give him one point
in time in his career is over 300 pounds

6135
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:49,160
and you've cut the 65.

6136
02:28:49,190 --> 02:28:49,341
Yeah,

6137
02:28:49,341 --> 02:28:50,870
we used to cut down to 65.

6138
02:28:50,871 --> 02:28:53,110
It was fucking enormous when shredded.

6139
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:56,900
Shredded when he fought our Lawsky
when he fought fade or month.

6140
02:28:57,220 --> 02:28:57,680
Yeah.

6141
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,271
Shred.

6142
02:28:58,271 --> 02:28:58,990
It was huge.

6143
02:28:58,990 --> 02:29:00,890
It was absolutely gigantic.

6144
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:02,240
When he fought Arlovski,

6145
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,200
he fought last game.

6146
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:03,860
Oh yeah.

6147
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:04,391
When they,

6148
02:29:04,391 --> 02:29:04,481
yeah.

6149
02:29:04,481 --> 02:29:07,360
They fought in Strikeforce or
it might've been the lead XC.

6150
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:08,270
It was a lead XC.

6151
02:29:08,330 --> 02:29:09,163
How did he do?

6152
02:29:09,630 --> 02:29:10,520
He won in a,

6153
02:29:10,521 --> 02:29:12,140
I think it was a controversial decision,

6154
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,940
but it was a good fight really.

6155
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:15,130
And he won.

6156
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:17,630
It might've been decisioned
but he won for sure.

6157
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:18,320
Hmm.

6158
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,153
Um,

6159
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:21,560
so big get that cut.

6160
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:22,490
My God,

6161
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:23,330
it was pretty bad.

6162
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:24,410
Crazy big foot.

6163
02:29:24,470 --> 02:29:26,210
Big Foot on those stuff though.

6164
02:29:26,211 --> 02:29:26,660
It does.

6165
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:28,280
Just because he has an issue,

6166
02:29:28,281 --> 02:29:31,070
doesn't make it okay that
he takes stuff because this,

6167
02:29:31,071 --> 02:29:32,660
this is why you want to make it fair.

6168
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:32,981
Say,

6169
02:29:32,981 --> 02:29:33,530
all right.

6170
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:35,540
[inaudible] you can take
whatever he's taken.

6171
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:36,810
Brian,

6172
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:39,860
that would be fair to my
problem with that of course,

6173
02:29:39,861 --> 02:29:40,880
is that when you,

6174
02:29:40,881 --> 02:29:41,500
um,

6175
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:41,900
so you know,

6176
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:44,540
ways to tell a guy and
they can take hormones,

6177
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:46,520
especially if you don't really need them.

6178
02:29:46,521 --> 02:29:47,091
Naturally.

6179
02:29:47,091 --> 02:29:47,300
If you,

6180
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,230
your body's healthy,

6181
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:51,200
you know you're going to fuck your
whole endocrine system of your systems,

6182
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:52,210
what's going on,

6183
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:53,043
right?

6184
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:54,013
Yes.

6185
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:55,490
It's a responsible,

6186
02:29:55,491 --> 02:30:00,410
at the same time you're fighting a guy
who was on different supplements to

6187
02:30:00,411 --> 02:30:01,640
enhance his fighting career,

6188
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:02,331
then you are,

6189
02:30:02,331 --> 02:30:03,560
and you can't do anything about it.

6190
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,100
Right.

6191
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:05,660
And she has a path to do this.

6192
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:06,411
Oh,

6193
02:30:06,411 --> 02:30:08,120
and they're fighting in Brazil.

6194
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:12,290
Weird in Brazil,

6195
02:30:12,291 --> 02:30:14,180
bigfoot in Brazil or lossy.

6196
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:15,170
This is not a gift.

6197
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,340
This is a punishment.

6198
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:19,340
Do you think that when
he gets down there that,

6199
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:19,701
I mean,

6200
02:30:19,701 --> 02:30:22,700
is it possible for big
foot to fight clean?

6201
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:23,660
That's the real question.

6202
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:24,050
Nope,

6203
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:24,830
not possible.

6204
02:30:24,830 --> 02:30:25,660
Not Possible.

6205
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:26,690
But with his condition,

6206
02:30:26,691 --> 02:30:27,081
stuff like that.

6207
02:30:27,081 --> 02:30:27,914
Not Possible.

6208
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:30,950
And he's been on his entire career and
they want to get them off your ranking in

6209
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:31,790
the top five.

6210
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:32,713
Good luck.

6211
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:33,853
Good luck.

6212
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:35,420
So what is the reason to fight in Brazil?

6213
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:36,710
So you think he's going to juice up?

6214
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:37,400
I think so.

6215
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:37,970
I'm wow.

6216
02:30:37,970 --> 02:30:38,480
Interesting.

6217
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:39,220
I think so.

6218
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:40,040
I Ellison if,

6219
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:41,810
and this is what I would
done if the UFC is said,

6220
02:30:41,811 --> 02:30:42,130
hey,

6221
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:43,580
why don't you fight big foot in Brazil?

6222
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,050
Say Listen,

6223
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:45,981
I'll fight big foot.

6224
02:30:45,981 --> 02:30:46,520
No problem.

6225
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,440
I want to fight him in Vegas,

6226
02:30:47,460 --> 02:30:50,000
California with the drug
testing strict were all right.

6227
02:30:50,001 --> 02:30:51,050
He doesn't need this stuff.

6228
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,651
That's fine.

6229
02:30:51,651 --> 02:30:52,400
That's fair game.

6230
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:53,520
However I want it regulated.

6231
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:56,600
I went random test to make sure he's not
overdoing it because that's what guys

6232
02:30:56,601 --> 02:30:57,260
are doing.

6233
02:30:57,260 --> 02:30:58,370
Let's be real here man.

6234
02:30:58,700 --> 02:30:59,540
Fuck that noise.

6235
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:00,081
Yeah.

6236
02:31:00,081 --> 02:31:01,680
Well what do you think about v torn now?

6237
02:31:01,681 --> 02:31:04,030
Cause vittores going to and
he's gonna get a tight shot.

6238
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:05,750
Weidman that ain't no picnic,

6239
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:06,330
bro.

6240
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:08,030
Whole him fighting Weidman.

6241
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:08,631
No.

6242
02:31:08,631 --> 02:31:10,610
Coming off the sauce and fighting Weidman.

6243
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:12,460
Have you seen the photos of Itar?

6244
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,300
I've seen video of him lately.

6245
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:14,631
No,

6246
02:31:14,631 --> 02:31:15,410
it does not look the same.

6247
02:31:15,410 --> 02:31:15,950
He does it.

6248
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:16,820
He does not look the same.

6249
02:31:16,821 --> 02:31:17,654
It looks much smaller.

6250
02:31:17,850 --> 02:31:18,683
He's again,

6251
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:19,591
probably get destroyed,

6252
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:20,280
man.

6253
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:20,491
Yeah.

6254
02:31:20,491 --> 02:31:22,010
It looks like you almost
can make welterweight.

6255
02:31:22,150 --> 02:31:22,620
Dang.

6256
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:23,310
Wow.

6257
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:24,143
Yeah.

6258
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:25,440
It takes a size nine shoe.

6259
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:26,610
He's got small hands and feet.

6260
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:27,090
Yeah.

6261
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:28,150
It's not the biggest guy in the world.

6262
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:31,180
He said a lot of broken hands because
of that and his wife is at time.

6263
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:33,631
Look at you.

6264
02:31:33,631 --> 02:31:34,464
Sorry man.

6265
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,943
Flow.

6266
02:31:36,410 --> 02:31:36,760
Yeah,

6267
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:37,201
I would,

6268
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:37,961
the big foot stuff it.

6269
02:31:37,961 --> 02:31:38,521
It's tough,

6270
02:31:38,521 --> 02:31:38,820
man.

6271
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:39,300
It's tough.

6272
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:39,841
It's almost,

6273
02:31:39,841 --> 02:31:40,740
you almost want to say,

6274
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:41,341
all right,

6275
02:31:41,341 --> 02:31:42,900
if you can't fight
without taking this stuff,

6276
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:44,100
she'll probably stop fighting.

6277
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:45,353
You know what I'm saying?

6278
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:46,530
It's not fair either.

6279
02:31:46,531 --> 02:31:48,030
We paint it even if he needs to stuff,

6280
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:50,010
it's not fair because the
other guys aren't on it.

6281
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:51,080
That mean,

6282
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:53,520
and that is the true not if
you can't fight without it,

6283
02:31:53,521 --> 02:31:57,750
you really should stop fighting because
a lot of the reasons why these people

6284
02:31:57,751 --> 02:32:02,751
need that stuff is because I had injuries
or cheating or he used to do steroids.

6285
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:04,330
He used to cheat whatever's.

6286
02:32:04,331 --> 02:32:08,910
The reason is if I fight bigfoot Silva
and he's all juiced up on ever cocktail

6287
02:32:08,911 --> 02:32:10,650
he has in Brazil that I'm not on,

6288
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:15,300
you punch me in the face and I suffered
horrible brain trauma because you were

6289
02:32:15,301 --> 02:32:18,690
sauced up or how about I
punched him as hard as I can.

6290
02:32:19,570 --> 02:32:20,340
Dude,

6291
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:23,970
there's about two guys in this world who
can take a Mark Hunt punch to the face.

6292
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:25,020
Roy Nelson,

6293
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:27,870
who he's fighting September
and big foot Silva juiced up,

6294
02:32:28,650 --> 02:32:32,130
only juiced up and he's not taking
his mate where his head is enormous.

6295
02:32:32,131 --> 02:32:33,660
So it probably helps
them Howard juiced up.

6296
02:32:33,661 --> 02:32:34,440
It's helping him.

6297
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:36,030
What's his kiss in the pocket with market?

6298
02:32:36,060 --> 02:32:36,331
No one,

6299
02:32:36,331 --> 02:32:36,710
this world.

6300
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:37,530
So for those two guys,

6301
02:32:37,530 --> 02:32:39,210
I wonder if it did help them,

6302
02:32:39,211 --> 02:32:40,200
because if you,

6303
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,430
if you know the whole story,

6304
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:45,090
hunt fought big foot and
they had this incredible war,

6305
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:48,120
but then it turns out they
tested big foot after the fight.

6306
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,400
He was on testosterone replacement,

6307
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:50,340
tested him before the fight.

6308
02:32:50,341 --> 02:32:51,480
He was at normal levels,

6309
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:54,150
tested them after the
fight Jack to the roof.

6310
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:56,100
So put some stuff in their locker room,

6311
02:32:56,101 --> 02:32:56,950
maybe allege,

6312
02:32:57,010 --> 02:32:58,200
and he blamed his most.

6313
02:32:58,310 --> 02:32:59,790
Doctor blamed his doctor,

6314
02:32:59,850 --> 02:33:00,630
which is crazy.

6315
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:01,860
It's doctor's gonna sue him.

6316
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:02,790
We said he was gonna sue them.

6317
02:33:02,791 --> 02:33:04,110
I don't know who knows
what the fuck happened,

6318
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:05,081
but either way,

6319
02:33:05,081 --> 02:33:06,780
the point is illegally took stuff.

6320
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:11,840
He definitely too much
elevated testosterone and he
definitely had a tremendous

6321
02:33:11,981 --> 02:33:14,360
ability to absorb punishment
that he didn't have.

6322
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:17,660
It didn't show in the Cormier fight
or can we put them white cane,

6323
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:18,503
put them away.

6324
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:21,840
Like Cain lit him up and dropped him and
put them away quick and their fight and

6325
02:33:21,841 --> 02:33:24,210
Mark Hunt hits harder than
both of them combined.

6326
02:33:24,211 --> 02:33:27,630
There's no one in this
heavyweight division that
hits harder than Mark Hunt in

6327
02:33:27,631 --> 02:33:28,050
the world.

6328
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:28,840
There's just not.

6329
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:31,050
Isn't that fascinating that
testosterone can do that for you?

6330
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:31,670
It's crazy.

6331
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:34,650
It's all you have to do is just go in
there with a hyper elevated levels.

6332
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:38,310
So take out the part that he has fucking
giant Dantic TISM you know what I'm

6333
02:33:38,311 --> 02:33:38,491
saying?

6334
02:33:38,491 --> 02:33:39,870
That he's an absolute monster,

6335
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:42,840
but now he can absorb punches.

6336
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:43,260
Yeah,

6337
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,420
and hit harder and better cardio.

6338
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:46,230
Fuck.

6339
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,740
If you're a,

6340
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:47,970
if you do an EPO and everything,

6341
02:33:47,971 --> 02:33:49,530
are you assuming he's also doing that?

6342
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:54,090
I don't know if you're
open to this cocktail,

6343
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:57,620
if you love your [inaudible],

6344
02:33:58,140 --> 02:33:59,460
whatever that is.

6345
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:00,930
I don't do anything.

6346
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:01,561
No,

6347
02:34:01,561 --> 02:34:03,690
I think you're on that is he had
to bring him back to himself.

6348
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:04,840
That is the question.

6349
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:05,260
It's like,

6350
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,790
Jeff,

6351
02:34:05,790 --> 02:34:07,260
how many guys are,

6352
02:34:07,290 --> 02:34:08,910
how many guys are on things?

6353
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:10,110
If you,

6354
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:13,500
if you're open to put these
supplements in your body,

6355
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:15,990
why wouldn't you be open to putting
these other supplements here?

6356
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:17,200
But of course not just like,

6357
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:17,711
well,

6358
02:34:17,711 --> 02:34:19,540
I'll do this when I got
to stay at this limit,

6359
02:34:19,541 --> 02:34:19,871
and they're like,

6360
02:34:19,871 --> 02:34:19,991
well,

6361
02:34:19,991 --> 02:34:20,531
if you do this,

6362
02:34:20,531 --> 02:34:21,730
you're really going to be a Badass.

6363
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:22,271
No,

6364
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:24,040
that's just ethically wrong.

6365
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:26,020
If you're putting a needle in your ass,

6366
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:28,120
what do you care if it's
filled half way or full?

6367
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:28,890
You know what I'm saying?

6368
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:29,723
It's true.

6369
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:30,161
Yeah.

6370
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:30,821
That is true.

6371
02:34:30,821 --> 02:34:31,654
I mean,

6372
02:34:31,690 --> 02:34:32,710
a guy like chill,

6373
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:34,150
I mean that's pretty much proves it.

6374
02:34:34,410 --> 02:34:34,751
You know,

6375
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:36,640
chill had his reasons why he said that.

6376
02:34:36,641 --> 02:34:39,850
He took those first two supplements and
then it turns out that they have this

6377
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:45,120
incredibly detailed testing that Lorenzo
pays for that's $45,000 per fighter and

6378
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:48,850
they're taking this,

6379
02:34:48,850 --> 02:34:49,661
this is a crazy thing,

6380
02:34:49,661 --> 02:34:50,410
they're taking the drug,

6381
02:34:50,410 --> 02:34:51,250
they take the blood,

6382
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:55,540
rather they'd take a test from you
and then the guy has a direct chain of

6383
02:34:55,541 --> 02:34:56,290
custody.

6384
02:34:56,290 --> 02:35:00,520
So he's taking this flying with his blood
to the place where they're testing it

6385
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:01,990
and there he's like a notary.

6386
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:03,220
Yeah.

6387
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:05,950
Well it was basically like the guy
carrying the fucking nuclear codes,

6388
02:35:06,220 --> 02:35:06,431
you know,

6389
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:09,070
he's flying with it in his
possession at all times,

6390
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:11,830
gets to the lab so it's
never left his possession.

6391
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:13,990
And then they test it and you know,

6392
02:35:13,991 --> 02:35:18,460
they tested on shale got busted
for all that stone EPO and HGH,

6393
02:35:18,461 --> 02:35:19,990
which the athletic commissions,

6394
02:35:19,991 --> 02:35:22,320
we're not testing for it because
it's fucking expensive as shit.

6395
02:35:22,370 --> 02:35:22,780
Yeah.

6396
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:25,750
If they had to look for fires
getting paid eight grand,

6397
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:30,650
eight and eight eight to win the show
and it's cost $45,000 to test him.

6398
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:32,110
Something is crazy.

6399
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,360
That's why only the superstars
in you taught cause you're,

6400
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:35,950
you're paying the suicides so much money.

6401
02:35:35,951 --> 02:35:37,360
It's worth it to risk it.

6402
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:38,590
Is it worth it now?

6403
02:35:38,620 --> 02:35:43,030
Cause now we just lost one of the biggest
faces to the UFC who could talk people

6404
02:35:43,031 --> 02:35:44,230
into liking the UFC?

6405
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:45,880
Yeah.

6406
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:46,631
Is it though?

6407
02:35:46,631 --> 02:35:47,620
But it's worth it.

6408
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:49,390
Well what is not the only one?

6409
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:49,960
No,

6410
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:50,781
it's like baseball.

6411
02:35:50,781 --> 02:35:51,550
When people freak out,

6412
02:35:51,550 --> 02:35:52,780
mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,

6413
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:54,430
you dumb fucks.

6414
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:55,720
All the pitchers were on it.

6415
02:35:56,020 --> 02:35:57,370
So it's a fair game.

6416
02:35:57,460 --> 02:35:58,330
Lance Armstrong,

6417
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,111
listen,

6418
02:35:59,111 --> 02:36:00,310
when he tested positive,

6419
02:36:00,490 --> 02:36:03,670
they have to go back to 15th place to
find a guy who didn't test positive.

6420
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:05,200
It's a level playing field.

6421
02:36:05,201 --> 02:36:06,250
If everyone's on it,

6422
02:36:06,251 --> 02:36:06,820
you fucks.

6423
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:07,620
You know what I'm saying?

6424
02:36:07,620 --> 02:36:08,201
Sort of.

6425
02:36:08,201 --> 02:36:09,640
But it's chronic.

6426
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:10,660
Well it's like,

6427
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:13,000
especially in combat sports
like well it's dangerous.

6428
02:36:13,001 --> 02:36:14,920
Well so's getting punched in the face,

6429
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:15,700
you know,

6430
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:17,010
that's pretty dangerous too.

6431
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:17,860
Super Dangerous.

6432
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:18,850
It keeps your career.

6433
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:20,470
You can fight longer,

6434
02:36:20,471 --> 02:36:21,580
you can play longer.

6435
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:22,451
You know,

6436
02:36:22,451 --> 02:36:24,010
you're not hitting a
fast ball off your bat.

6437
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:26,080
Speed slows down a lot of
times in the major leagues.

6438
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:30,400
But you can make 20 more million dollars
in play for five years if you take some

6439
02:36:30,401 --> 02:36:30,950
stuff's signed.

6440
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:31,990
Bron Ryan Braun,

6441
02:36:31,991 --> 02:36:33,250
Leo got busted and then ratted.

6442
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,030
How to everyone say how he was against.

6443
02:36:35,031 --> 02:36:37,210
So that gave me an $144 million.

6444
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:39,040
Went to fucking Costa Rico.

6445
02:36:39,041 --> 02:36:39,760
I was suspended.

6446
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:40,211
Came back.

6447
02:36:40,211 --> 02:36:40,850
He's fine.

6448
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:41,140
Yeah,

6449
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:42,340
and I do it.

6450
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:47,080
Why didn't you stay in deep and coach
[inaudible] hundred 40 million in the

6451
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:47,914
bank?

6452
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:48,880
Everyone forgets.

6453
02:36:48,881 --> 02:36:51,400
He got a standing ovation when
he went back to Milwaukee.

6454
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:51,840
Really?

6455
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:52,301
That guy,

6456
02:36:52,301 --> 02:36:53,530
he's back.

6457
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:54,513
Hey guys.

6458
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:58,270
Took a year off recuperating
my body rich as shit.

6459
02:36:59,110 --> 02:36:59,750
And you stay,

6460
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:00,610
you stay injury free.

6461
02:37:01,310 --> 02:37:01,880
Guaranteed.

6462
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:02,050
Yeah,

6463
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:03,220
he made it guaranteed.

6464
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:05,920
So they don't take any of that away from
you and you test positive for drugs and

6465
02:37:05,921 --> 02:37:06,641
robbing your friend.

6466
02:37:06,641 --> 02:37:07,740
Maybe like 10 millions.

6467
02:37:07,750 --> 02:37:08,860
Who gives a fuck?

6468
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:12,490
That's so gross though,

6469
02:37:12,491 --> 02:37:13,180
isn't it?

6470
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:13,451
That's,

6471
02:37:13,451 --> 02:37:13,661
you know,

6472
02:37:13,661 --> 02:37:15,100
that's an issue with change as well.

6473
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:16,670
They're bringing in the federal guys,

6474
02:37:16,671 --> 02:37:18,200
so they're going to ask him questions.

6475
02:37:18,201 --> 02:37:19,220
Where'd you get the Epo?

6476
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:20,360
Especially EPO.

6477
02:37:20,361 --> 02:37:21,560
That is a motherfucker.

6478
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:22,341
That's a super,

6479
02:37:22,341 --> 02:37:23,630
super illegal thing.

6480
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:24,680
Yeah,

6481
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,513
you have that.

6482
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:27,230
It's not good man EPO,

6483
02:37:27,231 --> 02:37:27,921
HGH.

6484
02:37:27,921 --> 02:37:30,650
Testosterone is normal.

6485
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:33,320
Like you could find that EPO is tricky.

6486
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:33,890
That's soup.

6487
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:34,940
It's very dangerous.

6488
02:37:34,941 --> 02:37:36,710
I say nobody went to
jail for taking steroids,

6489
02:37:36,711 --> 02:37:38,210
but you go to jail for lying to the feds.

6490
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:40,260
Go to jail for lying on,

6491
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:44,280
goes to jail for lying and you go to jail
for selling it and mass distribution.

6492
02:37:44,850 --> 02:37:47,240
It's going to be really interesting
to see what happens with Shell.

6493
02:37:47,241 --> 02:37:47,481
I mean,

6494
02:37:47,481 --> 02:37:48,890
I don't know where the
fuck he got it from,

6495
02:37:48,891 --> 02:37:49,611
but Brian,

6496
02:37:49,611 --> 02:37:52,360
Stan was talking about it like you know
that he had a conversation with shale.

6497
02:37:52,361 --> 02:37:52,671
He's like,

6498
02:37:52,671 --> 02:37:55,490
you better be forthcoming when they
come to you and they ask you questions.

6499
02:37:55,700 --> 02:37:56,990
That is where you can't lie to them.

6500
02:37:56,991 --> 02:37:57,381
Listen,

6501
02:37:57,381 --> 02:37:58,790
if Brian Stan tells me something,

6502
02:37:58,791 --> 02:38:00,020
as far as the government goes,

6503
02:38:00,021 --> 02:38:02,660
I'm for sure he's listening
because I'm definitely,

6504
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:04,050
I'm calling a sir.

6505
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:04,730
Yes sir.

6506
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:05,510
Yes sir.

6507
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:06,081
Why are you calling me,

6508
02:38:06,081 --> 02:38:06,800
sir?

6509
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:07,760
I'm really freaked out.

6510
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:12,010
Can you just come back to
my hotel room and talk to,

6511
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,910
if I had to ask you,

6512
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:13,760
talk me to sleep.

6513
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:16,070
You're the inside guy
here more than any of us.

6514
02:38:16,071 --> 02:38:16,400
Right.

6515
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:17,480
If I had to ask you,

6516
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:19,070
how many guys do you think,

6517
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,230
what percentage guys are taking HGH?

6518
02:38:23,570 --> 02:38:24,440
There's a headline.

6519
02:38:24,441 --> 02:38:24,961
You'd be tomorrow.

6520
02:38:24,961 --> 02:38:25,510
Okay,

6521
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,910
thanks.

6522
02:38:25,910 --> 02:38:27,090
Everyone's on shit.

6523
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:27,620
I'm just going.

6524
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:28,260
This is a fight.

6525
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:29,750
Bigfoot only in Denver.

6526
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:30,810
I'm just going to say some,

6527
02:38:30,811 --> 02:38:34,970
not some numbers and you just give me
facial expressions that don't necessarily

6528
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:36,890
deny.

6529
02:38:36,890 --> 02:38:37,630
Okay.

6530
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:42,590
I'm 60% 70% wow.

6531
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:43,550
We're going to stop there.

6532
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:44,360
I don't want to,

6533
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,140
it's amazing.

6534
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:45,860
I don't even,

6535
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:46,640
yeah,

6536
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:46,881
like,

6537
02:38:46,881 --> 02:38:47,091
like,

6538
02:38:47,091 --> 02:38:48,070
like when I thought Lavard,

6539
02:38:48,071 --> 02:38:48,831
John's for instance,

6540
02:38:48,831 --> 02:38:51,170
we went on the scales and we get off.

6541
02:38:51,171 --> 02:38:52,970
I turned my coach and he'll come on Bro.

6542
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:56,840
Because obviously on stuff I just
assumed like everyone's like bro,

6543
02:38:56,841 --> 02:38:57,610
he's jacked.

6544
02:38:57,610 --> 02:38:58,130
They're like,

6545
02:38:58,130 --> 02:38:58,521
yeah,

6546
02:38:58,521 --> 02:38:59,240
I know.

6547
02:38:59,240 --> 02:38:59,481
Yeah.

6548
02:38:59,481 --> 02:39:01,880
Well literally I just assume he's on shit.

6549
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:03,140
I assume he's on HGH.

6550
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:04,730
I assume he was on testosterone,

6551
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:04,930
right?

6552
02:39:04,930 --> 02:39:06,290
It's just part of the game we play,

6553
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:08,360
which is fucking insane.

6554
02:39:08,650 --> 02:39:12,680
Cause he hit me with like this 30%
outbreak cut and I was like in La La land

6555
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:15,140
almost ripped my fucking lips off 30%.

6556
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:15,920
30%.

6557
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:18,110
Cause he kind of went with it.

6558
02:39:18,250 --> 02:39:18,680
Right.

6559
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:19,220
You know what I'm saying?

6560
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:21,230
That thing lands my jaws all shattered.

6561
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:25,340
I'm fucking Kanye West style talk
like slurping my dinner and shit.

6562
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:25,790
What happened?

6563
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:27,860
A Kanye West was a crotch shot I think.

6564
02:39:27,861 --> 02:39:28,191
Right?

6565
02:39:28,191 --> 02:39:29,850
And broke his jaw or some was it?

6566
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:33,620
I just figure a gangster shot I made,

6567
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:34,671
I assumed,

6568
02:39:34,671 --> 02:39:37,220
I assumed he wears like
Gucci loafers and Shit.

6569
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:38,450
This guy gangster.

6570
02:39:38,680 --> 02:39:39,170
I don't know.

6571
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:40,003
Sports are crazy.

6572
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:40,873
Listen,

6573
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,630
this is,

6574
02:39:41,630 --> 02:39:42,620
it's just not the UFC.

6575
02:39:42,621 --> 02:39:44,090
We're talking about like the UFC prom.

6576
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:45,530
This is everything.

6577
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,690
And watch the NFL network.

6578
02:39:47,691 --> 02:39:49,150
The bottom of screen goes black.

6579
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:49,940
Uh,

6580
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:53,240
Jordan Dixon gets spent for
enhancing performance enhancers.

6581
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:54,021
It happens all the time,

6582
02:39:54,021 --> 02:39:55,190
but they don't make a big deal of it.

6583
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:56,600
This like literally,

6584
02:39:56,630 --> 02:39:57,463
you don't hear about it.

6585
02:39:57,470 --> 02:40:00,470
You didn't hear balance sports center
when no one gets tested more than combat

6586
02:40:00,471 --> 02:40:00,951
athletes,

6587
02:40:00,951 --> 02:40:01,880
but the,

6588
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:03,920
they make such a big deal of it.

6589
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:04,940
Well here's these other sports.

6590
02:40:04,941 --> 02:40:08,510
They don't because if you're better
because of performance enhancing drugs,

6591
02:40:08,570 --> 02:40:10,370
you're better performing by,

6592
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:11,810
you're better at hitting a ball.

6593
02:40:12,050 --> 02:40:13,440
You're better at throwing a ball.

6594
02:40:13,441 --> 02:40:14,274
You're better at,

6595
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:14,790
you know,

6596
02:40:14,790 --> 02:40:15,810
doing sports,

6597
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:19,500
but you're not better at beating the
fuck at a person and causing damage to

6598
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:19,770
their

6599
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:22,730
brain and definitely taking
years off their life.

6600
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:23,090
Yeah,

6601
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:24,860
we saw a rod last night in Vegas.

6602
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:28,930
I'm a fan and I've always liked to
have had a couple of gals with him.

6603
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:30,350
Looks like he's having a good old time.

6604
02:40:30,351 --> 02:40:31,130
What the fuck?

6605
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:34,760
This guy was at the bar to blonde die
pieces who I was going to go up to and

6606
02:40:34,761 --> 02:40:35,720
kind of snag myself.

6607
02:40:35,721 --> 02:40:35,991
Good thing.

6608
02:40:35,991 --> 02:40:37,670
And I did it because they might away.

6609
02:40:37,671 --> 02:40:39,270
They'd be like away,

6610
02:40:39,970 --> 02:40:40,880
fuck out of here,

6611
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:41,390
you know,

6612
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:42,021
kind of money.

6613
02:40:42,021 --> 02:40:42,930
And he runs penis.

6614
02:40:44,120 --> 02:40:45,150
He's in the suite.

6615
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:45,360
Oh,

6616
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:46,041
I'm the seller.

6617
02:40:46,041 --> 02:40:46,461
I'm sorry,

6618
02:40:46,461 --> 02:40:47,294
I'm down below.

6619
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:48,440
I'm down below in New York,

6620
02:40:48,441 --> 02:40:48,741
New York.

6621
02:40:48,741 --> 02:40:49,574
Literally in the subway.

6622
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:50,061
I tell you,

6623
02:40:50,061 --> 02:40:51,050
if I was a rod out of a,

6624
02:40:51,051 --> 02:40:51,980
hey girls here,

6625
02:40:52,010 --> 02:40:52,843
my eyes are up here.

6626
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:53,530
Look at me.

6627
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:58,530
They did have the hungry eyes
for big brown [inaudible].

6628
02:41:00,340 --> 02:41:01,490
Your girls were looking,

6629
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:01,821
well,

6630
02:41:01,821 --> 02:41:02,810
let's talk about that.

6631
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:04,200
There's a difference.

6632
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:08,270
There's a difference between the dictate
an athlete and a fighter when when

6633
02:41:08,271 --> 02:41:09,290
there's a bunch of athletes,

6634
02:41:09,291 --> 02:41:12,980
but then the fighter walks in the room
that the stakes have been changed for

6635
02:41:12,990 --> 02:41:13,281
sure.

6636
02:41:13,281 --> 02:41:14,840
I have a male in the house.

6637
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:17,211
Cool.

6638
02:41:17,211 --> 02:41:18,410
You hit a little white ball.

6639
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:19,273
That's awesome.

6640
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:20,730
I'll snap your fucking neck.

6641
02:41:22,490 --> 02:41:23,420
I wish I could say that.

6642
02:41:23,421 --> 02:41:23,661
I'll,

6643
02:41:23,661 --> 02:41:27,200
I'll snap your neck and then fucked his
two girls you brought yet and you can't

6644
02:41:27,201 --> 02:41:28,070
do anything about it.

6645
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:28,820
Brian.

6646
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:31,520
I wish I could you tell
us like feet or toes.

6647
02:41:32,270 --> 02:41:33,031
Shoes right now.

6648
02:41:33,031 --> 02:41:35,840
His toes curl it up and
not the Boston red sox.

6649
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:37,070
Motherfucker old snap your neck.

6650
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:37,933
Take your girls.

6651
02:41:38,300 --> 02:41:43,300
Is there a single like sport that commands
more respect in that night and close

6652
02:41:43,350 --> 02:41:44,210
and even boxing,

6653
02:41:44,211 --> 02:41:45,200
right clothes,

6654
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:46,160
nice clothes.

6655
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:48,470
Cause MMA people really
can't even like what?

6656
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:49,910
Well look at fucking Floyd Mayweather.

6657
02:41:49,911 --> 02:41:53,180
He's can compared to Ronda Rousey and
everybody says Rhonda Rousey would beat

6658
02:41:53,181 --> 02:41:53,961
his ass in a street.

6659
02:41:53,961 --> 02:41:54,800
Beat the shit out of everyone.

6660
02:41:56,210 --> 02:41:58,730
I really did 100% she would
look at that last fight.

6661
02:41:58,910 --> 02:41:59,570
I look at Port,

6662
02:41:59,570 --> 02:42:00,580
I'm not mad at Bj's girl.

6663
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:01,671
She's very pretty.

6664
02:42:01,671 --> 02:42:02,660
But look at Port Bj,

6665
02:42:02,661 --> 02:42:03,021
man,

6666
02:42:03,021 --> 02:42:03,854
that is wrong.

6667
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:04,981
And she looked at Bj.

6668
02:42:04,981 --> 02:42:05,814
I looked at his girl.

6669
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:06,803
Oh man,

6670
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:08,030
it's hard to watch,

6671
02:42:08,031 --> 02:42:08,710
man,

6672
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:09,050
man.

6673
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:09,883
I love that guy.

6674
02:42:10,610 --> 02:42:11,350
Hard to watch,

6675
02:42:11,350 --> 02:42:11,780
man.

6676
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:12,051
You know?

6677
02:42:12,051 --> 02:42:13,760
And I just got to go home
to his kids like that.

6678
02:42:13,761 --> 02:42:16,610
I mean that was something that he said
when he fought Nick Diaz and I was

6679
02:42:16,611 --> 02:42:17,180
talking to him.

6680
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:17,421
He's like,

6681
02:42:17,421 --> 02:42:19,190
I can't keep calling home to my children.

6682
02:42:19,191 --> 02:42:19,881
But then like this,

6683
02:42:19,881 --> 02:42:20,511
that's a beast,

6684
02:42:20,511 --> 02:42:20,691
man.

6685
02:42:20,691 --> 02:42:21,560
He's just scared of me.

6686
02:42:21,561 --> 02:42:22,394
You know?

6687
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:23,660
Dan called me a once again.

6688
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:24,800
I hate when I lose.

6689
02:42:24,801 --> 02:42:27,100
I hate being around my
neighbors even link Dan cy,

6690
02:42:27,101 --> 02:42:28,320
man did they talk to me,

6691
02:42:28,330 --> 02:42:29,240
hate my neighbors,

6692
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:31,460
but I walk in,

6693
02:42:31,461 --> 02:42:31,941
I'm like,

6694
02:42:31,941 --> 02:42:33,380
fuck sorry bro,

6695
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:35,330
I can't stand my neighbors.

6696
02:42:35,380 --> 02:42:36,390
That's hilarious.

6697
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:38,073
Really.

6698
02:42:38,110 --> 02:42:38,943
What's it about?

6699
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:42,760
Because they're 50 and act like they're
30 and they party and do drugs and keep

6700
02:42:42,761 --> 02:42:43,780
me up when I'm in camp.

6701
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:44,913
Oh No

6702
02:42:45,070 --> 02:42:46,030
guy knows who I am.

6703
02:42:46,031 --> 02:42:46,541
You know what I'm saying?

6704
02:42:46,541 --> 02:42:46,691
Like,

6705
02:42:46,691 --> 02:42:47,500
come on Bro.

6706
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:48,880
I just talked about snapping a rods.

6707
02:42:48,881 --> 02:42:49,151
Nick,

6708
02:42:49,151 --> 02:42:50,200
what do you think you'll do to you?

6709
02:42:50,590 --> 02:42:52,960
They're 50 and they party all night.

6710
02:42:52,990 --> 02:42:53,890
Party do drugs,

6711
02:42:53,891 --> 02:42:55,480
coke banging on the walls.

6712
02:42:55,570 --> 02:42:57,280
They yell at me when I Bang on the walls.

6713
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:58,421
I'm moving out of there.

6714
02:42:58,421 --> 02:42:59,021
By the way though,

6715
02:42:59,021 --> 02:43:01,870
things are moving up and all.

6716
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:03,250
My place is super nice dog.

6717
02:43:03,251 --> 02:43:04,330
My plates is Super Nice.

6718
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:05,381
It's super nice,

6719
02:43:05,381 --> 02:43:06,710
but they're just whatever there,

6720
02:43:06,850 --> 02:43:07,360
I don't know.

6721
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:09,070
They see you guys banging on
the walls with each other.

6722
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,050
I Bang on the walls and she yells at me.

6723
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:11,831
All right,

6724
02:43:11,831 --> 02:43:11,980
I

6725
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,813
hear you.

6726
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:14,560
I'll turn it down.

6727
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:16,330
Cheeto fingers.

6728
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:17,171
I went over there.

6729
02:43:17,171 --> 02:43:18,220
I gave him a motivational talk.

6730
02:43:18,221 --> 02:43:19,054
It didn't work.

6731
02:43:19,290 --> 02:43:20,710
He gave him a motivational talk.

6732
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:24,310
How they clean their life up and
stop being Cheetos could get a job.

6733
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:26,570
No,

6734
02:43:26,570 --> 02:43:27,090
I do though.

6735
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:27,923
I'll do that.

6736
02:43:28,410 --> 02:43:32,370
49 95 I'll come to your house with cheeto
fingers when you're in mid camp and

6737
02:43:32,371 --> 02:43:35,400
you're fucking training your ass
off and you're constantly exhausted.

6738
02:43:35,401 --> 02:43:36,330
Constantly pushing it.

6739
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:37,800
Do you look at this like,

6740
02:43:37,801 --> 02:43:38,790

6742
02:43:40,141 --> 02:43:43,050
there's only a certain amount
of years I can do this.

6743
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:43,351
No,

6744
02:43:43,351 --> 02:43:45,840
I don't just think once you start
thinking that you're fucked,

6745
02:43:45,930 --> 02:43:47,460
I think you're right because they told me,

6746
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:48,120

6747
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:48,601
I've heard about it.

6748
02:43:48,601 --> 02:43:49,470
I'm not gonna mention names.

6749
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:54,460
Fellow heavyweight was going through
camp recently and was like fuck this man,

6750
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:55,294

6751
02:43:55,870 --> 02:43:56,501
Guess who?

6752
02:43:56,501 --> 02:43:57,880
Guess who doesn't say that in camp?

6753
02:43:57,881 --> 02:43:58,714

02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:04,570
I'm just like fuck I gotta do this.

6759
02:44:04,571 --> 02:44:05,081

6760
02:44:05,081 --> 02:44:05,441
I do this.

6761
02:44:05,441 --> 02:44:06,820
I constantly think how I can get better.

6762
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:08,680
You are very self motivated so you know,

6763
02:44:08,681 --> 02:44:09,171
and I go,

6764
02:44:09,171 --> 02:44:10,390

02:44:16,611 --> 02:44:17,720

6769
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:20,090
someone's going to yell at you while
you're fucking getting your ass whooped.

6770
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:20,920
You don't want that.

6771
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:23,380
You know what else is self
motivated Brian Cowen.

6772
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:23,891
That's right.

6773
02:44:23,891 --> 02:44:26,890
Listen gentlemen pretends to work out.

6774
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:31,300
It does boxing going Chin ups,

6775
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,473

6776
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:33,920
man.

6777
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:34,750
Life's crazy.

6778
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:37,470
Runs up the hill and gets tired.

6779
02:44:38,660 --> 02:44:39,493
That's it guys.

6780
02:44:39,700 --> 02:44:40,533
I'm going to,

6781
02:44:40,570 --> 02:44:41,403
I'm going to go to bed.

6782
02:44:41,530 --> 02:44:42,363
Get up early.

6783
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:42,791
Oh yeah.

6784
02:44:42,791 --> 02:44:43,561
What time are you working on?

6785
02:44:43,561 --> 02:44:44,560
Right into my meditation.

6786
02:44:44,561 --> 02:44:46,900
Read Nietzsche reteaching.

6787
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,650
No,

6788
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:48,011
no,

6789
02:44:48,011 --> 02:44:49,090
not as like the way it sounds.

6790
02:44:49,540 --> 02:44:51,610
It's a good thing to say to
chicks and we trust the press.

6791
02:44:51,630 --> 02:44:52,920
Him Get into my horse stance.

6792
02:44:52,930 --> 02:44:53,860
It's a classic story.

6793
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,390
First time I ever went to Brian's house,

6794
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:56,830
he had like some fucking,

6795
02:44:56,831 --> 02:45:00,400
the catcher in the rye or some
shit open on his coffee table.

6796
02:45:00,401 --> 02:45:00,581
I go,

6797
02:45:00,581 --> 02:45:01,570
you don't read that?

6798
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:02,010
I go,

6799
02:45:02,010 --> 02:45:02,950
you're putting that out there.

6800
02:45:02,951 --> 02:45:04,390
When chicks come over to impress him.

6801
02:45:04,391 --> 02:45:04,751
He was like,

6802
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:05,584
you're right.

6803
02:45:05,830 --> 02:45:06,611
I tell a story about that.

6804
02:45:06,611 --> 02:45:08,600
My standup just laying books
around like I was going.

6805
02:45:08,860 --> 02:45:09,790
She was like really smart.

6806
02:45:09,791 --> 02:45:10,451
She went to Princeton.

6807
02:45:10,451 --> 02:45:10,990
I was like,

6808
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:11,650
oh look,

6809
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:12,430
Hemingway.

6810
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:12,790
I Dunno.

6811
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:14,430
I guess her read it so
you when I'm not in,

6812
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,660
are you reading the
dictionary when I'm not on TV?

6813
02:45:16,661 --> 02:45:19,380
I read Hemingway trying to be God.

6814
02:45:19,390 --> 02:45:21,340
The things I picked up in a book,

6815
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:22,600
something I've picked up in a book.

6816
02:45:22,601 --> 02:45:23,770
Kids cause I'm white.

6817
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:24,401
W H I.

6818
02:45:24,401 --> 02:45:26,800
T do you ever read books about training?

6819
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:27,590
About like,

6820
02:45:27,590 --> 02:45:28,990
like mental toughness?

6821
02:45:30,470 --> 02:45:31,303
A lot of people,

6822
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,691
yeah,

6823
02:45:31,691 --> 02:45:33,340
I read a lot of like mental books,

6824
02:45:33,390 --> 02:45:34,330
a mental toughness.

6825
02:45:34,331 --> 02:45:36,130
I read a lot of like um,

6826
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:39,790
military stuff really because
if you can pitch it out,

6827
02:45:39,791 --> 02:45:41,230
military guys like navy seals,

6828
02:45:41,231 --> 02:45:43,270
what they go through in
the mindframe they get in.

6829
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:46,030
What we do is nothing compared to them.

6830
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:46,330
Right.

6831
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,440
You've got to think about the nerves,

6832
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:50,500
the navy seals dealing with before they
go into war and they talked about the

6833
02:45:50,501 --> 02:45:52,240
breathing technique and
the mentality they have,

6834
02:45:52,241 --> 02:45:56,020
especially when they're going through
like bootcamp and the navy seal selection,

6835
02:45:56,021 --> 02:45:57,700
which is insane because one,

6836
02:45:57,701 --> 02:46:02,701
I have like 99 makes the cut and
seeing the guys who make it and the,

6837
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:06,430
the guys who run it say they can
always tell who's going to make it.

6838
02:46:06,431 --> 02:46:07,690
Cause I guess they talked to them,

6839
02:46:07,691 --> 02:46:09,790
interview them after each day and the one,

6840
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:10,940
you know guys be like,

6841
02:46:11,150 --> 02:46:11,870
yeah man,

6842
02:46:11,870 --> 02:46:13,240
there's only three weeks left Africa.

6843
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:15,080
If I can just get through
these three weeks.

6844
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:17,150
They see when they go acts
of the room like he's fucked,

6845
02:46:17,151 --> 02:46:17,984
he's not going to make it.

6846
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:19,730
Then another guy comes in
the room and he's like,

6847
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:21,260
I'm just trying to get
through tomorrow man.

6848
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:22,300
I'm just trying to get through tomorrow.

6849
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:24,590
I literally take it one at a time.

6850
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:24,951
I go,

6851
02:46:24,951 --> 02:46:26,660
just get through this drill
and take the next drill.

6852
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:26,810
Yeah,

6853
02:46:26,810 --> 02:46:29,360
and it's the same thing in
fighting and that that's what I do.

6854
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:31,820
I had never look at the
grand scheme of things.

6855
02:46:31,821 --> 02:46:32,750
I never do.

6856
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:34,040
Like I'll wake up and like I,

6857
02:46:34,041 --> 02:46:35,390
you got five round spine,

6858
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:36,260
let's go,

6859
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,750
let's do this first round and then
I look at the state ground third,

6860
02:46:38,751 --> 02:46:39,081
fourth,

6861
02:46:39,081 --> 02:46:39,500
fifth.

6862
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:40,190
That's interesting.

6863
02:46:40,190 --> 02:46:41,300
If you look at the grand scheme of like,

6864
02:46:41,330 --> 02:46:41,691
Oh man,

6865
02:46:41,691 --> 02:46:42,360
I got 12 weeks,

6866
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:43,280
get ready for this fight,

6867
02:46:43,380 --> 02:46:44,540
and you seem about the 12 weeks,

6868
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:45,710
what the fuck?

6869
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:46,820
It's a lot of work,

6870
02:46:46,821 --> 02:46:47,091
man.

6871
02:46:47,091 --> 02:46:47,924
You're me overwhelmed.

6872
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:49,370
You're not going to be
focused at your best.

6873
02:46:49,371 --> 02:46:50,600
Breaking it down individually.

6874
02:46:51,080 --> 02:46:51,831
That's interesting,

6875
02:46:51,831 --> 02:46:53,720
but what about like the overall game?

6876
02:46:53,721 --> 02:46:57,320
Like if you look at your overall mixed
martial arts game and trying to improve

6877
02:46:57,321 --> 02:46:59,060
and trying to compare all these things,

6878
02:46:59,061 --> 02:47:00,740
do you do like have like a,

6879
02:47:00,741 --> 02:47:05,120
an an an overall like
assessment of like over six,

6880
02:47:05,330 --> 02:47:06,021
six weeks?

6881
02:47:06,021 --> 02:47:08,630
I would like to look like
this for seven weeks in.

6882
02:47:08,631 --> 02:47:10,850
I would like to be at these numbers.

6883
02:47:10,851 --> 02:47:12,440
I'd like to be doing these rounds.

6884
02:47:12,441 --> 02:47:13,310
I'd like to be doing.

6885
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,450
Do you have like,

6886
02:47:14,450 --> 02:47:16,070
like things match kids?

6887
02:47:16,170 --> 02:47:17,930
Cardio Cardio's never
been a huge issue for me.

6888
02:47:17,931 --> 02:47:19,400
Like I was getting crazy shape.

6889
02:47:19,430 --> 02:47:19,850
I,

6890
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:22,190
the one thing I do have like as a marker,

6891
02:47:22,191 --> 02:47:24,800
like a numerical marker
is my resting heart rate.

6892
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:27,170
If I'm above 40,

6893
02:47:27,171 --> 02:47:28,004
I freak out.

6894
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:30,800
I'm usually around 37 38
when I'm phenomenal shape,

6895
02:47:30,980 --> 02:47:33,290
which beats Michael Phelps
in Hussein bolt by the way.

6896
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:34,393
Wow.

6897
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:35,750
So when I'm like 37,

6898
02:47:36,130 --> 02:47:36,590
uh,

6899
02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:39,380
for Mitchell and I get down I think 36 37,

6900
02:47:39,381 --> 02:47:40,640
it's like the best I've ever been.

6901
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:41,630
Jesus Christ.

6902
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:42,201
Crazy,

6903
02:47:42,201 --> 02:47:42,440
right?

6904
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,700
What gets your heart rate?

6905
02:47:43,701 --> 02:47:44,121
They're like,

6906
02:47:44,121 --> 02:47:45,950
what is like being a phenomenal shape man?

6907
02:47:45,951 --> 02:47:48,320
Like what is like the
best thing that you do?

6908
02:47:48,370 --> 02:47:48,510
Like,

6909
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:48,690
what,

6910
02:47:48,690 --> 02:47:49,970
what do you attribute that to?

6911
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:51,200
Like what,

6912
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:51,801
what kind of,

6913
02:47:51,801 --> 02:47:53,180
I don't know if I can put some one thing,

6914
02:47:53,181 --> 02:47:55,100
I'll just say just really like the tempo.

6915
02:47:55,101 --> 02:47:58,910
I sat nonstop and then I finished
my week off by running on the track,

6916
02:47:58,911 --> 02:48:01,910
doing these long sprints where
we monitor my heart rate.

6917
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:02,893
So when it goes,

6918
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:03,370
uh,

6919
02:48:03,370 --> 02:48:07,220
and so I'll end my heart rate be like
one 88 soon as it gets down to one 40,

6920
02:48:07,221 --> 02:48:08,060
I'm running again.

6921
02:48:08,480 --> 02:48:09,313
Wow.

6922
02:48:09,380 --> 02:48:09,741
That's it.

6923
02:48:09,741 --> 02:48:10,191
That does it.

6924
02:48:10,191 --> 02:48:10,550
Yeah.

6925
02:48:10,550 --> 02:48:13,870
As soon as it gets down to 140140140,

6926
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:14,900
that's not very low.

6927
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:15,753
It's not very low.

6928
02:48:15,890 --> 02:48:16,420
No.

6929
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:16,670
Yeah.

6930
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:19,060
So you just keep swiping
my confidence from though,

6931
02:48:19,061 --> 02:48:19,360
man.

6932
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:21,440
Cause I'm fucking terrified and I,

6933
02:48:21,441 --> 02:48:21,931
and I'll,

6934
02:48:21,931 --> 02:48:22,521
I'll be honest,

6935
02:48:22,521 --> 02:48:24,410
I suffer a little bit
from body issues too,

6936
02:48:24,411 --> 02:48:24,830
man,

6937
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:26,180
because I'm not like Super Rib.

6938
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:27,710
So that's why I'm always on a diet.

6939
02:48:27,711 --> 02:48:29,220
Like tomorrow I just don't buy it.

6940
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:30,890
I'm going on a four day juicing cleanse.

6941
02:48:30,891 --> 02:48:32,270
I'm just going to drink
a juice for four days.

6942
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:35,930
I'm a feminist and had some dumb
off at the airport like shit.

6943
02:48:35,931 --> 02:48:38,180
And I'm going to go on this
four day Monday's Lens.

6944
02:48:38,181 --> 02:48:38,390
Yeah.

6945
02:48:38,390 --> 02:48:39,223
You Ate Wendy's?

6946
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:39,441
Yeah,

6947
02:48:39,441 --> 02:48:39,771
I did.

6948
02:48:39,771 --> 02:48:41,630
First Time I've had fast food
and probably eight years.

6949
02:48:42,110 --> 02:48:42,450
Yeah.

6950
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:43,283
Sorry.

6951
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:47,480
You're hungry and tired and he
did some drinking this weekend.

6952
02:48:47,870 --> 02:48:49,330
They'll look crazy as humanity.

6953
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:52,700
So when you say body issues,

6954
02:48:52,701 --> 02:48:55,580
like you feel where we take your
shirt off inside the octagon,

6955
02:48:55,620 --> 02:48:56,453
like that kind of thing?

6956
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:57,321
No,

6957
02:48:57,321 --> 02:48:57,681
not really.

6958
02:48:57,681 --> 02:48:59,710
Inside the AUC in like
when I'm at a camp you,

6959
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:00,411
it's rare.

6960
02:49:00,411 --> 02:49:01,700
You'll see me with like my shirt off,

6961
02:49:01,701 --> 02:49:02,051
which I'm,

6962
02:49:02,051 --> 02:49:02,690
I'm in.

6963
02:49:02,690 --> 02:49:03,381
I'm always in good.

6964
02:49:03,381 --> 02:49:04,071
We never wear clothes.

6965
02:49:04,071 --> 02:49:04,700
If I had your buddy.

6966
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:05,533
Yeah.

6967
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:06,051
It's weird,

6968
02:49:06,051 --> 02:49:06,440
right?

6969
02:49:06,440 --> 02:49:06,990
It's weird.

6970
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:07,880
But I

6971
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:08,813
cloth,

6972
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:09,301
listen,

6973
02:49:09,301 --> 02:49:09,781
you talked to her,

6974
02:49:09,781 --> 02:49:10,051
Yani.

6975
02:49:10,051 --> 02:49:11,100
I'm sure there's something
she doesn't like.

6976
02:49:11,101 --> 02:49:11,521
Unheard by.

6977
02:49:11,521 --> 02:49:12,510
Everyone suffers from it.

6978
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:13,291
For me though,

6979
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:14,040
it's just like,

6980
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:14,873
like when you,

6981
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:15,481
when,

6982
02:49:15,481 --> 02:49:16,080
uh,

6983
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:18,150
you're looked at as an elite athlete,

6984
02:49:18,151 --> 02:49:20,640
I never want people to
see me not in shape,

6985
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:21,780
which I am in shape,

6986
02:49:21,781 --> 02:49:24,690
but I don't want people to
see me like out of my peak.

6987
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:27,570
But you see a guy like fade or like
always had kind of like a little bit of a

6988
02:49:27,571 --> 02:49:28,170
gut,

6989
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:28,471
you know,

6990
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:30,240
always like he just didn't give a fuck.

6991
02:49:30,241 --> 02:49:31,320
He's just like whatever.

6992
02:49:31,321 --> 02:49:33,540
I'm going to say he had no ass.

6993
02:49:33,541 --> 02:49:35,520
Like just fuck.

6994
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:37,890
It wasn't worried at all about,

6995
02:49:37,891 --> 02:49:38,671
I know it's different.

6996
02:49:38,671 --> 02:49:39,151
It's different.

6997
02:49:39,151 --> 02:49:39,780
I know.

6998
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:41,070
Don't you wish you could be like that?

6999
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:42,541
I guess.

7000
02:49:42,541 --> 02:49:42,870
Yeah.

7001
02:49:42,870 --> 02:49:43,703
Hell yeah I do.

7002
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:46,080
Well what did you think?

7003
02:49:46,081 --> 02:49:48,650
Like maybe if he like thought
the way he thinks I miss.

7004
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:52,610
Is there a way to like emulate that sort
of a mindset or program yourself like

7005
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:55,200
that do culturally what
is considered manly?

7006
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:55,621
He also,

7007
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:55,901
does it.

7008
02:49:55,901 --> 02:49:56,160
Know what I mean?

7009
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,240
He also doesn't care.

7010
02:49:57,241 --> 02:49:58,530
Like I care how I look.

7011
02:49:58,531 --> 02:49:59,430
I'm very vain.

7012
02:49:59,431 --> 02:50:01,140
I like fast cars bad.

7013
02:50:01,141 --> 02:50:02,820
She itches and I live on the beach.

7014
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:04,890
He lives in Russia,

7015
02:50:04,891 --> 02:50:05,760
wrestles Grizzly,

7016
02:50:05,761 --> 02:50:06,121
bears,

7017
02:50:06,121 --> 02:50:10,800
drinks fucking beer and fucking eats
potatoes and has a gut hanging over his

7018
02:50:10,801 --> 02:50:12,530
belt and probably fucking Gucci.

7019
02:50:12,531 --> 02:50:17,531
Trued has fucking here hanging out of
her armpits were both Russian Nate.

7020
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:19,290
We're very different.

7021
02:50:19,291 --> 02:50:20,550
We're very different.

7022
02:50:21,750 --> 02:50:22,770
If you like had,

7023
02:50:22,890 --> 02:50:25,560
I don't think it has anything to
do with being successful or not.

7024
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:27,630
I think some of the biggest stars or no,

7025
02:50:27,631 --> 02:50:29,820
most successful people I
know are very self conscious,

7026
02:50:30,060 --> 02:50:31,720
really big time in,

7027
02:50:31,750 --> 02:50:32,583
in MMA,

7028
02:50:32,790 --> 02:50:33,623
MMA,

7029
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:38,720
NFL acting who and said please
don't ever use acting with MMA.

7030
02:50:39,790 --> 02:50:40,860
I'm seeing stars though.

7031
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:41,694
I'm saying like stop.

7032
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:42,421
Please.

7033
02:50:42,421 --> 02:50:43,470
You're hurt my soul.

7034
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:44,870
Put that together sir.

7035
02:50:45,210 --> 02:50:45,780
Um,

7036
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:47,420
do you like when like,

7037
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:51,600
like what athletes do you think in MMA
or like real self conscious like that

7038
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:52,860
certain ones.

7039
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:53,511
You don't want to talk about it?

7040
02:50:53,511 --> 02:50:53,810
No,

7041
02:50:53,810 --> 02:50:54,121
not at all.

7042
02:50:54,121 --> 02:50:54,960
I'll tell you off there though.

7043
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:55,630
Okay,

7044
02:50:55,630 --> 02:50:56,040
let's,

7045
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:57,120
let's wrap this bitch up.

7046
02:50:57,250 --> 02:50:57,520
Uh,

7047
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:59,220

fun fight companion,

7048
02:50:59,221 --> 02:50:59,610

Man.

7050
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:02,190
I want to talk a little while at the end.

7051
02:51:02,191 --> 02:51:05,460
Just alleviate some
depressure mouse super down.

7052
02:51:05,880 --> 02:51:06,900
I was going to crash.

7053
02:51:06,901 --> 02:51:08,420
Brian's put sun the wall.

7054
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:09,060
It wasn't,

7055
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:10,890
and not trying for not putting,

7056
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,671
not paid for it.

7057
02:51:11,671 --> 02:51:11,851
Yeah,

7058
02:51:11,851 --> 02:51:12,360
I didn't,

7059
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:15,580
I mean it's not surprising
but it Kinda is one.

7060
02:51:15,750 --> 02:51:17,010
You just don't want to see that shit.

7061
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:18,133
Yeah.

7062
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:19,170
All right folks.

7063
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:20,460
When are we going to do this again?

7064
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:20,941
When's the next,

7065
02:51:20,941 --> 02:51:21,571

Evan Dunham and a Edson Barboza

7087
02:51:57,510 --> 02:51:58,980

7088
02:51:59,100 --> 02:51:59,491
So,

7089
02:51:59,491 --> 02:51:59,761
