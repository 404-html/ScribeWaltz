1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Okay,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,530
boom. And we're live. What's up
brother? How are you man, Joe Rogan.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,940
I am so happy to be here. I'm
so happy to see you. Fuck,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,460
you've gone through a journey.
Oh Man.

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:19,230
Since the last time I seen him yesterday
was one year from your heart transplant

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:23,610
anniversary. Exactly.
Wow. One year. And Joe,

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,200
if I told you it was easy,
I'd be lying. But man,

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,230
it was so worth the journey
and they ain't even funny.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,770
What does it feel like right now? Like
have another person's heart in your body.

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,940
What does that feel like?
Well,

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,030
a lot of times it feels like I actually
did die and this is just a dream my hand

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,900
right now. Yup. Wow. This,
this is, I think there's,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,070
this would be my heaven. You look
great. You're still jacked. No,

14
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:54,330
not losing any weight. Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. But I mean, you still,

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,170
you still jacked. He's still
got muscles. Uh, you know, it's,

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,210
it's such a,

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,270
a fall from where I was, you know, I
really appreciate it though, but I, I,

18
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,470
you know, I look at myself, man,
it's just, uh, you know, fragmented.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,970
What I used to be, but you
know, still here. That's
what's so important to me, man.

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,370
Well,
the ridiculous thing you were doing,

21
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:20,371
you're making videos of your working out
like getting ready and after your heart

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,630
attack,
heart operation,

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,830
this you have a heart transplant and
you're running in a parking lot and you

24
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:30,190
trip and fall. I'm like,
Jesus man, slow down.

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,220
You just decided that you were just going
to start pushing from the beginning.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,470
Well,
uh,

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
actually my brain was
ready but my body wasn't.

28
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,660
Did they warn you about doing that?
Did they say it was okay?

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,880
You can tell me that they gave me
permission to walk and you know me,

30
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,970
I'm like walk shit.
I can run

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,700
my mind so that I could. Right. What
does it feel like though? Like when you,

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,570
like what is the difference between
the way your heart feels now?

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,970
It's night and day.
You know,

34
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:10,620
before I got the transplant
it had got really bad,

35
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,510
really bad. I had a Frat line
two more times, uh, you know,

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,400
before the actual transplant and it was,
I couldn't go through one another frat.

37
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:25,140
Right. I mean, that would've been it.
But the difference now, I mean, it feels,

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,820
I only say flatline, like
your heart stops. Yes. Yes.

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,440
And what did they do to
start it back up again? Okay.

40
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,570
After had this last heart attack,
um, they asked me to see Mr freshly,

41
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:40,220
do you want to us to put in
a pacemaker? And I, you know,

42
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:44,460
I thought about it a lot because my
brother and my older brother at Walt had a

43
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,520
pacemaker installed before he passed away.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,350
And his pacemaker was actually
going off, uh, when he,

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,890
when he died. So I'm like, man, I
didn't really do any good for him.

46
00:02:55,891 --> 00:03:00,430
So I was like going back and forth
and then this, it's sounding voice,

47
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,850
say Diego and get it. And so I told him
he had put it in and pacemaker saved me.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,060
Wow. So it went flat like she,
her heart gave up. And then the p,

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,820
what is the pacemaker do exactly?
It's like a defibrillator, you know,

50
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,100
I think they had the paddles to give
you an electric shock, you know, that's,

51
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,610
that's what the pacemaker does.
Just give you a little inside, uh,

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,180
inside, and it's connected directly
to your heart, that sucker flat lines.

53
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,140
It gives you a jolt. Wow.
Yeah. Did you feel it?

54
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,410
No. No. I was, I was
dead until you're dead.

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,830
You don't feel nothing. So
you'd blocked out to Oh, uh,

56
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,910
it's not, uh, a blackout or,
uh, uh, like those offerings.

57
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,910
You're sleeping.
Death is totally different.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,960
Totally different.
And you,

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,220
I knew that I was dead
before I died before at flat.

60
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,930
Right. It was just me and my wife at home
and I was talking to her just like I'm

61
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:06,190
talking to you. And the next
thing, all the lights went out.

62
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,160
It was like a one of
those old fashioned TVs.

63
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,880
I don't know if you're old enough to
remember these black and white TVs. Yeah,

64
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,470
yeah. That's exactly how it
was. Just sort of Chinese pop,

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,790
tiny pinprick of light and you know that,
that's it.

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,740
Wow. It's no, you know, you
absolutely know that this is it.

67
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,900
And it's not, you know, this is the
irreversible and you're, you're, you know,

68
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,500
that it's, this is death and this,
you're not just those in our,

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,320
you know, did you have a near
death experience? I everything.

70
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,260
Um,
the only thing you have to,

71
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't think I had time to
say was I had timely, uh,

72
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,450
call my wife's name. But I mean,
when they say things rush, you know,

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,490
everything's like, this is
the, this is it. You know,

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,710
you're not going to be able to do this
anymore. You're not going to get it.

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,200
This is it.
This is it.

76
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,210
The final finalization of
everything hits you like the,

77
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,540
you know, this is it, you
know, this is the final thing.

78
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,010
This is your last moment on earth
and you know it. And I'm like,

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,420
what do you do B, you know, I can do
with say my wife's name. And that was it.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,940
That was it. So the, the pacemaker
kicks in and then you route.

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah. And it was, so that's a
damn good description. I mean,

82
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,000
it was like a,

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I thought I felt like that
I had been asleep for hours.

84
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,280
It was the best,
most peaceful,

85
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,850
restful time of my entire life.
Wow.

86
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,130
And in just a short moment,

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,710
it felt like I had been asleep for eight
hours, so rested so well rested. So,

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
and my wife told me,
and I was just a short period of time,

89
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,830
but it felt like I'd been asleep for
eight hours. So this happened twice? Yes.

90
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,240
The second time was in
the hospital. Oh Wow.

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,070
So they tell you, okay, Mr.
Fletcher, we have a heart for you.

92
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,400
Yeah,
they call me like two 40 in the morning.

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,830
So that you have to get in there right
now. Is that how it felt was? No,

94
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,470
I had hours, uh, before I had
to actually be at the hospital.

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,570
I said the be it the hospital thing,
like six or seven, they had more. Yeah.

96
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,640
And then you think an whoa boy.
Uh,

97
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,230
I was happy and sad when I got the car.

98
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,080
I was happy for myself,
um,

99
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,960
because I didn't think I could
go through another flat line,

100
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,770
but I was sad for the
donor and dawn's Fam. Yeah.

101
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,980
I knew somebody had to pass away
in order for me to get that hard.

102
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,930
So I felt real bad about that.

103
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,700
So they put it in you,
you wake up,

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,130
what does that feel like?
Um,

105
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,680
it felt like, uh, um, being born again,

106
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,080
a rebirth. I never
tried. Never go at life.

107
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,440
Wow. Yeah. I get it. Never started
another chance they had it,

108
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,520
my said ain't over.
Wow.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
So from this,
so they have to open you up,

110
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,070
do that chest spreader thing and uh,
and what is all that like?

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,750
Well, are you, of course that
you were out, but when you
wake up and you look down,

112
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:30,290
you're covered with stitches,
right? I mean, it must be
a giant scar, right? They,

113
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,150
it's, they are so good now
to go get it. You know,

114
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,980
I have a scar, but considering that
it's my second time being split open,

115
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,590
you know, the first time, uh, and Oh
five, when they put a metal valve in,

116
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,050
I've flattened. I during that
operates in three times on, you know,

117
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,470
on the table during the,
the operation itself. Uh,

118
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,210
so me and flat line, you got a five
flat lines. I think I'm at my limit man.

119
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,130
Um, I seen the scars.
They had to take a pace,

120
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,490
the pacemaker out, they took
the metal valve out of it. Well,

121
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,850
they took the old heart, had the metal
fab and he took the old hard out.

122
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,810
They put in a new heart and uh,

123
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,920
it's just me and it's unbelievably this
before a shower would kill me if I took

124
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,360
a shower, I'd be done for the
rest of the day. A shower. Yeah.

125
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,350
Shout we kill me for the rest of the
day and I had to seat in the shower,

126
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,070
you know, uh, how would, how
would a shower kill you? Oh Man.

127
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:35,850
It was that amount of physical activity
and you know, uh, how, you know,

128
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,110
people take taking a shower for granted,

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,410
but that amount of physical
activity would kill me.

130
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:47,300
I'd be white out just for washing your
sheets. Yes. For the rest of the day,

131
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,770
man. It was. So you were hanging by a
smell? Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

132
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,910
It was, you know, Kim, you know,
and my wife was opening jars for me,

133
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,960
you know,
here I am,

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,850
former big spreads world
champion and I got my wife.

135
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,720
Hey baby cause you open these jelly
jar for me. Wow. Yeah it's a humbling,

136
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,790
humbling. Very big time. Big Time.

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,560
How long did you have to stay in the
hospital for? Um, we were in the hospital,

138
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,290
not very long. I mean we got out of
uh, we went straight to intensive care.

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,330
They keep you there for like three days,

140
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,630
but I think I was probably
released to within two weeks total.

141
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,900
Wow. And then are you using a
walker? Are you walking fine?

142
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,910
Like I wouldn't say I was walking fine
but I was walking just walking slowly.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,980
Oh, big time. Big Time. Slowly. Yeah,

144
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:48,060
I was crawling along. Yeah. Wow.
And how long did it take to,

145
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,370
for you to get to where you're at?
And like now?

146
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,570
Like now I'd have no idea that you had
a heart transplant and really well I

147
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:59,130
appreciate it. No. When I saw you, me,
you look very happy. Oh, I am happy.

148
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,680
You look like you're growing.

149
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,860
I am extremely happy just to be alive
when you come that close to dying.

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,170
I mean every day is just the blessing,
man.

151
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,690
If people are having ain't doing CT,
I'm blessed man.

152
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,500
I'm sorry I got no complaints.
Oh yes. No complaints whatsoever.

153
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,810
I'm through. I seen, I want to hug
them. Joe. I'm so happy to see.

154
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,460
I'm so happy to see you man. I'm
alive. Wow. Cause we, you know,

155
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:34,461
last time we talked about me needing a
transplant and I needed the transplant,

156
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,960
it now back.
I had it,

157
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,510
the first six months were rough.
Yeah.

158
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,510
The first six months after it was uh,

159
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,000
the jelly jar oatmealy jelly jars,
just not being able to do,

160
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,220
you know, normal things. The first
thing I tried to do was walk.

161
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,960
So they had me walk around, I guess
a city block. I mean, city plot.

162
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,250
Joe. When I first tried to
walk around a city buck,

163
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:10,251
I'd have to stop probably 1213 times and
take a seat and get up and try to walk.

164
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,620
And it was, it was killing
me, man. My, my, you know, my,

165
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,440
my wife would slow down and he slowed
down and walk with me and us too.

166
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,260
It was such a struggle and I'm like,
you know what,

167
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,120
I don't give a damn how long it take me.

168
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm going to make you mad and I'm
going to make it says keep, keep going.

169
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,440
And what kind of activity are
you able to do now? A year later,

170
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,540
I am a lifting again, but very
lightly I am able to do, you know,

171
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,210
the machines and stuff from the 10.
Uh,

172
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,990
I think I've been able to do
that for the last two months.

173
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,430
So when you say it lightly, is this by
doctor's orders? Oh yeah. The doctor.

174
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,220
I can't do anything. You know,
without them approving it first. Yeah.

175
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,930
Except the run in the parking
lot. Didn't even approve. Yeah.

176
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,170
Well mine was like, go ahead,
you can do it. My body was like,

177
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,380
leave me out this month. Yeah. So what,

178
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,980
what holds you back in terms
of like lifting weights?

179
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,120
Like why do you have to go light?

180
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,560
And my strength is just nowhere near what
it used to be. The strength of steel,

181
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:19,480
you know, I can tell that, uh, you know,
I have a long way to go, but, you know,

182
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,610
just to be able to do anything.

183
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,650
So I guess I kinda need
to do and I do what I can.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,180
That's what I tell people all the
time, man. If you can't, uh, you know,

185
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,570
do what you want to do, at least get
in there and do what you can do. Yeah.

186
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,770
It's better than doing
nothing. Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,830
So now did they have you on medications
to make sure that the heart doesn't get

188
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,220
rejected by your body?
Most definitely in an,

189
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,350
and people out there who've
had transplants, I know
that they were like, oh man.

190
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,920
Yeah. I take about 21
different medications everyday.

191
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,470
Yup. 21 different medica and when
the side effects of the stuff,

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
they used to be worst,
but now, you know, my uh,

193
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,920
fetus swollen pretty much every day.
Um,

194
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,780
something in the medical kind of kicks
my arthritis. I have arthritis too,

195
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:15,370
so it kind of kicks in and told her
stiff, you know, pretty much every day.

196
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:20,371
But when I compare the side effects
to the work took possibly after him,

197
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,710
which is death and the
side effects ain't shit,

198
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,350
I'll take them now when you have
to take this medication forever,

199
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,870
uh, it gets less, less and less.

200
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,250
When I go back this month back up to
Palo Alto where they did the transplant,

201
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,120
um, they're going to take off about
four or five different medications.

202
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,900
So I'm a year out now. They last
and then the further you get out,

203
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,380
the less medication and thinking events,
we'll get down to two or three,

204
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,140
but you'll always have to
take some oh yeah, definitely.

205
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,280
And it's just because your body doesn't
understand why it has someone's heart in

206
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:58,120
it. Um, for a while they had
that in the beginning, right?

207
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm taking 21 now. It's
because, you know, uh,

208
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,880
to keep the chances that rejection
down why it's your check today,

209
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,050
then understand that it wasn't the
one that she was born with. Right.

210
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,840
As a foreign, you know, foreign heart.

211
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,790
And I really want to talk to you about
that heart. What I know about it. Um,

212
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,110
it's a woman's heart,
right? Yeah. So, you know,

213
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:24,350
you know already I was going to drop a
bomb on, you know, the following. Yeah.

214
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,190
Very good. Yeah. Yeah. I won.

215
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,440
But I tell you that, that threw me
for a loop. Yeah. And I was, you know,

216
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,010
I'm always talking about how strong
my faith is and you know, I'm

217
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,230
faith, faith, faith, faith man,
the Super Man of faith. Uh,

218
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,730
I could have so much faith to
Matt and can't phase me. You know,

219
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,830
I went into the operation,
hey,

220
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:54,450
I see you guys in the other side
of this because you know, I got,

221
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,130
I know I'm going to be here. I
got so much faith that, you know,

222
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,620
I'm going to get through this
so I'm going to see you guys.

223
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:05,621
But when the doctor came in and told me
that I had a woman's heart that sock the

224
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:11,360
shit out of my face because I had done
steady, you know, I looked, you know,

225
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,320
steady on this,
the,

226
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,970
the survival rate of male to female.

227
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,840
And it wasn't good.
The stage that I had read wasn't good.

228
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:25,070
When they do a female to me, I'm sorry,
female to Male, the term it's not good.

229
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,340
And I was like, everything I had
read said it's not a good thing.

230
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,250
The doctor comes in and says,
Yep, you've got a woman's heart.

231
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,950
And she wasn't that much
younger than you are

232
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,930
that, that you know, side.
Yeah. Tested my faith big time.

233
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,820
How did she die? I have no
idea. I have no idea. But,

234
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,090
um,
the thing I have feelings,

235
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,860
I haven't talked to the family.
I would love to.

236
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,210
I don't know anything about it,

237
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:01,211
but I have these feelings and I really
would like to know if what I'm feeling is

238
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,360
right. You know, I want, I really
want to meet the family and let them,

239
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,050
let them know that I'm out here doing
everything I can to raise donor awareness.

240
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,000
And if their mother or their wife or
their sister or their aunt didn't die in

241
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:17,834
vain.

242
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,250
And then I'm doing my absolute best
to carry on and let people know that,

243
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:22,761
you know,

244
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:27,470
she was a donor and that it's so
utterly important for people to donate,

245
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,630
give the gift of life. What are these
feelings? I have feelings that, uh,

246
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:37,631
for some reason I can see that I feel
like she was an oriental lady and I,

247
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,020
I, you know, I don't know why,

248
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,180
but I really have feelings like that
and I feel like I can see this woman,

249
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm telling her husband,
you know,

250
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:54,701
I'll see when we get home from work and
making plans with their kids for the

251
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,520
weekend and have no idea
if this is right or not.

252
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,060
But I just had those feelings.
But they are recurring. Yes.

253
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,610
And did you like it? Do you
remember it like a memory? It's, um,

254
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,120
it's like I get to look into her,
you know,

255
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,300
her existence, her, her life,

256
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,930
and I have no,
I could be totally wrong.

257
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:24,440
She kept me a Jamaican
lady. Right. I have no idea.

258
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,770
Or if I'm in the ballpark or not.

259
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,490
I just have this feeling.
I just have a feeling. Wow.

260
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,870
Do you have any unusual cravings
or anything like food or, uh,

261
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,500
I don't think, uh, no.
I don't think I haven't.

262
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,730
I do talk to her and I feel like that,

263
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,740
uh, you know, when, when like when
I was walking around and I'm trying,

264
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,010
I'm trying to make it around that.

265
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I would often ask her for help
to help me make it around me.

266
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,000
Wow. Yeah. Well I talked to
her a lot. Wow. Come on lady.

267
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,510
I need to have a name for it.
I just kind of the lady,

268
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,090
come on lady. I need jail.
Wow. Wow. That's crazy.

269
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,670
You're superman from
captain has a lady's heart.

270
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,390
Now when you say that,
that it's not,

271
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,500
the results aren't good for lady
hearts in Male bodies. Yeah.

272
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,750
Did you say that to the doctor
and the doctor is so, um,

273
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,860
it's so funny.

274
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,490
I don't even know if the doctor
suppose because it was this one doctor.

275
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,830
He would come in and young guy
and he would come in every day.

276
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,430
How are you doing Mr. Fletcher? And
I will say I'm blessed. I don't care.

277
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,660
When I woke up from the transplant,

278
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,900
I consider every second
after that a blessing.

279
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,400
It's borrowed time and I wasn't supposed
to be here, so I, I, my answer is always,

280
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:51,090
I'm blessed so he can meet you. How are
you doing? I'm blessed him. But he said,

281
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:55,410
you know what, you're going to
change that and I ain't to no doc.

282
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,240
It's nothing you can say.
It's going to make me change my answer.

283
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,670
I'm going to always be blessed
no matter what you say. He said,

284
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,320
you think you're doing really good, don't
you and I were hair. Yeah. I think I'm,

285
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,580
I'm, I'm alive. Yeah.
I think I'm doing good.

286
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,990
I walked around this a hospital corridor.
I think I'm doing really good.

287
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,430
He said,
you're not,

288
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,940
you're doing about what you're supposed
to be doing and you have a woman's heart

289
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,970
and it's too small for you.

290
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,160
And she was almost your age.
Fuck,

291
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,900
it's too small.

292
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,450
He told me that the heart
was too small and uh,

293
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,590
the lady was,

294
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,250
I was 58 or nine and 59 cause
that'd be 60 on June the eighth.

295
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,880
So, uh, he says it's too small and

296
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,820
you're not, you know, you're not
doing anything extraordinary.

297
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:58,620
You just do an average and
she's your age. I'm like, man,

298
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,620
fuck for the rest of the day I was fucked.
I was fucking mind,

299
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,010
man. I was, you know, God, why
didn't you do this? The League?

300
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,240
Why did you kill me? Oh, well I'm
and sorry. And old woman it dad,

301
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,580
why can you give me an
age? Well, I'm the why God,

302
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,330
I was questioning why did you
do this to me? Did you ask him?

303
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,100
Hey, what did you say? You mean the
doctor or guide the doctor? Uh, I didn't,

304
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,830
I need to ask the doctor that my doctor
did come in and I deal. Do you know,

305
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm sorry. I did ask the doctor.
I asked her, I said, dad, why,

306
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,450
why could you now I am, dude. I had tears
in my eyes because this was, you know,

307
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:42,330
I'm like, fuck, I got another
heart, but I ain't gonna last long.

308
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm going to be out here.
So it was, you know,

309
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:49,740
it was fucking with me and the
doctor, um, acid dye of why,

310
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,010
I mean, why, and she looked me in the
eyeballs doing, she said, Mr Frichy,

311
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,730
we didn't want you to die. It's just
that sample. We didn't want you to die.

312
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,640
That was what was available. That was what
was available. It was a healthy heart.

313
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,770
And I need one bad deal now. Well,
that heart grow to match your body.

314
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,820
It already has really,
it is the proper size that it's,

315
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,400
it did. Yes. And the doctor
that told me it was too small.

316
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,720
It was the one who told me that he
had grown to the proper sides. Wow.

317
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,640
Why does it grow? Because it recognized
it was in a bigger body. Ah, Joe, I,

318
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,530
you're on. That's on the physical. Uh, if
you look at it physically and probably a,

319
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:32,961
you know,

320
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:37,600
on with a rational mind
that would probably be it
realized that it had to adapt

321
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,470
to a larger,

322
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,910
but I'm going to give him a little
credit the car because it's just me man.

323
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,380
So cause he came back too fast.

324
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,380
I mean it was like a week later and said
it's already decided that she would be

325
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,730
a week later, a week after week
later before I left the hospital.

326
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,230
He was telling me that it's
already sizes should be Jesus.

327
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,260
And I said see dark.
I told you I'm blessed man.

328
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,880
I that doesn't make any sense.
I know. What did he say?

329
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,720
Did the doctor say it doesn't make
any sense to the normal thing?

330
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,490
I have no idea why. I have no idea
if it's a normal thing or not.

331
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,570
But you know, I mean me I'm giving
credit. I'm going wild. Another miracle.

332
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:17,404
Thank God

333
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,650
I didn't say that question guy and I,
my answer was what did I,

334
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,590
I got back was what simple.

335
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,770
He said that if I gave you or a
18 year old Olympic athletes harp,

336
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:35,170
CT and you recovered,
was doing well,

337
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,420
then people are going to say that.

338
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,420
That's why we got an 18 year old Olympic
gold medal is hard and you're able to

339
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:45,250
recover and stuff because of this,

340
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,360
but if I take a old lady's heart,

341
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,230
there's two small and that not,

342
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,670
you're not supposed to be able to come
back and do these things with this heart,

343
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,090
then they're going to have to
give me a little credit. He said,

344
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:04,870
I have a habit of taking
the least of the least,

345
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,940
the lowest of the low and making
something out of it and I see anywhere.

346
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,930
Let me shut the fuck up.
You're absolutely, it
wouldn't be that impressive,

347
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,550
right? It wouldn't be a miracle if I
eat if it was this wonderful heart,

348
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,800
but because I'm God,

349
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm going to take this heart and give
it to you and he's going to still do all

350
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:28,930
those things, so shit up Ct.
I said, okay, that's good.

351
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,410
Now when you're exercising now eight,
you're just,

352
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,220
are you pushing or you just get into a
point where you just feel a little tired

353
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:39,610
and your back off?
Joe Rogan,

354
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,700
I can't help but push my say no.
That's why I'm asking like, you know,

355
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,180
I give, I gave her, I gave
everything that guy. Yeah,

356
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,880
I can't help.

357
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:54,860
It doesn't matter if you feel weird when
your heart starts beating heavy. Um,

358
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,710
or should I say her start her heart,

359
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,960
her heart starts beating them pretty
fast and you know, I don't feel weird.

360
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,460
I feel like,
uh,

361
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,230
it's something I've done my whole life
and I'm just glad to be back able to do,

362
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,880
you know, some of what I used to
do. It's just a feel good. You know,

363
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,340
I still talk to her though.
Come on. Wait, I'm sure.

364
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,290
I'm sure we get through this sadly.

365
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,400
And now you feel it building up like
you feel like every month or so you get

366
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:29,840
stronger? Um, definitely.
Yeah, definitely.

367
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:34,250
I feel that the longer that gets any
long as that, that the heart is in need,

368
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:38,460
the more it feels like, you know,
it's, that's where it should be in my,

369
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:40,820
my body adapts.

370
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,330
And how long does a heart transplant
usually survive in a person?

371
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,633
Well,
um,

372
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,730
I think the the longest at this
point it's close to 40 years.

373
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,020
40. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I
don't want 40 years. That's,

374
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,750
I don't want to be a hundred man.
You don't know why not?

375
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,570
I want to, I, you know, I never expected,

376
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,940
I said on June the eighth,
I'll be 60.

377
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,540
I never expected to make it to 40,

378
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,930
so go really, really? Yeah. I never,

379
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,070
I never expected I expected
to die young. So, um,

380
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,400
I'm way past where I thought
I would make it anyway.

381
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,990
So it's why'd you think you're going
to die that young? Oh Man, I never had,

382
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,360
I want it to be, I was, I was my,

383
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:36,080
and I want it to be the sky rocket man.
Brilliant.

384
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:40,700
Like to shoot way up. They Ms.
Guy be a brilliant burst. And Dan,

385
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:45,470
I thought they would be the perfect
ending. Just go for it. Go for it.

386
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,570
Go for it.
Go for it and explode

387
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,710
it dead motherfucker. Yeah.
But he, he was, you know,

388
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,100
he was something else when he
was alive and happy with that.

389
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,170
That's what you thought. [inaudible]
hell yeah, definitely. Wow. Yeah.

390
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,250
Now you've got to settle in for 41 years.
I don't even want to be for her

391
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,720
to be alive right now and
every day is a blessing. Yeah.

392
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,010
So why is it 40 years of blessing? It
would be a blessing, but I, man, you know,

393
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,650
I would be, uh, I didn't
want to be around where,

394
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,720
uh, um, I don't want to be a
burden on anybody and, uh, I think,

395
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,340
yeah, a hundred man. Yo, somebody else
got to take care of you, wipe your ass.

396
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,920
You know,
you got to wear diapers and shit.

397
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,420
And I don't know if I w I w I wouldn't
want to be around to be a burden on

398
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:38,660
somebody. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I know what you mean.

399
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,340
But right now you're not a burden. I
hope not. No. I think my might disagree.

400
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,950
But you're moving around, man. I
mean, like I said, if I didn't know,

401
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:52,280
I would have no idea.
Well, I appreciate that.

402
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,820
And even though I know you must
have lost some muscle, he's still,

403
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,220
if I just met you, I'd be like,
this is a Jack Dude. Yeah.

404
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,740
He's still hanging on the size of
your arms, man. There's still huge,

405
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,820
I don't think so. What they
used to be. That's why.

406
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,110
Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I
don't see him. You see it?

407
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,470
That's kind of stuff don't even
matter that much anymore. Right.

408
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,370
I'm sure you have a new lease on life. Oh
yeah. Big Time. What matters to you now?

409
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,250
Uh, the, the really important
things are of course my family,

410
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,520
uh, and spreading, um,

411
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,550
donor awareness is so important because
so many people die just waiting to get a

412
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:37,220
heart, you know, on the list of 20,
I think 21 people a day pass away,

413
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,960
just waiting, trying to
get in. I was so fortunate,

414
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,310
so blessed to be able to get on that.

415
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,810
I want to try to make sure
that other people get one too.

416
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,300
So if whatever I can do
to try to raise awareness,

417
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,430
what is the problem? Like people putting
on that they'll donate their organs.

418
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,990
You could do it online. Now the only
drivers, like in California, you can't,

419
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:04,760
I don't know about other states, but
in California you can do it all online,

420
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,660
you know,
and,

421
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,370
and through the DMV and get your
diet on your driver's license.

422
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,630
And I want to be a donor and I mean, you
can't take the stuff, which, you know,

423
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,640
wait,
no,

424
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,290
you people get paranoid too.
I've heard people say,

425
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,250
I'm worried about doing that because
what if they don't resuscitate me because

426
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:25,820
they need someone to get a
heart or a liver or something.
I'm like, I don't know,

427
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:27,900
man. I really don't think
that's what doctors are there.

428
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,580
No, no, it's, it's, uh, I had, uh,

429
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,510
I, Eh, younger, you know,
when I first got my driver,

430
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:40,530
I was 16 years old and asks you to even
want to be a donor. I'm like, no. Oh,

431
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,850
I'm taking everything that God
gave me with me. I ain't even know.

432
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,120
I know, right. I ain't doing
nothing. But you know, uh,

433
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,560
time brings about a change,
man. You get a little older,

434
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:54,950
a little more wisdom and,
uh,

435
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,530
and if I can get something
to somebody else can use,

436
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,080
definitely most definitely take it.
Yeah.

437
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,000
My mother and all nine of her brothers
and sisters all passed away from heart.

438
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,910
Well, so it's just something that's
in your family. Oh yeah. It's,

439
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,430
my older brother walked passed away just
a couple of years ago from congestive

440
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,160
heart failure and other complications.

441
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,960
So heart problems run big time in the
Fletcher family. That's a crazy one.

442
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:26,810
Right. That does run in families.
Yep. Yeah. It is crazy. Yeah.

443
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,300
But it's reality.
Yeah.

444
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,060
So now, um, do you, what kind
of diet do they have you on?

445
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,100
Uh, I very clean man. Um, I guess, uh, um,

446
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,710
I had my, uh, my kids crack up. I
tell, I said I'm a Presbyterian,

447
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:48,160
but actually, uh, there's Pescatarian,

448
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,750
I face a face,
you know,

449
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:55,600
and blessed stubbles and um,
it's no bullshit,

450
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,480
no bullshit, no time for bullshit. No time
for bullshit. It's exactly right, man.

451
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,870
Cause time, coffee time is precious.
Do I used to, but the caffeine, uh,

452
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,240
and my doctors don't like we mad the
caffeine. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah.

453
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,680
So, um, rest must be very
important for you to yeah.

454
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,460
God I get putting any of it. Yeah, it is.

455
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,450
What other things they make sure that
you do. Um, the Diet has to be on point,

456
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,360
have to take my medication. Uh,
they didn't want me, um, to,

457
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:32,200
uh, you know, do too much
strenuous activities.

458
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,730
Um, they had limited me. I, I wouldn't,

459
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,410
I was not able to travel out
of the country until yesterday.

460
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,930
Um, so yeah. So at one year anniversary,
that's when they give you the green light.

461
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,010
Yep. Man, I can go all over.

462
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,670
What did they say when they saw you
running the parking lot and fall down?

463
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,360
All my doctors and um,
you know,

464
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,830
they all said,
uh,

465
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,990
CT what we think except one except one,

466
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,300
my cardiologist. And he
said, you know what, CT,

467
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,370
I'm not going to wreck. She's
like, everybody else did. Uh,

468
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,460
you already know that they
shouldn't have done that. But man,

469
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,700
I am so proud of you.
He said,

470
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,300
you have inspired me to
start working out again.

471
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,170
That was doctor Salaam. Doctors Slam
him if he's listening. Thank you.

472
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,080
He was the only one
that didn't condemn me.

473
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,640
How far out where it was that
the surgery when you fell down?

474
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,990
Three months
get so crazy.

475
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,410
I felt like I could do
to my mind was like, oh,

476
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,900
well that's that mentality that you have.
You know?

477
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,400
I would imagine it's very
hard to adjust. Uh, yeah,

478
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,560
it's big time. I mean,
from being a village,

479
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,430
it will be the same for you.

480
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:02,431
So you're an active guy kicking
the shit out of the bags and stuff.

481
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:07,621
Old Lightman foot over there and then
even maybe you think and not be able to

482
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:13,090
raise your leg. Yeah. Or throw a punch.

483
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,850
Man. I'll be walking around in
the grocery store. I'm like,

484
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,560
man with my wife and I'm like, man, I hope
nobody fucks with me. Oh, right, right,

485
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:24,820
right. Yeah. How's he feeling
if somebody, you thinking, man,

486
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:28,930
if somebody fucks with you can't even
punch him. Yeah. He can't do anything.

487
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,510
You can't do nothing.
You'd be helpless.

488
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,110
That's man that it's hard to
little old ladies have to do.

489
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,270
It's hard on my pants and my fuck with me.
I'm just going to get beat.

490
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,210
I got no defense.
That's a terrible thing.

491
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,080
That's a terrible thing. But
awfully humbling. Yeah. Tam.

492
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,500
Then you reel, he realized, you know,

493
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,210
just how your whole life you
live for strength. You know,

494
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:04,211
I've been a strong man my whole life
and then all of a sudden all of that is

495
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,970
taken away and you're just,
you know,

496
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,060
fucking invalid man.
You're just weak is shit.

497
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,490
It's very hard mentally to deal with.

498
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,520
But you're past that now.
Yes.

499
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,190
Now you're just in what wa how would you
categorize like how you feel right now?

500
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,940
Um, I categorize my, my, uh,

501
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,980
emotional feelings as being
probably better than ever.

502
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,440
Really? Yes. Uh,

503
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,670
as I see things in such a different light,
uh,

504
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,590
after coming that close to dying,

505
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,620
the things that I thought were
important just don't even matter.

506
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,920
Like what I used to, I give
you one example. You know,

507
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,080
people I used to tell him,
okay,

508
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,890
you asked me about this last time I was
on the show. And I tell people, they say,

509
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,020
well, it's about to steroids and
steroids, how CTU. He takes years.

510
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,420
And I tell him the same thing that I've
been saying for fucking 25 years and

511
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,170
magazine articles and
stuff. I tried them. Yes,

512
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:13,580
I tried them when I was
young and didn't work for me.

513
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,560
I stopped taking [inaudible] with nobody.
Nobody.

514
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,810
Lot of people don't believe they didn't
believe that. And they'll tell me, oh,

515
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,800
you're full of shit. Ct your line.
And I had an out of that and Joe,

516
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,320
that used to bother the fuck out of me.
People flying.

517
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,020
I'd be arguing with people online and say,
fuck,

518
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,610
I take a Goddamn drug tests anytime, 24
hours a day, you could test me. I fucking,

519
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,330
I tell you what, I gave you 10,000
bucks. If I fail your drug test,

520
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,580
all you gotta do is get off fucking social
media. Nobody ever took that burden.

521
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,630
But, but uh, I don't give a fuck if people
say I take steroids now. I don't care.

522
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:52,520
Who Cares? Right. Okay. Now it's
a fucking compliment. Do you a,

523
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:55,910
you don't still go back and forth and
argue with people online? Oh No, no,

524
00:34:55,911 --> 00:35:00,130
not anymore. I sure it
did. I, Oh shit. I would,

525
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,730
I would jump on him in a
minute. Shake my head like, why?

526
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,340
Oh man, Joe, because that was my
mentality. A attacker attack back.

527
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,640
He hit me, I'm gonna hit you back, man.

528
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,580
Try to hit your heart of escalates
all the APPS. Oh yeah. Well, you know,

529
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,760
I do the all caps. Can you talk to me
about, you're yelling, you're yelling, CP,

530
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,850
but I can't have seat so I make it
all caps so I can read what I'm,

531
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,600
what I'm trying. Right, right. Or you get
one. I said, can you actually hear that?

532
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,210
Can you actually hear
that through those words?

533
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,970
You're fucking loud. It's, you
got spidey sense, man. Got, so

534
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,270
one of the most humbling
things about getting older
is the vision going. Oh yeah.

535
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,070
I've known it like from when I was like
42 I started to notice it and by the

536
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,990
time I was 46 I was like God damn.

537
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:53,610
And I think I need glasses cause I would
just try to like read the computer and

538
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,540
I'd be doing this when my,

539
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:59,460
I was like bawling my eyes squinting and
trying to look at it sideways and try

540
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,950
to see what the fuck I was raised.
So weird thing. It's like, oh boy,

541
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,880
my ability to see the world
is fading. It happens. Yeah,

542
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:09,750
it was to the best of this. But it's
a warning sign like, hey man, this is,

543
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,980
you know, this is a
finite existence. Yeah.

544
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,700
Oh get some shit done. Right. Yeah man.

545
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,170
Right now don't wait.
It's going to be waiting time.

546
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:24,100
It sets or precious
commodity billionaires.

547
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,080
You cannot buy one sec.
One second of life.

548
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,420
Yeah. Can't do it. Nope.
It's whole pricing.

549
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,050
Anything that you're thinking about
doing and you've been putting off,

550
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,450
my advice is to get the step
and get the to her next year.

551
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,250
Right now. Get after it. Don't put
it off any longer. Get it done.

552
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,520
So do you feel like you're
like CT Fletcher 2.0

553
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,240
definitely that I'm a new dude.

554
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,300
I knew dude wouldn't do attitude.
Yeah. Yep. Big Time. No.

555
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:03,370
Well you won't be arguing October the
guys. I used to argue it online. Hey,

556
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:06,400
I love you man.
You can hate me all you want to.

557
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:11,401
I love to see I ain't got time
for hate and racism or big.

558
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,180
I ain't got time for none of that.
It's all full of shit. I said,

559
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,940
it's so much bullshit and just a waste
of time and they ain't even finding,

560
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm like, look, if the end,

561
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:25,390
the transplant experience
enhanced my view.

562
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:27,400
I've always said we were
all saying I need the bar.

563
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,180
My mom taught me to love
everybody, but look, they took,

564
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,240
I have no idea the nationality
or race of the donor,

565
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,193
it don't matter.

566
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,150
I hope you're right. If you're
right, it's an Asian woman.

567
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,600
I think that would be fantastic
and you could feel that,

568
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,680
that you would know that
and he could feel it.

569
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,130
Man. Wouldn't that be something
be amazing. I got to find out.

570
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,870
How can you find out? I, I don't,
I have no idea. I want that.

571
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,310
Hopefully they're listening
to the Joe Rogan podcast.

572
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,800
Why don't you give him some details?
Like when,

573
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,970
what day did it happen and what,
like where did the,

574
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,020
did they tell you where the donor came
from? No part of the country. Nope.

575
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,170
I know that their heart was
flown in and I actually,

576
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:13,810
you know,
my,

577
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,580
my wife baby crazy is that it's something
that took a heart out of someone's

578
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:21,670
body and they put it on ice and
we actually see as video the ice,

579
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,760
just a lead going into the room and
then the ice just come follow him right

580
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:31,520
afterwards. God, that's so crazy.
It is crazy. It's, I mean it's,

581
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,070
when I was a kid, uh, it would be
like doctor Frankenstein. Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,720
They didn't start doing it to 68 and I
was born in 59 so you know why they did

583
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:44,140
heart transplants and see
68. Yeah, my wife's, yeah,

584
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,090
lactic 60 a week doing a
long time. But, uh, when I,

585
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,720
like I said when I was a
kid would have been like,

586
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:53,470
Dr. Franks time you told me something
like that was possible. I would say,

587
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:57,030
Oh hell no. You're crazy. You're just
making it up. It's science fiction,

588
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,640
but it most,
it most certainly is possible.

589
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,750
Well, do you think they're going to
be able to grow your own heart? Yeah.

590
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,040
They're working on that right now. Growing
your own heart with stem cells and,

591
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,410
and you know it's going to
happen, which is just crazy. Yeah.

592
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,390
It is going to happen.
I have no doubt. Yeah.

593
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,350
They've already grew a woman's bladder.

594
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,420
The woman had bladder cancer and
they grew her a new bladder. Wow.

595
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,370
Replaced her bladder. Yep. So the
hearts coming. Yeah. It's coming, man.

596
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,250
Yeah. They're already working
on a, I think they're three d.

597
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,960
See if you could find a Jamie,

598
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:35,760
they're three d printing a human heart
and they think that they're going to be

599
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:39,450
able to get to a point where they
have a working model of a human heart,

600
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,010
like wow. And, and put
your heart in your body.

601
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:47,150
A freshie new one,

602
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,970
which is just so crazy.
That is crazy.

603
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,350
And how about for people who are
amputees and things along those lines

604
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,510
with your own limb
actually grow you a limb.

605
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,120
Isn't that something?
Here it is.

606
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,190
The first three d printed heart
made up of living human cells.

607
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,980
Like who knows? Yeah. Yeah, man. It's,

608
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,690
thank God there's people smarter than us.
Old Good.

609
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,670
That is a heart made by universities.
Uh, Tel Aviv University.

610
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,680
Wow.
Heart.

611
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:26,280
The size of a rabbit marks the first
time an entire heart has been three d

612
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,640
printed.
So that's a tiny one right now.

613
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,080
But complete with living cells, blood
vessels, ventricles and chambers intact.

614
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,050
Crazy, incredible. Mini heart can
contract, but it can't yet pump out blood.

615
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,530
So they're working on all those
different variables, I guess. But man,

616
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,940
in that incredible,
look at that three d printing machine,

617
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:51,550
like three d printing machines freaked
me the fuck out. Like their, hey,

618
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,070
that's the future. They're gonna be
able to make things. Yeah. Look at that.

619
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,820
Look how that works. If you folks who
haven't seen this, uh, this is, uh,

620
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:02,280
what the future is on cnet.com.

621
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,020
You can Google it and just watch the
video of them actually creating this.

622
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:09,180
It is unbelievably fascinating.

623
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,360
So did you look at the heart
before they put it in you?

624
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,610
She has to see it. No, no, no. I was
out. Yeah. It was out by that time.

625
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,450
Yeah. Wow. You don't look
at it and say, wake up,

626
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,950
lights come back on. Yup. And uh, doctors,

627
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,390
their wives, they're doctors.
Damn my wife's there.

628
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,910
And uh, it was uh, you a
new day and I was like, Eh,

629
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,300
I wa I kind of wanted to, I kind of
wanted to say, Eh, I told you so.

630
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,550
Yeah. That was a hot, that's hilarious.

631
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,130
Do so I told you so.
It was a funny thing to say.

632
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,920
Would you come back from a heart
transplant on me because you would be a,

633
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,090
you would be surprised
at how funny though,

634
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,650
if you did say that it was so many.
Uh,

635
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,290
I got so many people and it
was overwhelming support,

636
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,760
but I got quite a few,
well too many for me, uh,

637
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,200
messages with Dns and I hope you don't
make it. I hope you die and your,

638
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:15,230
I wish to be dead already know
stuff like that. Do you feel,

639
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:20,060
I'm sorry for those people now?
Oh yeah, most definitely now.

640
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,260
Now I do, you know, be angry
before [inaudible] I was like,

641
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,610
oh, choke the shit out of
him. But you know, now,

642
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,440
I mean you gotta beat.
Um, what, what is your,

643
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,630
your existence must be pretty
pitiful for you to, you know,

644
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:43,010
feel that much hate for somebody that
you don't even know. Never. Yeah,

645
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,870
I just can't stand Joe Rogan.
I hate him.

646
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,790
I've never met him.
I never sit down.

647
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,600
There's no happy people that are
doing that now. It's so transparent.

648
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,130
You gotta be pretty, you know, probably
believably miserable, miserable,

649
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,990
miserable. I'm a file of Joe Rogan
just so I can talk shit about them.

650
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,590
I don't care.
I wish Joe Rogan was off the air,

651
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,160
but I'm following every word he said

652
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,630
because I don't want to miss nothing to
Joe Rogan has to say, but I hate them.

653
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah. Makes no sense, man.
Well, it doesn't make sense,

654
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,830
but a lot of people don't make sense.
That's true.

655
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,080
People live their lives and just very
counterproductive ways and they feel like

656
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,460
as long as they've got something,
they're excited about that,

657
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,740
that they're doing something,

658
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,320
even if it's excited about
hating you for no reason.

659
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,800
I don't get it. Time is too precious
to waste on hate. It's just foolish.

660
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,900
It's a foolish way to exist. Yeah.
I can take, they can take, uh,

661
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,880
livers and hearts and different organs
from any nascent malty and switch them

662
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:50,600
around. Were any changeable
till we were interchangeable?

663
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,460
All one thing.
Yes.

664
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,330
The only thing that separates us is the
climate that we came from. That's it.

665
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,190
That's it. And it's so it,
it, it makes racism. So s

666
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,510
anything stupid.
Tribalism is stupid.

667
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,220
The conservative versus liberal. That's
southern versus northern. That stupid.

668
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:13,880
It's too Asian versus black.

669
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,200
Pakistani. Stupid Dude. So stupid. It's,

670
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,750
we're all in a tangible dude.

671
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,530
That right there shows you
that, you know, we're all one,

672
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,590
we wouldn't be interchangeable now.
Couldn't make we

673
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,070
just this outer shit.
It's on top.

674
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,020
This epidermis, the skin,
this stuff that, you know,

675
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,680
uh,

676
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,480
the Pfizers and it's what makes us
interesting or foolish about it.

677
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,100
It's like,
yeah,

678
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,240
what's fascinating to me is that human
beings came from every single spot on the

679
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:55,220
earth and then one time they originated
in Africa and spread out all over the

680
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:58,220
planogramming adapted to
each individual environment.

681
00:44:58,221 --> 00:45:00,500
When you meet someone from
Ireland, they're white, like paper.

682
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,190
That shit's just because there's no
sun. Exactly. Their body developed.

683
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,050
It's like a, a solar panel
for vitamin D. They're like,

684
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,420
we've got to figure out how to get
fucking vitamin D, this black skinny,

685
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,810
cut the fucking sun out here.

686
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,900
We don't need this melanin cause we're
not protecting ourselves from the sun

687
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:16,490
anymore.
So they turned white

688
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,590
but did the same exact thing.

689
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,590
They can take that guy from in the guy
from Africa and this guy needs a part.

690
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,640
Hey, let me just switch it up
with me. This gentleman here,

691
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,720
Graham Hancock was on my podcast last
week and he's a brilliant, brilliant guy,

692
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:37,800
but he studies ancient civilizations
and people and one of the things that

693
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,590
they're studying now is,
um,

694
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,130
the various civilizations that we didn't
even know existed that existed in South

695
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:45,510
America.
Like huge,

696
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,840
multimillion size of population
civilizations in the Amazon,

697
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,450
like 20 million people living in
the Amazon at one point in time.

698
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:59,190
And they think they were wiped out by
Spanish explorers and European explorers

699
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,570
that came over game smallpox,

700
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,600
like the way they wiped out
90% of the native Americans.

701
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,930
They think the same thing happened
down there in the Amazon. It just,

702
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,340
they had huge cities down there that
European settlers had reported on.

703
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,530
They were just wiped out.
But the point is that we were,

704
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,700
we were everywhere and it's all one thing.
It's all human.

705
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,070
It is human race.
That's it man.

706
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,200
And the funny thing about white people
that are racist is that especially like

707
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:28,370
I have a neanderthal DNA
that's more primitive than
homosapien DNA and it's only

708
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:33,360
in white people. Like, it's kind
of funny that way. You know,

709
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,310
cause white white racists,

710
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,940
like they have to deal with the fact
that the only white people carry that in

711
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:39,700
the end are tall shit.

712
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,533
No,

713
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,330
I don't think that they would find that
a bad thing right at the end to talk to

714
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,670
you. Ain't no, I think they'd
be hell. Yeah. Oh right. Yeah.

715
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,130
Well they weren't smart enough to
stick around for whatever reason.

716
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:57,190
I don't even know why.
You know,

717
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,350
they don't know if we outbred them or we
interbred with them or if we wiped them

718
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,910
out. They don't even know. They're also
finding new humans that there's a human,

719
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,500
they found in Russia called a Dennis,

720
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,240
I think it's called Dennis
Olan is that he's had,

721
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,730
and they just found more
bones of them in Tibet.

722
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,190
So they know that these Russian people,

723
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:19,191
that was a totally distinct subspecies
of human travel travel to Tibet.

724
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,150
Yeah. And neanderthals lived
for half a million years,

725
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,980
so they were around way longer than we've,
uh,

726
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,010
we've only been around I
think for a couple hundred
thousand years. Homo, yeah. So

727
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,360
they were around longer than us.

728
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:35,830
Like by a factor of like somewhere
around 300,000 years. Yeah.

729
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:39,220
All over the world, man. Just
what a crazy animal we are.

730
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,990
We just travel everywhere and find
a spot and adapt. That's right.

731
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,050
We make it stay in a community so he
could help each other and live off each

732
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:50,740
other and adapt.

733
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:53,820
And unfortunately that's where all
of tribalism comes from to that,

734
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:57,490
that we have this tight knit group and
everybody else, fuck everybody else.

735
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:00,850
It's US versus them. And
that's inside of us. You know,

736
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,220
wouldn't it? Wouldn't
it be great? And, and,

737
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:09,330
and this is why I don't
think that it's wrong.

738
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,340
If you're a attacking guy,

739
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,210
I don't think it's wrong to be
very proud of being Italian. I,

740
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:19,120
and if you're a Polish guy,
I don't think it's, uh,

741
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,310
wrong to be very proud of being posed.

742
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,640
Why can't I be proud?

743
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,910
Or why can't you be proud of
being whatever race you are?

744
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,830
You can be proud of that.

745
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:34,831
But there's that mean that I have to
hate another guy because he's not,

746
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,580
no. The racing game, you can be
proud of what you are and not hate.

747
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,580
Another guy for being different
than what you are. How?

748
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,280
How about we give daddy tried?

749
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,550
Well, I think the feeling that you
got from the second chance on life,

750
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:53,110
this beautiful feeling of appreciation
and celebration of, of this existence,

751
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,760
that's what we need to try to
foster in people. Try to like,

752
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:01,780
let people know this is, this
is a temporary thing, man.

753
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,140
If you're lucky, like we were talking
about a hundred years. If you're lucky,

754
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,460
you get to a hundred years. I'm 51 I'm
halfway there, right? If I'm lucky,

755
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:12,550
if everything works out perfect and
it probably isn't, let's be honest.

756
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,380
Beat the shit out of my body.
Right?

757
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,300
So it's probably not going to
make it want to make it to be,

758
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,440
obviously it was what's
up. I do because I, I'm a,

759
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,700
I'm a science nerd. I'm, I'm,

760
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:25,420
I'm fascinated by all these three
d printed hearts and all this shit.

761
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,450
I want to see what the fuck they can do.
I really think,

762
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,650
and talking to guys like David Sinclair
and all these anti aging specialist,

763
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,450
I think they're on the verge of being
able to reverse aging that they're

764
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:39,520
treating aging like it's a disease.

765
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,690
It's a disease at the cellular
level instead of accepting
it and that like, wow,

766
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,510
you get older, hey, you're
going to have to accept,

767
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:49,690
you can't do as much by is not
going to work as well. Why?

768
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,640
Maybe that's not the case.

769
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,970
Maybe if they can correct certain
things about the human body,

770
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,990
maybe they can correct that and I think
it's very likely that in the future,

771
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,750
I don't think that's an
insurmountable is a situation.

772
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:04,960
I think they're gonna be able to correct.
What happens to your body when it ages,

773
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,440
the deterioration that's
caused by the aging process.

774
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,630
Your body produces less hormones, your
body starts to slow down, all timers,

775
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,464
all these different things.

776
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,000
I think they're going to be able
to correct those things. Wow.

777
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,120
The problem with that is then what?
We're going to live forever.

778
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,810
You gotta be happy living forever. Like
what if when you die, it's amazing.

779
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,160
What if when you died,
there really is a heaven.

780
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,660
You really,

781
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,660
we really do go to some spectacular
dimension filled with love and peace and

782
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:39,890
happiness. And there's no
emotions like we think about here.

783
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,550
There's no fear. There's not none
of the things that hold people back.

784
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:47,270
None of the anxiety and the angst
is just consciousness and love.

785
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,270
And then you're wasting your time here.
Just trying to stay alive,

786
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,790
taking pills to live to be a million

787
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,430
boy. You open up big ass can
of worms, right fit. Well,

788
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,120
I will tell you, um, Joe,

789
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,480
without a shadow of a doubt.
None whatsoever.

790
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,850
Death is not the end. You don't
think so? I know, I know too.

791
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,930
How do you know, cause I've been
dead, right? Yes, I've been there.

792
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,590
What about that experience
cemented in your head?

793
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:27,450
Um, when I, like I said,

794
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:32,440
it was the most peaceful.
Um,

795
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,740
and, and I, I don't feel like it
was the most peace, most restful,

796
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:42,150
most I was, I woke up laughing. I was,

797
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,730
yeah. Yeah. Ma, I was
overjoyed. You woke up,

798
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:51,070
laugh.
I was over to it.

799
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,960
You remember anything about what happened
when you blacked out a street at the

800
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:59,730
time? Extremely peaceful. Extreme.

801
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,090
I didn't have a worry.
Extremely true.

802
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,200
And I was not sad at all.
You know,

803
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:11,730
I was overjoyed, very
happy, very peaceful,

804
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,390
and it erased any fear
that I might have had.

805
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,070
And I, and, and any fear of dying is gone.

806
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:27,570
I don't feel that at all.
It so I made that.

807
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:30,060
Maybe that's why I didn't want to
live to be a hundred, cause I mean,

808
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:32,730
I wouldn't mind visiting that place again,
man.

809
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:37,680
It was so much peace so much and
it wasn't like, you know, um,

810
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,470
this is, you know, I'm just in the ground.

811
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,310
I'm a and I'm not a plant, uh, just

812
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,400
dirt,
you know,

813
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,920
I know that I'm in a very
comfortable place and,

814
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,700
and you know, I wouldn't mind
visiting again. I wouldn't mind.

815
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,040
So I'll definitely, I hold no fear
it. And so when I say that it's,

816
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,630
it's definitely not the end. You're,
I believe that your soul, you know,

817
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,270
so people have a different name
for consciousness of whatever.

818
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,250
It's definitely eternal and it has.

819
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,270
How else could you have these
feelings or emotions or you know,

820
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,070
they had that,
that sort of comfort,

821
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:24,660
the feeling of comfort and being in
the right place if something didn't

822
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:29,010
continue. Cause my life, my wife was gone.
The essence of life, my, my bindings,

823
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,880
you know, God, it was gone
flat line dead with him.

824
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,040
I told my doctor that died. He said, no,

825
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,940
actually it's called some kind of Paul's
or some shit like that. And I'm saying,

826
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:42,660
look, if I, if the pause lasted
doc, I wouldn't be talking to him.

827
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,640
So I call it a pause. Like, Oh,

828
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:51,060
well during that Paul's,
I was dead. So, uh,

829
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,160
it's, it was a wonderful feeling to,
well I think with a guy like you,

830
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,480
so physical and you've been
so physical your whole life,

831
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:04,280
the big fears to not be able to take
care of yourself or move like that's what

832
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:06,860
we're talking about when you
talk about being a hundred,

833
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,650
like having someone wipe your
ass and take care of you.

834
00:54:09,651 --> 00:54:14,270
Like that's the big fear is not death.
Death is just peaceful. It's the end.

835
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,300
But the, the big fear is the
deterioration of the physical body to them

836
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,440
point where it's just
painful, everything's painful
and you can't go anywhere.

837
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:26,790
You can't count on
yourself. Yeah. It's uh,

838
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,410
it's very peaceful,

839
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:33,411
but I definitely don't think it's
the end I made just the beginning.

840
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,970
Yeah. Yep. And that's a,

841
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,740
it's an overwhelming feeling.
Like I had,

842
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,820
I was able to peek over into the other
side and that is definitely assurance

843
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:53,040
that it's not the ends and that there
is something else on the other side.

844
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:57,660
I have that assurance is able to
pick it, just peek into it. Well,

845
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,260
I think we all have this feeling that
we are something other than our body.

846
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,213
Most definitely.

847
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:02,701
I mean,
I,

848
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:06,970
I have that feeling like I feel like
there's like a little ball of energy in

849
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:11,620
there that moves this thing around,
but that's what it feels like.

850
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,080
And it always feels like
that. Yeah. That's what I,

851
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:18,400
I've always rejected the label atheist.
Like people say, are you religious?

852
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:22,890
I'm like, I was, when I was a little kid,
I had to go to Catholic school and I,

853
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:26,800
you know, I did all that jazz, but my
parents when I grew up were hippies.

854
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,960
After that,
my mom split up from my dad.

855
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,730
My mom shacked up with
my stepfather who was a,

856
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,530
he's a hippie and there was no,
no church after that.

857
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,140
But I'm not an atheist. I'm
not, I don't know. Like I,

858
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:44,150
I don't believe anybody that says they
know what life is or what life means or

859
00:55:46,571 --> 00:55:49,480
what happens when you die.
I want to hear your opinions.

860
00:55:49,481 --> 00:55:51,640
I want to hear your thoughts,
but you don't know.

861
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,640
And anybody that says they know
what happens when they die.

862
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:59,350
I know what happens when I die. It'll be
black and, and cold. And that is the end.

863
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,010
And just like there was nothing before,
there'll be nothing at the end. And like,

864
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:05,860
you don't know that. Yeah, you're
just saying that there is no god.

865
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,440
How do you say that? How do
you say that? Well, one day,

866
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:12,910
what have you stand in front of
God or, uh, in, in God's presence.

867
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,750
And some nonphysical form. And then
you're, you're weeping and, and your,

868
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,010
your arrogance and s say,
stating that there's no higher power.

869
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:25,060
Like it might be the, the
universe might be God. I mean,

870
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:26,530
we don't know anything.

871
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,890
We are strange little monkey people
living on this fucking planet,

872
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:35,710
making things that alter our
environment and moving around,

873
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:39,550
drive and fly and talking to each other,
talking shit. But at the end of the day,

874
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:44,080
you're only aware of what you've
experienced and when you don't know,

875
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,170
that's like when people have had,
I've,

876
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,550
I've talked to several friends at
vet near death experiences. Um,

877
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,440
a very good friend of mine,
she,

878
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:54,160
she was in a car accident and she had a
very similar thing where she said it was

879
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,250
so peaceful. Yeah. She
said, you know, they got,

880
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:02,610
I think they got rear ended and like
really bagged up and when it felt like she

881
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:07,090
was gonna die,
she felt so peaceful.

882
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,010
It's so true. Yeah. We got
a lot of people get, uh,

883
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,080
have come that close to dying. Uh, are a
lot of them are gonna say the same thing,

884
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:22,000
that they have no fear of death anymore.
It's the raised and uh,

885
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:24,190
you, you put two, you also have
the feminine back. You know,

886
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,910
that this existence on earth,
you when your physical body,

887
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,800
it's definitely not the end.

888
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,290
And the way she describes it
as exactly the way you do.

889
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,970
She's my manager and you know,
I talk to her all the time.

890
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,530
The way she describes things is
essentially exactly how you did that.

891
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,400
It's just so peaceful. Just
felt, just felt peaceful. Yeah.

892
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,060
But Mac, uh, you know, like

893
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:52,650
black people who don't believe
in back there. Uh, by the way,

894
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,980
let me, and let me say I'm
not religious either. Yeah.

895
00:57:55,981 --> 00:58:00,981
I was raised super religious in
a super religious home by a us,

896
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:07,030
a pentacostal a heaven or hell brimstone
and fire and brimstone preacher and

897
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,990
they do the tongues. Oh
yes. Oh, that's hilarious.

898
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,720
Shower and uh, speaking in
tongues, everything, everything.

899
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,070
Everything was a sin all summer
where everybody, oh, dancing.

900
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:24,150
Dancing was listening to rock
and roll music. Yeah. Oh yeah.

901
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,370
Everything was us.

902
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,590
So I think that's really what drove
me away from being a religious person.

903
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,470
I'm definitely not,
I always say I'm a man of faith.

904
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,200
I have a tremendous amount of faith,

905
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,490
but faith and religion are two different
things. A lot of people confuse them.

906
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,520
Yeah. They, they talk about
him as being the same,

907
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,840
but they are definitely not a
religious man makes and you know,

908
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,580
a set of rules. It makes it, okay,

909
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:53,130
we're going to be this and if
you want to be this religion,

910
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:57,780
then you're gonna have to go by these
rules. And it's, it's, it's all man made,

911
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:01,380
but faith is not me and me.
And so I'm a tremendous man of faith,

912
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:02,820
but not religion.

913
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,060
Yeah. Some would say that like
you're a spiritual person.

914
00:59:06,061 --> 00:59:09,030
That's like a thing that gets thrown
around today. Like I'm not religious,

915
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:12,000
but I'm spiritual. People say that
a lot. Like what does that mean?

916
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,090
No one really knows.
It's a strange sort of definition,

917
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:17,910
but I feel what you're saying that
there's something more to this.

918
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:22,700
There's something more to this than just
tissue and bone and blood moving on.

919
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:26,450
This rock that's traveling through
the universe. There's something more,

920
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,920
there's something, there's
something, there's some,

921
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,440
and maybe it's just something more for us,

922
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,060
but the beauty of friendship
and love and family,

923
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,340
like those things are intense,

924
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,810
beautiful emotional experiences that I,
I don't,

925
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,280
I don't know. They seem to
transcend just regular life itself.

926
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,570
They seem to have a, there is a higher
power to them, a higher beauty to them.

927
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,540
I think that's one of the things that
we'd like when we see people doing

928
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:58,490
something really great. We
love seeing people accomplish
things cause we, we love,

929
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:03,690
we liked seeing people succeed. We like
seeing people like that have doubts and,

930
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:03,911
and,

931
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:08,600
and something almost insurmountable and
incredibly difficult in front of them.

932
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,650
And then they,

933
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:13,760
they overcome and it gives us all hope
and it gives us all like this inspiration

934
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:16,970
that's feeling. We're connected in
some sort of very, very strange way.

935
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,750
But I think you could just chalk it
up. Oh, that's just comradery needed.

936
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:24,110
That because of evolution. That's how
we stayed alive. Like maybe, maybe,

937
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,430
but maybe there's something else.

938
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,210
Maybe the whatever this
consciousness is that's totally not,

939
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,040
no one has ever defined consciousness.

940
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,830
And there's certain people that think
that it occurs only in the brain and the

941
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:38,390
neurons and the synapses and it might war.
That might just be an antenna.

942
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,940
I mean consciousness might very well be,

943
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,480
you are using your physical tissue
to tune in to whatever this,

944
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,950
this thing that we share is this
life force that we all seem to share.

945
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,180
And when you win this, I think like
looking in someone's eyes, man,

946
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,310
like when,

947
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:01,730
when you know someone's like there for
you and you know you're there for them,

948
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,680
like that comradery, that intense
camaraderie, this, he's just like that,

949
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,510
that the expression,
the windows to the soul,

950
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:11,930
that the eyes are the windows to the soul.
It really does seem like that. Right?

951
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:16,910
Like you see people, you
see them, you know, like the
Avatar Lady said, I see you.

952
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,560
Yeah. Yeah you can. It's I'm

953
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:26,040
looking at, they didn't to look in this
in my anxieties. You can tell a lot.

954
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,400
You can tell if they're bullshit.
Yes, they're full of shit or not.

955
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,940
Or if they feel weird about something
you can secure and maybe they feel like

956
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,820
maybe this isn't a smart thing or maybe,
maybe,

957
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:38,620
maybe I should've done better by you.

958
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:43,180
Yeah. Maybe fucked you over. Yeah.
You can tell that. And I, uh,

959
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,800
I, I, I told her first,
first time I had the, uh, uh,

960
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:52,750
open heart surgery and flatlined
three times during that surgery.

961
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,770
I also had an experience,
um,

962
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,160
that also strengthens my belief in there
being something after the body dies,

963
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,800
I gazing or whatever you
want to call it. Uh, okay.

964
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,790
I see.
I see.

965
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:14,790
I was able to see my mother who had
passed away the year before and uh,

966
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,850
you know, I say I see my
mother, I'd add, see her face.

967
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:23,910
I heard a voice and I knew it was
her and she was pleading to a,

968
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,190
I say, God, a lot of people
may say, you know what,

969
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,360
whatever they look up to and I
ain't got no problem with that.

970
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,590
I don't think that, uh, because
people don't believe exactly like,

971
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,050
I believe that they're doom
and they're going to hell.

972
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,130
Although that was the way I was raised,
or if you don't believe like this, I mean,

973
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,730
all Catholics, when,
when I'm coaching my dad,

974
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,700
all Catholics were just lost.

975
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:55,140
They're not gonna make it because they
don't believe they believe the wrong shit.

976
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:56,950
Ain't no fuck that.
Don't bleed right shit there.

977
01:02:56,951 --> 01:03:01,130
So of course they're not going to
make it about Jews. I'll go right.

978
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,820
If you don't believe,
like this is fucked up,

979
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,510
just lost man fucked off
man. Oh, you'll get it.

980
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:14,120
Specially you're especially lost and
that they, you know, but that's how they,

981
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,610
that's how they felt. That's how I was
talking to yesterday. And that just,

982
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,260
you know, I don't believe that you
can't, you got this, uh, my dad was,

983
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,700
some people they found, my dad
thought that he could walk on water,

984
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,870
he could do no wrong, and it's the
same guy that you knew. So, you know,

985
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,780
break my nose and send me to the
fucking emergency room kicking my ass.

986
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:37,940
And my mom was a slave and that
was perfectly fine with him. And,

987
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,760
and also this was the guy who
was fucking women in the church.

988
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,980
But you don't believe like,
I believe you're going to hell.

989
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:51,040
Yeah. People have a remarkable ability
to be hypocrites. Yeah. There's soup.

990
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,420
And I seen that so much
from super religious people.

991
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:01,250
They didn't just turn me off from
being a religious person. Well,

992
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:04,860
I think a lot of what it is is control.
People want to control the people.

993
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,860
They want to be able to tell people
what to do and when to do it.

994
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:11,850
And it gives them some power in
their own life by doing so. Yeah,

995
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,460
man, I that just a, you
know, it destroyed my, uh,

996
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:22,080
um, faith and just super, you know,

997
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,280
people that are in church every Sunday,
every Tuesday.

998
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,860
We went to church three
times a week for three times,

999
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:30,990
three times every Tuesday,
every Friday.

1000
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:34,200
And every Sunday in church and churches.
I mean,

1001
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,610
during the watts riots, I'm a
little kid. We went to church.

1002
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,140
Wow. Yeah. The guy that soldiers
are national guard on the streets.

1003
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:47,800
They pulled my dad over and a little kid
in the back seat. What are you going, uh,

1004
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,560
I'm going to church and I'm like, fuck
these guys, this tanks on the street.

1005
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:57,180
This guy's got fucking MCS 16
and asked him and my dad's like,

1006
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,660
we're going to church. I'm like,
fuck, could you leave us at home?

1007
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,810
We leave. I want to be at home looking
at fucking Heco with Japanese cartoons,

1008
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:11,700
man. I don't want to fucking be it.
Got Man. We went to church, man.

1009
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,740
So he was super dedicated,
you know, to, you know,

1010
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:20,910
pardon was super dedicated to what
he believed. And then, um, you know,

1011
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,920
it'd be go over the sisters Sally's
house to give her consultation and I'm

1012
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,820
looking in the room,

1013
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:32,821
her bedroom doors open as my dad would
just fucking [inaudible] sister Sally's

1014
01:05:33,171 --> 01:05:34,570
in her slip and shit.

1015
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:40,050
And I guess me and my brother was there
to be as a scape goat or you know,

1016
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:42,900
he's, excuse my mom, you know,
if I take them and you know,

1017
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:46,960
nothing could be going on wrong, right?
Like I still remember that shit. Fuck.

1018
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:49,050
What kind of castle tasting is he doing?

1019
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:51,913
All right.

1020
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,830
I think right now we're experiencing
some of the most insidious aspects of a,

1021
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:01,831
of religion in the people attacking
people while they're worshiping Muslims

1022
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:05,450
attacking Christians and
Christians attacking Muslims.

1023
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:09,650
And it's like in synagogues and
Christians attacking Jews. I mean it's,

1024
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,030
the whole thing is so insane.

1025
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,550
While they're worshiping,
it is insane.

1026
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,930
This sign of how fucked up things are
right now that this is something that's

1027
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:21,520
happening on a regular basis now

1028
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:24,620
in the name of religion.
I mean doesn't,

1029
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:30,260
I mean what kind of religion
would you know say this is okay?

1030
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:34,760
I mean, aren't we supposed to
love thy neighbor as thyself?

1031
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,860
I mean the,
the Christ church one you could not,

1032
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,190
it's hard to even say that
that was about religion.

1033
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:44,930
There's more about bigotry and
racism and anything. Right.

1034
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:49,260
And then the response to that is what
you're seeing in Sri Lanka and you know,

1035
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:53,670
people blowing people up and in
churches and synagogues and it's just,

1036
01:06:53,671 --> 01:06:55,770
it's insane. It's a, it's just, we've,

1037
01:06:55,771 --> 01:07:00,771
we've reached this very critical moment
in our society and just civilization in

1038
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:07,200
general where people are attacking
people for things that they believe in,

1039
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:12,810
which is one of the most insane things
to attack people on and not attack people

1040
01:07:13,201 --> 01:07:16,050
because they're aggressive because
they're coming towards you.

1041
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:20,250
They're trying to take away your, your
resources or harm your family. No, no, no.

1042
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,760
They believe the wrong.

1043
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:26,960
Yeah. Which one? The Kelo. Yeah. They
don't believe like hundreds of them

1044
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,000
since Saturday. I mean, it doesn't
have to know how to fix it.

1045
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,520
I thought the overriding principle
of most every religion is love.

1046
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,890
Yeah.
I posted to be low.

1047
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:47,520
I thought all of them taught me love.

1048
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,410
Isn't that the overriding
principle of religion?

1049
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,430
Your religion?
Doesn't it teach you to love people?

1050
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,910
If you're really to teach you to hate
people to go out and kill people,

1051
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,400
then something's fucked.

1052
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,880
Yeah. Yeah. It's supposed to
be reinforcing this idea of,

1053
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:10,120
of community, of we're all together
working towards a goal that's wrong.

1054
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:15,080
Yeah. It's, uh, I mean it's
some, I mean, there's so many,

1055
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,940
right? There's so many issues
with, uh, with poverty, with crime,

1056
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:22,430
with all these different things
in this world today. But the,

1057
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,460
the religion issue and the hatred,

1058
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,920
hatred of other people's
Religions has gotta be one of the,

1059
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:31,340
one of the strangest aspects of
our community or our cultures.

1060
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,280
It's so crazy, man. I, man, I,

1061
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,360
I just want to do everything that
I possibly can possibly can do.

1062
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:43,290
And I, you know, I'm just a little
guy from Compton. Nobody knows me.

1063
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:48,060
Nobody knew who the fuck is CP fucker
ain't nobody but whatever I can possibly

1064
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:50,700
do to try to bring people together,
man,

1065
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:54,690
let it just come together and
lobby that I had, it's this thing,

1066
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:59,010
we're all the same under the bar. That's
my equivalent of trying to, you know,

1067
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:03,630
bring people in. A weightlifting says
a similar thing from all the same.

1068
01:09:03,631 --> 01:09:08,430
We're all brothers and sisters on the
maths. Sadly. That's exactly what it is.

1069
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,510
That's,

1070
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:13,560
that's a thing sometimes you know, when
someone has like this common struggle,

1071
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,700
like, like you find out a lot about
someone when you lift with them, right?

1072
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,460
When you know that they can do 10 and
they can start pitching out at seven like,

1073
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:25,050
come on Bro, steer your spirit. Come on.

1074
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:26,770
I mean that's,
that's similar in,

1075
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,610
I mean marathon runners have
that sort of camaraderie,

1076
01:09:29,611 --> 01:09:33,510
that feeling like what if someone can
can actually complete marathons and then

1077
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,470
ultra marathons.
If you have the girl doesn't know it,

1078
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,530
no one gives a fuck of your Chinese
or black or a girl or a boy,

1079
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,640
you're a bad motherfucker or you are not.
If you are not,

1080
01:09:44,641 --> 01:09:49,470
you should work towards becoming one.
Yeah. I mean that's MMA, right? Yeah.

1081
01:09:49,471 --> 01:09:50,910
That's martial arts in general.

1082
01:09:50,911 --> 01:09:54,060
I mean it's all about a vehicle for
developing your human potential.

1083
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,250
I've always said that one of the best
ways to stop bullying and stop all this,

1084
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,780
I mean it sounds counterproductive
and counterintuitive,

1085
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:05,130
but that's stop bullying. Teach
kids how to fight. They won't fuck.

1086
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,360
They won't do that man. I mean and the the
ones who are the strongest, they won't,

1087
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,510
they won't have this need to
impose on people. They don't.

1088
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,490
That doesn't exist in Jujitsu
the way it exists in, in,

1089
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:21,770
in kids because kids are insecure and
they have this weapon being bigger or

1090
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:25,890
being mean or, or being more
aggressive and scaring kids. And they,

1091
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,410
they see someone intimidated and they
can't help himself because they don't have

1092
01:10:28,411 --> 01:10:30,210
any guidance. They don't have, they don't.

1093
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:34,260
No one's taught them the proper way to
behave and think and then no one's taught

1094
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:38,340
them the consequences of that shitty
behavior and thinking they just get away

1095
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,940
with it. They do it and they don't think
that it's hurting anybody or they don't,

1096
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,180
they don't care. They don't feel it
yet, but just numb to it. They're not,

1097
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:49,590
they're not, they haven't been taught.
No, there have not been taught this is,

1098
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:52,210
this is the way that I can stand out.
Yeah.

1099
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:57,090
And a lot of it is because
like they need a real cause.

1100
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,023
They need a real,

1101
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,320
something real to work towards
instead of like looking for conflict.

1102
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:05,130
And some fucking kid is looking at
you at the bus stop, weird. Look for,

1103
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,170
find real conflict,

1104
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:11,040
find something that you could really
work towards and you'll feel better about

1105
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,920
yourself and you'll feel better about
the way you communicate other people.

1106
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,310
It's one of the reasons why a
lot of people talk about Jujitsu,

1107
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,430
like it's a religion.

1108
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,910
And in some ways I think it kind of is
because you learn not in the bad ways,

1109
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:27,390
but in the good way is that you learn
this sense of community through struggle.

1110
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:31,020
Right. I think the same thing could
be said for weightlifters too.

1111
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,870
There's a bond you guys,
man, and it's, it translates,

1112
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:41,200
it's sold.
Maybe MMA guys that you know,

1113
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,200
have come through the Amtrak train,
uh,

1114
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,490
worked out and it's so relatable.

1115
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:52,000
Good weightlifting her of
the fighting world. Uh,

1116
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,690
except for not getting busted upside
the head when you're in the gym.

1117
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:58,860
But that struggle though. Yeah. This truck
I saw when you trained Tyron Woodley.

1118
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,620
Oh Man. Sort of struggle. Yeah. Yeah.

1119
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,870
And He's another dude that
looks like he's on steroids,

1120
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,500
but he's not answering me.
Just,

1121
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,860
he got that fucking beautiful roll of
the dice and Jane had a girl the dice.

1122
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,020
That's exactly right. And by the
way, Tyrone, if you're listening,

1123
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,630
you would have not been back.

1124
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,380
And I worked like for you to come back
to do the type of fighting that he does

1125
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,340
though. You can't really lift
the way you had them left
all the time. No, no, no, no,

1126
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,840
no, no. Uh, no.

1127
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:32,870
It would just be a incorporates most most
fires just choose a weight lifting as

1128
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:36,420
a tool. Yeah. And just when they come,

1129
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,560
they want to test themselves when they
come and train with me this time I just

1130
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:48,310
want to see and what I do, I can
take, it can take you to nine,

1131
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,650
you know, motherfucking side
no matter what. No matter what.

1132
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:53,380
And knows.

1133
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:58,380
Those guys do really well because it's
so much mental chore involved in it,

1134
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,560
you know? And, and they,
they're the mind to tough.

1135
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,860
Even make guys minds are tougher.
Nick. They do real well. No,

1136
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:08,940
you don't get tougher. It just, you just
got off. You just get different, you know,

1137
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:11,910
I mean, like I said about
ultra marathon runners or any,

1138
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,780
anybody who does anything that's
extremely grueling and brutal. You don't,

1139
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:19,380
you don't get taught for you just to
find a different different path. Exactly.

1140
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:22,270
That's sort of tough and
it always leaks through.

1141
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:26,970
The mine they passed always leaks through
the mind, man, that whole expression,

1142
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:29,640
that idle hands are the devil's
play things. That's so true.

1143
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,850
That's so goddamn true.
People need, they need,

1144
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:35,430
sometimes they need a cause and
you just struggle. They need,

1145
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,660
they need something hard.

1146
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,750
They need something difficult to define
themselves through. If they don't,

1147
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,990
they just,
they get scattered and insecure and crazy.

1148
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:46,930
But through that struggle you, you
gained confidence and character. You,

1149
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:49,620
you know who you are. I'm like, no man.

1150
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,100
You could pull off a workout
with CT Fletcher at the
end of that fucking workout

1151
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:58,210
and you sitting there on that bench
drinking water. I know. Who the fuck

1152
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,290
did it? People need to know that they
did it. Yeah. Need that they need,

1153
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:07,770
I did it. You need, I did it all the time.
You need, I did it like five days a week.

1154
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,890
It's true. If I take a couple
of days off, I feel like, man,

1155
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,790
I gotta go do something. I
don't feel bad. Yeah. Too Bad.

1156
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,620
I still won't do the shit in the
had to kick I show. Yeah, man.

1157
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:23,410
Right now it's slow.
They cover a little more.

1158
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,670
The good thing is, the best
way to learn is slow. Oh,

1159
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:32,140
well I'm ready to tackle the
real slow. Yeah. The people,

1160
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:35,890
the real problem with strong people is
that they want to put their strength into

1161
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:40,610
it, you know, and you know, you want to
like really just fucking drunk. Yeah.

1162
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,280
It's a hard for strong dudes to learn
how to kick properly. It really is.

1163
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,490
It's a perfect time for Peter Marino.
Take tickets.

1164
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:52,420
They put so much grunt into everything.
Oftentimes they're not pivoting,

1165
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:56,170
so they put too much pressure on their
leg. They want to pop in their knee. Yeah.

1166
01:14:56,171 --> 01:15:00,960
I mean there's a lot, a lot
of shit kicking man. Sick. God

1167
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,260
chill.

1168
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:09,260
He's got some of the meetings kicks
I have ever seen from anybody.

1169
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:14,820
I'm like, I didn't know you could kick
it. Fuck it. It's a funny thing. Um,

1170
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:19,390
there's a guy named John Dawn her
who's a Jujitsu genius and uh,

1171
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:23,470
he came to me once and it turned out he
actually knew, but he was playing it off.

1172
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:24,304
Like he didn't know.

1173
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:28,600
He was telling me that he wanted George
St Pierre who is the champion of the

1174
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:30,410
time.
I know of my,

1175
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:37,180
they wanted him to get some coaching
on his, a spinning back kick.

1176
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:40,450
There was like a, he's a, he thinks
the fundamentals are a little bit off.

1177
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:44,440
Do you know anybody? And I was like,
alright, this is gonna sound crazy.

1178
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,310
I know I'm a comedian and a no,
I'm just a commentator, but I,

1179
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,470
I have a really good spinning back.
I'm like,

1180
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:53,230
I could show you how to do it and I
can show you as good as any human being

1181
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:57,250
that's ever lived. I'm like, I could show
you how to do that. That was my shit.

1182
01:15:57,251 --> 01:16:00,310
I mean, but when I was
a kid, man, I, you know,

1183
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,780
it's hard for me to even talk about it
now because it seems like a different

1184
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:05,500
life,

1185
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:10,500
like a different person for from the time
I was 15 till I was 21 I was obsessed.

1186
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:15,760
I trained all day, every day.
I mean, that's what I did.

1187
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:20,560
I basically lived there and so that's
why I developed all that opp station.

1188
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:25,900
They say it's a bad word. I don't
think so. No. The find my life.

1189
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,470
It's about life, you know? I
mean, I've had a good life.

1190
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,060
I've had a good life through obsession

1191
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,680
now coined that phrase. I'm
also at a good rifle. Shit.

1192
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,660
I'm careful with that shit.
Like a bad dog.

1193
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:43,750
I keep that motherfucker on a leash and
I keep it away from the wrong people.

1194
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:50,350
Got some good savings. You have
to be careful. Like Jamie knows,

1195
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,690
we've been having problems
with his goddamn quake game.

1196
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,130
We play play this video games,
first person shooter called quake,

1197
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,950
and I have a real problem. I
get obsessed with things. Well,

1198
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:03,670
I want to play all day long.
I want to play fucking eight,
10 hours a day. I can't,

1199
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:06,400
I don't allow myself to,
but that's the same thing.

1200
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:09,830
It's the same thing that got me
into martial when I was a kid.

1201
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,060
I have a fucked up brain,
but it's fucked up in a good it.

1202
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:16,730
As long as I know how to guide it,
as long as the,

1203
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:21,040
the managers in the building and the
manager is me right now going, hey,

1204
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,220
settle the fuck down. All right. You
got shit to do. You've got a family.

1205
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,073
Got Stuff to do.

1206
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,110
You can't just go run off
and decide you're going to
be a professional this or a

1207
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,510
professional dad because that's
what my brain wants to do.

1208
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,450
My brain wants to find something
and go with what's this thing? Okay,

1209
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,440
what's the be the best in the world?

1210
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,570
We're going to be the best in the
world test. This is what this is.

1211
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:42,140
Every day you're gonna wake up and didn't
know, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1212
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:44,100
I got pay taxes.
You got shit.

1213
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,960
I fucking love it too because
you are not alone now.

1214
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:54,890
There's a bunch of us,
a whole lot of them were in the UFC.

1215
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:59,180
Yeah. It's a whole lot of mouth.
Their jobs running crazy going crazy.

1216
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:01,940
Like tapping the things on the desk just
can't wait to get at to what the fuck

1217
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:03,200
they want to do when they get off work.

1218
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,850
Ain't that something fucking 28
years at the post office man.

1219
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:10,140
I hate thinking about,

1220
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,480
you know, go do what I really yeah. Yeah.

1221
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,510
It's a lot of people out there listening
that have that same feeling. Oh Man.

1222
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:25,070
Punching the clock every day
and they fucking hate it.
You know, you're not alone.

1223
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,440
Not alone years. I hated it whenever
I had a job, whatever job I had,

1224
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:31,191
I fucking hated that.

1225
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:35,100
And I had a bunch of part time bullshit
jobs cause I wouldn't take a real job on

1226
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:38,750
because I was so scared that if I had
like a real nine to five and then started

1227
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:42,530
getting a career and then have a family
got married, they trapped, dropped.

1228
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,970
I was in, that was me. I was definitely
trapping and kids at home and had to eat.

1229
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:48,890
So yeah, nothing you got to, I mean,

1230
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,730
and then you take that time when you get
off and that's your obsession time then.

1231
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,390
Yeah. I mean there's a lot of people
that live that life, you know,

1232
01:18:55,391 --> 01:18:59,150
and but I've always tell people is
before you have all those other things,

1233
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,970
a mortgage and family and
all that other stuff, damn.

1234
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:06,780
To funnel that energy into you to
what you like. You could live up

1235
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:13,110
wonderful existence and charmed
life if you could do what I mean.

1236
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:13,971
Whatever it is.

1237
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:17,900
What do you like making knives are fucking
painting whatever the fuck you like

1238
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:21,140
to do. If that's your thing and you
think about it all the time, God damn,

1239
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:23,960
you got to find a way to do that.
That is your call.

1240
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,820
Most definitely excellent
advice from Joe Rogan. He's so,

1241
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:33,200
so right. And before you
get, you know the wife,

1242
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:37,350
the kids because then you
trap. Yeah. But the minds,

1243
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,050
everyone's mind is so different.
You know,

1244
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:43,880
there's some people that they don't have
that obsessed mine. Their mind is like,

1245
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:46,800
they're, they're better
off like, you know,

1246
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,220
running a country store somewhere.

1247
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,930
Just being real friendly to people
that come in and being a baker,

1248
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:57,900
making good food for folks. That's their
thing. That's their calling and that,

1249
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:00,830
you know, that's perfectly
fine. It's the people, you know,

1250
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:03,740
people that annoy the fuck out of me.
I love you.

1251
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,830
What's your annoy the fuck out
of me is people that have no,

1252
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,490
no drive whatsoever.
I'm just happy not doing shit.

1253
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:13,990
I always wonder about that.
I was,

1254
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,820
I was wondering like what if I
got them when they were little?

1255
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,440
What if I got ahold of them
when they were little and,

1256
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:23,690
and just introduced them to
exciting things and rewarded
them when they did well

1257
01:20:23,691 --> 01:20:26,240
and high five them and hugged them.
You know what I mean?

1258
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,050
Like it could possibly change

1259
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,030
reinforcement of,

1260
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:36,770
of positive goals and reinforcement
of positive experiences.

1261
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,420
I think there's some people that just,

1262
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,640
they never got any of that and everything
was just work and just drudgery and

1263
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,720
they'd rather just lay around because
that is the alternative to work and

1264
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:48,554
drudgery.

1265
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,513
Wow.
Um,

1266
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:54,890
I gave a a speech and I'm talking about
obsession session and being driven and

1267
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:58,170
all those, and you know, one
of the questions Africans,

1268
01:20:58,171 --> 01:21:01,470
because the guy was asking
me, so, uh, what if you know,

1269
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,560
what if you don't want to do anything,

1270
01:21:03,561 --> 01:21:07,320
you don't have any goals or upsetting,
uh,

1271
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,570
could you tell me how to get one?
And I was like,

1272
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:12,740
fuck,

1273
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:18,950
how do I tell this motherfucker his,
you know,

1274
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:22,480
he won. He Won. He said he won. He
Won. I want to find the goal was him,

1275
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,610
but I don't know you, I
don't know. I don't know.

1276
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:30,920
This the first time I ever met you
and you're asking me how to give you,

1277
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,730
uh, an obsession or, or
make him give you an idea.

1278
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,970
I only thing I can tell you is fine.
Something.

1279
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,150
Do you have anything that you'd love?
Is there anything that you love?

1280
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:43,340
Anything that you'd like to do,
then you know,

1281
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:47,760
start the head start if you it.

1282
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,640
If the person looks back at you and
says, no, not rarely, then I'm like,

1283
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,800
fuck,
this dude is irking the fuck

1284
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,450
you mean you don't have any fucking thing.

1285
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,680
I know some people that have nothing.
Yeah.

1286
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:10,840
Some people it is nothing and there's
nothing. Absolutely. And that, you know,

1287
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:15,080
I you, I love you guys, but um,
he bugged the fuck out of me.

1288
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,160
But just,

1289
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,080
you don't have a calls or go or
nothing that really excites you,

1290
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:27,740
that you really want to make a difference.
You just,

1291
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,690
you're happy being blind,

1292
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:33,170
frayed and fucking every image.

1293
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,380
I just want to be a Kog man.

1294
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,240
I just want to be a fucking car.

1295
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:44,520
World needs cogs. Do you think that some
people are like, here's, here's a thought.

1296
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:47,450
Like not everybody but could be
a fucking psychopath right now.

1297
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,590
Not everybody can be obsessed by things.

1298
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:53,680
The world will be too insane and regular
stuff would never get done. Right.

1299
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,790
You and I aren't getting
regular shit done, you know?

1300
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:59,630
But how about being the
best fucking cock bear is

1301
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:06,040
best fucking cod varies man. I'm going
to support the fuck guy to Joe road.

1302
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,180
Oh Man, I don't know what people, I don't,

1303
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:12,060
I would like to add,

1304
01:23:12,061 --> 01:23:14,520
I think one day we're going to probably
be able to experience this through

1305
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:15,354
technology.

1306
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:19,890
I would like to know how people think
like go well I would like to know like

1307
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:23,850
what is going on in someone's head
when they experience like some,

1308
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:28,110
sometimes things will happen to you
in life and you're just in the worst

1309
01:23:28,111 --> 01:23:31,740
possible state of mind when it happens
and sometimes it's the best possible

1310
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:34,380
state of mind and sometimes when
it's the best possible state of mind,

1311
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:38,040
something that should be like
catastrophic, like Eh, it'll be all right.

1312
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,350
You don't like the person who
did it to you. Like, look man,

1313
01:23:40,351 --> 01:23:43,080
I know he didn't mean to do. It's all
right, don't worry about it. Take it easy.

1314
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,570
And then you just drop it and
you like feel good about it.

1315
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:48,180
And then other times like fuck that guy,
I'm going to fucking kill that guy.

1316
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,280
And it's all like, it's all in
white. How were you wired that day?

1317
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,710
Like what, what's, how
are you coming into it?

1318
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:57,210
You coming into this with a lot of stress,

1319
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,330
you've got a lot of other bullshit
piling up in your life or you coming into

1320
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:05,331
this fresh off a heart transplant where
you feel love for the world and you and

1321
01:24:06,481 --> 01:24:10,710
you have like a new found enlightenment
where you realize that this is all

1322
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:14,910
bullshit, all this nonsense and
fighting and arguing for nothing.

1323
01:24:14,911 --> 01:24:19,710
Like why, why you do you enjoy, relax.

1324
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:20,544
I appreciate

1325
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,190
mad or just think that's serious

1326
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:26,380
passion for your existence
and what you enjoy,

1327
01:24:26,381 --> 01:24:31,060
what you truly love and your friends
and Camaraderie and fellowship.

1328
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:31,923
That's what it's all about.

1329
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:34,090
Yeah. And I think, uh, you know,

1330
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,120
they got a whole field,

1331
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:42,160
the psychologist and psychiatrist who
that's their field and some of the worst,

1332
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,380
uh,

1333
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:49,380
some of the most mentally challenged
people I've ever met were psychiatrist.

1334
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,580
I'm like, what though? Have
a theory about that. Yeah,

1335
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,050
I have a theory about that.
I've theory about that.

1336
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:59,360
That's very similar in my
theory about cops. You know,

1337
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:02,270
I have a deep respect for
cops. Neat too. And uh,

1338
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,030
I think it's insanely difficult job.

1339
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,820
Just same my same feeling
I have for soldiers.

1340
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:13,180
Like you cannot expect someone to
just do that with no guidance and no,

1341
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,960
no. You have to have an
appreciation for this trust.

1342
01:25:17,961 --> 01:25:20,270
They go through every time
a cop pull somebody over,

1343
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,190
this might be the last
moment of their life.

1344
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:25,700
Every time they come to that window and
it's tinted and they don't know who the

1345
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,370
fuck is in there and what kind
of warrant that guy might have.

1346
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:29,720
They don't have any idea.

1347
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:33,590
And we've all seen videos online and cops
getting shot and people getting killed.

1348
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:37,490
It fucking happens. And everyone
they're dealing with is lying to them.

1349
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,850
Everyone they're dealing with is,
if you're a psychiatrist,

1350
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:44,960
every day you're dealing with
people who are fucked every day.

1351
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,240
Everyone's fucked up.
Everyone's and some,

1352
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,810
some of their fucked up is nonsense and
you just want to grab them and shake

1353
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:53,930
them by the call and get your
fucking shit together. Man,

1354
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,710
the fuck is wrong with you. Come on.
You know there's something wrong.

1355
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,070
Stop doing what you're doing stupid.
But you can't even say that,

1356
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:05,750
so you have to go. So Mike, um,
uh, you know, uh, you're, you're,

1357
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:08,930
you're still getting tied up by that
woman and she still kicks in the balls

1358
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,501
because he should,

1359
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:14,930
the people are into like every day
you showing up and everyone's nuts.

1360
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,680
Everyone you work with, you know,
I'm very fortunate. I show up here,

1361
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:20,120
I get to talk to nice people like you.

1362
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:23,930
I hang out with great people like
Jamie and every, everyone's fun here.

1363
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:28,730
It's all nice. My experiences on a
daily basis are very mostly positive.

1364
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:32,120
I go to the comedy store, hanging out
with comedians. Did you do to, hang on?

1365
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:35,540
What'd you do to guys?
It's fun experiences or good experiences.

1366
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:39,740
Psychiatrists are just dealing
with crazy vox all day long.

1367
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:44,160
That's the chosen foggy gap to deal
with next. Yeah. When I was, um,

1368
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,380
when I was briefly

1369
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,080
college,

1370
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,020
one of the things that I was concentrating
on with psychology because I was

1371
01:26:49,021 --> 01:26:50,430
trying to find out what can,

1372
01:26:50,431 --> 01:26:54,450
I knew there was times when I fought and
I was very confident and I knew there

1373
01:26:54,451 --> 01:26:57,480
was times that I felt that it was a
nervous wreck. And I was like, why?

1374
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:01,380
What is that, that feeling of nerves?
Were you scared? It's very compromising.

1375
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,940
If it fucks my performance.
Oh, more guy. Yeah. I mean,
look, you, you might get hit,

1376
01:27:05,941 --> 01:27:10,140
you might lose it. This could happen.
But to dwell on that, it's crippling.

1377
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,290
Like you gotta be able to
accept those consequences,

1378
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:15,690
but you also have to not dwell,
save to be zen.

1379
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,170
And so I was reading a lot of
psychology books and philosophy books,

1380
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,960
a lot of Samurai books.
And um,

1381
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:24,960
but one thing I realized that in
talking to people that were like,

1382
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,210
psychologists are psychology majors.

1383
01:27:27,211 --> 01:27:32,040
Like you're dealing with
fucked up people all the time,

1384
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:35,250
especially psychiatrists.
Oh, fuck up people.

1385
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:36,710
And then they're prescribing
them drug right there.

1386
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,130
You're going to get out of here,
take this.

1387
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:42,740
Yes, we're getting numb. Crazy man.

1388
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:45,640
He was crazy. Very nice
guy, but was great.

1389
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:47,110
I think you get crazy.

1390
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,670
I think you get crazy dealing with all
those people all the time too, man. Yeah.

1391
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,750
I mean,
if your day is blocked off,

1392
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:55,630
you have your secretary and then
you've got patients all day long.

1393
01:27:55,631 --> 01:27:56,710
They're out of their fucking,
yeah.

1394
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:01,610
Yeah. Very good point. It's
a terrible diet, you know.

1395
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,260
But you know, I don't know if
you knew, but I used to, um,

1396
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,890
do tournaments, fighting a
karate style, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1397
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:13,050
And the reason the,

1398
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:17,420
what discouraged me or made me know that
I didn't want to be a Friday was just

1399
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:21,700
what you described,
anxiety. Oh yeah. It would,

1400
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:26,420
it was paralyzing. It was
paralyzing. Yeah. I mean,

1401
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:31,610
I'd be frozen with it. It's,
it's so crazy that I'm going to,

1402
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:32,241
last term,

1403
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:36,890
I was an ed Parker's a international
variety tangling ships in Long Beach,

1404
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:37,724
California.

1405
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:43,270
And I knew they'd fight
until my feet worse stuck.

1406
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,910
And I was a taekwondo black belt,

1407
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:52,320
but my feet were frozen to the fucking
man. I couldn't lift them like an ace.

1408
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:56,780
Wait a thousand pounds each. Me and I
was so paranoid because all these people,

1409
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:59,060
it was always people around.

1410
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:03,570
And I was so afraid that I was going
to do something to embarrass myself.

1411
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:08,620
And I'm like, oh my God, everybody's
looking and then you know, I'll sit,

1412
01:29:08,621 --> 01:29:10,710
but the Max is going on at the same time.

1413
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,940
But it felt like everybody was
looking at me and I'm like, man,

1414
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:16,500
they got to watch them through something.

1415
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,860
My technique's going to
be wrong or it's got,

1416
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,710
I'm just going to fuck up
in front end of the, the,

1417
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:26,350
the fear was paralyzing him. Like,
you know, I can't fucking do this.

1418
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:31,520
I'm not cut out to be a fighter man. I
just can't, the press just kicked my,

1419
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:36,760
I think to overcome. Oh, that's
hard to sort your way through it.

1420
01:29:36,761 --> 01:29:40,030
And it's what's really hard for a lot
of fighters has come back from a loss.

1421
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,770
They get beat up and smashed and then
then they have to come back and figure out

1422
01:29:44,771 --> 01:29:46,980
a way through, you know, and um,

1423
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,760
that's a devastating loss of quotes,
you see, isn't yet but devastating.

1424
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:53,810
No Raymond Daniels is,
oh, of course they go.

1425
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,910
Did you see his fight this past weekend?

1426
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,160
Do you see that 720 degree punch?

1427
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:02,820
So go to Bellatore they
find that clip man. Aye.

1428
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:06,360
Well we won't be able to show
it. Right. I can show you guys.

1429
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,930
Just show us for folks who don't know.
Well,

1430
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,510
one of the reasons I brought up Raymond,
Danielle says Raymond Daniels. Oh,

1431
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,210
he's a belt or kickboxing champion.

1432
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:19,211
Now he lost in devastating fashion to
Nikki Holt skin who's a another world

1433
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,810
champion. And uh, also to Joseph
Valtellina who's another world champion.

1434
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:28,460
So when he was making the transition from
karate champion to kickboxing champion,

1435
01:30:28,461 --> 01:30:31,820
he had some stumbling. Yeah, it made,
it didn't, didn't go 100% smooth,

1436
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,950
but that guy's got an iron will

1437
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,800
man,
um,

1438
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:41,090
stunt coordinators and
move. Yes. Watch this.

1439
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:43,340
Look at Ray Mactan.
Raymond Daniels.

1440
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:47,990
Wow. That's fucking, it's fucking crazy.

1441
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:50,210
He went for a three 60 roundhouse kick.

1442
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:55,280
Dude wasn't there and then he continued
to spend further and boom. I mean,

1443
01:30:55,281 --> 01:30:59,180
that is insane. That is
such an incident. The land,

1444
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:00,350
a punch at the end of that.

1445
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:04,980
I mean is so bananas and he
landed a spinning back kick
to the body right before

1446
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:07,730
bed too. Yeah. I mean he did a thing,

1447
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,590
find the thing he did in um, in, in glory.

1448
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:17,480
He did a jumping sidekicks, spinning back
kick combination where he touched him.

1449
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:21,920
He touched him with the front leg and
then spun in the air and spinning back

1450
01:31:21,921 --> 01:31:24,710
kick areas right here.
Yeah.

1451
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:28,220
I mean this is fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1452
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,810
He watched watch how he does
let, let this go. Here it goes.

1453
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:33,720
Watch he touches up.

1454
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:40,450
Oh, Ooh. Shit. And World
Class kickboxer like,

1455
01:31:40,451 --> 01:31:41,231
that's what I'm saying.

1456
01:31:41,231 --> 01:31:46,231
I mean the movie or looking at
his highlights to come up with,

1457
01:31:47,141 --> 01:31:48,730
you know,
fight free dude.

1458
01:31:48,731 --> 01:31:53,510
If there's stuff that they don't even
do in the movies in a real fight. Yeah.

1459
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:56,760
Yeah. He's hard to handle. He,

1460
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,950
he uh,

1461
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:03,820
a pep talk or speaks into a group
of fighters. He was in the group.

1462
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:06,820
They came out and then I got it.
I got to meet. I was like, man,

1463
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:11,080
I don't know all his fan. A fan boy. Big
Time. All right. Again, I'm saying like,

1464
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,460
damn mother fucker.

1465
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,920
I love watching those guys and like
guys like Michael Venom and Paige was

1466
01:32:16,921 --> 01:32:19,740
another one who has those karate skills,

1467
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:24,060
but then they're learning all the skills
of MMA and then you see, look man,

1468
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:27,090
if you don't know that karate style,
and he knows MMA,

1469
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,780
like you're kind of fucked because they
didn't do shit. That's like outlandish,

1470
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:35,340
you know, venom page Landis Shit.

1471
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:39,900
It's ridiculous. And he's,
he's so long too. And his,

1472
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:44,400
his timing and movement
is so unpredictable and he
could sprint at you and you

1473
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:48,620
don't even know all of a
sudden, Bang. He's punching
him in the face. You saw that,

1474
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,030
that knockout when he knocked out cyborg
and caved his head in with that knee

1475
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,290
cave the man's head.
And I've seen thousands of fights.

1476
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:59,100
I never saw a man get his head caved in,

1477
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,470
ever hard to lead his phone.
Look at that.

1478
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:07,890
Look at his skull. His,
his head is pushed in.

1479
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:12,450
I mean that was six
that the video above it.

1480
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,000
Does that show the actual
knockout? No, that's not it.

1481
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,710
But look how he fights to
hands down. I mean, that is

1482
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,540
the scene writhing in agony.
Like that.

1483
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:32,730
I remember his fight with, uh, it
was one of the best MMA fights.

1484
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,820
Every real muscular guy.
He's real muscular. Cyborg.

1485
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,530
Cyborg had a fight with
this. I never, oh, he's,

1486
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,960
he's kind of on the down hill now,

1487
01:33:42,961 --> 01:33:47,961
but at one time he was like
the Mike Tyson of MMA we built,

1488
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,790
I know, you know what I'm talking about.
You that was a man whose yes. Yeah,

1489
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,960
I knew you knew what you see.
Cyborg.

1490
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:01,450
Yeah. It's a mother fucker, man. Ooh.

1491
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,960
He's another one man. Yeah. Came
from that. Uh, he's, he comes from,

1492
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:08,880
um,
Mike's gym in Holland,

1493
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:12,440
which is a famous kickboxing
gym for savages. Just,

1494
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:17,280
just wore the young, a
young man. What's up?

1495
01:34:17,281 --> 01:34:20,380
I can see. Oh, there it is. Woo.

1496
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:25,320
And Melvin is built like a fucking,
he was another one.

1497
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:28,080
Unbelievable power and speed
when he was in his prime,

1498
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,010
but he's not the same anymore.
You're right.

1499
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:33,670
Wars. But man, that dude was super

1500
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:37,990
and he always wore those gladiator
jokes too. Here's a piece of my,

1501
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:41,130
one of my favorites,
but that showed you how tough Cyborg was.

1502
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:44,430
That was a war that was in cage warriors.
I think that was the name.

1503
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:47,680
That was the war. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in.

1504
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,330
I've had the privilege watching
so many great fighters fight.

1505
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:54,090
It's interesting to watch all of
the different styles and all that,

1506
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,940
but the thing that they all have,
all the great ones,

1507
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:01,580
they have this unstoppable belief in
themselves. Even if they lose, they just,

1508
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:04,880
they learn, they lose, they learn
to come back. They get better.

1509
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:10,700
Favorite interviews was
hoists Gracie and man, uh,

1510
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,790
his mentality, he says, you know,

1511
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,570
I make no plans for after the fright.

1512
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,760
Yeah. Of these guys guys.
Fucking, they're ready to die.

1513
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:24,890
He's not saying I hate.
See, I see guys, man.

1514
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:29,760
I'm talking about the after party and
meet me over here. Say, no, no, no.

1515
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,840
I am prepared to die in

1516
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:40,530
hell. Yeah. Shit up Joe.

1517
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:45,620
Because I was prepared to die
on the weightlifting platform.

1518
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,500
The doc says, Hey, if you go see
tea, you're able to have kicked,

1519
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:54,050
burst right there on stage you dying
for, and all those people. Good.

1520
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,793
That's the way I was.

1521
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:01,300
If you want to,
if you want real greatness,

1522
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:02,950
you have to be able to give it all away,

1523
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,160
but to find somebody else does that crazy.
I was like me,

1524
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:07,450
I thought I was the only one.

1525
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:11,250
Did you see the middleweight championship
fight between Calvin gas Lum and a

1526
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:14,980
Israel at a Sonia a style bender?
Did you see that fight? Of course,

1527
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,730
right before the fifth round.
It means a close fight and style.

1528
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,920
Bender came out and just
destroyed in the fifth round,

1529
01:36:20,921 --> 01:36:23,940
but right before that he said,
I'm ready to die. He says

1530
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,230
he's looking at him. He goes, I'm
ready to die. I heard that man.

1531
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:33,250
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1532
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:39,730
That was one of those believeable moment.
I love Kevin Calvin.

1533
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:45,010
He's a beast. He was a great, he was
also at the top is speaks to that.

1534
01:36:45,011 --> 01:36:49,130
Gave him rd coat. Kevin was
there and saying, young guy, man,

1535
01:36:49,131 --> 01:36:53,300
and he's still a young guy and he
really should be finding one's heaven.

1536
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:57,100
Honestly. You mean he's, yeah, I mean
he fought at one seven and he just,

1537
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:02,170
he likes to eat. You know
how hard, I really don't.

1538
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:05,230
Guy and Kevin, if you listen, I
love you man. Kelvin's a beast.

1539
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,790
He's not even near his full potential yet.
Style bender is either

1540
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:16,000
young guy, stop vendors better now than
he was in his first fight in the UFC,

1541
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:19,090
which was only about 16 months ago.
He's better now.

1542
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:23,470
He's trouble for anybody man. But he's
in his house and he, that guy has some,

1543
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,250
he's probably the most technical
striker that's ever fought in the UFC.

1544
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:31,270
So tactical. But um, okay.
Let me ask you about this.

1545
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:35,770
I heard a rumor of him
and John Jones. No, no,

1546
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,810
each other.
Oh yeah.

1547
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,730
John was talking shit about him
and he was talking shit about John,

1548
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,230
you know that maybe they'll fight.
John is way bigger. John's a big man.

1549
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:49,330
Yes.
Yeah.

1550
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:52,690
And he's bad motherfucker man.

1551
01:37:52,691 --> 01:37:55,980
I mean maybe one day they
could fight. But John, I

1552
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,200
think John's futures in heavyweight.
I really do.

1553
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,500
I think John is going to clean out the
light heavyweight division and then move

1554
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:05,970
up and I think he's probably going to
try to catch DC before DC steps out

1555
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,260
because DC is going to fight
against deep Amy. Oh chick,

1556
01:38:08,261 --> 01:38:09,360
they're going to have a rematch.

1557
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:14,070
And then I think DC versus John Jones is
probably what? Yeah, heavy heavyweight.

1558
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,260
I think John, what's go up there and
take that heavyweight title, you know,

1559
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,830
but I think DC has a better
chance against him at heavyweight.

1560
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:22,470
I don't think DC liked cutting weight
and I don't think it's good for his

1561
01:38:22,471 --> 01:38:26,430
performance or his durability
or anything. You know, I think,

1562
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:30,390
I mean judging by his
fights with Derek Lewis,

1563
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,500
who's a fucking huge guy
and knocking out Steve,

1564
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:36,150
a mule chick who's nobody's ever
been able to do it like that before,

1565
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:40,260
the way DC did it mean DC says that
heavyweight, he's just way more powerful,

1566
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,850
hits harder, takes a punch better,
you know? I mean, he's not tall guy,

1567
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:48,300
he's the only five 11 but he's
as wide as this fucking table.

1568
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,100
DC's a tank of a man,

1569
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:54,520
his wrestling of booties for now.

1570
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:58,020
But that's why as John so God damn
impressive at John took him down.

1571
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:01,290
John went right at them with
wrestling. It's like, motherfucker,

1572
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:05,430
I'm going to take you down and scare you.
My favorite

1573
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:10,500
food is if he's not the greatest of
all time, he's in a conversation.

1574
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,450
He's in a conversation that's like me.

1575
01:39:12,451 --> 01:39:15,360
My opinion is that mighty mouse
Johnson's the greatest of all time,

1576
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:20,100
but the caveat is that mighty mouse never
really fought the Caribou caliber of

1577
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:21,630
competition that John jumped it.

1578
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:25,500
Jon Jones first fight in
the UFC at for a title.

1579
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:29,040
He's fighting Mauricio Shogun
[inaudible] who is a legend.

1580
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:32,410
That's John's first fight.
John Opens up with a flying knee.

1581
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:38,610
It's a legend, you know, chokes. Liotta
Machida, completely unconscious. You know,

1582
01:39:38,611 --> 01:39:41,730
chokes out rampage. Chokes out.
He's just just smashed everybody.

1583
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:45,420
John smashed everybody. He's only
lost one time. That's a bullshit loss.

1584
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:50,940
Loss of disqualification. The fight that
he was dominated. Yeah. He's afraid, man.

1585
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:51,810
He's a real free.

1586
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,200
It most definitely is my favorite,

1587
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:58,750
especially since he told him he
listens to my eggs before I fight.

1588
01:39:58,751 --> 01:40:03,720
I always listen to your, I am
the one speech Ct. Hell yes.

1589
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:06,760
He's something special for definitely yes

1590
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:08,720
he is something special and I think um,

1591
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:12,740
you know he's had some troubles in his
life and troubles but I think he's got

1592
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:16,070
that shit behind him. I really
do. And I think he's, you know,

1593
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:20,270
he hasn't had a near death experience but
I think he's had so many you like near

1594
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:23,900
career experiences that
he appreciates it now.

1595
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,690
And I also think to be that good,

1596
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:30,440
you got to be fucking crazy and I think
Jon Jones is fucking crazy and he's just

1597
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,700
getting his crazy online.

1598
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:35,570
He's just getting his crazy and order
like keep my crazy and under wraps.

1599
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:39,230
Just keep my crazy together.
Going to be that good.

1600
01:40:39,231 --> 01:40:42,460
You got to be a wild motherfucker.
Oh you gotta be wild if that's,

1601
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:44,750
that's what he is.
He's smart too though.

1602
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,430
He's got like the perfect combination
of things like smart and wild and

1603
01:40:49,431 --> 01:40:54,190
physically talented like and then, and
then long, long as for the weight class,

1604
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,900
he's very strong toes lifting man.

1605
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,320
I get time tones into
the belly of the beast.

1606
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:09,940
Maybe after the fight with Tiago Santos
still have some time off, but he, uh,

1607
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,481
it's interesting,

1608
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,360
his coaches thought that his
powerlifting was a bad idea for him.

1609
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,310
Apparently not coaches.

1610
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,430
They think that he got really into
that before the OSP fight. Man,

1611
01:41:19,431 --> 01:41:23,860
we had a big stretch of time often in
the OSP fight. He didn't look as good,

1612
01:41:23,861 --> 01:41:26,440
but I credit that to Osp.

1613
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:31,050
I just think that OSP fought real hard
fight and he's a real big strong guy and

1614
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:33,300
he's fucking dangerous and I think

1615
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,150
improves a piece.

1616
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:41,320
I think that it's just one of those
things where stylistically, you know,

1617
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:43,490
[inaudible] fought a really
good fight and I mean,

1618
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:48,100
opens had a broken arm for I think the
last round that round with a fucking

1619
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:48,641
shattered arm.

1620
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:53,360
Never let anybody know then say a Goddamn
word about his forearms snapped for me.

1621
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:57,610
Tell some base to do that.
It's the hardest game in the world.

1622
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,360
Next to being a cop or a
firefighter or a soldier.

1623
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:05,860
MMA fighters the hardest came in
the world. Yeah, I totally agree.

1624
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,340
Um,

1625
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:12,340
gratitude brought up soldiers because
I'm a [inaudible] through myself and I,

1626
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:18,010
you know, I have a lot
to have a, um, PTSD.

1627
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:22,630
I was hoping that during the conversation
we could get a PTSD in there some kind

1628
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:23,830
of way because my [inaudible]

1629
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:28,050
bad, uh, suffered from PTSD big time.

1630
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,460
He went in the Korean
War and eight, 16, uh,

1631
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:37,350
he got a guy, yeah, he had
a guy, a signed form, uh,

1632
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,090
and said he was his
dad and he was able to,

1633
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:46,440
to get in for a while like
that. And that was, uh, uh,

1634
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:49,110
I,
that was,

1635
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:54,590
I give him a pass on a lot of the
crazy shit he did because of that.

1636
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:59,280
Right. You know, he never sit down and
had a conversation with me about it.

1637
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:04,670
I never talked to my dad for
more than five minutes at a time,

1638
01:43:05,491 --> 01:43:07,860
you know,
and when I talked to him growing up,

1639
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:13,080
never be more than five minutes at a time.
And in our whole life,

1640
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:17,070
my whole life, you know, he died
when he was 86 and I'm 50 something.

1641
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:18,720
I was 57,
eight,

1642
01:43:18,721 --> 01:43:23,721
somewhere around there before we had
maybe 10 minute conversation that was just

1643
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:28,650
apologizing to him for,
you know, hating him. Yeah.

1644
01:43:28,651 --> 01:43:31,860
We talked about this,
but he had the kid,

1645
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,650
when they call it a shell shot back then.

1646
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:39,030
So I explained to me it was an
explanation for a lot of his, uh,

1647
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,580
um, over the top behavior. I can't
imagine myself at 16 being, you know,

1648
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:51,090
gun fires in dead dead guys all around
me. I know I would have been, uh,

1649
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:56,300
uh, I'll mental mess also.
So I gave him a lot of, uh,

1650
01:43:57,030 --> 01:44:02,030
and it's such a problem now PTSD with
soldiers now they have the 21 pushups for

1651
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:09,950
21 veterans who kill themselves
every day, uh, from Ptsd.

1652
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:13,880
So it's a big cause for
me. I want to, you know,

1653
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,770
do everything I can do you try to bring,
and we're in this for the,

1654
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,280
my fellow veterans out there
that are suffering from that too.

1655
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:25,670
So I'm with you guys.
I'm with the Vicks. Yeah.

1656
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:29,900
So what we were talking about before to
ask someone to be able to get through

1657
01:44:29,901 --> 01:44:30,680
that.

1658
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:35,380
Yeah, it's an, it's incredible ass. I want
to ask you your opinion about something.

1659
01:44:35,381 --> 01:44:40,381
So do you think a police
chief or F F up guy can be,

1660
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:48,870
do you think a guy can possibly rise to
police chief without ever having been an

1661
01:44:51,371 --> 01:44:55,870
officer himself?
It doesn't seem like it should be.

1662
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,250
Okay.

1663
01:44:57,250 --> 01:45:01,930
Do you think a guy can be a fire chief
without ever having been a fire man

1664
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:04,630
himself?
Doesn't seem like you should be.

1665
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:09,640
Do you think a guy can be the commander
in chief of our armed forces without

1666
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:13,310
ever having been a soldier himself?
Doesn't seem like you should.

1667
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,370
Thank you Joe.

1668
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:22,640
I think it's way too easy to be
commander in chief. Like how many,

1669
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,570
how many people would, if that was like
a prerequisite you had to serve like uh,

1670
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:31,250
like in the Israeli army, if you're in
the Israeli army, everyone has to serve.

1671
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:34,520
There's a certain amount of time everyone
has to put in the South Korean army.

1672
01:45:34,521 --> 01:45:36,830
Same thing you have to serve.
You know,

1673
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:41,330
a chance on John who's a top level UFC
fighter took two years off his career

1674
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,990
because that was the requirement with the
South Korean army. They had him serve.

1675
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:46,343
Um,

1676
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:51,640
I think that if you are going to be able
to tell people where they go and that

1677
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:57,100
they have the risk of their life on a
campaign that many people might think is

1678
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,760
fruitless or even worse,

1679
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:01,790
many people might think it's
financially motivated and not necessary.

1680
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:07,030
And you're asking some someone's son to
go over there and die for that preach.

1681
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:11,570
Yes, you, you should have
some understanding about what
you're saying. You should,

1682
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,093
you should have served.

1683
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:18,950
I think it's possible for you
to have a good understanding,

1684
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:23,040
a grasp of what you're asking.

1685
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:27,420
If you haven't experienced it yourself.

1686
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:30,240
But now let's go back and
look at all the presidents.

1687
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:35,250
How many of them serve Barack
Obama never served. George W.

1688
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:39,450
Bush didn't serve, but George Herbert
Walker Bush served and you know,

1689
01:46:39,451 --> 01:46:44,340
he's actually shot down in World War
II, right? Um, Clinton never served.

1690
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,590
Nixon ever served. I
mean you, you got to go.

1691
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,440
Got It.
And I,

1692
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:54,460
and I think that none of them have been
able to be commander in chief of the

1693
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:00,450
armed forces. That's just my
feeling. If you didn't serve,

1694
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,880
you said they got plenty of
generals that could feel that spot.

1695
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:10,340
Yeah. I think that they
should change whatever they
need to change whatever wall,

1696
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:15,240
whatever it is to change that to commander
and chief of the armed forces has to

1697
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:19,230
be, has to be us, have been a soldier.

1698
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:22,020
They have a lot of five star generals.

1699
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:25,400
A lot of guys at the top that
have been in the military.

1700
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:27,810
Did that know what they're uh,
experience.

1701
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,270
Let them be the commander
in chief of the army.

1702
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:34,580
These are the 12 presidents who did
not serve in the military. So wait,

1703
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,460
wait a minute. That Nixon did. Nixon
served commander naval reserve.

1704
01:47:39,461 --> 01:47:42,670
It says Oh, neighbor was okay. Um,

1705
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:46,440
but Clinton didn't know FDR,

1706
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:50,650
Hoover Coolidge hardy.
Interesting. But um,

1707
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:53,920
George W w Bush didn't serve.

1708
01:47:53,921 --> 01:47:58,480
Did he think he was a reserve for a
small period of time or something? Oh,

1709
01:47:58,481 --> 01:48:01,560
that's right. Yeah. There were
some shenanigans for, they
got, they got them out of,

1710
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:05,440
I think Trump had like eight deferments,
like feet,

1711
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:10,110
her phone sprayers.
How do you get bone spurs,

1712
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:14,800
but never working out ever. How did that
happen? He's kind of funny though, man.

1713
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:16,210
The,
the not working out thing.

1714
01:48:16,211 --> 01:48:20,800
He thinks his body's like a battery and
then thinks like if you, you work out,

1715
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:24,490
you use up your, your juice. Ooh, that is,

1716
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,220
you've got a finite number of
heartbeats or something like that.

1717
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:29,500
Is that what he said? Yeah. There's
other people that believe that too.

1718
01:48:29,501 --> 01:48:32,560
I've looked it up too.
But they do believe that that's the case.

1719
01:48:32,561 --> 01:48:35,890
But here's the thing, when you train
you, it lowers your heart rate.

1720
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:37,480
That's what we didn't understand.

1721
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,250
Like Michael Bisping as a 34 beats
per minute resting heart rate. Yeah.

1722
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:47,520
Most fat fucks out there have
like 78 80 you know that they're,

1723
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:52,970
they're wasting mirror. I'd like
to run this super low. Yeah.

1724
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:56,770
And then when you take him speed,
right pills,

1725
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,080
he's just described me as a fat fuck.

1726
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:04,360
It was like 78 eight no, no, no, no,

1727
01:49:04,361 --> 01:49:07,420
no, no. You ain't a fat fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

1728
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:12,940
But if even if that is true,

1729
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:16,960
I mean there's no real evidence
that that's what it is. True.

1730
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:20,050
I think, um, yeah,

1731
01:49:20,051 --> 01:49:24,970
I think anybody that is going to tell
people they have to fight for our country

1732
01:49:24,971 --> 01:49:28,840
should have had to fight most or at
least should have had to serve, serve.

1733
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:33,160
You don't have to necessarily
have had military.

1734
01:49:33,161 --> 01:49:35,550
I mean it's not your fault if
you didn't see actually. Right,

1735
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,340
right. Yeah, I agree with
that. You know, amount of calm,

1736
01:49:38,341 --> 01:49:39,790
you don't have to be a combat death,

1737
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,640
but it is being have been willing
that when do you were cold

1738
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:49,280
yes. To accept the call
and step up and you know,

1739
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:55,150
we cause by doing that you're saying and
when I signed this piece of paper that

1740
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:57,940
I don't know if there's going to be
conflict, there's going to be a war not,

1741
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:02,710
but I'm signing up. If
there is, I'm available.

1742
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:07,030
I'm here man. And so we're always hoping
for the best, right. With presidents.

1743
01:50:07,031 --> 01:50:11,530
But it always disappoints us like, no,
no one, no one's been the most amazing.

1744
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:14,410
No one has ever like the one person,
when you look back and go, man,

1745
01:50:14,411 --> 01:50:16,630
that mother fucker nailed everything.
They got it right.

1746
01:50:16,631 --> 01:50:19,900
They got it right with whistle blowers.
They got it right with human rights.

1747
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:22,830
They got it right with freedom of speech.
They got it right with everything.

1748
01:50:22,831 --> 01:50:24,370
You've got it right with
military intervention,

1749
01:50:24,371 --> 01:50:26,710
they got it right with regime change wars,

1750
01:50:26,711 --> 01:50:30,760
they got it right with everything they
did do. Didn't do anything wrong and man,

1751
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:31,930
everybody should be like them.

1752
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,790
Like a lot of goofy people look back
to like Ronald Reagan like this,

1753
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:36,910
an old Ronald Reagan.

1754
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:40,480
He was our guy like just that's just cause
it's a long time ago and you remember

1755
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:44,920
sucks. I remember, I remember when
people fucking hated Ronald Reagan. Man,

1756
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:47,350
I remember when they were trying to
get him out of office like that wasn't,

1757
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,500
that one didn't work either. No one. No
one's good at the job. They're going to.

1758
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:55,870
Boy, you got to get a lot of
comments on man. It's true though.

1759
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,130
It's an impossible job to please.
Everybody is always an impossible.

1760
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:06,520
It's impossible thing. No, I don't
know anybody who, not everybody,

1761
01:51:06,521 --> 01:51:11,260
but the idea that one person is going
to oversee every branch of government,

1762
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,070
the military, the economy, social issues,

1763
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:19,570
censorship,
big tech problems with the environment.

1764
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:22,780
Like what the fuck are you crazy?
How could one person do all that?

1765
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:23,950
It's not possible.

1766
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:28,440
It's not possible and do a
wonderful job at it all too.

1767
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,420
Right?
I mean I,

1768
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:36,040
I don't understand how
it's even humanly possible.

1769
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:39,070
I don't think a human,
I think that job should be,

1770
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:44,100
there should be a council of wise people
decide things and we should be able to

1771
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,970
decide whether or not they're
wise. You know what I mean?
There should be, I guess,

1772
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:50,440
I guess that's what the
Lex and in Congress,

1773
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:57,400
that's supposedly what that I guess,
yes, that's what it's supposed to be.

1774
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,200
It's also like it's too easy to vote.
I mean it's too easy to just say, ah,

1775
01:52:02,201 --> 01:52:06,340
that guy, that guy. You should
be able to tell me why that guy.

1776
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,800
Like what's your reasoning?
Does it make sense?

1777
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:11,620
Did you think this through you just like,
that guy's a republican.

1778
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:14,470
I'm a Republican. Fuck it. Is that what
you're doing? Like what are you doing?

1779
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:16,670
Like you,
you'd making these choices and you know,

1780
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:20,230
you throw on your mark on this piece of
paper and that could affect the way the

1781
01:52:20,231 --> 01:52:24,640
world swings. Like what's the thought
process behind it? So easy people.

1782
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:29,110
So they have to explain that.
I don't because I don't think that,

1783
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:33,910
I think the right to vote should not be
anything that's infringed upon in any

1784
01:52:33,911 --> 01:52:34,750
way,
shape or form.

1785
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:38,260
But it would be a lot better if people
knew what the fuck they were voting on.

1786
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:42,430
It would help. It would help if
they had a real understanding of it,

1787
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,710
but people don't have the time. That's
the other problem. Then you know,

1788
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:49,100
we're talking about people slaving away
all day. If someone's working all day,

1789
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:49,761
eight hours a day,

1790
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:53,570
how much time do they really
have to research foreign
policy and which time they

1791
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:57,080
have to research what's going wrong
with the economy, sub, you know,

1792
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:02,270
sub prime interest rate loans and all
that shit. Oh, how much time do people,

1793
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:08,390
they're concerned about what's going on
in their family and they're trying to

1794
01:53:08,391 --> 01:53:12,290
get laid. And the triangle and they
want to get to the game and uh,

1795
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:13,480
they got tickets already.

1796
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:18,680
Fucking the vendors are
out there three hours long.

1797
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:25,100
I stayed awake. I haven't seen it yet.
I stayed awake. I heard it's great.

1798
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:30,140
Good enough to keep me awake. That's,
that's, uh, at saying something from the,

1799
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:34,400
I go to sleep off with time from the heart
transplant or you sleep beer now? No,

1800
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:38,960
no. I went to sleep all the time
before Doris get comfortable.

1801
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:40,860
Fucking it's over, man. Yeah.

1802
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:46,810
Well that's the thing too,
when people train a already fucking with.

1803
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:48,950
Yeah.
If you train a lot though,

1804
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:53,090
you're always ready to take a nap because
your body is always like recovering.

1805
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:57,200
I'm out. Oh, proud.

1806
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:01,990
Or overtraining is bullshit. You think,
look for trainings. Bullshit. Oh,

1807
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:04,130
I know you don't.

1808
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:09,131
I think I picked to think that it's not
bullshit and overtrained is very real.

1809
01:54:10,341 --> 01:54:13,460
Don't you try it? Yes, I do. And who
you would say that you know what?

1810
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:18,350
Rhabdomyolysis is a no, I
have no idea. When you're
overtraining, you're literally,

1811
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:23,240
your muscles start breaking
down to pollute your kidneys.
People die from it. Wow.

1812
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,340
That was a big ass long words.

1813
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:29,640
And if you're looking at dictionary,
it'll say boasts,

1814
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:38,930
no dry pick it. Beers under resting
under recuperation. That's true.

1815
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:43,250
But a overtraining. Nah. If you get
enough rest and enough recuperation,

1816
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,140
I think overtraining spools.
Right.

1817
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,440
But if you have to work out hard and
then you have to work out again the next

1818
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,980
day and you work out hard the next day,
that's a, that's robbed on my locis Piss.

1819
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:56,080
When you get robbed though, you're pissed
comes out looking like ice tea. Yeah.

1820
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,340
I don't mean the rapper.

1821
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:04,710
You're more than a rapper though, right?
It's hard to say. He's a rapper. Actor.

1822
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:09,470
Yeah. He's a cool dude. Yeah. I mean
he has body count. That's a metal band.

1823
01:55:09,471 --> 01:55:14,450
So there's that too. Yeah. Yeah.
Right. Acts Peaks. Cool. Um, but yeah,

1824
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:18,980
it looks like diet coke would say that.
This looks like it's fucked up. Yeah.

1825
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,650
That's, um, that's what
happens in that train. Every,

1826
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,410
I'm worked fucking eight
hours a day, eight, 10,

1827
01:55:24,411 --> 01:55:27,050
12 hours a day for the post office.
Went to the gym,

1828
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:31,780
put in another four to six hours
for fucking 25 years in my pissed.

1829
01:55:31,781 --> 01:55:36,560
Never looked like that.
Yeah.

1830
01:55:36,561 --> 01:55:40,250
I think that's more endurance athletes
and uh, particularly crossfit.

1831
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,740
A lot of crossfit people
get robbed at Oh yeah.

1832
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,320
Cause a competing gets other people
and they get real wrapped up in it.

1833
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:51,010
I got to ask, Jason could leap about this
good friend of mine, see if he's pissed.

1834
01:55:51,011 --> 01:55:53,440
Every look like root beer.

1835
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,080
That's a real, real issue for crossfitters
and like ultra endurance athletes.

1836
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:02,020
Yeah. Yeah. He's one of the
top crossfitters guy. Yeah.

1837
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:04,250
He's like world champion
two or three times.

1838
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:08,860
Those guys are ridiculously ridiculous.
Lee Fitting to add him in the,

1839
01:56:08,861 --> 01:56:12,820
in mind to him and I put them through
my training. It was one of the,

1840
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:18,010
he did the shit like yeah, he's
fucking that guy. Crossfit. Neat.

1841
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:22,310
And you know, wait with this would kind
of laugh it cross fingers and ah, that's,

1842
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:26,300
that's, you know, you know
girly shit man. It's bullish.

1843
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,790
Cross fitness bullshit.

1844
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:32,110
But that motherfucker is in
extremely good shape. Yeah.

1845
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:36,790
Crossfitting is definitely not,
definitely not bullshit.

1846
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:41,800
You know, it's very hard. Yup. What
those guys do is very, very, very,

1847
01:56:41,801 --> 01:56:45,790
very hard. Yeah. The real question is
whether or not it's good for your body.

1848
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,530
And that's where,
um,

1849
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:51,490
that's where I'm not qualified to judge,

1850
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:56,380
but there's a lot of people that are
professional strength and conditioning

1851
01:56:56,381 --> 01:56:59,440
coaches to frown upon it because they
think that those kind of movements like

1852
01:56:59,441 --> 01:57:02,250
power lifting movements like clean
press, that kind of shit. Again,

1853
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,590
that should not be done for the
maximum amount of repetitions.

1854
01:57:05,591 --> 01:57:08,500
I think that should be done for
power then you should, you know,

1855
01:57:08,501 --> 01:57:12,940
you should holy step your maximum or 85%
of your maximum for x amount of times

1856
01:57:12,941 --> 01:57:15,490
and that's it. But what they're
trying to do is just, you know,

1857
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:20,410
if Mike does 10 I want to do 12 Mike
does 12, I want to do 15 you know,

1858
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:20,920
and they,

1859
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:24,940
they think that there's like Steve
Maxwell who's a pretty famous strength

1860
01:57:24,941 --> 01:57:27,340
conditioning coach, he frowns upon
it and he just thinks it's just,

1861
01:57:27,610 --> 01:57:30,060
those movements are not
designed for endurance.

1862
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,990
Those movements are designed for power.

1863
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,320
He thinks ultimately it's
detrimental for your body.

1864
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:40,060
And that if you want to have a long career
in fitness and constantly be able to

1865
01:57:40,061 --> 01:57:42,160
work out like deep into your 50s and 60s,

1866
01:57:42,161 --> 01:57:46,150
he just thinks it's very
detrimental for your body. Again,

1867
01:57:46,151 --> 01:57:49,270
I'm not the guy to tell, right,
that's true or not true either.

1868
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,480
I need to get one of those
top level crossfit guys.

1869
01:57:52,481 --> 01:57:54,910
I know I've gone back and
forth with rich Froning.

1870
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:58,060
Is that how you see a chance again online,
but I'd never got him on.

1871
01:57:58,220 --> 01:57:59,810
Oh yeah.
What were we talking to him again?

1872
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:04,160
I'm sure Jason would die to
be going on here, but um,

1873
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:08,510
he is exceptionally fit and,
you know,

1874
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:12,740
the long term, I don't know, cause
he's still a pretty young guy.

1875
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,480
But, uh, I,

1876
01:58:14,810 --> 01:58:18,710
I have a real bad habit of,

1877
01:58:18,711 --> 01:58:23,570
I'm looking at the people that,

1878
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:27,980
uh, say those things about, uh, you know,

1879
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:29,630
athletes like that.

1880
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:34,660
I always look at them
and act as a bad habit.

1881
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:38,510
I can't help him.
All the people that give all the advice,

1882
01:58:38,511 --> 01:58:41,060
the weightlifting advice online,
I always,

1883
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:45,380
and look at their pace and
Seattle fuck pay, look at sauce.

1884
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:49,420
The overwhelming majority of uh,

1885
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:53,110
Instagram coaches are fat fucks.

1886
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:58,750
Yup, it is. I had a fuck.

1887
01:58:58,751 --> 01:59:03,700
Can you give advice and look like dead?

1888
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,360
Exactly right. How can you, I tell
people all the time, how can I,

1889
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:10,750
I can't tell you or anybody how to,

1890
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:16,010
to get through anything if I never
been through anything myself.

1891
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:22,530
I can't tell you how to
overcome an obstacle if I
never overcame me any fucking

1892
01:59:22,631 --> 01:59:27,520
thing. Right. And I can't tell you how to
be in shape. If I look like a fat fuck,

1893
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:33,280
I just can't do it. And I have a bad
habit of looking at that person in, in,

1894
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:36,490
you know,
examining them first.

1895
01:59:36,491 --> 01:59:40,300
If you're going to give me this kind
of advice, then I have to, you know,

1896
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,430
I got to look at your page, Joe. I
never seen them pictures and shit.

1897
01:59:44,431 --> 01:59:48,730
You been posting me now if I want to
know, that's why I'm asking. Joe wrote me,

1898
01:59:48,731 --> 01:59:53,731
show me how to kick cause I seen this
motherfucker kick and he kicks like fuck

1899
01:59:54,511 --> 01:59:58,600
fucking you man. I'm like, I want
to learn how to kick from dead guy.

1900
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:03,940
I want to see somebody kicking through
walls and shit and just rules that if you

1901
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:07,180
have not seen room kick look it up.

1902
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:12,690
That is one kicking ass
ob to kick his ass though.

1903
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:16,520
Yeah, I think you, you
got a good point about uh,

1904
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,830
the people that criticize like some
people criticize people that work too hard

1905
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:22,650
because they don't want to work that
hard and like you don't need to work that

1906
02:00:22,651 --> 02:00:26,820
hard. Yeah. Yeah. I don't trust
trainers that look like shit. Oh fuck.

1907
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:32,310
Gang of them. Some of them are pretty
popular and I seen him, I'm like,

1908
02:00:32,311 --> 02:00:35,820
what kind of body is that fucking car?
Yeah.

1909
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,540
They gotta be great.
Talkers got to be great. Oh,

1910
02:00:39,541 --> 02:00:43,350
they must have good degrees
and physiology and this. Nah,

1911
02:00:43,351 --> 02:00:46,320
they must man, let me, I look at them.

1912
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:49,920
They look doughy like with
their Chin looks like,

1913
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:54,370
okay. How might they know Claire?
Too Skinny. I came out first you,

1914
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:56,920
I'm talking to talking
shit about them guys.

1915
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:59,020
I couldn't get a job
as a personal trainer.

1916
02:00:59,021 --> 02:01:02,590
I had all these fucking world championship
certificates and sit and make told me

1917
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:06,850
you're not certified by this.
Not 35 Friday, we can't use it,

1918
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:13,180
and I'm like, fuck,
you're a personal trainer.

1919
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:16,890
And this guy looked like he had
never seen the inside of here.

1920
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:21,310
We even drove by a fucking Jew and
he's a fucking, if you're the head

1921
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,350
personal trainer here, I'm like, oh,

1922
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,920
I wonder if someone could
be a good trainer without
ever really working out hard

1923
02:01:26,921 --> 02:01:27,431
themselves.

1924
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:30,970
Isn't that sounds similar to someone
saying that someone shouldn't be the

1925
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:35,480
commander in chief without Howard?
Yeah.

1926
02:01:36,330 --> 02:01:39,380
If I'm going to work out, I want to work
out with someone who's built like you.

1927
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:41,600
I want to work out with someone
who's built like, oh, this one,

1928
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:46,520
the fuckers lift some weights.
They understand what it takes to get big.

1929
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:51,710
I know what it takes to get strong. It's,
it's like I'm not just in theory. Yeah.

1930
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:55,970
It's like we do hire a boxing coach.

1931
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,620
They never been in a box. It just
never been in the ring because never,

1932
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:05,690
I hasn't seen lies. I couldn't
do, I couldn't buy some piece of,

1933
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:10,010
the interesting thing is some trainers
are just really good martial artists and

1934
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:13,370
they never have competed.
I don't understand how that works though.

1935
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,290
It doesn't make sense to me. And then
they would say that you know, their,

1936
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:21,260
their skills in teaching things
just not in fighting itself.

1937
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:23,060
But I think some of the best,

1938
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:27,260
best fighters are the best coaches
are there have been fighters,

1939
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:30,110
some of the best. Yeah, I totally agree.

1940
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:35,190
Cause they know what the
fighters going through and that,

1941
02:02:35,531 --> 02:02:38,500
that's part of it was not just the skill,
you know,

1942
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:41,200
the techniques that the kicks the point.

1943
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:45,850
It's not just that they know
everything because they been there.

1944
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:49,810
They know what you know, they know
everything from the ring walk to what,

1945
02:02:49,811 --> 02:02:54,220
what it's like when it gets hard. Brian,
when you're down on your cards. Yes.

1946
02:02:54,250 --> 02:02:57,790
They know that that's
a very fair and no and,

1947
02:02:57,791 --> 02:02:59,620
and a guy that never been through that,

1948
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:05,710
it'd be lost in that situation. We'll know
what the fuck to tell you. Yeah. Yeah.

1949
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:06,880
I mean I think that's what

1950
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,060
most things in life, right? Yeah.

1951
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:12,310
So I was going to give you
advice on something they
better have some actual real

1952
02:03:12,311 --> 02:03:13,144
world experience.

1953
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:16,970
Yeah, I think so. I think it's a
necessity. But what the fuck do I know?

1954
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:22,190
Lot Ma'am just came from
Compton. Well, I ain't a kid,

1955
02:03:22,191 --> 02:03:25,020
but I'm just a scroll guy from county.
Yeah.

1956
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:29,120
But a lot of good stuff comes out of
Compton. Had Dr Dre came from Compton.

1957
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:33,350
A lot of good stuff comes out of pressure.
Yeah, for sure. Compton's pressure.

1958
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:35,330
It is definitely pressure.

1959
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,370
Things come out of it as well. Oh yeah.
You know what I mean? It's not ideal,

1960
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,530
but damn. If he can make it
through. Oh Man. I said crazy thing.

1961
02:03:44,531 --> 02:03:49,120
Like you don't want your children to
suffer, but the people who do suffer,

1962
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:52,810
God damn, they come through
with some incredible character.

1963
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:58,390
It's a conundrum, right?
Wow. Yes. It's such a,

1964
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,990
I think that, you know,
people telling me it showed,

1965
02:04:01,991 --> 02:04:06,991
people tell him I get letters and
a DM and stuff from people from Oh,

1966
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:12,280
the planet and so many different races.

1967
02:04:12,281 --> 02:04:16,210
There's rush and uh, Ethiopian, um,

1968
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:19,360
people from Sri lock everywhere.
Hey CT,

1969
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:24,370
it was something about your store.
If it was a childhood,

1970
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:27,860
um, your health problems, uh,

1971
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:32,620
how you went through that and overcame,

1972
02:04:32,650 --> 02:04:37,650
gave me inspiration to
go through my problems.

1973
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:42,090
That is the best feeling in the world,
Joe.

1974
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,300
And when I hear that I'm like everything
I had to go through or everything I

1975
02:04:47,941 --> 02:04:52,470
went through, I, I didn't volunteer
to die. I read her or April,

1976
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:54,510
but it wasn't my choice.
If I had a choice,

1977
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:58,560
I had been perfectly fucking hills but,
but going through it,

1978
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:02,010
if it can help that guy in Sri Lanka,

1979
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:05,160
they came rushing to guy and to guy and I,

1980
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:09,690
if it can help them
then it was so worth it.

1981
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:14,130
It ain't even funny.
Do I do it all over again tomorrow?

1982
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:21,110
Just because this guy says that it
helped me get through some inspiration.

1983
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:29,130
Inspiration is very, very valuable.
Very valuable and really hard to,

1984
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,880
I mean it's hard to quantify if you
unexplained inspiration to someone who's

1985
02:05:32,881 --> 02:05:33,780
never experienced it.

1986
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:38,490
But like someone else doing something
good makes you feel like you can do

1987
02:05:38,491 --> 02:05:41,000
something good.
It seems like it shouldn't be.

1988
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:44,820
It shouldn't have anything to do
with you. But it does. It does.

1989
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:50,370
I have my first one. We had
a, we go to do these expos,

1990
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:54,390
these expos and stuff and people
come and something. Wait in line,

1991
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:58,530
two or three hours to shake my hand.

1992
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:02,330
And I think that's so crazy to hoe.
I mean,

1993
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:05,940
who the fuck am I?
Who am I?

1994
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:09,990
I'm I fuck I am nobody.
I'm nobody.

1995
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:13,020
I ain't done nothing. Well,
stop and think about this.

1996
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:17,350
Many of your videos have like more
than a million views. Yeah. So that's,

1997
02:06:17,690 --> 02:06:22,320
you're not nobody. It's crazy.
But that's not nobody. Everybody.

1998
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:24,300
Somebody, right? I mean
that's an old saying.

1999
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:29,960
The reality is you have reached out with
your videos and touched and if you saw

2000
02:06:32,191 --> 02:06:34,820
a million people in front of you,
you'd freak the fuck out. Right?

2001
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,530
Well that's more than that.

2002
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:39,450
You've touched many more than that
is millions and millions of people.

2003
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:43,890
It is absolutely crazy to me
too. I just can't, but I don't.

2004
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,520
Cause the first, first year there I
get on on Youtube, I go, hey, look,

2005
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:51,910
I don't give a fuck if you listened
to me and not who would listen to

2006
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:56,670
me. I listened to it, like
turned me to fuck off.

2007
02:06:56,671 --> 02:07:00,810
I don't give a fuck if people in and
I'm carrying a fucking million people

2008
02:07:00,811 --> 02:07:05,610
looking at this. And I'm like, man, I,
it's just, it's just so crazy. So cause I,

2009
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:10,100
and like I said, I consider myself the
least at least, and Lewis and Lewis,

2010
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:14,010
the bottom of the barrel and I'm just,
you know, people, people will say, oh,

2011
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:18,490
CT or you're, uh, the
greatest year, King Year, uh,

2012
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:23,270
I went, oh man, ain't none of
that stuff. I'm nothing. Yeah,

2013
02:07:23,330 --> 02:07:26,550
I'm absolutely not friend.
Well, that's not true either.

2014
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:28,800
What you are as an exceptional person.

2015
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:32,250
The thing about exceptional people
is there a self critical. And the,

2016
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:35,980
one of the reasons why you got to
be so good at what you chose to

2017
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,930
be obsessed by is that you,
you worked hard to constantly improve.

2018
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:43,240
So when you're constantly
working hard to improve,

2019
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,360
you're not thinking I'm the best.
I'm the best healer. God Damn,

2020
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:50,870
I got to go to work. I got to get this
in. I gotta get this done. And so when,

2021
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,480
when people tell you you're great,
you're like, what are you, I'm working.

2022
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:57,790
I'm over here working, trying
to get better. Great man.

2023
02:07:57,791 --> 02:07:59,320
That's inspiring to people though.

2024
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:03,340
The thing about what
inspiration does to people,

2025
02:08:03,341 --> 02:08:06,640
it's almost like a type
of intangible fuel. Oh,

2026
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:10,960
it's can change lives.
So

2027
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:15,260
come to me in, in the line,
they kind of tell me, uh, uh,

2028
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:19,040
grown me.
He starts crying rope.

2029
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:22,910
He's down on his knees and might
want to stay away from that guy.

2030
02:08:23,090 --> 02:08:24,320
This guy is crying.

2031
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:28,490
He would get down on his
knees and tell him, oh,

2032
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:32,840
see changed my life.
You kept me from committing suicide.

2033
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:39,440
I've heard that story that I,
because of me,

2034
02:08:39,441 --> 02:08:43,880
they didn't take their own life
at least a hundred times. Yeah.

2035
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:46,130
Joe Rogan,

2036
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:51,790
what I have gone through just to say if
these people are the same that I saved

2037
02:08:53,451 --> 02:08:58,451
their life because I didn't
give up because I didn't
give in because I kept the

2038
02:09:03,621 --> 02:09:08,390
faith and kept going. I was going to
do that anyway, Joe, that's just right.

2039
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:12,980
But it takes their life for them to tell
me something like that. I'm like, fuck I,

2040
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,860
she had all over again
tomorrow. Well, you know,

2041
02:09:15,861 --> 02:09:20,390
it's like what we were saying earlier
about people that don't have anything that

2042
02:09:20,391 --> 02:09:21,770
they're inspired by.

2043
02:09:22,370 --> 02:09:26,660
And S I was saying I could maybe I wish
I w I saw them when they were young.

2044
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:28,910
Like maybe if you got ahold
of them when they were young,

2045
02:09:28,911 --> 02:09:33,911
you could teach them the
value of expressing themselves
and competing or doing

2046
02:09:33,951 --> 02:09:38,951
something where you get positive feedback
from your effort and I think that some

2047
02:09:39,771 --> 02:09:43,970
people, they just, they don't,
they don't ever get that.

2048
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:48,680
And so when someone gets that
from someone like you, when they,

2049
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:51,140
they get that,
that fuel,

2050
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:55,350
that intangible fuel that you get when
you get inspired by somebody, they,

2051
02:09:55,550 --> 02:09:59,870
it's so emotional because it's a really
is like you gave them a gift and that

2052
02:09:59,871 --> 02:10:03,080
gift we model ourselves after
other successful people.

2053
02:10:03,081 --> 02:10:06,170
We do it all the time either. Hopefully
if everything goes great, you Molly,

2054
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:09,470
self hockey parents or you
model yourself after your uncle,

2055
02:10:09,471 --> 02:10:11,810
your brothers and sisters or
whoever it is that's around you,

2056
02:10:11,811 --> 02:10:15,500
that seems to be exceptional and that
that fuels people, it helps people.

2057
02:10:15,501 --> 02:10:18,590
It means a lot to people.
Sometimes people don't have that,

2058
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:20,330
so they've got to look inward.
They got, uh, you know,

2059
02:10:20,331 --> 02:10:23,870
it's like that old Whitney
Houston Song. Um, you know,

2060
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:29,650
everybody's searching for a hero song
that was like on the Mohammed Ali,

2061
02:10:30,530 --> 02:10:34,610
a life story that was, uh, that
was, that was the song that they,

2062
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:37,940
the original version
of that song was on a,

2063
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,690
it was like a Docu drama
on Muhammad Ali's life,

2064
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:47,710
but that sometimes you don't find someone
for a long time and then when you do,

2065
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:53,030
it changes your whole life.
You find someone,

2066
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:57,510
maybe it's just a youtube video and
it's you saying it's still your mother

2067
02:10:57,511 --> 02:11:01,970
fucking set and it's you just pushing
people and telling people to go get after

2068
02:11:01,971 --> 02:11:06,080
it. And people see that and all of a
sudden it's like they get goosebumps.

2069
02:11:06,350 --> 02:11:09,620
Their hearts starts racing.
It's like you gave them a drug,

2070
02:11:09,621 --> 02:11:13,070
like you gave them fuel and then
then they want to change their life.

2071
02:11:13,071 --> 02:11:15,040
Then they want to watch you tomorrow
and then they want to watch you when

2072
02:11:15,041 --> 02:11:16,280
they're at lunch break.
They don't want you,

2073
02:11:16,281 --> 02:11:19,460
they're taking a shit in other
watch you on the phone. But that's,

2074
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:23,600
that's fuel and you literally can change
a person's life through that because we

2075
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:26,210
need each other.
I mean this is,

2076
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:30,950
it's one more piece of evidence that we
need each other and then we have this

2077
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:33,440
sort of very strange,
loose,

2078
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,620
fitted community of all
human beings together.

2079
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:40,520
And when someone like you does something
that's exceptional and says something

2080
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:43,340
that's exceptional and has
these inspirational words,

2081
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:47,870
it can change a person's whole life,
changed their whole path,

2082
02:11:47,871 --> 02:11:48,704
change who they are.

2083
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:53,270
I've gotten so many messages from people
that say I lost 130 pounds. You know,

2084
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:56,930
I did this, I got off sugar. I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm, I'm fucking running every day.

2085
02:11:56,931 --> 02:12:00,740
I hit the gym five days a week.
Now I'm, I'm a different person.

2086
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:05,120
I'm drinking water. I'm exercise that
I take vitamins, I'm eating healthy,

2087
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:07,760
we've got more juice,
I got more energy.

2088
02:12:07,761 --> 02:12:12,290
My whole life is different now
as it happens all the time. Yeah,

2089
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:16,150
but how does that make
you feel too obligated,

2090
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:22,300
you know? No, I didn't know exactly what
to me. You like, you have to keep going.

2091
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:25,450
You can't feel,
you can't cause man,

2092
02:12:25,451 --> 02:12:29,590
you got all these people
looking up to you.

2093
02:12:30,190 --> 02:12:33,160
Yeah. I don't want that. I definitely
don't want anybody looking up to me.

2094
02:12:33,161 --> 02:12:38,080
But I do like people being inspired and
if people get inspired by me, I'm happy.

2095
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:39,760
But uh,
you know,

2096
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:44,060
they with Joe gave looking up to
you and you can't help it. Man.

2097
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:47,620
You can't help it think I
don't want it. I mean, I don't,

2098
02:12:47,860 --> 02:12:52,450
I always say it all the time.
Yeah. I'm nobody. I'm going
way. Don't look at me, man.

2099
02:12:52,451 --> 02:12:55,450
I'm looking at, I talk about a higher
power and look at the higher power. Man.

2100
02:12:55,451 --> 02:12:59,260
Don't look at me. We fucking
need each other. We all need
each other. We really do.

2101
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:02,500
There's something beautiful
about that though. The only Kiki,

2102
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:06,730
he can't just go it alone. You
really do need each other. And like,

2103
02:13:06,731 --> 02:13:08,920
if you accomplish everything
you ever want to accomplish,

2104
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:12,850
but nobody's there for with you.
Nobody cares. Nobody likes you,

2105
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:16,300
don't mean shit. It's useless. Absolutely.

2106
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:21,550
Love is the most important thing. And
that sounds so cliche, but without love,

2107
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:23,950
it's all useless. Yeah. It's all useless.

2108
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:27,580
There's no personal satisfaction and
accomplishments. If nobody loves you,

2109
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:31,940
you're not going to enjoy it.
Yeah. At least your family. Yeah.

2110
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,310
Yeah.

2111
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:36,460
[inaudible] everybody. And the more
you can spread positive energy,

2112
02:13:36,461 --> 02:13:39,760
the more people will love you, the more
you'll have that community of love,

2113
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:41,040
you know?
And that's,

2114
02:13:42,130 --> 02:13:45,520
it's just like I tell you to, I
never expected even, you know,

2115
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:50,200
Leah Passporty I people,
I always think about,

2116
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:55,590
um, I'm the little kid that used to, um,

2117
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:01,440
hide in the closet when I hear my dad's
keys rattling the door or a police car

2118
02:14:03,370 --> 02:14:07,330
pulled up behind the cause that
they're trying to hide. I didn't want,

2119
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:11,680
I didn't want him to see me. I didn't
want to just, I'm that kid, dude.

2120
02:14:11,681 --> 02:14:15,820
I'm so hmm. And my dad would
always tell me that, you know,

2121
02:14:15,821 --> 02:14:18,880
you're never going to be nothing. You're
never going to do this. You never go.

2122
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:23,700
And so I'm that kid. So it still
fucks with you owe it to come from no,

2123
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:26,830
it, I'm reminded of it. I,

2124
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:31,010
I think about that when people
tell me all your grades or You,

2125
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:36,250
no man, I'm, I come from, I'm you man.

2126
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:41,080
I, I wash dishes, I cut grass, I pump gas.

2127
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:46,480
Um, those people, you know,
I bused tables as a kid.

2128
02:14:46,481 --> 02:14:48,290
I watched it.
I did all those things.

2129
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,720
The people that are saying that I'm great.
I'm my own man. I'm you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2130
02:14:54,850 --> 02:14:59,140
I'm you. I'm not, I'm at
anything other than you.

2131
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:00,190
That's so important.
Yeah.

2132
02:15:00,410 --> 02:15:04,450
Here though. Yeah, they are you. But
that they can be someone like you to,

2133
02:15:04,451 --> 02:15:06,520
if they put in the kind of time
and effort that you put in,

2134
02:15:06,670 --> 02:15:10,180
that's the real message.
The real messages. We all
started from nowhere. I mean,

2135
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:13,180
we all had bullshit jobs
where you felt like losers,

2136
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:16,750
but through time and effort,

2137
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:21,670
you build a stronger human. You build a
stronger body, you build a stronger mind,

2138
02:15:21,671 --> 02:15:23,530
you build complements and we'll,

2139
02:15:23,531 --> 02:15:27,280
and momentum and then you
look back and you go, hey man,

2140
02:15:27,281 --> 02:15:31,060
I'm not washing tables anymore. You
know, I'm not a, I'm not washing dishes.

2141
02:15:31,061 --> 02:15:33,940
I'm not cutting lawns
and not digging ditches.

2142
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:37,180
I'm a different person now,
but I used to be

2143
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:42,410
and are these desire not to be there
for a mattress? That's, that's what the,

2144
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,280
that's the hardest.
Yeah.

2145
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:43,560
All right.

2146
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:47,270
Just to get out of that Rut when you ain't
got shit and there's nothing going on.

2147
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:51,140
To have faith then is so difficult
to have faith when you're successful.

2148
02:15:51,141 --> 02:15:53,750
It's like, yeah, this is a bit,
she'd been successful for a while.

2149
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:57,950
Once she got faith, just keep doing
what you're doing is absolutely right.

2150
02:15:57,951 --> 02:16:01,790
It's like you already got up the hill.
Now you're just coasting. You know,

2151
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:04,840
you're just rolling down the hill.
Everything's great and it's easy,

2152
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:08,990
smooth sailing. The hard part
is getting up that fucking hill.

2153
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:11,390
Especially if you've got
a dad you're hiding from,

2154
02:16:11,391 --> 02:16:14,000
especially if you feel
like you're a loser.

2155
02:16:14,001 --> 02:16:16,820
You never really had anything in your
life that you could look back on and say,

2156
02:16:16,821 --> 02:16:18,730
hey, I was really good at that. You know,

2157
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:20,870
and that's a lot of people
out there listening to this.

2158
02:16:20,871 --> 02:16:24,050
There's so many people that are in that.
That's that starting point,

2159
02:16:24,530 --> 02:16:27,440
like the people that come up to you and
say, what do I don't know what to do?

2160
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:30,640
What should I do? How do I do
it? How do I get going? Well,

2161
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:33,280
you're going to have to figure it out.
One foot in front of the other.

2162
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:37,900
You're going to have to find a thing and
keep working at it and get better at it.

2163
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:40,540
That's one of the things that I
liked so much about martial arts.

2164
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:44,710
They let anybody in anybody in,
and then from that,

2165
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:48,610
from learning how to do that, you get
better and then you realize, damn,

2166
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:52,980
I didn't get better at anything because
it's so the first time I ever did you

2167
02:16:52,981 --> 02:16:55,720
did sue. I remember just being
manhandled. So bad going, man,

2168
02:16:55,721 --> 02:16:59,500
I'll never be good at this. This is
terrible. I'm fucking awful at this.

2169
02:16:59,501 --> 02:16:59,790
And this is,

2170
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:03,580
I had already been a black
belt in taekwondo and
already kickboxer did a bunch

2171
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:06,400
of shit and I was like, I can't believe
I'm starting from scratch again.

2172
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:11,920
But that at least I knew then that I
already done that before I'd already

2173
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:15,720
started from scratch. So like I had some
experience and started from scratch.

2174
02:17:15,721 --> 02:17:17,650
I'm like, Oh, I have to do is just
put in the time and the effort.

2175
02:17:17,690 --> 02:17:22,320
Yeah, the desire to get better data.
That's for everybody. Just find a thing.

2176
02:17:22,350 --> 02:17:23,183
Everything.

2177
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:26,370
And if you find a thing like
a particularly martial arts,

2178
02:17:26,371 --> 02:17:30,150
because you get belts and ranks and
then you could see how you're doing with

2179
02:17:30,151 --> 02:17:32,030
opponents,
especially Jujitsu.

2180
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:34,600
I liked that when the bolt's cause
you're not getting hit, you know?

2181
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:37,630
I think there's so many people that
in the, especially if you go to a,

2182
02:17:37,631 --> 02:17:40,800
a bad gym in the early days,
people going to tune, tune you up.

2183
02:17:41,590 --> 02:17:42,423
I'm going to beat you up.

2184
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:46,180
Yep. Yeah. You can get some little
damage. It'd be scourge a lot.

2185
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:50,300
Yeah. But if you could just find a
thing and work hard at that thing,

2186
02:17:50,301 --> 02:17:54,980
you'll realize through that thing that
you can get good at anything with time

2187
02:17:54,981 --> 02:17:55,680
and effort.

2188
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:58,820
Don't have anything on hand. I
mean, you pick the thing. Yeah.

2189
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:02,590
Great. What getting calls to you,
whatever. Whatever calls to you.

2190
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:07,580
Yep. They'd be desired to
change to, to, to not, uh,

2191
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:12,370
to change those circumstances, whatever
they might be. Yeah. As long as you have,

2192
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:16,700
you have to have that desire,
the will to change their circumstances.

2193
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:20,550
That's actually start right there man.
We are how bleak it makes scene.

2194
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:23,860
But if you have the will
to be sired to change it,

2195
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:25,730
they are just starting point.

2196
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:28,960
Since you started doing these
videos on youtube to now,

2197
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:31,290
how much of a difference
has it made in the, the,

2198
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:36,190
the types of people that come to your
gym and then the numbers of people that

2199
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:37,024
come in,

2200
02:18:37,170 --> 02:18:38,003
um,

2201
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:42,990
that I have Joe Rogan's phone number.

2202
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:49,030
I have Terry crews phone number. I
have doctor Trey's phone number. Yeah.

2203
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:53,880
Saw you, you took a lot of pictures of
Dr Dre man. Even high with them a lot.

2204
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:59,150
Dr Dre. I know, hey, you guys
look at the news and he's,

2205
02:18:59,290 --> 02:19:03,300
he might see, hey, it don't say
anything bad about Dr in front of me.

2206
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:08,740
We haven't got an incredible
individual and credible Dr Dre,

2207
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:14,400
I call them trade. Now. Trade
is an incredible individual.

2208
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:18,960
His heart is huge.
Huge too.

2209
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:21,360
I can't take it out cause it took,
not too,

2210
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:26,070
but that he's an incredible individual.

2211
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:29,030
Was jacked at one point
in time, right? Yeah.

2212
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:31,940
You still looks great.

2213
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,490
He told me he's in very
good shape right now.

2214
02:19:34,491 --> 02:19:38,880
He's a lot of cardio eats really
well. Matter of fact, uh, he,

2215
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:41,210
he's got this trail he wants me to,

2216
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:45,680
he challenged me to turn it out hiking
up a hill and I'm not ready for it too.

2217
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:50,060
But Dr Dre, if you miss me, I'm
gonna make it up at fucking trail.

2218
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:56,750
I might have to roll down, but I'm going
to back. You know, he's in great shape,

2219
02:19:56,751 --> 02:20:01,600
but he's a great human being.
He's a, a very good human being.

2220
02:20:01,850 --> 02:20:05,340
That's awesome to hear.
I love hearing just down to Earth.

2221
02:20:05,341 --> 02:20:10,341
So he shifted his training from
like just a really big goal.

2222
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:14,000
Yeah. He's all at the comedy store one
night and he looked like the rock. Yeah,

2223
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:18,110
exactly. You know, he's,
he's more a, you know,

2224
02:20:18,111 --> 02:20:22,620
health oriented and cardio
and he wants to, uh,

2225
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:26,150
he said his goal was to
get down to 200 pounds, uh,

2226
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:31,010
of just lean low body fat percentage
muscle. What does he weigh now?

2227
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:35,720
Uh, two 10 I think he said, and were with
me and him saying around the same way.

2228
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:39,440
And my goal is also to get down to
200 pounds. I want to be 200 pounds,

2229
02:20:39,441 --> 02:20:42,860
which I haven't been in a long time,
but I want to be 200 pounds. Well,

2230
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:44,640
there's pictures of you
when you were power lifting.

2231
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:51,000
Three 25 25. Oh my God. I man,

2232
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:54,050
wow man. I ain't gonna call
this motherfucker in the world.

2233
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:59,060
So you are as wide as a building
now house God damn three.

2234
02:21:01,470 --> 02:21:04,880
So you were 115 pounds
heavier than you are now.

2235
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:11,320
So, so you see why I feel like I'm
scared of within that 15 pounds state.

2236
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:15,050
You know, I feel like a skeleton
now. Compare it to did man,

2237
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:19,310
but just stop and thinking
about 115 one pound stakes.

2238
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:23,440
Just slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap,
slap, slap, slap, slap, all that big.

2239
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:28,600
I just a lot of me
shoulders and I did care.

2240
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:33,350
I pay out, almost pass out, tied my shoes,

2241
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:38,780
get out of breath, walking to the
front fucking door. I'm like, Oh fuck.

2242
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:42,340
See overweightness are at your door again.
Oh fuck.

2243
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:46,730
You were saying you had a terrible
diet back then. Oh it was horrible day.

2244
02:21:46,731 --> 02:21:49,760
You are looking at you.
Yeah. Yeah. That's my it

2245
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:55,430
shit.
That ain't all fat man.

2246
02:21:56,260 --> 02:22:00,990
You look gigantic as a fat fuck and
I'm trying to get like the other guy,

2247
02:22:00,991 --> 02:22:04,100
I don't know if that lean
lean CPU on the other side.

2248
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:06,290
How much did you weigh in the other side?

2249
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:11,180
On the other side I was probably about
two 20 I want to get down to 200 pounds.

2250
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:16,640
That's the goal by sixties be 200 pounds.
Jesus crossing the size of your arm,

2251
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:23,360
so crazy fucking arm.
That is so preposterous.

2252
02:22:23,390 --> 02:22:26,040
And the TRICEP,
the line

2253
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,140
between the tricep and the Bicep,
that is,

2254
02:22:28,370 --> 02:22:33,200
that's what me, me and I think
through my a lid on. Yeah.

2255
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:38,750
I don't think so. Stop lying.
I picked, they helped me. Yeah,

2256
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:42,890
I don't think so. You look
pretty young there too. Yeah,

2257
02:22:42,891 --> 02:22:47,810
I was actually a 50,
50 more tonight to in that picture.

2258
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:52,310
Yeah. Wow. Go back to that again.
That's 50 with no steroids.

2259
02:22:52,311 --> 02:22:55,940
That's ridiculous. Well, a natural, uh,

2260
02:22:56,870 --> 02:23:01,030
um, and uh, uh, professional, uh,

2261
02:23:01,390 --> 02:23:03,230
the natural professor
who would be freezing.

2262
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,010
So I won the over 50 category and mile.
Well,

2263
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:11,680
that's how I got my pro card
is a bodybuilder. But, uh, I,

2264
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:14,080
it looks a little at what daddy me,

2265
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:22,690
big difference. We were talking about
people that come to your gym nomad,

2266
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:26,490
I mean flock to you now. Um, I flack,

2267
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:27,830
I don't know if that's kind of cool though

2268
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,490
because you,
you have sort of,

2269
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:34,350
you've taken on this role as a guru.
I mean,

2270
02:23:34,351 --> 02:23:38,850
that's one of the things that a lot of
people have gotten from your videos and

2271
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:43,470
these, I mean there's
motivation from, you know,

2272
02:23:43,471 --> 02:23:46,470
a lot of people can give you motivation
and some of that motivation seems stale

2273
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:49,650
and then there's some people that give
you motivation like, wow, that's alive.

2274
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,920
That shit's alive. Your
motivation is live. It's real.

2275
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:54,270
You could tell it's not scripted.

2276
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:58,980
Yeah. Tell me what you see. I put her
in the heart. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

2277
02:23:58,981 --> 02:24:03,930
Everything is right off
the top of the head, man. I
think, uh, when a guru, right,

2278
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:07,170
that's an every tighter I think
I'm definitely not worthy.

2279
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:12,000
I maybe, you know, people
say, oh, he's an old g old.

2280
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:16,180
It's more closer to I've
been around long enough.

2281
02:24:16,330 --> 02:24:19,930
Well, you're also like people turn
because of the fact you've been around,

2282
02:24:19,931 --> 02:24:23,600
you've done so much, the people
will turn to you and say, hey you,

2283
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:28,300
this is a person with real
life experience. You, you
really have done things.

2284
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:31,210
You had done some stuff.
When you start talking about pushing,

2285
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:32,950
he started talking about pushing yourself.

2286
02:24:32,951 --> 02:24:35,710
People understand this is
coming from life experience.

2287
02:24:36,190 --> 02:24:40,000
This is real and that's a different,
that's why it's if resonates with people,

2288
02:24:40,001 --> 02:24:42,340
it resonates with people
because it's authentic.

2289
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:47,150
Man. That's, that's a high
compliment. I appreciate it.

2290
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:49,310
Thanks it death.
Both staff leaves.

2291
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:51,510
There's a lot of people out there
listening to this, that know you,

2292
02:24:51,511 --> 02:24:54,090
that are not in their head right now.
And appreciation and understanding.

2293
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:57,170
They know what we're saying. They
know that when you, when you,

2294
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:58,830
you fire me the fuck up dude.

2295
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:04,240
Those videos I get fired
up high praise right there.

2296
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:06,710
It's not just me man.
It's a lot of other people.

2297
02:25:06,950 --> 02:25:11,190
But that must have led a lot
of people to come to gym. Yeah.

2298
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:14,480
I get people from a and I go,

2299
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:18,260
I guarantee that I'm going to be there
on Wednesday nights because people come

2300
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:21,940
all the time expecting me to be
at the gym 24 hours a day. Right.

2301
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:26,760
Where is the gym? It's in
Signal Hill, California and
uh, it's iron addicts, right?

2302
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:30,100
Iron addicts, GM, Signal
Hill, California. And uh,

2303
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:33,880
there's a rumor that we're going to be
opening up another one here pretty soon.

2304
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:39,050
A, we haven't decided yet.
I'm over here side, you know,

2305
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:42,280
that's, that's a possibility. He
will need a hardcore gym out here.

2306
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:46,890
That is a possibility. Uh, uh,

2307
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:51,850
an area where people can afford the
membership. That's what we were thinking,

2308
02:25:51,851 --> 02:25:55,540
man. You know, cause we're where
I'm at now too. I tell you,

2309
02:25:55,570 --> 02:26:00,370
I could make a lot more money,
but I, you know, first responders,

2310
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:04,150
firemen, policemen, uh,
all vets, paramedics,

2311
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:07,730
they trained at the gym for free. Could
feel I don't turn to him. Nothing. Man,

2312
02:26:07,731 --> 02:26:09,790
that's amazing.
It's the least I could do.

2313
02:26:09,791 --> 02:26:13,210
I think it's at least I can
think is beautiful. And so yeah,

2314
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:17,590
I could make more money,
but that's something that I
choose to do. Good for you.

2315
02:26:17,650 --> 02:26:19,150
Yeah.
But yeah,

2316
02:26:19,151 --> 02:26:24,151
we're thinking about opening up another
one in the area where people got some

2317
02:26:24,521 --> 02:26:29,140
money. When you do, man, let
me know and I'll get that
bat signal up in the sky. Oh,

2318
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:32,980
hey, definitely. Definitely Joe Rogan

2319
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:38,240
podcast. What? You had one of my,
it's on. Yeah, man. Thank you.

2320
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:42,070
I really appreciate that.
Oh my pleasure brother.

2321
02:26:42,071 --> 02:26:45,790
I was so fucking excited when I see
that somebody, somebody seen it first.

2322
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:50,290
One of my kids see first cause there
all the time on social media. Hey Dad,

2323
02:26:50,291 --> 02:26:53,800
look at you. I'm like,
Oh fuck. That's cool.

2324
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:58,980
I was happy for you to see that your
posters hanging up in the air to a broken

2325
02:26:58,981 --> 02:27:03,550
screw up my poster hanging up
in his brain. That's cool man.

2326
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:05,380
That is so,
so you're there every Wednesday,

2327
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:08,830
every Wednesday night and that's
when the gym is pretty packed.

2328
02:27:08,831 --> 02:27:11,710
And Wednesday nights we do
a live workout and people,

2329
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:14,010
you take people through this workout,
all you have,

2330
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:18,220
if they come on Wednesday
nights, I've trained people,
you know, I don't, I it it,

2331
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:21,940
it's on Wednesday nights to
absolutely free. I'll see.

2332
02:27:21,941 --> 02:27:24,970
That's another reason make them, I have
people come over on Wednesday nights,

2333
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:28,420
they train for absolutely free.
All you gotta do is sign the waiver.

2334
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:32,250
So if you get fucked up, it's on you.
You don't try to sue me in that light.

2335
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:35,800
But if you come on Wednesday night and
sign, the waiver is absolutely free.

2336
02:27:35,830 --> 02:27:40,360
That's amazing. Yeah. I yell and
scream at him. He'll let me see.

2337
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:42,030
He called me motherfucking people.

2338
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:46,810
It's so funny because my motherfucking,
I'm like,

2339
02:27:46,811 --> 02:27:49,690
I've been calling people a motherfucker
since the fifth grade for him.

2340
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:52,020
For nothing, man. He
wasn't that weird. Yeah.

2341
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:54,290
And now they want me to call
him mother fucker. You know,

2342
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:59,900
I'm on the Cameo Cameo and on
the cameo they can for 25 bucks.

2343
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:02,260
I cussed him out.
Oh,

2344
02:28:02,261 --> 02:28:07,261
that's how it became your
app and it costs 25 bucks.

2345
02:28:07,391 --> 02:28:12,050
I cut some out and I'm like, damn, I used
to cuss me out for nothing. That's how

2346
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:17,740
I took about 10 a day. Really?
Yeah. Wow. Some out man.

2347
02:28:18,110 --> 02:28:23,030
I wish my, uh, you know, wished me
happy fucking birthday. See Dean,

2348
02:28:23,031 --> 02:28:27,650
I was happy birthday or whatever the
fuck they want. Right. Five bucks, man.

2349
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:32,060
That's very reasonable. Yeah.
Yeah. Used to be more and, and uh,

2350
02:28:32,061 --> 02:28:35,450
as an African and make it cheap and
so more people can afford to do it.

2351
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:40,670
I don't mind. I might cuss him out. I
would, I would say he got a heart of gold.

2352
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:44,110
But you have a new heart. Yeah. So
you've got a new heart. A goal there,

2353
02:28:44,170 --> 02:28:47,300
but you really do, man, the way you
look at things is, it's very cool.

2354
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:51,040
It's very cool the way you let first
responders and firefighters and veterans

2355
02:28:51,041 --> 02:28:55,130
work out for free and the Wednesday
night working out for free and all that.

2356
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:59,480
Your heart is in the right place.
Your mind's in the right place. I try.

2357
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:01,820
I tried to go. It is, man.

2358
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:05,510
It is so like the
environment around the gym.

2359
02:29:05,870 --> 02:29:10,230
How much did it change once you
started putting up those videos? Oh,

2360
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:14,480
uh, it's, it's a type of gym.

2361
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:19,070
My type of jam that um,
if you're don't,

2362
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:23,440
uh, you know, I got to say is
we got number two behind goals.

2363
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:26,360
Dam as a favorite
hardcore gang in America.

2364
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:30,170
Iron addicts get behind
Gold's gym, man. Holy Shit.

2365
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,870
You can't beat Gold's gym
because she might be number one.

2366
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:35,570
Always going to vote for
Gold's gym number one.

2367
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:41,430
But that can be incredible. That's an
honor, man. That's what I'm saying.

2368
02:29:41,470 --> 02:29:44,900
I think you won. That was a super,
I feel like you got first place.

2369
02:29:45,370 --> 02:29:49,430
He can't really defeat Gold's gym.
People come in, you know, from,

2370
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:54,640
from a Lithuanian CT, and then we
came, we were in, in town on vacation.

2371
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:57,900
One place we wanted to go was your gym.
Wow.

2372
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:03,560
I love that kind of stuff. It's
amazing. It is so gratifying. You know?

2373
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:07,040
It might, but it's, it's
not a planet fitness.

2374
02:30:08,350 --> 02:30:11,420
It's a hardcore, I love
the way it looks. Yeah.

2375
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:15,270
It looks like it's just like a fucking
tornado ransom. But if you don't

2376
02:30:18,350 --> 02:30:21,900
look like they've been, everybody's
been lifting. Yeah. That's what I like.

2377
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,130
Fuck out of here with that.

2378
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:30,590
But see the x [inaudible] the,
if you had that kind of mentality,

2379
02:30:30,770 --> 02:30:34,670
then you'll love it. Yeah. You know,
there's some people going like, ah,

2380
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:38,240
I don't know. It's not my
cup of tea. Then you won't.

2381
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:43,560
Thank goodness there's enough people like
us. And my daughter's like, could you,

2382

2383
02:30:49,131 --> 02:30:52,850

and I'm going, fuck, this is perfect.

2384
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:59,630

up a little bit. Banged up. Asked me.

2386
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:06,140
Especially if you, you're going
to go put yourself through hell.

2387
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:11,150
You like cars too. Yeah. I love
cars. I noticed that you love cars.

2388
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:15,600
I love cars. You got a
corvette to yeah. 65. I know,

2389
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:19,680
man. It's fucking bad ass
too. But you didn't know that.

2390
02:31:19,681 --> 02:31:23,700
I'm a car nut too. I do know your
car. Not We talked about it. We did.

2391
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:28,200
Yeah. What do you have? Oh,

2392

02:31:46,610 --> 02:31:51,450
wow. Damn you are good on that. You
speak about, yeah, that's yours too.

2397
02:31:51,710 --> 02:31:56,210
Oh, that one's nice. Black

one we have here. Is that sent me to that.

2399
02:32:01,101 --> 02:32:04,410
So that's all generation three,
right? Yeah. Yeah. My, my uh,

2400
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:08,900
my neighbors hate that fucker is loud.
I bags that years.

2401
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:11,960
Amazing. Those, those
are gorgeous cars, man.

2402
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:17,670
Compared to what you can. But you know, I
like them. I love them. I love Corvettes.

2403
02:32:17,671 --> 02:32:19,890
I liked the new ones too.
I like all of them. Yeah.

2404
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:22,980
You got something else besides the
corvette too? I heard about it,

2405
02:32:22,981 --> 02:32:26,020
but I haven't seen, I seen the
corvette. But what else? Um,

2406
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,590
I have a 69 Nova that they're
building right now. I did sucked.

2407
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:33,540
I think I did. And, and you, you,

2408
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:37,800
everything's like super new. I know. It's,

2409
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:41,190
yeah.
I don't like old shit.

2410
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:47,750
Fucked up suspensions. We can't go around
corners. I'm not interested in dying.

2411
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:52,450
Not like that. Oh yeah. I
like what they call resto.

2412
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:55,820
That's the electric
yours. Oh No, no. I, I,

2413
02:32:55,830 --> 02:33:00,830
well the yellow one I got from a guy
who's a plastic surgeon and that was like

2414
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:06,540
his bottom of the line car,
but he did everything to it.

2415
02:33:06,541 --> 02:33:10,760
It's got the suspension and everything
and it makes a big difference. You know,

2416
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:15,960
I could try that thing anywhere. But the,
uh, the black room for 27 try and Carb,

2417
02:33:16,050 --> 02:33:20,130
it's old school, old school all
the way and the brakes. No, no,

2418
02:33:20,131 --> 02:33:23,370
it's got disc brakes. Yeah. That's where
you got to draw the line. Yeah. Yeah.

2419
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:26,200
Got It. Here. I've got to be able
to stop. Got to be able to stop it.

2420
02:33:26,201 --> 02:33:30,770
That fucker is, and actually I
like, I like shit like that. I,

2421
02:33:31,230 --> 02:33:36,000
I wouldn't mind the restroom. I, but
I, I like the, I like, Oh shit man.

2422
02:33:36,001 --> 02:33:40,720
I just, I like old houses. I like
old cars. I collect old bikes.

2423
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:45,660
Yeah. Just old shit. I just,
shit man. I do too. Yeah.

2424
02:33:45,770 --> 02:33:48,320
I think this character told things.
Yup.

2425
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:51,810
It's like either you like it or you don't
like some people just like everything

2426
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:55,860
new and modern and shining.
Like when I started making money,

2427
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:58,590
I started buying older cars.
I like older shit.

2428
02:33:58,710 --> 02:34:03,570
You just have a different feel to them.
Totally. Totally. Totally. Totally.

2429
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:08,460
I have a, uh, yeah. Yeah. Just your trade.
His truck, man. What did you get this?

2430
02:34:09,260 --> 02:34:12,210
I got that, uh, probably six months ago.

2431
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:16,990
See,
I liked it motherfucker at all.

2432
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:21,450
All the Patina on that crew cab
or for freaks, the wine crew cab.

2433
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:26,330
Find those creek and it came from
the factory or crew cab man. Wow.

2434
02:34:26,490 --> 02:34:31,120
That truck looks like me
bashed in windows and shit.

2435
02:34:31,121 --> 02:34:35,290
Scars. Beautiful. I love it. I love you.

2436
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:39,060
Drive that around that motherfucker.
You know what? I'm waiting there.

2437
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:42,580
I am going to get the Party work done
on that mother fucker because it's got

2438
02:34:42,581 --> 02:34:46,130
some holes in it. Oh it's pretty beat up.
Yeah, it's pretty. I got to get the buddy.

2439
02:34:46,131 --> 02:34:50,740
We're good to go. There's something to
that. When you look at those old cars,

2440
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:54,200
you realize that they don't make
anything like this anymore. No Man.

2441
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:56,620
The style,
uh,

2442
02:34:56,650 --> 02:35:01,240
they really put a lot into
style 50s and sixties, man.

2443
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:06,270
But it just doesn't seem same. He didn't
say look good like a new corvette,

2444
02:35:06,350 --> 02:35:10,300
like a 2019 corvette. It's a beautiful
car. But you look at that old truck,

2445
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:13,130
it does not have what that truck has.
Its like it,

2446
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:16,810
it'll put a smile on your
face just driving it, man.

2447
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:20,770
One of my biggest joys is it
sitting behind the wheel of that,

2448
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:25,510
those old cars, man, it just makes me,
I feel like a young mother fucking,

2449
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:29,920
when I'm sitting there like a kid.
Yeah. Like it's a toy. Oh, like a ride.

2450
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:33,510
Like you driving around in a
ride. It is, yeah. It's so much.

2451
02:35:33,870 --> 02:35:38,240
You pull up to a stoplight, some other
fucking glue in the car next to him.

2452
02:35:38,241 --> 02:35:40,450
The guy's giving you a thumbs up,
man.

2453
02:35:40,451 --> 02:35:42,910
I be cheesing from ear
to ear when that happens.

2454
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,930
And you don't even have to drive those
fast. No. Yeah. Even that corvette,

2455
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:51,880
you don't have to. Every once in a while
it's fun, you know, break them loose.

2456
02:35:52,270 --> 02:35:55,660
It's a little fun to break them loose,
but you know,

2457
02:35:55,661 --> 02:35:58,000
you don't have to drive for me.
Well, for a power lifter though,

2458
02:35:58,001 --> 02:36:01,840
it's almost like mandatory for you to
have some sort of a muscle car. Yeah,

2459
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:05,950
I can't. So it's like, it
goes with the territory.

2460
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:08,290
It doesn't like a big block
engine. There's you, oh,

2461
02:36:08,291 --> 02:36:11,470
somebody got a video of you
driving by. Yeah. That's hilarious.

2462
02:36:11,770 --> 02:36:16,620
I like you get recognized a lot,
you know more than I, you know, I'm,

2463
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:20,720
I'm still shocked but it,
I go to the store,

2464
02:36:21,390 --> 02:36:26,340
I was walking down the street
the other day and it got, hey CT,

2465
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:28,810
you know what? I was yelling and
screaming from the car and I'm like, man,

2466
02:36:28,811 --> 02:36:30,850
how do you even know what the fuck I am?

2467
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:34,870
Because I figure if you're not a weight
lifter and you don't look at Youtube,

2468
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:39,980
then I know that's a lot of
people. Yeah. Well you know,

2469
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:44,400
even know who the fuck I was.
I was, I still shocked by,

2470
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:47,830
but I get recognized more than that,
you know, or did I thought I would.

2471
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:53,340
This CT Fletcher 2.0 that this life
that you're living right now. Yes.

2472
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:58,420
What? What is, what is different in
like what you're trying to accomplish?

2473
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:03,610
Oh Man. The first one, you
know, it was me, me, me, me,

2474
02:37:03,611 --> 02:37:08,611
me and this 2.0 guy is so much more
concerned about other people and doing

2475
02:37:11,771 --> 02:37:16,550
something to help somebody
else is almost more important.

2476
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:21,130
Veno know my,
my initial videos you see as well,

2477
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:23,750
you may not know right now,
but you will, you know,

2478
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,830
I'm going to do this and what this
guy, fuck that guy. I'm, I'm king.

2479
02:37:27,831 --> 02:37:29,810
I'm the beast album. The bad. It's one.

2480
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:34,550
I'm the baddest man on the
planet and you know, as I,

2481
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:40,030
and now I consider myself this new guys
so insignificant that it's not even

2482
02:37:41,571 --> 02:37:44,660
funny me and just a CT for us.

2483
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:49,910
It feel weird to just completely shifted
your consciousness like that. It,

2484
02:37:50,110 --> 02:37:54,650
it,
it s a little weird at times.

2485
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:58,100
It feels a little weird.
Like you're not even you. Uh,

2486
02:37:58,130 --> 02:38:02,210
but so much it's me and I know it's me,

2487
02:38:02,211 --> 02:38:07,030
but I feel so much better,
so much better, man.

2488
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:10,910
He was, what happened when, when
the focus on me, you know, um,

2489
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:15,680
this, this new version, it's news. It's,

2490
02:38:15,870 --> 02:38:20,870
I feel so much better than I'm
trying to bring people together.

2491
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:23,510
I'm telling like, I have a, my mission,

2492
02:38:23,511 --> 02:38:26,510
my purpose is so much greater.

2493
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:30,590
I'm trying to do some good old
[inaudible] Fletcher. That's my mom.

2494
02:38:30,591 --> 02:38:34,580
That's the lady who kept me from
being completely retarded as a kid.

2495
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:37,850
I the oldest reflect your
heart foundation. You know,

2496
02:38:37,851 --> 02:38:42,851
I'm tried to a nonprofit organization
named my mom and it's to people because

2497
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:49,100
our transplant is a very,
I mean, lot of people,

2498
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:51,320
if it wasn't for the
army, for what? For me,

2499
02:38:51,321 --> 02:38:53,540
being a veteran is no way I
could afford a transplant.

2500
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:58,580
It's $1 million for seizure and
handle fucking million dollars show.

2501
02:38:58,820 --> 02:39:03,050
It's so, but there's other,
even if you have insurance,

2502
02:39:03,051 --> 02:39:05,210
there's other things that comes up,
you know,

2503
02:39:05,211 --> 02:39:08,660
say that the head of the family has to
have a transplant, a heart transplant.

2504
02:39:08,870 --> 02:39:13,070
He's out. Ah, okay. His medical bills
are taken care of it, but what about,

2505
02:39:13,071 --> 02:39:16,490
how's his wife gonna pay the mortgage?
How she's going to buy gas?

2506
02:39:16,491 --> 02:39:17,750
I just going to feed the kids.

2507
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:22,580
I started the Osb Fletcher
Heart Foundation to help people,

2508
02:39:22,970 --> 02:39:23,803
uh,

2509
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:28,070
with that to help the mom who still at
home was still has to pay the bills and

2510
02:39:28,071 --> 02:39:32,450
stuff because insurance doesn't cover
everything to help the people that don't,

2511
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:37,370
you know, I haven't, I haven't had even
had my first event or anything like that.

2512
02:39:37,371 --> 02:39:41,060
I just paid the lawyer for, uh, to
get the name and stuff as a kid,

2513
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:43,610
but I won't have to start.

2514
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:46,400
You got to start somewhere and that
started had the visit of my hand.

2515
02:39:46,401 --> 02:39:50,150
I'm going to do something for my mom. So
her memory, you know, go on. You know,

2516
02:39:50,151 --> 02:39:52,160
even after I'm dead and gone,

2517
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:55,310
those referred to heart foundation will
still be around and we'll do something

2518
02:39:55,311 --> 02:39:59,480
to honor her because that woman, you
know, everything I am is because of her.

2519
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:01,730
So I wanted to do something to honor her.

2520
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:07,060
I just got all these things I want
to do to help my veterans and PTSD.

2521
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:12,140
Uh, I could, I got so many goals
and stuff to live for a man.

2522
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:15,750
I don't know what to do and I don't know
how much time I got to do it. I can,

2523
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:17,970
you know, walk out of here and
dropped dead. I don't know.

2524
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:21,300
But I'm going to be got danced with her.
I'm not going to waste one second Evan.

2525
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:22,440
I'm going to be trying,

2526
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:26,610
I'm on the Joe Rogan show and I'm talking
to Joe Rogan podcasts and I'm talking

2527
02:40:26,611 --> 02:40:30,900
about it right now. So I'm doing something
about it. Joe, what is donor weirdness?

2528
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:33,870
Beautiful to see your,
your transformation man.

2529
02:40:34,050 --> 02:40:38,250
It's beautiful to see this evolution view
as a person and it's beautiful to see

2530
02:40:38,251 --> 02:40:41,040

2531
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:44,400
terrible scare but came
out a better person.

2532
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:45,970
Oh Man.
Yeah.

2533
02:40:45,971 --> 02:40:50,080
It's something else that we were on the
last time we were talking to and I said,

2534
02:40:50,081 --> 02:40:53,260
yeah,
they tell me I need a heart transplant,

2535
02:40:53,710 --> 02:40:58,180
a heart transplant. Oh my
God, Dude. Are you scared?

2536
02:40:58,540 --> 02:41:03,340
Like no drop, mad, scared. But it's
uh, it's something else, man. It is.

2537

later. Now you have it. Yup.

Rogan podcast, Joe Rogan packets.

2543

you are. So this opportunity,
