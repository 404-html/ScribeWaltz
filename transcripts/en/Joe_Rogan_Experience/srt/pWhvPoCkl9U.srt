1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:01,831
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:05,160
That's why I think that activities
are really important for people.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,550
There's a lot of people that
unfortunately don't engage in activity.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,340
They don't engage and tell him to
have hobbies or anything like that.

6
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,220
I learn a language.

7
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,390
They did do something,

8
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,740
do something that's exciting

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,591
art of learning.

10
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,090
You know the problem with
our education system,

11
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:19,430
Garvey,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,010
I was saying this is what it was,

13
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:25,030
that we don't have an education
system that teaches you how to think.

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
We don't like so true.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,061
And that's,

16
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:28,510
that's,

17
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,171
that's the,

18
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:30,400
there is an art to learning,

19
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:30,671
man.

20
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:31,560
There's an art to learning.

21
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,210
It's an art.

22
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,970
It's an art to be in a human beings.

23
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:34,270
Right.

24
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,901
It really is.

25
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:35,920
And no one teaches us.

26
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:37,060
We don't know what the fuck we're doing.

27
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:42,061
We're all idiots raising other people
by the same flaws that we were raised

28
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:42,461
with.

29
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:43,480
There's no manual for it.

30
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,261
Exactly.

31
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,380
And there's an,

32
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,970
when you look at what we consider our are
our source of education as far as like

33
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,890
what is distributed to us nightly,

34
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,940
what's the news?

35
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,361
Right.

36
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:57,880
I mean that's really the
education that people have today.

37
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,290
Once you get out of school,

38
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,270
unless you're reading books on your own,

39
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,220
where are you getting your
information about the world?

40
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:04,720
You're getting it from the fucking news.

41
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,140
Well,

42
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,220
the news doesn't really represent
what's a going on in the world and B,

43
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:12,190
it doesn't say anything about how
you should be dealing with this,

44
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,540
how you should be thinking,

45
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:13,991
how we,

46
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,360
how we should resolve these issues.

47
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,870
It's like this tattle tale that just
goes running over and tells us about all

48
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,580
the fucked up shit that's
happening in the world,

49
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,750
but they don't,

50
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,000
there's not a dialogue with a person.

51
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,530
It's like a source of information

52
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:26,820
shy.

53
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,530
The way that that complaint
goes back at least 3,500 years.

54
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,310
Socrates,

55
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,200
when he was in his trial said,

56
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,190
you take a,

57
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,370
you wouldn't take a horse to
try to ride it and not train it.

58
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,800
The same applies to a human being.

59
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,521
You got to,

60
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,600
you got to start with,

61
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,660
with the notion of he was trying to
teach philosophy in the sense that you

62
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,110
better,

63
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,720
you better know what questions
to ask throughout your life.

64
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,430
And we should start with young people,

65
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,180
educate young people the right
way with the right questions.

66
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,410
If you don't do that,

67
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:55,741
then,

68
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,461
then you know,

69
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,260
you've got to start with a base almost,

70
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,040
you know,

71
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,330
and,

72
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,163
and uh,

73
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,051
we don't,

74
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:01,650
we don't do that.

75
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,910
Men,

76
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,190
we,

77
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,570
it's,

78
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,690
it's almost like learning Jujitsu,

79
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,270
just learning moves without learning
the principles behind it first.

80
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,731
Yeah.

81
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:11,140
Well it's also like learning
Jujitsu without going over
the real correct drills,

82
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,250
learning real live applications and,

83
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,000
and the,

84
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,480
you know,

85
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,760
the,

86
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,010
the way school is set up,

87
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,250
I,

88
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,941
you note again,

89
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,774
you mother Fucker,

90
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,250
the way school is set up,

91
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:21,491
it's,

92
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:26,491
they have x amount of thousand kids and
they have to get these kids through with

93
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,320
a basic understanding of the
building blocks of our world.

94
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,820
They have to understand math.

95
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:30,921
They,

96
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,000
I've done understanding of how to
structure a sentence and they understand.

97
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,750
They have to understand that if foreign
paragraphs and they've got to know what

98
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,450
happened in the past and then you're,

99
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,600
you're off on your own,

100
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,553
good luck fucker,

101
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,670
stop college.

102
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,030
Um,

103
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,230
I,

104
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,850
I saw quite a few of your videos online.

105
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,380
It really a really,

106
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,150
really interesting conversations.

107
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,300
And one of them that really struck me was,

108
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:52,990
um,

109
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,630
you will live with several
of them that struck me,

110
00:02:55,631 --> 00:03:00,631
but one of them was your
story of being mugged and you,

111
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
you told people on an online room like
where you got mugged and people were

112
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:09,280
upset that you in telling
them that you got,

113
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,050
didn't telling the world
that you got mugged there,

114
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,610
it was lowering their property value.

115
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,951
Yeah.

116
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:14,230
That was,

117
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,230
it was a bad one.

118
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,160
Um,

119
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,270
that's so crazy.

120
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,020
Yeah.

121
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,400
I mean it was one thing to get mugged.

122
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,900
It was just Kinda freaky in itself.

123
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,830
Uh,

124
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,131
you know,

125
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:23,641
and whatever,

126
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:23,941
you know,

127
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,530
shaming weirdness goes with that.

128
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,831
But,

129
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,664
um,

130
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,370
I guess what I was trying to do,

131
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,710
I mean deep down was probably elicit,

132
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,633
you know,

133
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,790
love and affection from people on my list,

134
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,361
you know,

135
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,080
so I put up,

136
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,321
Oh,

137
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:37,591
you know,

138
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:38,790
and there was a social,

139
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,770
something social responsibility to it.

140
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:43,680
So I put up where I got mugged cause
everyone should know this is maybe a

141
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,300
dangerous stretch here.

142
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,440
We got to maybe get a light.

143
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,723
But um,

144
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,120
yeah,

145
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,660
so I sent,

146
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,860
I sent it out and then,

147
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,280
um,

148
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,280
the first two emails I got back from
this like loving list of parents was how

149
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,080
dare you see exactly where it happened.

150
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:58,261
You know,

151
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,700
we live right across the street,

152
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,331
you know,

153
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:03,570
you're going to lower our property
values and like are you selling now?

154
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:03,901
Is that,

155
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,220
is that now we're not selling.

156
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:09,060
But it was a really weird time when people
needed their property values to go up

157
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:12,420
because they were trying to get bigger
mortgages and pay down and do all that.

158
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,740
Um,

159
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,320
and it was just like so
panicky there about that,

160
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,370
that some,

161
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,670
you know,

162
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,830
someone was afraid of,

163
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,390
what if a newspaper
covers it and it's bad.

164
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,224
And what if I,

165
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,320
it's so weird when one's
and zero's Trump humanity,

166
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,671
you know.

167
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:29,810
And in that case,

168
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,980
that's exactly what that is.

169
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:32,450
It's ones and Zeros.

170
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,901
Trump,

171
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:33,734
humanity.

172
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,591
Well yeah,

173
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:35,880
in two kinds of ones and Zeros,

174
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:36,570
you know the,

175
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,291
the ones and zeroes,

176
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:37,980
that money.

177
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,280
Yeah,

178
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,550
no.

179
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,470
And the ones and Zeros,

180
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,400
it's sort of of digital technology,

181
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:45,840
which I think can create
a kind of a distance

182
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,831
feeling.

183
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,270
The impact of saying that to
someone's face that you're,

184
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,130
yeah,

185
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,950
there's a weird communication
that takes place online.

186
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,380
That's you.

187
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,310
It doesn't have any consequence.

188
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,641
You know,

189
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,061
you can,

190
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,740
you can do it anonymously
and this is this,

191
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,610
it's like these barbs that you can
just send out and illogically like in,

192
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:04,841
in,

193
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,220
in ways that you would never,

194
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,100
if you had to deal with someone one on
one because you would feel it and you

195
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:09,700
would look at them,

196
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,840
you would feel their response.

197
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,291
You would be like,

198
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,130
why are you saying this?

199
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,640
Like,

200
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,091
like why?

201
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,230
Why are you being such an asshole?

202
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,240
But because you are anonymous,

203
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:16,720
you can just,

204
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,080
so people are just like in this
unnatural communication thing.

205
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,520
Right?

206
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,080
But then the,

207
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,330
the,

208
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:21,931
the part that,

209
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:25,650
that worries me after that is if you
get used to doing it like that in an

210
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,030
anonymous way online,

211
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,450
does that start to make the behavior a
bit more normative when you're even with

212
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,744
your identity?

213
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,681
Oh,

214
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,340
I guarantee it has to.

215
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,470
It has to.

216
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:38,751
There's,

217
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,840
there's no free rides
when it comes to that.

218
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,730
I really feel like your thoughts,

219
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:43,540
you're kind of like,

220
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,800
there was always a thing.

221
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,780
I remember when I was in high school,

222
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,890
this was someone in my school newspaper
wrote like a funny critique about the

223
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,724
boy scouts.

224
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,300
And one of the things that he didn't
like about the boy scouts was that they

225
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,070
wanted you to keep your thoughts pure.

226
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,011
And he was like,

227
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,311
you know,

228
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:58,521
well,

229
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,020
my thoughts are my own thoughts.

230
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,351
You know,

231
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:00,980
I'm just,

232
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,630
as long as I don't do anything,

233
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,850
I don't think there's anything
wrong with my thoughts.

234
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,610
All right.

235
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,700
Know if that was really smartly argued.

236
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,990
I remember reading that going,

237
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,121
wow,

238
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,220
this kid's pretty clever.

239
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,271
But then I thought about it.

240
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:11,481
I'm like,

241
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:11,780
but you,

242
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,730
if you're thinking about creepy shit,

243
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,590
you probably are kind of creepy.

244
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,341
You know,

245
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,651
and it's,

246
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:17,900
it's not going to get any better.

247
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,320
Just,

248
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,621
you know,

249
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,620
you're just going to eventually one day
going to snap and then you got to do

250
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:21,980
something.

251
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,581
He'd be thing.

252
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:22,881
Yeah.

253
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,640
If you really are like the,

254
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,161
I don't know.

255
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,550
I mean everyone has their own
definition of thoughts being pure,

256
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,091
you know,

257
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,091
like a more lenient person might allow
a lot of like healthy sexual things and

258
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,070
the idea of thoughts being pure
as long as it's not creepy,

259
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,320
but there's other people that
would just sit around and say,

260
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:39,561
well,

261
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,650
let me just think about creepy shit
all day and not do it and I'm fine,

262
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,053
but they're not,

263
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,220
there's no free ride.

264
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,280
There may be though,

265
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,223
you think.

266
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,521
Well,

267
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:48,140
I mean,

268
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,220
what you're describing,

269
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,540
what you're describing is,

270
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:50,781
you know,

271
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,140
the benefits of an absolute police
state as long as it was always right.

272
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,420
Yeah.

273
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,253
That's no problem.

274
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,500
That's the problem.

275
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,220
I mean,

276
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,260
you can always get your minority report,

277
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,591
you know,

278
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:01,600
just in case maybe they're wrong.

279
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
I really subscribing to that.

280
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm just saying that
you really can be nice.

281
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,040
You can't have really shitty
thoughts and get through.

282
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,990
And I think that if you're
really shitty online,

283
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:09,824
you have those thoughts.

284
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,150
Even if it's only online,

285
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,540
I really believe that negative
energy is going to leak.

286
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,661
Genuinely shitty.

287
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:14,871
I mean,

288
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,000
it's just how do you decide what's,

289
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,460
what's,

290
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,510
what's shitty and whatnot.

291
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,344
But yeah,

292
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,370
no,

293
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,530
it's people when their demeanor,

294
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,750
you are online without your face.

295
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,620
The meaning you can be online with your
face on the meaner you can get in real

296
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,020
life,

297
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,280
you know,

298
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,500
until you just got mean people.

299
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,043
Okay.

300
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,451
You ready to,

301
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,190
of course recording.

302
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:01,491
Oh,

303
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:02,324
it is already.

304
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,410
What the fuck's on?
