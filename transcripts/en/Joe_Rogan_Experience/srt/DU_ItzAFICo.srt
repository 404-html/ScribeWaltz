1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,780
He gives zero fucks.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,900
Your Ratha drove,

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,901
rode to the Experia and Canada's rough
if you get up drunk driving in America,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,650
good luck in Canada.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,160
Oh really?

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,850
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,031
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,660
A lot of um,

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,270
a lot of fighters have issues
getting into Canada for fights.

10
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,590
A lot of comedians have issues.

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,100
A lot of comedians have had issues
getting into the Montreal comedy festival,

12
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:23,040
which is one of the big events for standup
comedians because of drunk driving.

13
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,460
Yes.

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,690
Cause a drunk driving conviction.

15
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,940
Any domestic violence
or anything like that?

16
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:27,210
Yeah,

17
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,650
Eddie Bravo had um,

18
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,160
an arrest for having a gun on him legally.

19
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,731
Okay.

20
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,720
He was a working for a check cashing
place and he used to have to carry large

21
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,600
sums of cash in his car
to another location.

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,590
And so he would leave with the check
cashing company and he had a registered

23
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,630
concealed carry permit for a gun.

24
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,860
And so,

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,130
uh,

26
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,430
he got pulled over for something
and he had to tell the,

27
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:50,581
uh,

28
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,520
the cop officer I worked
for check cashing company,

29
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:56,490
I have a legal registered
handgun in my car right now.

30
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,533
It's loaded.

31
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,620
And then they go,

32
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,100
okay,

33
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,731
hold on a second,

34
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,410
we're going to put you in handcuffs
and we're going to run this.

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,460
So they run it.

36
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,791
They go,

37
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,150
okay,

38
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,720
checks out.

39
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,410
They let him go because he was not even
supposed to be on his record because it

40
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:08,244
was all legal.

41
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,210
It doesn't matter.

42
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,680
Every time he goes to Canada,

43
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,760
they sit him down.

44
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,680
Tell us about this.

45
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,300
You have a gone on side.

46
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:15,990
You what?

47
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,030
I now take a gun.

48
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,650
You should to go for the border.

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,011
No,

50
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:20,191
no,

51
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:20,371
no,

52
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,491
no,

53
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:20,641
no,

54
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:20,761
no,

55
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:20,910
no,

56
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,031
no,

57
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,420
no.

58
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,811
I was,

59
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,250
I was working for a company.

60
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,750
I was allowed to have
this kind of like it cut.

61
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,350
He's got an extra hour every
time he goes into Canada,

62
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,370
it happened quickly.

63
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,930
And immigration going into Canada.

64
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,670
What'd you get?

65
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,550
What it was your issue?

66
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,801
Well,

67
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,130
they asked me if I'd ever been
convicted of a crime and I said no,

68
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,990
and I go sit down and then they
call me over and they said,

69
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,320
uh,

70
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,711
the guys,

71
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,230
like you said you'd never
been convicted of a crime,

72
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:44,591
correct?

73
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:44,861
I said,

74
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:45,490
yeah.

75
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,090
He said,

76
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,090
is there anything you'd like to say
about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983 and I was

77
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,624
like,

78
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,391
uh,

79
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:53,801
yeah,

80
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,720
I got busted in Fairbank's,

81
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,200
you know,

82
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,560
a for eating a snickers
bar and the fucking grocery
store and not paying for it.

83
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,580
And,

84
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,020
but I did two or three days.

85
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,220
It was Memorial Day weekend.

86
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:03,910
I did three,

87
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,410
four nights in the prison.

88
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,270
And then the guy said 20
hours of community service
and this will disappear from

89
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,610
your record and get if you
don't get arrested in a year.

90
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,620
So I always say no,

91
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:15,281
cause that's,

92
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:15,430
yeah,

93
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
it wasn't convicted of anything.

94
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,200
And they said it would
be taken from my record.

95
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:20,741
And the guy's like,

96
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,310
nope.

97
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,500
The fact that you were not Alaskan,

98
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,040
so you're from out of state meant they
couldn't strike it from your record.

99
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,110
So,

100
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,650
and it's on your FBI record,

101
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,120
which is what we get in Canada.

102
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,710
So he was knicker thief.

103
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,041
Yeah,

104
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:33,910
I'm a sneaker thief.

105
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:34,750
So he's a cool guy.

106
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:39,730
I did four days in a fee in a federal
medium security prison with no underwear

107
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
for a snickers,

108
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,630
for snickers.

109
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,500
What do you mean with no underwear?

110
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,000
Were you wearing anything or just naked?

111
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,010
I was a wearing short.

112
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
Why did you have pants at the groceries?

113
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,650
Because it makes it

114
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
more harrowing.

115
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,623
Come on man.

116
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,200
I was,

117
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,790
I was 19 years old.

118
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,430
Not yet will you liked very twink ish.

119
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,420
I was twinkie.

120
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,253
I was very,

121
00:02:59,590 --> 00:02:59,821
yeah.

122
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,690
So you were worried it
was all going to go down.

123
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,610
It would have been
worried if I were wearing,

124
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,640
you know what a anything survival suit.

125
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,703
But yeah,

126
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,080
it's that even isn't that under the
amount of money that they could even bust

127
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:11,560
you for something?

128
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,540
Maybe not in the 80s Reagan was president.

129
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,280
They were trying to
fucking be tough on crime.

130
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
Just say no.

131
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,781
Yeah.

132
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,680
And also I had a,

133
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,620
I mean what happened was we got in from
this 10 day hitch with these two guys I

134
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:26,950
had met on the ferry coming up the
inside passage and we had this long hitch

135
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,450
through the Yukon territory,

136
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,550
all this crazy shit.

137
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,384
And,

138
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,660
and we get to Fairbank's.

139
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,410
So the first place we go is the
laundromat because we stank,

140
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,040
right?

141
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,370
We didn't have that special
soap that your defense defense.

142
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,750
So and a,

143
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,800
so we went to the laundromat,

144
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,110
we put everything possible in the washer.

145
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,690
So all three of us were wearing
shorts with no underwear,

146
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,940
boots with no socks and
a jacket with no shirt.

147
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,920
And then one of the guys was like,

148
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,161
oh,

149
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,340
he wanted to go to the grocery
store because there was a payphone.

150
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,470
And he was going to call his girlfriend
to let her know that he'd arrived on

151
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,304
time.

152
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:57,821
And I was like,

153
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,061
fuck it.

154
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:58,900
I'll go over with you.

155
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,870
And the other guy's going to stay with
the bags or backpacks and all that shit.

156
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,590
And you know,

157
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,520
watch the clothes.

158
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,900
So I went with him.

159
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,430
Somebody who's on the phone,

160
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,960
we start pushing a cart around.

161
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,471
We were like,

162
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:08,681
you know,

163
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,940
Soviet immigrants,

164
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:10,121
like,

165
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,331
oh,

166
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,440
so many kinds of,

167
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:11,711
you know,

168
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,544
food here,

169
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,030
because we'd been living in the woods
eating nuts and chocolate in LSD for the

170
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,864
last 10 days.

171
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,750
And so he,

172
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,430
he opened a thing of Keifer.

173
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,950
First time I'd ever heard of Keifer,

174
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
which is like liquid yogurt and
drank that great for your body.

175
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,243
Acidophilus.

176
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,480
And I,

177
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,050
uh,

178
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,530
I,

179
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,281
for some reason,

180
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,210
eight a snickers bar,

181
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,390
even though I'd been eating chocolate
and not much imagination there.

182
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,980
And then we,

183
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,000
he used the phone,

184
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,530
we ditch the cart and we laughed.

185
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,800
And so there's some security guy
had seen us and turned into a thing.

186
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,070
This cop showed up and I had a knife
in my boot and some grass in my pocket,

187
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,560
both of which were legal
at the time in Alaska,

188
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,810
but it was enough to make
this cop not like me at all.

189
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,250
And he was like this,

190
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:57,851
you know,

191
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:02,851
he'd Napoleonic cop kind of situation
and he didn't like smart ass college kids

192
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,820
from outside coming into Alaska in the
summer and know snickers bar walking

193
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:07,390
around.

194
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,631
Yeah.

195
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,620
Fucking around with Kiefer.

196
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,700
So he took us,

197
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,400
he handcuffed us and took us to prison.

198
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,870
Fairbank's correctional center.

199
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,580
Did you not have the money
for the snickers bar?

200
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,821
Yeah,

201
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:16,660
we have plenty of money.

202
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,680
He just didn't want to pay for it,

203
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,221
but it was like,

204
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:18,461
well,

205
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,780
you tell it to the magistrate.

206
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,681
Oh,

207
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,450
you mean for that now that was just like,

208
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,510
I don't know what the fuck you're just
young and we're just telling Tom and you

209
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:25,751
know,

210
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,430
and maybe there was a line or something,

211
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,070
I don't remember,

212
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,070
but we pretended we were shopping so we
put like dog food and Shit in the cart,

213
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,940
you know,

214
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,600
and we had our stuff and put the package
like we were going to pay for it when

215
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,434
we checked out.

216
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,230
So I don't know what we
were just being dumb,

217
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,060
but uh,

218
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,331
yeah,

219
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:48,331
so we ended up being taken to
this prison and I had a pipe to,

220
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,581
yeah,

221
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,960
cause I remember when we were,

222
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,100
did the intake,

223
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,300
the guy that like the prison
dude who booked us and you know,

224
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,450
did the whole intake thing,

225
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,800
I was joking with him,

226
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,161
I was like,

227
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,341
yeah,

228
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,290
I'm not going to get
that pipe and grasp back.

229
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,771
Am I?

230
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,311
And he was like,

231
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,420
I don't think so man.

232
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:02,661
I was like,

233
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,080
well,

234
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,471
you know,

235
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,740
it wouldn't bother me if it just
disappeared and was never even registered

236
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,480
because grass is hard to
come by in Alaska was then.

237
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,310
And so we sort of had a little
understanding and like I'm cool,

238
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:13,671
you're cool.

239
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,504
Cause he was like,

240
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,250
what the fuck you have sneakers bar,

241
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,084
why would this guy,

242
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,440
what's wrong with that cop?

243
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,780
Did you like hit him or something?

244
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:20,031
And I'm like,

245
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:20,331
no,

246
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:20,481
it,

247
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:20,751
you know,

248
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,460
he just had a hair up his ass.

249
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,940
Right?

250
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,440
So this guy was cool.

251
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,390
He saved us because
what he did is he said,

252
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:26,810
look,

253
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm not going to put you guys
in with the general population.

254
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,880
You're going to sleep in the gym at night.

255
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,230
You've got some cots,

256
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,610
you sleep in the gym,

257
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,350
you never let the other one out of
your sight the whole time you're here,

258
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,760
you go to the bathroom together,

259
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,140
you go to the showers together,

260
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,170
you watch each other's back and
you'll get through it all right.

261
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,990
And we did and he was wild.

262
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,730
And this was like 83,

263
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,564
I guess.

264
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,710
And um,

265
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,130
so the,

266
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,780
there's a lot of money in Alaska,

267
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,141
right?

268
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,100
From all the oil.

269
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,110
So the prison was plush.

270
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,570
It was like every meal
was all you can eat,

271
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,160
really solid bar,

272
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,300
whole wheat rolls,

273
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,230
white roles.

274
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,460
Wednesday was prime rib day where the
cops could pay a buck to eat with the

275
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,294
prisoners.

276
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,680
But the catch was you only
had 20 minutes each meal.

277
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,730
So I remember like one day we're sitting
there at this table and I wouldn't like

278
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,520
19 maybe 20 maybe 20 something like that.

279
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,890
We're sitting at this table and the guy
across the table looked like Charles

280
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,011
Bronson.

281
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,620
You remember him,

282
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,350
the stash and the tats and all that,

283
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,850
and we're just like,

284
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,610
this dude was shoveling it in and
he looks up at one point he says,

285
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,070
this is the best fucking
prison I've ever been in.

286
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,740
Yikes.

287
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,170
And you know,

288
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,820
laundry lists of prisons that don't,

289
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,190
don't meet that criteria to standard.

290
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,371
Yeah,

291
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:43,640
he,

292
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,090
he,

293
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,050
his story was,

294
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
he founded dude with his wife and he
beat him with a lead pipe and he didn't

295
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:52,190
know if he was dead,

296
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,170
but as soon as it happened,

297
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:54,981
he got in his car,

298
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,380
he was from like New Mexico or Arizona.

299
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,550
He got in his car and drove to Alaska
because he knew he'd get picked up and he

300
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,280
wanted to get picked up in Alaska
because he'd heard the prisons were much

301
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:04,590
better.

302
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,810
That's hilarious.

303
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,730
So he might've beat a
guy to death and said,

304
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,070
the way to deal with this is to
go to a place that I was awesome.

305
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:14,420
Prisons and that place just happens
to be on the exact opposite.

306
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:22,610
Yeah.
