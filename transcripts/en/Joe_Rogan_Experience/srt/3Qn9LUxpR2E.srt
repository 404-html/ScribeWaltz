00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello Freak bitches.
The more view,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:04,674
the better.
It's just going to make people want to 

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,810
see.
But it was funny.

4
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:09,960
Fucking shit.
It was funny.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,040
It's crazy.
We were having.

6
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,430
You were doing that.
Sorry I was filming at the store.

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,340
You were doing that fucking years and 
years and years and years ago.

8
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,690
You do little sketches.
No.

9
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,524
Well I want to take all that stuff now 
and just cut it up and do like little 

10
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,000
three minute things and put it on funny 
or die stuff because everybody was.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,900
You were in it.
Everybody has it.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,010
Everybody played a part.
But you do what?

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,700
The foreign comic Bronie we'd call them 
the foreign comic,

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,810
you know,
and it was just these crazy EPA.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,710
I remember you coming over to me one 
night and you guys.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,553
Can I ask you something?
Because I was using the comedy store 

17
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,204
like a set I'd be filming.
I changed all the lighting in the 

18
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,800
kitchen.
I put the red lights,

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,013
blue lights fulfilling.
I was doing it for a year and the cut 

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,080
and waitresses would come in to get like
drink orders and I go,

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
I can have you in right now.
We're filming.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,530
You can't be.
You're in my shot and everybody's asking

23
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,490
like managers,
like,

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,640
what show is this?
There was no show,

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,790
but everybody was in it.
Steve Reynolds was in it.

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,610
My black was my book.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,100
I've become friends with my fucking 
black,

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,120
so for whatever we use,
I come over to this guy,

29
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,910
he's sitting in the booth in the kitchen
and I go,

30
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,890
Hey Mike,
you want you want to be in the show?

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,130
And he's going,
what you?

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,620
I go,
it's,

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,430
it's,
it's a reality show.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
And reality wasn't really happening yet.
It just wasn't happening.

35
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,170
So people like,
well,

36
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,110
what is I go,
you just do what I tell you to dope.

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,660
Just say what I tell you to say and do 
whatever I said.

38
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,530
So whenever he goes,
yeah,

39
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:50,670
I want to be in it,
you know,

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,481
I go,
okay,

41
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,880
we're going to go to the top of the 
belly,

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,260
the belly room,
the steps,

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,600
and I'm going to throw you down the 
steps.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,913
Okay?
And I got to get a couple of angles so 

45
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,310
we'll have to do it two or three times.

46
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,380
And he goes,
wait a minute.

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,243
He goes,
what do you mean you're going to throw 

48
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,080
me down the steps?
I go,

49
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,040
yeah,
from the top.

50
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,790
So you just go with it,
you know,

51
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,390
just fall down the steps.
And he goes,

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,150
I don't want you to do that to me.
Like A,

53
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,830
why not?
What's the big deal?

54
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,540
It's what you do.
He goes,

55
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,710
what do you mean?
It's what I do.

56
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,870
I go,
aren't you a stunt man?

57
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,540
And he goes,
where did you hear that echo?

58
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,870
The comics told me that that's what you 
do besides comedy,

59
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,130
you're a stunt.
He goes,

60
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm not a stunt man.
I don't want to be thrown down.

61
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,760
I want to be in it,
but I can't have you just taught me down

62
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,190
a full flight of steps like that.
I'm going to get hurt,

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,960
so we had to do with the pieces which I 
like a fake fall.

64
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,561
Well,
no,

65
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,394
he would go like halfway and then I go 
to the bottom of the steps to get the 

66
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,664
rest of the fall and then I tried to 
kill him with a chair and Ari Shaffir 

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,320
jumps on me at the right moment to stop 
me from killing this guy.

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,540
It was so I could do launch just so I 
could a line from a bronx tale where I'm

69
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,140
on top of them now and I go,
I did this to you.

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,380
And he goes,
what will that mean?

71
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,850
I go,
don't worry about it.

72
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,240
When it's edited,
you'll see the whole series.

73
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,320
The image.
Yeah.

74
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,700
I got a job doing what I tell you to go 
over to comics and go right,

75
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,563
look that way and enforced second.
Say That guy's gonna have a fucking 

76
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,640
problem.
And he goes,

77
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,660
but there's nobody today.
I go,

78
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:27,090
don't worry about that part.

79
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,993
They'll be somebody on the other end and
another time and that's how I would 

80
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,130
piece though.
So I want to take these tapes.

81
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,840
Just have some,
some editor do like three minute because

82
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,120
it was,
I did it for for two years.

83
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,840
They come to my house for a barbecue.
It wound up fighting.

84
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,093
Eleanor gets into a fistfight with Steve
[inaudible] wife where he screamed and 

85
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,114
knocked the shit out of a.
she's got her up against the garage 

86
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,150
because she said eleanor like,
you know,

87
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,320
is,
is like the house is filthy,

88
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,750
you know,
in Illinois,

89
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,290
screaming at me in the kitchen,
go.

90
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,800
And she said that when I'm so fucking 
nice to have,

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,030
I'll handle this right now in Illinois.
It comes out of the back yard now.

92
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,080
The comic sitting there don't notice is 
going to.

93
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,170
And she goes,
hey bitch,

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,170
this is to Steve's wife.
Right?

95
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,080
And she chases a slams are against the 
garage that's beaten.

96
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,913
The shit out of Illinois was a progress 
is Mike Black and Dave Taylor and Steve 

97
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,160
Simone and my own kids screaming Kela 
just fucking kill hogs.

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,510
And the end of that episode is Dave 
Taylor,

99
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,030
you know,
at night sitting around going,

100
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:37,720
do you understand?
Do you know why Ellen did that?

101
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:42,721
Because girls like tracy,
but taking guys like you from eleanor,

102
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,840
her life and everybody's good.
And Steve,

103
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,621
someones going.
Yeah.

104
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,370
The way eleanor was hitting a like you 
could just feel it,

105
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,780
you know,
like raging bull.

106
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,820
Like she really wanted to damage.
Yeah,

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,673
it's hysterical.
That's why I wouldn't have barbecues 

108
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,883
just to film.
It was nonstop and he comes over to me 

109
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,164
at the store.
Like,

110
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,260
what are you doing exactly?
To show my show what show?

111
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,430
Where is it?
Where can I see it?

112
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,140
I don't know.
There'll be around.

113
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,180
Are you still have the footage?
All of it.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,200
Hundreds of tapes.
How did he exhibit towers?
