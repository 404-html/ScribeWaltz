1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,170
The joe rogan experience.
There's a paper article I just saw from

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,140
somebody posted it I think on twitter
and it was,

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,160
it was they ass.
They pulled a guy as an old newspaper

4
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:16,911
article.
They fold guys,

5
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:21,911
whether it's okay to spank a woman and
the answers.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,600
They pulled like five or six guys.
There's the old article and they were

7
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,430
all like,
absolutely like she needs it.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,530
If she's out of line and she doesn't
know she's doing just trying to help

9
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,190
her.
I thought that was hilarious.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,460
Yeah.
If a woman needs it,

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,240
should she be spanked?
The best part about it was rich read it.

12
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:40,910
Let's read it

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,020
so fucking funny.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,550
Why not?
Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,520
If they don't know how to behave,
by the time they're adults,

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,040
they should be treated like children and
spanked.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,650
That ought to make them grow up in a
hurry.

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,190
If it doesn't at first,
they'll soon get the idea.

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,220
This is incredible.
I get the idea.

20
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,530
I yes,
when they deserve it.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,110
As a barber,
I've got a lot of faith in the

22
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:07,600
hairbrush.
Oh my God.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,590
I think there are certain cases when it
is advisable,

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,130
when it is.
There's no reason why you shouldn't go

25
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,040
right ahead and do it.
I can't knock the idea.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,160
In my business,
a man sets a lot of the of store sets a

27
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:27,220
lot of store by the results he can get
with a hairbrush,

28
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,590
properly applied.
Nice little smack.

29
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:33,210
Now here's the counterpoint though.
Sets a lot of store maybe within the

30
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,570
business term.
Back then,

31
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,160
man sets a lot of store.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,660
Are you ready for the counterpoint?
Yes.

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,830
If there is none,
everybody

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,850
is.
The best part is everybody takes the

35
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,280
point of view.
This guy parking lot attendant from

36
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,110
Brooklyn,
you Teddy Galella.

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,700
You bet it teaches them who's boss.
A lot of women tend to forget.

38
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:56,500
This is a man's world at a lot of men
who stepped down as boss of a family,

39
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:01,000
wished they hadn't spanking might help
get back some of the respect they lost.

40
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,190
Look at Teddy.
Look at that as Joey Diaz,

41
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,620
his cousin with a black oxide.
Listen,

42
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,100
cocksucker spank them if they want it.
William Davis,

43
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,050
what does,
William says the toy factory owner.

44
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,510
Yes.
Most of them have it coming to them

45
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,210
anyway.
If they don't,

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,790
it will remind them of how well off they
are.

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,680
I subscribe to the theory that an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

48
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,540
Holy Shit.
Look at him.

49
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,760
Look at evil.
Look and fuck.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,850
It looks like Rutger hauer brother.
Wow.

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,500
Does he look like Rutger Hauer and
Robert De Niro fucked.

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,960
He looks evil,
man.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,820
Holtzman.
Oh yeah.

54
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,820
It does.
A little like holtzman.

55
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,810
Imagine that guy spanking your wife.
Let's hear what the other people said.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,630
It's not that last one.
That's awful.

57
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,720
I hate your garbage.
There's no radio.

58
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,240
There's no clock.
There's no electric light.

59
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,040
The girls carry water.
They don't wear makeup.

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,810
They have their babies by,

61
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,470
they go in shack and squat down and have
their babies.

62
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,200
I live on the ground.
I live on the earth.

63
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,490
I don't live.
I lived in Hollywood and I had all that.

64
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,990
The Rolls Royce and the Ferrari and the
pad and Beverly Hills.

65
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,220
I had the surf board and beach boys and
the beach keeps in the meal.

66
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,860
Diamond in in Roscommon,
the Jimmy Choo and Finn and Elvis

67
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,140
Presley's Mexican bachelor's and all
them guys,

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,840
the dean of Martin's.
And then Nancy should not vision a and a

69
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,100
Gasser Shafran will you do it to me?
I hear you did good honey and all that

70
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,780
kind of where you come up to my house
later.

71
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,940
So I went through all that and I seen
that was a bigger prison and the one I

72
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,960
just got out of and I really didn't care
to go back to prison to prison doesn't

73
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,470
begin and end at the gate.
Prisoners in mind,

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,370
it's locked in one world that's dead and
dying or it's opening to a world that's

75
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:52,300
free and alive.

76
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,630
Hold on.
This guy sounds like me

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,780
do should have a podcast.
This guy's great.

78
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,170
This one part of the documentary,
they talk about how they delivered

79
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:08,960
babies at the ranch and they talked
about one part where they got it like a

80
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,820
pair of scissors and just fucking get
it.

81
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,920
Homestyle oh Geez.
Yeah.

82
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,420
How we have babies like that and what a
sick fuck.

83
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:23,421
But it's a long time ago when I did the
tonight show at one of the,

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,670
one of the sets on there,
and I had a joke with a setup,

85
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:28,740
was kids are like homeless people.
And they go,

86
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,903
could you,
uh,

87
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,200
could you not say homeless people?
I go,

88
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,380
the jokes not about homeless people
listen to the joke.

89
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,800
It's about kids.
And,

90
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,634
and they go,
ah,

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,900
maybe just say a Hobo.
I go,

92
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:40,441
well,
here,

93
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,750
it's a problem.
I'm not a comic from the 1800

94
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:42,830
[inaudible].

95
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,830
It's a fucking Hobo.
Volvo.

96
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,070
Then they came back home was a great
word.

97
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,130
I love Hobo.
It just didn't fit.

98
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,280
And then they came back with why no,
I go,

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,870
so it's okay to make fun alcoholics,
but homeless people,

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,130
they are homeless that I'm not judging,
right.

101
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,080
It's what they are.
I just a fine,

102
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,670
what's the context?
How does the rest of the big goal,

103
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,520
uh,
is to,

104
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,490
don't judge.
It was a long,

105
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:09,200
long time ago.
I don't,

106
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
kids are like,
ah,

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,060
I don't have kids.
My sister's got kids.

108
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,180
If they're not yours,
you realize what kids really are.

109
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,740
They're tiny homeless people.
There's chase you around the house,

110
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:17,461
all the land going,
hey,

111
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:19,260
can I have a dollar?
Hey food,

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,390
I'm missing a shoe and I need a ride.
Hey,

113
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,320
I have a ride.
Okay.

114
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,940
It's silly.
It's stupid.

115
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:26,670
And that's where they,
they just lost their mind over the word

116
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,320
homeless.
Well then,

117
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,190
because I then I said,
uh,

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,310
I always give homeless people money and
maybe you shouldn't.

119
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,300
My brother goes,
don't,

120
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,950
he's just gonna go buy more alcohol and
cigarettes.

121
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:35,491
And I go,
oh,

122
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,470
like I wasn't,
so I'm bringing,

123
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,110
it's still back to me.
I'm so making fun of me.

124
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,460
Right.
I go,

125
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,680
so what am I supposed to say?
Don't give that wine.

126
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,514
Owe money.

127
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,720
Yeah.
A Hobo.

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,670
I'm sorry,
I don't have any material about riding

129
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:51,740
the rails.
Kathleen.

130
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,170
We've done some poles and people are
very uncomfortable with the word

131
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:55,681
homeless.
Yeah,

132
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:56,870
I guess so.
Yeah.

133
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,100
It's not funny.
Okay.

134
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,140
They are victims involved here in sound
funny,

135
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,080
but fuck,
why knows societal problem that we're

136
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,570
trying to work through and we don't
know.

137
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,070
It's like,
yes,

138
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,410
it's not two people from off.
This was the guy I was talking about

139
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,183
outreach.

140
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,630
And you'll never hit that.
So all of a sudden.
