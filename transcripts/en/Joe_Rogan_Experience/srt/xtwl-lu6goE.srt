1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,020
Makina immedion.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,253
Are we live?

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,480
Sure,

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,313
yeah.

5
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,630
Do ustream dot TV forward slash

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,570
big Jay Z.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,403
Jay z here.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,170
Bam.

9
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,450
And I'm tweeting and we're like,

10
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,620
what the fuck?

11
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,460
Big Jay.

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,601
Welcome back,

13
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,230
sir.

14
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,820
I heard you were punching
white people in Baltimore.

15
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,270
Is that true?

16
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,210
He just ran around just
punching white people.

17
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,170
Well you got to get all of
the fans you can get right?

18
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,290
If you want to be down one way right now.

19
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,860
Be Super upset with white people.

20
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,030
I had a,

21
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,270
I had an argument with
a comic about Baltimore.

22
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,104
Uh,

23
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,161
this week.

24
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,671
I was like,

25
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,200
he was very pro,

26
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,034
like the

27
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,880
okay.

28
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,290
The violent protest of it.

29
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,490
White Dude white like hipster
white comic I would say.

30
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,580
And His.

31
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,360
I was so surprised because
I always thought they were
supposed to be the tender

32
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:53,361
guys and his comment like I couldn't
believe the coldness and him saying he was

33
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,470
like so big fucking deal that,

34
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:55,700
you know,

35
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,830
they tear apart a,

36
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,531
a cvs.

37
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:58,741
He goes,

38
00:00:58,741 --> 00:00:59,251
who gives a shit?

39
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,371
Man,

40
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,460
there's people getting killed in the
street now the cops are killing people in

41
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:02,881
the streets.

42
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,670
And it's like,

43
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,261
who cares?

44
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,610
Like the fucking owner of the CVA.

45
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,021
Like why?

46
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,380
What does he have to eat shit for it.

47
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,700
It's totally unrelated.

48
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,790
They did it in Ferguson to businesses
that were owned by black people.

49
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,330
I mean there was,

50
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,720
there were some instances
of people burning down
businesses that had absolutely

51
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,170
nothing to do with any of the pro police,

52
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,950
you know,

53
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,783
group.

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,400
There were people that just lived in
the community and then all of a sudden

55
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,320
everything got smashed in Oakland.

56
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,190
When when some guy,

57
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,390
the guy got shot in Oakland,

58
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,583
there was a,

59
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,370
they smashed up bank and someone
wrote fuck capitalism on it.

60
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,091
Like,

61
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:33,541
okay.

62
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,440
I really like.

63
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,640
Is that what this is about?

64
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,030
The fucking cop killing
the guy is about Canberra.

65
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,090
Is it the other one that the accident or
the quote unquote accident at the train

66
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:42,660
station?

67
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,961
Yeah,

68
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,794
that was fucked.

69
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,360
Did you see the movie they made of it?

70
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,140
No.

71
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,010
They made a movie of it.

72
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:50,390
I like when they do this with a lot
of Hollywood stuff that it's sort of

73
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,881
hilarious.

74
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,500
Phoned in thing was if you remember,

75
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,210
if you remember the biggie smalls movies,

76
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,430
you ever see that one ever saw it.

77
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,450
What was it?

78
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,831
Did you say?

79
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,310
If I.

80
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,740
no,

81
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,760
it's called notorious.

82
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,570
Played Bass actually was pretty good.

83
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,820
That previewed look
like he did a good job.

84
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,450
Jamie.

85
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,790
Pull up a fucking Prius

86
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,751
I guess,

87
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,780
but what was funny was the
night he died in the movie,

88
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,570
like he made phone calls
to everyone and he's like,

89
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,341
I'm going to be good too.

90
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,520
You told his mom that money gets.

91
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,530
They didn't always like things that
are not true in that fruitvale station

92
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:22,801
movie,

93
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:23,970
which is about the Oakland guy.

94
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,430
Like they literally made that day like,

95
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,211
you know the guy,

96
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,640
he sold drugs for Kima
given drugs and he was like,

97
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,420
Nah,

98
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,180
I don't want to do this shit no
more better with my daughter.

99
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,510
And the thing is like,

100
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,550
you know,

101
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,060
the comedian named Chris Tinkle,

102
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,130
I pointed out because he knew the story.

103
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,660
He's from that area and
he said he was like,

104
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,190
it's already tragic.

105
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,024
Anyway,

106
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,760
this is a tragic situation
where a kid got killed.

107
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,541
Whatever was going on,

108
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,980
he probably deserves to get killed
by a cop accidentally or otherwise,

109
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,820
so it's just like,

110
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,080
why would you have to add like a.

111
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,340
and he was going to go back.

112
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,840
He was going to go to
University of Phoenix.

113
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,800
Online dues.

114
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,710
I can.

115
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,040
I can

116
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,701
spell it out.

117
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,540
Nice and simple.

118
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,160
It's exactly what it is.

119
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,270
There's a very high percentage,

120
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:09,160
a very high percentage of the movie
business that's filled with wonderful

121
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,420
creative people.

122
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,501
Fantastic.

123
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,910
Folks that just want to make good movies.

124
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,870
Like ex Machina.

125
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,940
I saw x walk into this big Holy Shit.

126
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,510
Is that good?

127
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,210
God Damn.

128
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,280
That's amazing.

129
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,001
Special effects.

130
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,110
Was it one of those movements?

131
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,750
The best movies I've ever seen in my life
and I don't want to say anything more

132
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,140
about it.

133
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,531
We'll talk.

134
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,520
We'll talk about a little bit but,

135
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:24,960
but,

136
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,150
but,

137
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
but points,

138
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,970
most of them are trying
to do shit like that,

139
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,660
but there are a few out there and those
ones will stand out and they will just,

140
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,340
they will just fucking,

141
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,500
just in every soup you gotta add their
little fucking spoon to all your ideas

142
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,400
and they fuck everything up man.

143
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,020
And especially it's grows especially
gross when they do a real live story.

144
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,740
A lot of times they'll do who are still
alive and they just butchered this toy.

145
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,180
Like that fucking wrestler movie.

146
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,343
What the fuck was that?

147
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,700
We've talked about it before.

148
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,750
What is it called?

149
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,210
Fox catcher fucks the one
about John Hunt or what?

150
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,270
Hunt?

151
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,580
John.

152
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,170
Mark Hunt.

153
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,370
No,

154
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,461
no,

155
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:04,690
no,

156
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,811
no.

157
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,590
Margaret has a fighter.

158
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,250
My contract.

159
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,520
What is the guy's name or
pharmaceutical company?

160
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,331
Yeah,

161
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,230
John Dupont.

162
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,681
Dupont.

163
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,490
Thank you.

164
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,180
John Dupont,

165
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,470
who was a crazy murderous cocaine
fiend who shot this wrestler.

166
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,351
Dave Schultz,

167
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,270
who's a famous wrestler,

168
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,890
but the movie's about his brother,

169
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:21,610
Mark Schultz,

170
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,540
who's still alive and you just
add a bunch of shit to it.

171
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,860
Make a bunch of shit up,

172
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,360
change the timeline around.

173
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,490
Change the success story of his life.

174
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,060
Also also throw some kind of like
a gay undertone for no reason.

175
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,390
Coke doing coke with a Gig for you
to get frosted tips and short shorts.

176
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,360
The whole thing was like,

177
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,470
what's going on here?

178
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,131
What are you doing,

179
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:42,660
man?

180
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:42,851
You know,

181
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,640
it's one of the methods because I'm
from Philly and that story happened in

182
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:48,940
Pennsylvania outside of
Philadelphia and it was Connecticut,

183
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,920
Fox catcher things in Philly
that was outside of Philly,

184
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,481
Pennsylvania.

185
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:52,991
Oh Wow.

186
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,561
Confused.

187
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,090
But I think it was John Du Pont.

188
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,440
It was like a multiple day stay.

189
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,880
Also.

190
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,460
One was interesting.

191
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,330
It was that it was a standoff
for days with the cops,

192
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,300
but they made it like he killed the guy
and then he walked out of his house and

193
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,570
they just arrested him like it was such
like a speed through all the things that

194
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:11,700
are real and interesting to add some
weird Hollywood like they have to force in

195
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,330
the fact that maybe he
was gay for this guy.

196
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,650
They had nothing to do with anything.

197
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,360
Just decided to make them gay.

198
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,420
Just to make this more fun.

199
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,850
You're going to get me
arrowhead and my helicopter

200
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,420
helicopter on each other's sweating.

201
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,640
Do they change shit that
they didn't have to change,

202
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,750
like historical shit,

203
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,150
like the fact that he was
already a world champion,

204
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,040
one of the best wrestlers on earth.

205
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,830
They made him out to be like a
guy was failing and falling apart.

206
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,620
They also had him fight in the UFC,

207
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,180
did fight once in the UFC,

208
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,520
but against a white guy in a real UFC.

209
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,830
Fought against a black guy
named big Gary Goodrich.

210
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,080
It's a historic match.

211
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,230
It's a historic,

212
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,040
like if you're a.

213
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,730
If you're a martial arts historian that
matches the historic match because he

214
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,990
was an Olympic gold medalist.

215
00:05:55,991 --> 00:06:00,050
He came and just took down one of the
best mma fighters at the time at will and

216
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,530
show the difference between
like worldclass wrestling
and this fucking bullshit

217
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,610
that these guys were doing in the gym.

218
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:04,821
They were.

219
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,340
They were infants in comparison
to his wrestling skill,

220
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,230
but they changed the timeline of it.

221
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,940
They had him watch the UFC and 87.

222
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,670
The UFC wasn't even made until 93,

223
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,230
so they just fucked with everything.

224
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,690
Just to gay it up and add a little of this

225
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
little fucking.

226
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,260
Yeah.

227
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,561
Yeah.

228
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,650
That was my idea is
basically the script man.

229
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,930
The story structure just didn't work.

230
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,100
There was something missing.

231
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,353
Gay stuff.

232
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,110
When they get.

233
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,280
When they get those actors,

234
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,280
they don't want to like it to just
be in independent film theaters,

235
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,930
so they gotta they got Hollywood,

236
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,430
some horse shit story into it all.

237
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,290
It's just so.

238
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,260
It's so depressing.

239
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,310
They do that to a movie.

240
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,550
That's a real story because
then you have in your head,

241
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,090
oh,

242
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,500
well we almost got gay with the guy.

243
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,520
He did coke,

244
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,770
he saw the UFC and 87.

245
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,140
You have all these things in your head
and then you start reading and you go,

246
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,281
Whoa,

247
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:54,441
Whoa,

248
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:54,650
whoa,

249
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,950
Whoa,

250
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,780
whoa.

251
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,960
That's not the case.

252
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,794
Like there was.

253
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,300
He wrote a list on facebook.

254
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:03,170
Mark Schultz did have all the
inaccuracies of the foxcatcher movie.

255
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
It's fucking ridiculous.

256
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,331
It's ridiculous.

257
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:08,960
They just been fucked with everything
they know because he was like a consultant

258
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,380
on the movie.

259
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm sure he probably knew a little bit.

260
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,250
What the fuck is he going to do?

261
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,930
They're probably given
him an ass load of money,

262
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,823
right.

263
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,053
Tips.

264
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,860
He say he's a wrestler.

265
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,630
Wrestling coach at Brigham Young.

266
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,890
I mean he had a stop mma fighting
because the school that he was teaching

267
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,570
wrestling at didn't want them doing it.

268
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,980
It was a different time.

269
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,640
It was like 96 or 97 or whatever
the fuck it was when he fought.

270
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,200
That was right on the end of like USC
being like sumo wrestler fights in Ninja.

271
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,180
It was still that still.

272
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,890
He was still using bare knuckles.

273
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,721
There was still a,

274
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:45,200
I think he would still wear shoes when
I started used to google wear shoes.

275
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,510
You couldn't punch the balls
when I first got there.

276
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,370
You couldn't punch the
balls and you couldn't.

277
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,810
I don't think you could pull hair anymore.

278
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,100
They got rid of that early on.

279
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,890
Fun growing up.

280
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,510
I watched a documentary recently
to a 28 USC 20 and like,

281
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,120
uh,

282
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,500
having that go through my life,

283
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,410
like watching this sport
grow in my lifetime for me,

284
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,770
I remember me and my stepfather order
the first one ever when it was tournament

285
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,950
style and you have to go out and fight
like three times and we thought it was

286
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:11,760
like the greatest thing of all time.

287
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:12,890
But data watch it go from like,

288
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:13,580
you know,

289
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,271
no shoes,

290
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:14,441
no,

291
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:14,901
Geez,

292
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,880
no gouging,

293
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,813
all these things.

294
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,200
But you have to,

295
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,280
that has to happen.

296
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,850
And then they go,

297
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,510
oh Yay.

298
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,350
Now you can't just,

299
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,750
you can't just break a guy's
finger because you're losing.

300
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,771
Yeah.

301
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,604
Well it's,

302
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,110
it's why can't you,

303
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,550
if you break guys arm,

304
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,440
how come you can't break
but what guy's finger like?

305
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,274
I really,

306
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,460
I disagree with like all the thoughts
about like small joint manipulation

307
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,950
because the reality is if someone's
trying to manipulate your joint,

308
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,750
like if say the only
way that would really.

309
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,910
The only way that
usually works in defense,

310
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,780
like say if a guy,

311
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,950
if you're a,

312
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,470
you're trying to grab a guy and you're
trying to choke him and he starts pulling

313
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,280
on your fingers,

314
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,750
well you could just
pull your fingers away,

315
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,411
you know,

316
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,930
it's not like it's an automatic that
he's going to break your fingers.

317
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,320
Sure.

318
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,820
You just have to be more aware of it.

319
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,650
Like it's realistic.

320
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,830
Like if a guy has to do is pull your
finger back to stop you from doing a choke

321
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,041
will.

322
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,360
Then he did the right thing.

323
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,240
Why are you taking that away from him
when it's okay for him to choke you?

324
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,861
Oh yeah.

325
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:06,120
You have to like actually get
under the hand itself completely.

326
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:06,930
Right?

327
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,630
But why are you taking away the guy's
ability to pull on your fingers?

328
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,130
Yeah,

329
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,220
we've pulls on your fingers.

330
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,410
You better get your fingers out of
there and then try to choke them again.

331
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,720
It just makes sense to me.

332
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,220
I actually thought because it never
happens that I thought there was a rule of

333
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,360
no choking in the UFC,

334
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,780
like a direct on choke.

335
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:23,760
Like you're trying to
fight against the wall,

336
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:24,571
but you can do that.

337
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:28,750
Apparently it's the most unrealistic
move to this same reason.

338
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,950
No one headlocks like you
did in the school yard as a
kid where you have the guy

339
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,200
got a bulldog position.

340
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,980
Him as like the more that nef that
so rarely ever happened to us.

341
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,540
I think you're wrong.

342
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,090
I think it is illegal to
grab the neck like that.

343
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,530
I think it's illegal to straight on.

344
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,240
I think it used to be legal,

345
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,320
but now it's illegal.

346
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:46,861
I need.

347
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:47,011
Yeah.

348
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:48,120
I need to find out about that.

349
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,901
There was something about,

350
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:48,991
well,

351
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,210
there's a bunch of weird
spots that you can't do.

352
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,370
Like do you know you can't hit
a guy in the back of the head,

353
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,640
can't hit a guy in the back.

354
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,840
You get kicked in the back
of the head all the time.

355
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,310
When you get hit with a head kick.

356
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,550
One of the things about a head kick is
you know the shins kind of coming around

357
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,550
here and a lot of times
like a high percentage,

358
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,730
that foot in the instep are bang wrapping
right around the back of your head way

359
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:13,830
fucking harder than you
can ever punch like so.

360
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,390
The idea that you don't get
hit in the back of the head,

361
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:20,280
it's crazy because there's a totally legal
shot that's basically the back of the

362
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:20,640
head.

363
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,300
Nobody ever gets in trouble for kicking
somebody in the back of the head and it

364
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,070
happens all the time.

365
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,870
It's just ground and pound.

366
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,620
When you're grounded.

367
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,710
Impounding is usually when guys get in
trouble for hitting the back of the head,

368
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,410
which is the most ridiculous because
that's when guys are moving around.

369
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,803
He's trying to protect them.

370
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,620
All we gotta do is get
to the back of your head,

371
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,850
but standup wise,

372
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,470
a lot of guys get hit
in the back of the head.

373
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,400
They get hit with clubbing punches
like when in like in melees.

374
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,160
They never get in trouble for that and
there's a lot of elbows that go to the

375
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:50,520
back of the head because you're up against
the cage and in areas where you'd get

376
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,380
in trouble hitting him
somehow and ground and pound,

377
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,890
it seems almost like elbows to the back
of the head and punches the back of the

378
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:59,530
head are really only recognize clearly
when it's ground and pound wha.

379
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,361
Why Man?

380
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:00,841
What was that?

381
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,370
Uh,

382
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,010
to Diego Sanchez elbowing the top of clay.

383
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,123
Sweetest head.

384
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,510
Like I don't know how
those weren't like illegal.

385
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,211
Excuse me by the rules.

386
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,080
That should have been illegal.

387
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,240
Here's the top is fine.

388
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,480
It's the base of the skull that's
supposed to be the real danger area.

389
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
It's the back of the head
and the base of skull.

390
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,610
You can elbow top of the head was
directly on top of the head is fine.

391
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,240
The top of the heads find the sides of
the head are fine and there's like a

392
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:25,310
bunch of debate about like,

393
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,570
what is the [inaudible] called?

394
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,330
The Mohawk,

395
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,990
the Mohawk,

396
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,200
meaning this is the area that can hit
Mohawk in the back of the head like that

397
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:35,850
strip down with a spine is some people
extend it more towards the ears and some

398
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,950
people keep it more narrow
and some people lower it,

399
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,940
so it's just the base.

400
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,440
Some people think that like right here,

401
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,910
like sort of the mid back of the head,

402
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,744
it's fine,

403
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,530
so it's,

404
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:43,930
it's,

405
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,690
it's,

406
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,720
it's open to debate,

407
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:50,610
but the idea is ultimately that the base
of the spine is very dangerous to hit

408
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,800
and then if you hit someone
they're really hard.

409
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,540
You might be able to separate their
fucking brain and our spinal column.

410
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,800
It was a big move in the old day.

411
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,060
See,

412
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,711
in the old days,

413
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,850
one of the best moves was you'd take guys
back and then you would smash the back

414
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,730
of his head with elbows like
Henzel Gracie did that too.

415
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,670
Like this judo specialist
that he fought and got.

416
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,504
I want to say like,

417
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,980
I forget the organization.

418
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,160
It might have been Mars or it
might have been like one of those,

419
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,450
one of those like really,

420
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,510
really young old school martial arts
promotions that never really made it so

421
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:25,900
Hensville gets this guy down,

422
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,690
kitces back and just fuck it.

423
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,170
Boom.

424
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,340
Just smashes the back of his head because
it's totally legal back then and you

425
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,400
realize like that takes away
all your rear naked choke,

426
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,234
all that stuff.

427
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,330
That's like not even nearly
as effective as doing that.

428
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,660
You've got a guy's head fee.

429
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:42,990
If you're.

430
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,480
You got him face down and you're smashing
the back of his head with elbows while

431
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:47,500
you have the back mountain.

432
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,740
There's very little he can do to
defend that used to be illegal.

433
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,870
It's funny in that unit goes to.

434
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:53,980
They take away from the sport.

435
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,160
It still stays a thousand times
more interesting than box.

436
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,191
You see,

437
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:58,730
man,

438
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,810
everybody says that.

439
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,051
Right?

440
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,970
But I really found that fight interesting.

441
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,180
I'm of the minority that thought that
it was a really interesting fight.

442
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,140
Everybody was mad for this.

443
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,660
With that,

444
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm like,

445
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,110
come on.

446
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,943
You.

447
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,140
As a person who appreciates boxing,

448
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,300
that fight to me was pretty wild.

449
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,270
It was intense to watch because
you know manny Pacquiao,

450
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,460
he's been able to get
his gloves on everybody.

451
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,390
He fights everybody.

452
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:20,811
He fights,

453
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,644
he lights up,

454
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,520
he gets a hold of you.

455
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:26,210
Eventually any lights you up and you
might get them like mark has got them,

456
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,840
but before market has
got them sound like pack.

457
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,710
Y'All didn't crack them,

458
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,071
you know,

459
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,960
they weren't going back and
forth and back and forth.

460
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:36,800
Just smart cast as a legendary Chin and
awesome punching power and eventually

461
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:37,310
knocked pack,

462
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,790
yell out.

463
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,180
But pack yellow is in these wars
with Margarita wars with Kodo,

464
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:42,400
you know,

465
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,420
just bash the shit out of Chris.

466
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,150
Algeria is real slick and moves real well.

467
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,051
Just gets you.

468
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:48,920
And he's a pretty boy.

469
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:49,340
White Guy.

470
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,911
He's a pretty boy,

471
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:50,151
white guy,

472
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,080
but he's a bad motherfucker,

473
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,960
but manny Pacquiao just
could not get to floyd.

474
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,640
Then one time he did get them.

475
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,570
It's like nothing,

476
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:56,881
you know,

477
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,790
it's like floyd just covered up,

478
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,511
uses defense,

479
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,440
kept shaking his head like,

480
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:00,980
nope,

481
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,580
nothing.

482
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,060
Nope.

483
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,460
Nothing like manny.

484
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,730
We just couldn't get them.

485
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,120
To me that was impressive as
fuck the way he was moving.

486
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,190
Like every time manny
would come for that blitz,

487
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,780
floyd was gone.

488
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,950
He just wasn't there,

489
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,610
you know,

490
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,730
just suit super slick boxing.

491
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,611
I'm from Philly,

492
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:21,370
so I spent a lifetime with Bernard Hopkins
just watching him and rooting for him

493
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,204
of these,

494
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,660
these really long,

495
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,700
slow flights.

496
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,670
They are like,

497
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,841
they just take for us.

498
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,850
I think floyd mayweather was
kind of the same thing for me.

499
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,280
You know,

500
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,160
I just watched again man,

501
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,190
that you see that Tyson
documentary on cable all the time,

502
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:35,450
which is him sitting and talking in the,

503
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,420
in the white shirt when
they go to that footage.

504
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,830
Once in a while I'll even watch that.

505
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:40,551
Fox Sports,

506
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,181
we'll do the,

507
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:41,580
you know,

508
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,730
the all day just Tyson's fights,

509
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,570
but watching that footage of him training
and just how fast he wasn't what he

510
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:48,404
was doing.

511
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,120
How come there isn't.

512
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,460
There hasn't been the
Mike Tyson since my Tyson.

513
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,120
There's been arguably six
Jordan's since Jordan.

514
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,351
You know what I mean?

515
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:01,580
You need a lot of things that come
together correctly to make a Mike Tyson.

516
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,140
You need a lot of things.

517
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,951
Also that talent,

518
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,070
I think in the last decade jumps to mma.

519
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,770
Yeah.

520
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,030
No,

521
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,170
I don't know man.

522
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,861
I don't know.

523
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,320
I mean there's still a lot of
guys who really like boxing.

524
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:12,561
You know,

525
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:12,621
I,

526
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,250
I,

527
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,641
I got an,

528
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,410
a famous argument years
back with this guy,

529
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:19,970
Lou Dibella on espn where I was telling
the box he was going to get swallowed up

530
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,750
by the,

531
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,441
by the UFC,

532
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,011
by MMA,

533
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,330
by a more dynamic sport,

534
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,730
but I would have never done
that if that guy wasn't a dick.

535
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,800
But I like boxing.

536
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,900
I've always liked boxing.

537
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,740
I've been a huge fan
since I was a little kid.

538
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,041
Man.

539
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,540
Just always been a fan of it.

540
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,673
There's some.

541
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,020
I also am a big fan of kickboxing.

542
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,250
I'm a big Fan of glory and I'm a big fan
of Moitai because I think that there's

543
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:44,480
things that you pull off in just
straight kickboxing or boxing,

544
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,630
that you just can't do an mma because
guys will clinch you the three to the

545
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:47,930
ground.

546
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,191
You just,

547
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,024
you can't get it off.

548
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,840
You can't do most of this shit.

549
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,340
Floyd mayweather does with leg kicks,

550
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,840
soon as leg kicks were in the mix.

551
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,040
You can't do most of this shit,

552
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,220
but to me what he's doing is incredible.

553
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,960
I mean it's so artistic.

554
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,730
He's beating the game.

555
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,970
He's going out at 48 F and o
with no brain scrambles me.

556
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,060
There's only been tagged
that I can remember twice,

557
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,710
three times at maximum.

558
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,820
Never been really fucking battered
to the point where you like,

559
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,520
the fight is going to be stopped and
he's to come back like goddy ward or

560
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,240
anything like that.

561
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,070
None of that shit.

562
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,310
But if you're going to stay interested
in boxing now you have to be a real fan

563
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:25,660
of like the sweet science.

564
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:26,051
You know what I mean?

565
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,170
Like the quote unquote
because there's just no.

566
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,240
I mean there's just not.

567
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,330
People want to see knockout,

568
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,560
you know?

569
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,580
At the end of the day we're all,

570
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,100
I guess the gladiator cage
and we don't want to see like,

571
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,220
you know,

572
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,031
people get knocked out.

573
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,940
You want to see that
violence that you like.

574
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,890
MMA is such a scary thing to the layman
that boxing's become less scared.

575
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,361
She's like,

576
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:47,440
we'll go to the size of those gloves,

577
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,050
like these guys are going multiple
rounds and they're getting hit with,

578
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,913
you know,

579
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,810
it was like a sponge over
your fist a little bit,

580
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,051
you know,

581
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:53,884
like,

582
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,600
yeah,

583
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,880
let's do it.

584
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,340
I think it just like draws.

585
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,960
You can't go back with attention more.

586
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,860
You can.

587
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,550
I can,

588
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,941
I don't,

589
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:01,271
I really,

590
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,960
I mean I'm not just saying here's what,

591
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,670
here's what you'll never.

592
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,670
You'll never have a girl will never
go retroactive from UFC to boxing.

593
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,151
I don't think so,

594
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:10,331
but,

595
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:10,570
but,

596
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:10,751
but,

597
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,850
but you can get a girl girls very easily.

598
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,680
I find getting the UFC really.

599
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,810
I think girls get into UFC very,

600
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:17,500
very easily.

601
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,440
What do you think that is
that some gladiator gene shit,

602
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:21,910
they want to get some
gladiators permanent.

603
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,020
I think there's an actual.

604
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:23,141
Yeah,

605
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:23,770
I think there's like the,

606
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,140
the,

607
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,790
I think the,

608
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,130
like the machismo of the whole thing.

609
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,330
And then also uh,

610
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,030
in UFC very specifically,

611
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:31,420
but in,

612
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,450
in most of the televised mma stuff,

613
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:34,811
I actually really,

614
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,270
I mean UFC really does it like the best.

615
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,330
Like if you just give your girl two
episodes of the buildup shit like Daniel

616
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,510
Cormier,

617
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,221
Jon Jones,

618
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,054
like she was in,

619
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,400
she invested interest in
that because we watched it.

620
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,780
I made her go back watch Jon Jones.

621
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,820
Like first thing when he came out,

622
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,690
he was the hero.

623
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,870
She put her out of this course.

624
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:53,960
Uh,

625
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,570
yeah,

626
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,850
I want to say about it
made her watch that,

627
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:55,981
you know,

628
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,180
that half hour thing of him like,

629
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:57,511
you know,

630
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,840
I saved the old woman from getting robbed
and I was thinking she and his story

631
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,790
and it's kind of hard
luck story and growing up.

632
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,691
And she was like,

633
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:03,811
wow,

634
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,491
I really liked this guy.

635
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,760
Them again watches things now.

636
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:06,594
Like he just,

637
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,900
his personality is different and he just
made himself like the villain sort of.

638
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,221
Well,

639
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,330
I don't think that the villains,

640
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,090
I think villains in actual sports,

641
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:15,000
so not wrestling.

642
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,350
What's funny about that?

643
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,030
I think any kind of sport actually like,

644
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,450
you know,

645
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,970
even someone who hates the Yankees,

646
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,260
like if you meet a rod,

647
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,970
you're probably still like Mr Rodriguez,

648
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,480
as you know,

649
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,601
you're,

650
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:24,750
you're,

651
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,760
you're meeting like a sports
celebrity to some degree.

652
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:27,211
You know what I mean?

653
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,460
Like I'd always say like
fuck Michael Jordan,

654
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,230
like I'm not like a bulls fan of,

655
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,850
but it'd be amazing to
meet Michael Jordan,

656
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,360
you know what I mean?

657
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,140
Don't you think?

658
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,500
Right now's a great time to get chicks
into a two because of Ronda Rousey.

659
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,170
Like there's never been
never been a female fighter.

660
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,960
Like Rhonda Rousey a hot check
the pizza fuck out of everybody,

661
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,960
but she's so hot and she
really assisted video of her

662
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,010
with Luke rockhold and she's got Luke
rockhold and what we call spider web.

663
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,200
It's when you try to finish Armbar,

664
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,310
Luke rockhold is a fucking monster.

665
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,880
Okay.

666
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,661
He's like six,

667
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,790
300.

668
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,220
He cuts down to one 85 is
usually way over 200 pounds.

669
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,550
He's a fucking stud at
Jujitsu and Rhonda are.

670
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,190
She completes the arm bar
on him like he's defending,

671
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,950
like he's really defending and she
completes it and he has to tap.

672
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,390
That's how bad ass she is.

673
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,670
Like I don't think,

674
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,311
you know,

675
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:11,961
like if you,

676
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:13,380
if you've never been armed guard before,

677
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,730
you don't know how ridiculous that is.

678
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,591
Like a guy that grew,

679
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,740
caught luke rockhold,

680
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,380
she'd have like retarded defense,

681
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,710
like he's an ace level MMA black.

682
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:22,051
But look,

683
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:22,740
look at this.

684
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,450
This is Luke rockhold on the bottom here.

685
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:24,871
Okay.

686
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:29,820
Luke rockhold again is world
class in the UFC at 185 pounds.

687
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,430
Just beat the fuck out of Leo Machida,

688
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:32,731
I mean,

689
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:33,720
destroyed him,

690
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,830
took him to the ground,

691
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,551
controlled him,

692
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,480
smashed him,

693
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,910
finished out the Brown and here he is
trying to defend against Ronda Rousey's

694
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:45,310
arm bar and she's got a bunch of
different techniques she uses to uh,

695
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,730
attack the grip that he's using.

696
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,640
She keeps adjusting.

697
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,260
Readjusting.

698
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,310
Now I see how he stepped
over her head right there.

699
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,380
That's like fucking defcon four.

700
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,010
Like he knows he's in some serious trouble
could if she straightens out his arm,

701
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,450
he's done and he's got a tap.

702
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,600
And she seconds away from straightening
out his arm and he's going to get to

703
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,321
this situation is tap,

704
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:01,591
tap,

705
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:01,900
tap.

706
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,730
He had a tap.

707
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,690
She fucking tapped him.

708
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:04,020
Dude,

709
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,380
she fights at 1:35 as a woman.

710
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,530
He fights 50 pounds heavier as
one of the best men in the world.

711
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,710
That that's how fucking good
her arm bar technique is.

712
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,690
There's never been a fighter in
any fucking sport like her before.

713
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,171
No.

714
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,980
That's like a total pioneer
because she's the one before her,

715
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,700
like her.

716
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,010
She,

717
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,810
she so impressed me on that
last one with cats in Ghana.

718
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,810
Yeah.

719
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,000
Because I know it was over in 14 seconds,

720
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,060
but watching it just in real time,

721
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,260
I was like,

722
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,450
that was a series of
lucky things that worked.

723
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:41,710
Effort and live in that position.

724
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,670
And then.

725
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,270
No,

726
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,560
no,

727
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,750
no.

728
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,530
And then when she said it,

729
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,250
she said in the,

730
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,010
in the interview she have
been working on that,

731
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,960
doing the transition.

732
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,970
You don't borrow from
that transition and she,

733
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:52,450
uh,

734
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,190
and then when you watch it in slow motion,

735
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,800
you see her make a fucking
decision to step over.

736
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,350
But it was one of the craziest
things I've ever seen.

737
00:20:59,351 --> 00:20:59,501
Yeah.

738
00:20:59,501 --> 00:20:59,861
She's,

739
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,250
she's terrifying and she's
fun and she's not like a,

740
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:03,940
you know,

741
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,280
Cyborg was terrifying,

742
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,230
but so much because of the size.

743
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,730
It wasn't like any kind of a necessary.

744
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:10,630
I mean she had a skill set,

745
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,351
but it wasn't that,

746
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:11,860
that was so,

747
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,460
it was just like she was
10 times bigger than that,

748
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,660
you know,

749
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,730
kind of like a man.

750
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,360
Yeah.

751
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,710
I mean let's be at her
height way worse than China.

752
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,951
Wait,

753
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,130
why did we decide big why's?

754
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,530
She was like the side,

755
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,310
but it was different because
you are getting to see her
actually hit people like

756
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,820
in China was really impressive because
she was big and strong and you're like,

757
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,260
I,

758
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,521
she,

759
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:31,620
uh,

760
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,680
she was on fear factor.

761
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,330
Like China's yoked.

762
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,631
I mean,

763
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,770
she's a big girl.

764
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,500
If she,

765
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,800
you know,

766
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
if you had to wrestle
her a goddamn tussle,

767
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,293
that's a big Gal,

768
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,541
you know,

769
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,600
she's strongly sex tape with wrestling.

770
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:44,740
Stop Pussy boner.

771
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,440
That's total wrestling.

772
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,290
Did you watch the one where she
did anal fro one within ones?

773
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,650
It was mostly pro launched.

774
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,250
If she'd have professional
porns portfolio apart,

775
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,620
but you're still one where it's
a back door to China on it.

776
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,350
You did it and I remember
having a little bit,

777
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,150
but it was like a really famous
porn dude went for poor bastard.

778
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,880
Both of them.

779
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,713
I don't know.

780
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,540
But um,

781
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,460
but my point was like,

782
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,040
when she,

783
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,170
you're not supposed to say the
sideboard looked like a man,

784
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,570
but when she was beating the
fuck out like Gina Carano,

785
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:17,530
she was feeling like a man.

786
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,840
It wasn't like the
classic female body type.

787
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,510
So when she got busted for male steroids,

788
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,763
everybody's like,

789
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,170
of course she looks different now though,

790
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:26,410
man,

791
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:26,720
she's,

792
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,940
she's become more feminine,

793
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,930
a lot more feminine.

794
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,973
But there's,

795
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,530
there's an honest debate as to what,

796
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,470
how much of how much of what you do
to your body when you alter it that

797
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:37,030
severely,

798
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,440
how much you changed this permanent.

799
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,880
Like they've done these studies on
athletes that have taken anabolic steroids

800
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,013
and um,

801
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,320
they've had permanent
effects on the strength,

802
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,303
permanent,

803
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,530
not just temporary but permanent,

804
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:52,540
like permanent improvements in strength.

805
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,340
And so they wonder like,

806
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,250
how much of her getting
off the male hormones?

807
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,360
Like how much does she lose?

808
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,171
Does she lose all of it?

809
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,100
Is it still fair?

810
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:00,311
I mean,

811
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:00,460
what,

812
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,260
what is it?

813
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,630
I don't know.

814
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,020
You know,

815
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,321
my,

816
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,154
uh,

817
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,450
my stepfather,

818
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,820
I think it's a pretty
naturally strong guy,

819
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:07,390
but he did a bunch of
steroids when he was younger.

820
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,111
Power lifting,

821
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:08,944
that's what he did.

822
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,323
And uh,

823
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:10,781
you know,

824
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,670
even through his forties and he,

825
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:12,970
you know,

826
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,110
he's in his fifties now.

827
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,080
Like,

828
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,380
like I can still go out there
and bench on just a day,

829
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,000
throw up like 350 pounds.

830
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,840
I mean I remember it 30.

831
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,460
He's like doing like 4:55 and,

832
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,250
and he's not,

833
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,083
he always like,

834
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,641
you know,

835
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:26,080
a buck 70 bucks,

836
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:26,590
75.

837
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:26,741
Yeah.

838
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:27,850
Those power lifter dudes,

839
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:28,061
man,

840
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,250
that's a totally different
type of moving your body.

841
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,640
That's like some severe
strength that's required to do.

842
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,153
But I'm saying,

843
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,430
but the steroids,

844
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,020
I believe like definitely you still,

845
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,310
you still build a base,

846
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:39,451
you know,

847
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,151
the thing is what happened.

848
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,320
I think it raises your base.

849
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,900
It doesn't mean to
according to these studies,

850
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,080
but the question is it gets
more complicated when it's
a woman because it's not,

851
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,530
it's not even like she took like
more of what she already had.

852
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,930
She actually introduced some stuff
that she's not supposed to have.

853
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:54,111
I mean,

854
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:56,210
you do have a little bit of
testosterone when you're a woman,

855
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,620
but nothing like the levels that they
take when they get into bodybuilding or

856
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,311
power lifting.

857
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,440
Like the women that like
even track and field women

858
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,870
people get get caught all the
time taking shit because it works.

859
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,180
I mean it changes their.

860
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,320
You ever seen like bodybuilder porn,

861
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,120
like girl bodybuilder,

862
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,560
Porno,

863
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,241
nude pictures.

864
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:14,500
Like,

865
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,333
oh,

866
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,150
it's a man's body.

867
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,200
I was watching one of those,

868
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:18,620
uh,

869
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,850
those are my strange addiction shows
and the lady that was addicted to

870
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:24,050
bodybuilding and she,

871
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
her sister was on as a point of reference.

872
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,200
It was really interesting.

873
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,621
Like,

874
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:28,251
your sister's like,

875
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,061
you're getting bigger.

876
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,410
Are you going to keep getting bigger?

877
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:30,981
She's like,

878
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,880
I just love it.

879
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,490
This is what I look like now.

880
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,100
I love it.

881
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,640
I can't wait.

882
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm on how well you know,

883
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,400
how often do you work out?

884
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,090
And she's like,

885
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,301
oh,

886
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,650
I work out like three days a week.

887
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:39,861
She's like,

888
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,300
I work out seven hours a day.

889
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,530
She was working out six,

890
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,311
seven hours a day.

891
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:48,140
Her fucking head was as big as
Tito Ortiz's and my mood together.

892
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,470
She's a giant fucking neck.

893
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,500
Huge traps.

894
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,250
Look at this broad.

895
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,083
Is that her?

896
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,420
Is that the one from the show yet?

897
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,880
Look at the size of this lady.

898
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,620
Jesus fucking Christ.

899
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,560
It's me and I'm the years ago,

900
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,080
maybe 2005 or something of 2006.

901
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,910
Me and Patrice to the nasty show in
Montreal together and after the show there

902
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:12,800
was a bodybuilder chick who was white
girl way into him and really thorough and

903
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:13,300
she was.

904
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,540
She was just saying stuff like,

905
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,500
so sexy to own.

906
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:16,380
Patrice was so weird.

907
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,310
I mean you didn't do anything with it,

908
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,740
but I remember him saying he was like,

909
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,640
he goes,

910
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,560
I might just have to
wrestle it as big bitch.

911
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,110
I was with a Jujitsu girl once.

912
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,580
That was very intimidating.

913
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:27,910
Yeah,

914
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,390
but that's it.

915
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,830
She's a regular size gal.

916
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,933
She's an actual.

917
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,730
This other one,

918
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,580
I don't know if you know about
that was a different one.

919
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:33,851
Yeah,

920
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:37,110
there's been with three
Jujitsu chicks before.

921
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,020
One was definitely bigger than the other
ones and she just had one of those big

922
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:46,021
bodies and I remember her vagina was
very clean and like no hair but yet had

923
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:47,700
that explosion of Pussy,

924
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,190
lips,

925
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,180
Brown Pussy Lips.

926
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,330
They give us like a midi
vagina and it was weird.

927
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,193
It was a weird.

928
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,820
I've never even fucked a chick with abs.

929
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,410
I don't think ever had one gal that was
a bodybuilder when I was like really

930
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:01,711
young.

931
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:04,350
I think I was 21 and a day.

932
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,570
This gal from New
Hampshire had a six pack.

933
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,890
It was weird.

934
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,490
Had its rear body though.

935
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,740
Her legs were incredible.

936
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,620
I mean that like an like those
bodies and dresses look great.

937
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,760
Sometimes the girls just like abs,

938
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,321
like bodybuilder.

939
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,750
I was just like a girl
who's like toned and strong,

940
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,890
but looks like a girl.

941
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,540
Like there's a difference
in the girls strongholds.

942
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:24,330
Who girl or a guy like no fence.

943
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,930
The lady in those photographs was
most likely on some male hormones.

944
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:28,260
I mean,

945
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,340
you get the fuck out of here.

946
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,990
That's Vito Belfort in Brazil.

947
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,040
I mean that's.

948
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,360
Look at the size of that chick.

949
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,550
She looks like Mark Coleman when
he won the heavyweight title,

950
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,400
but you can even put that male
hormone is why their faces.

951
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,370
That wasn't the face she
was destined to have.

952
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,560
No,

953
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,640
she has a man's face.

954
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,060
Yeah.

955
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,260
She's very manly.

956
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,280
Mean like monster.

957
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:49,281
Like it's really weird touching a girl
also when it's hard as a rock and not

958
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,780
like soft and she and.

959
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,620
But I mean,

960
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:52,891
okay,

961
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,700
here's the question.

962
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Is that better or worse than someone who
eats themselves into a gelatinous wall

963
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:00,270
of meat?

964
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,940
I would take fat over that whale.

965
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,120
Like for a Gal,

966
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,010
for your lady friend.

967
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:05,730
Fat Chicks we're going to
come up with are awesome.

968
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:06,360
Yeah.

969
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,200
I would hook up.

970
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,030
I'd hook up with A.

971
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,930
I mean for the ones,

972
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,763
for the storage,

973
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,240
I'd go that direct life.

974
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,930
You think like if you could
get her off the sauce,

975
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,730
she could probably woman up a little bit.

976
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,800
Right?

977
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,633
Much.

978
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,630
How much would she woman,

979
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,290
but she would still retain a bunch of it,

980
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:22,800
you know,

981
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I know because there's a gal that lives
in my friend's neighborhood and I go to

982
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:32,900
visit him and she was apparently some
Olympia Olympian bodybuilder back in the

983
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,970
day and now she's like in her
fifties and she looks like a monster.

984
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,980
Really looks like a monster.

985
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,150
Just faces all.

986
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:39,730
She looks.

987
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,563
It's like,

988
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,880
when I say monster,

989
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,770
I don't mean like the worst monster.

990
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,730
I mean like a.

991
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,030
wouldn't it be kind of scary?

992
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,170
It's just what she's,

993
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,290
what she did was turn herself into
a semi male semi female thing.

994
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,260
Like she changed.

995
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,680
Her appearance has
changed and it's become,

996
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,111
you know,

997
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:05,610
she'd become more male than you're
supposed to be or then she was,

998
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,053
you know it.

999
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:07,741
Yeah.

1000
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:08,574
So you know,

1001
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,750
you can't go back either.

1002
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,584
I don't think you can.

1003
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,710
I think that could probably,

1004
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,170
like I saw a Gal,

1005
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,760
her chin shaved down,

1006
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,530
she was some big bodybuilder lady power
lifter Marshall trying to get something

1007
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,960
like that Chin shaved down
because her chin got too big.

1008
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,640
Trying to get all that,

1009
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,470
try to use to have that square face.

1010
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,470
She changed,

1011
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,330
she became much more feminine
when they start opening your skin,

1012
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,100
grinding down your bones.

1013
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,930
Arnold had that done to.

1014
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,800
Arnold had developed a very large um,

1015
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,550
upper brow area.

1016
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Then like there's like
before and after liquid,

1017
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,480
you look at him and Conan and you look
at them skull shaving shaved the skull

1018
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:46,800
down to something more reasonable.

1019
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,690
Have you ever just a room though?

1020
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,050
That's one of those rumors
like the Richard Gere durable
and we can never really

1021
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:52,580
know.

1022
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,130
We,

1023
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,620
me and my buddy literally
just talked about this,

1024
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:54,930
those,

1025
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,000
those urban myths like
that was actually a,

1026
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,840
the journal up the ass was a
specific Philadelphia News.

1027
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,990
They used to say it about in affiliate.

1028
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,511
That story,

1029
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,640
that urban legend and we and the,

1030
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,510
and the other one was uh,

1031
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,300
you know,

1032
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,051
pumping a gallon,

1033
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:07,884
a comment or.

1034
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,843
But you wouldn't be,

1035
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,531
you think,

1036
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:11,011
you know,

1037
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:11,821
the origin,

1038
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,120
like where it started from that.

1039
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,630
That's the literal we were
talking about earlier.

1040
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,070
Was that a like,

1041
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:22,071
it's amazing how that got around
so many years before the Internet.

1042
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,830
Like for Shit,

1043
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,510
for rumors to happen now is simple
one person of any kind of like,

1044
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:27,751
you know,

1045
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:31,170
who has any kind of ear or already
kind of voice for people you know,

1046
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,030
like says something.

1047
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,570
It becomes Gospel to some people.

1048
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Yeah,

1049
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,800
we've talked about it a bunch of times
that that's the mother of all rumors like

1050
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:39,451
that.

1051
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,010
No other rumor can close because
Eddie Bravo grew up in la.

1052
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,030
I grew up in Boston.

1053
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,470
We both heard about it at the same time.

1054
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,060
Yeah.

1055
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,870
You lived in Columbus so
it made its way across.

1056
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,120
But the Rod Stewart one was nothing
compared to roster one was he had his

1057
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,954
stomach pumped.

1058
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,250
Why don't you just throw up.

1059
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,720
Didn't make any sense.

1060
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,040
I had thrown up and went,

1061
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:57,701
this is ridiculous.

1062
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:58,630
How much did he drink?

1063
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,613
Come on.

1064
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,660
That's ridiculous.

1065
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,530
Just puke.

1066
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,990
But you have to go to the
computer to possibly been.

1067
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,150
Are you going to go to the top
hospital and tell him he drank calm.

1068
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,170
Why they going to test it?

1069
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,430
How the fuck do they know what it is?

1070
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,450
You have to tell him it's fucking
milk or glue or something.

1071
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:14,860
But so much that has to come out.

1072
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,690
It was blowing,

1073
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,570
blowing Peter North.

1074
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,490
Imagine going into the hospital and just
first of all I thought about how much I

1075
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:23,410
came at the time I was a young,

1076
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:24,100
young boy.

1077
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,790
I was probably like 12 when that rumor
came out and I was thinking about how

1078
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,630
much I can come.

1079
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,261
I'm like,

1080
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,900
how much more could a
grown adult possibly come?

1081
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,400
It doesn't even make any sense.

1082
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,690
Like how much could it be in my body?

1083
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,200
It gives your baby bird come like
that's how much come on Carolyn.

1084
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,440
I'm taking that back.

1085
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,700
You know nothing to think about it.

1086
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,720
I think this came out when I was 12
so I probably had never come yet.

1087
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,240
Just that weird little shiver.

1088
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,351
I probably,

1089
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:50,591
yeah,

1090
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,950
I probably really didn't even know
like what the actual volume would be.

1091
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,000
So that doesn't make any sense,

1092
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,750
but I just didn't like they said it was
like courts or gallons or something like

1093
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:58,920
that.

1094
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,650
12 you knew would come was you just
knew it wasn't happening to you when you

1095
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,570
can't really find it back then either.

1096
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,770
When did pretty woman come out?

1097
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:06,461
Because it came out,

1098
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:07,294
that was way later.

1099
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,910
That was way later.

1100
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,980
They're going to come out after that.

1101
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:12,040
That's why we all knew who
Richard greer gear was.

1102
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,450
He knew who he was before the officer.

1103
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,730
Gentleman off.

1104
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah,

1105
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,870
American Gigolo.

1106
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,040
He was in a lot of big movies.

1107
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,200
Do it seemed like it came out of her.

1108
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm pretty limited,

1109
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,900
but what's to say?

1110
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,320
I just came up again because
that was the next big,

1111
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:23,651
big,

1112
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:24,484
big hit he did.

1113
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,370
It's just amazing that it made it all
the way across the country like that.

1114
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,790
Yeah,

1115
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,001
no,

1116
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:28,481
absolutely.

1117
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:30,790
The word was that he had left scientology,

1118
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,173
scientology.

1119
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,190
Where did I get this word?

1120
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,180
Have No,

1121
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,270
it is the most poorly researched,

1122
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,104
whatever,

1123
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,930
but this is what I heard is that he left
scientology and someone in scientology

1124
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:41,111
said,

1125
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:41,171
well,

1126
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:41,540
yeah,

1127
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,970
we'll fix that fucker.

1128
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,420
And they put out some crazy rumor
that homeboy had a job up his ass.

1129
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,410
I believe that we've been following
that whole hbo show going.

1130
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,443
Yeah.

1131
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,090
There's only the one
documentary right now.

1132
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:58,150
They're making a documentary about
that guy that made the movie.

1133
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,290
Scientology is.

1134
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,940
They're also making a documentary
about Louis Thorough Louis Theroux that

1135
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,860
documentary and I love him.

1136
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,140
He's doing a special on scientology,

1137
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,750
so scientology decided to
do a documentary on him

1138
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,500
unless it was really good and you're like,

1139
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,070
Jeez,

1140
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,791
thanks a lot.

1141
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,451
Scientology.

1142
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,530
Maybe you guys are pretty cool.

1143
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,640
That's a cool documentary.

1144
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:21,700
I don't think it's
going to be really well.

1145
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,840
Well done in it.

1146
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:23,740
Everything's great.

1147
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,191
Yeah.

1148
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,460
It's all about roses and
I think it's a headpiece,

1149
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:26,861
you know?

1150
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,641
I think that's what they're doing.

1151
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,190
They're trying to intimidate people
from bringing attention to them.

1152
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,960
You know what I just watched this morning,

1153
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,850
I woke up on Netflix and I was watching
a documentary called tricked about the

1154
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,200
sec guys,

1155
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:38,861
pimp girls.

1156
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,220
I get girls like young girls

1157
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,640
and pimp them out and the stuff they say
to convince them and the girls giving

1158
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:45,650
their account of what,

1159
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,740
you know,

1160
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,410
what the guy said to them
and how they were like,

1161
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:48,570
you know,

1162
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,070
to hey,

1163
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,970
I've got invited to a party and
then there was no other party.

1164
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,251
He goes,

1165
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:52,341
well,

1166
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,091
let's go have some dinner,

1167
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,611
and then like,

1168
00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:53,930
you know,

1169
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,920
two hours later it was like,

1170
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,210
fuck this guy's Dick in a car.

1171
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,100
It's the same when you hear these adults
who were out of scientology talking

1172
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:03,830
about and one thing I was actually
laughing a lot in the document is saying

1173
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,011
like,

1174
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:07,430
I know it sounds so stupid telling
it to you that they were like,

1175
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:08,000
you know,

1176
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,070
if you don't sit in this room
for the next three months,

1177
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,850
you know you're all
going to hell and you're,

1178
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,670
your inner aliens are going
to fuck you up or something.

1179
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,963
The tetons,

1180
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,120
they came up with it.

1181
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,033
You just get like,

1182
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,410
I don't know how someone could
talk you into that stupid shit.

1183
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:22,244
Like I really don't.

1184
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,450
The pimp mentality.

1185
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:23,880
I just,

1186
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,830
I guess I'm not that a convincing of a
speaker to even think that I could do

1187
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:28,664
some shit like that.

1188
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,600
I think you're not a loser and I think
there's a lot of people out there and not

1189
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:36,080
saying that everyone who's a prostitute
or a scientologist is a loser,

1190
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,190
but let's be honest,

1191
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,900
not so much in your favor,

1192
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,280
but the point being,

1193
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:48,430
it's like if you're down and out
and everybody's been down and out,

1194
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,360
there's certain people that
get a different level of
down now than you've ever

1195
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,650
been or I or you.

1196
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,970
That's the reality of it.

1197
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,590
It's not necessarily
that it's their fault,

1198
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:59,380
it's just there's levels of
down and out and some people,

1199
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:03,430
your life is shit from
the moment you're born,

1200
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,170
you're born into a terrible environment.

1201
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,880
Your parents are fucked up.

1202
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,380
Your family life is fucked up.

1203
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,700
There's all sorts of abuse.

1204
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:10,810
There's sexual abuse,

1205
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:11,740
there's violence,

1206
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:12,580
there's chaos,

1207
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:13,420
there's crime,

1208
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,830
there's starvation.

1209
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:17,650
You never know where your food's coming
from and then all of a sudden some dude

1210
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:21,880
comes along and he's given you love and
that is reality and it's not pretty and

1211
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:22,691
people don't like it,

1212
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:23,740
but there's levels.

1213
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,510
There's levels of fucked up.

1214
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,373
You're talking about.

1215
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,150
I'm talking about all of it.

1216
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Scientology and prostitution and moonies
and you know the fill in the blank.

1217
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:34,580
Mormon.

1218
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,300
Well that's the one thing.

1219
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,060
Extreme recruits seem like if you,

1220
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,900
if you get away from you just religion,

1221
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,090
like white supremacists
and recruit that way.

1222
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,283
The downtrodden.

1223
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,270
I mean those documentaries.

1224
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,410
Hbo used to be my favorite
pimps up hoes down.

1225
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,373
No.

1226
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,080
Skinheads USA.

1227
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:48,861
Do you ever see that one?

1228
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:49,820
That's the one where the guy like,

1229
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,780
you know their leader,

1230
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,130
he's like and you know,

1231
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,060
I leave them alone here.

1232
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:56,180
I trust them during the day
when I go work at the tire shop.

1233
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:56,810
You know what I mean?

1234
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,440
You worked on like a used
tire farm or something?

1235
00:34:59,800 --> 00:34:59,980
She would

1236
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,150
happen yesterday in Texas.

1237
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,840
No,

1238
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,100
they had a drama Hammad contest
or draw Mohammed art exhibit.

1239
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,020
So some guys came and started
shooting at them and they,

1240
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,990
they killed these two guys that
were shooting at this drama.

1241
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:15,040
Hammad exhibit.

1242
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,020
Wow.

1243
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,853
Yeah.

1244
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,910
Shooting at people in Texas is like,

1245
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,793
I mean,

1246
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,491
seriously.

1247
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:23,590
That's like jumping in the
water and try to bite a shark.

1248
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,930
It might be one of the dumbest fucking
thing around everyone in Texas is armed

1249
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:29,764
to the tits.

1250
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,630
You can't just be
shooting people in Texas,

1251
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,570
especially at a draw Mohammed exhibit,

1252
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,130
they should just have draw Mohammed
exhibits and then just like guys

1253
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,340
with police surround it and just wait
for somebody to come and it's like a

1254
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:41,970
honeypot,

1255
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,211
you know?

1256
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:42,720
That's like a,

1257
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,040
a trap

1258
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,090
that is a good way to shoot
like really radical extremists.

1259
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,700
But did they think that
they can shoot you?

1260
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,730
Because I see this argued on
twitter all the fucking time.

1261
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:53,750
They should've been provoking them.

1262
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,140
If all they have to do to provoke
you is draw a picture of a guy.

1263
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,850
What?

1264
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,850
What the fuck?

1265
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,310
Like how could anybody beyond there.

1266
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:07,700
So how could anybody ever
formed that argument by saying,

1267
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,680
oh well maybe they shouldn't be parochial.

1268
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,760
They knew what they were doing.

1269
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,320
They're doing that to incite violence.

1270
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,831
No,

1271
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,450
there are drawing.

1272
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,320
That's it.

1273
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,160
That's all it is.

1274
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,720
There's something designed
to piss off there.

1275
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,430
I just don't think of it.

1276
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,960
You don't to get to the point
where they want to kill you.

1277
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,070
Just not nothing,

1278
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,551
nothing.

1279
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,380
Your mother could be
sucking a gorilla's Dick.

1280
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,670
It's not good enough.

1281
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,061
You know,

1282
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:26,281
you,

1283
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:26,470
you,

1284
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,840
you,

1285
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,330
your mothers should be jerking off King
Kong or Godzilla fucks her mouth well

1286
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,790
enough.

1287
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,541
You could draw that.

1288
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,560
No one's going to want to kill you.

1289
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,670
But I believe in the thing.

1290
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:34,881
It's like,

1291
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:35,240
yeah,

1292
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,541
draw.

1293
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:35,961
Mohammed,

1294
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:36,510
who cares?

1295
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,080
I think you shouldn't be shown it.

1296
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,800
We,

1297
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,470
we've already been over the shock
that people will murder for this.

1298
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,304
So it's Kinda like when,

1299
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,550
when that happens,

1300
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,520
know it doesn't blow you away as much.

1301
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,320
I mean if you hear about cops,

1302
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:48,711
you know,

1303
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:49,940
being in things where
they killed a black kid,

1304
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,230
are you blown away anymore?

1305
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,080
We're desensitized to that
story almost at this point.

1306
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,501
Yeah,

1307
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:54,800
I.

1308
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,020
Well I guess we are to a certain extent,

1309
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,860
you know,

1310
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,693
there's definitely,

1311
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,200
we're not as surprised.

1312
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,060
It's still outrageous to people,

1313
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,350
but we're not as surprised,

1314
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,850
you know,

1315
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,290
just the idea that it's somehow
or another excusable in any way,

1316
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,140
shape or form that you would
think about that you think about.

1317
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:12,291
Yeah,

1318
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,090
what they did is definitely ridiculous.

1319
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,290
If you don't want violence,

1320
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,490
it's definitely ridiculous.

1321
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:18,830
But if that's all it
takes to incite violence,

1322
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,600
how the fuck do you in that cycle,

1323
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,850
you just kind of keep perpetuating
that to the end of time.

1324
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:23,631
Is it perfect?

1325
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:24,950
It never needs any evolution.

1326
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,870
You telling the,

1327
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,680
the idea at all that somehow or another
it's offensive to draw someone is so

1328
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:35,390
fucking ridiculous in 2015 that
anybody that defends in any way,

1329
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,580
shape or form even like
peripherally you're,

1330
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,950
you're way off from.

1331
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,950
You've talked to Dave attell,

1332
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:43,010
he'll tell you that the whole world
is like more nervous than ever.

1333
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,401
You know what I mean?

1334
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:44,750
Like people are more offended than ever.

1335
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,620
They are.

1336
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,640
They are more offended than ever.

1337
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,990
It's a weird time for comedy.

1338
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:48,921
You know,

1339
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,211
there's,

1340
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:50,670
there's a lot of shit that
you're not supposed to make you.

1341
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,040
Like people are actually saying.

1342
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,120
I.

1343
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,670
Someone made a joke about Bruce
Jenner and people were saying,

1344
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,120
you know,

1345
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,481
hey man,

1346
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:57,560
it's not cool to make fun of them.

1347
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:57,981
Oh,

1348
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:59,450
it's not the Jamie Foxx.

1349
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,490
And was so like benign.

1350
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,360
It was so benign.

1351
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,330
And then Bill Maher had one too
and everybody was upset at it.

1352
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,850
Listen,

1353
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,100
you,

1354
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,933
you know,

1355
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,360
whatever's wrong with him,

1356
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:12,380
whatever's wrong with Bruce Jenner to
say that you can't make fun of that.

1357
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,620
Like,

1358
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,720
well then everything funny is off base,

1359
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,340
but you got a guy who was an Olympic gold
medalist and now become a woman and he

1360
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,570
still wants to be a he,

1361
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,050
so he still wants you to refer to them
as Bruce until he decides to change that

1362
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,150
he's shooting his lips,

1363
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,740
he's taking hormones that
there's no humor in that.

1364
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,350
Really,

1365
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:28,611
really?

1366
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:29,301
That's perfect.

1367
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:29,720
And by the way,

1368
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,710
beautiful and peaceful.

1369
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,560
Technically it's not too soon either
because he's been wearing panty since like

1370
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,120
[inaudible] 85 or something.

1371
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,531
He said.

1372
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,620
So He's been taking
hormones for two years,

1373
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,220
but he's,

1374
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,690
he took hormones back in
the late eighties also.

1375
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,390
He's done a interview.

1376
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:45,220
He says that this is the second
time he's ever done that.

1377
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:45,520
So.

1378
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:45,910
Oh,

1379
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,480
so he took,

1380
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,530
he started playing the intellect trolls.

1381
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,180
Just take off all the hair on his
face when he was way younger too.

1382
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,893
So yeah.

1383
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,291
Yeah.

1384
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,510
So he went through all
this stuff like way,

1385
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:55,841
way,

1386
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:56,590
way younger.

1387
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:56,891
So yeah.

1388
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:58,340
So it's not even like,

1389
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,233
this is things that,

1390
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,420
I mean people were making jokes about
him without confirmation from him for

1391
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:04,811
years.

1392
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:06,130
Even when that Kardashians show,

1393
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,500
when you're making the same exact
show that people are actually getting,

1394
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:08,880
like,

1395
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,780
like look at this prophecy when you know,

1396
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:10,921
like,

1397
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,370
I don't just to throw a name out there.

1398
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:12,611
It was like,

1399
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:12,761
you know,

1400
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:15,370
like Dave Chappelle made a joke
three years ago about this.

1401
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:15,550
Like,

1402
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:15,731
yeah,

1403
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:19,090
he's looked like a woman
for the past 10 years.

1404
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,350
If someone made a joke about it,

1405
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,910
there was a joke on siren or something.

1406
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,763
The nineties.

1407
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,100
Yeah.

1408
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,490
Yeah,

1409
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,660
about like a thing.

1410
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,160
It was a woman from behind and it's
Bruce Jenner with the opposite thinking.

1411
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,510
It was Bruce Jenner and it's a woman.

1412
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,590
One of those.

1413
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,460
You didn't watch the,

1414
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:33,790
uh,

1415
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,623
interview at all.

1416
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,980
I watch very little of it.

1417
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,440
There were some really some
really great parts in point.

1418
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,310
I can't remember it now.

1419
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:39,910
She tear up.

1420
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,150
Oh,

1421
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,750
this is the.

1422
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,110
No,

1423
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,820
I didn't hear it.

1424
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,380
I thought it was.

1425
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,810
The whole thing was
ridiculous and hilarious.

1426
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,220
You're not supposed to make fun of it,

1427
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,491
right?

1428
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:50,491
Because you're supposed to be open minded
and you're supposed to be supportive

1429
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,770
and kind to someone who's obviously
transitioned through a very,

1430
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,720
very rough and difficult thing that's
all well and good and I'm with that.

1431
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,703
I get that.

1432
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,880
But if you're not homophobic
or transphobic running
that and you really don't

1433
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,520
have any problem with
anybody doing anything,

1434
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,330
they want to do whatever you want to.

1435
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,320
I'll totally accepted.

1436
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,730
I have zero problem with it at all,

1437
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,130
but to tell me it's not funny.

1438
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,200
Please get the fuck Outta here.

1439
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:15,920
You got a guy who's becoming a like.

1440
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,430
There's a guy who's six foot
six who's playing college,

1441
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:19,450
women's basketball.

1442
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,350
He's 50.

1443
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,490
Okay.

1444
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,350
He was a man most of his life.

1445
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,071
Had Children.

1446
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:27,220
Just decided at one point in time that
he wanted to be a woman and then found

1447
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,140
out that because he's now a new sex,

1448
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,150
he can reenter college sports.

1449
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,530
So he played college basketball as a
fucking man back in the day and now he's

1450
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:37,570
playing college basketball as a girl,

1451
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,640
but he's 50 and he's and
he's a giant full exchange,

1452
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,340
full sex change.

1453
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,520
So he's moving around with and then
there's people that are freaking out about

1454
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,800
it and there's people that are saying
you shouldn't make fun of it and you

1455
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:52,801
should just let it be like look to to
say this is not controversial is crazy.

1456
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:59,010
You're a crazy person to say there's
not some controversy in a six foot 6:50

1457
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,560
year old man playing
college sports with girls.

1458
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,723
I mean what?

1459
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,271
Okay,

1460
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,340
now he's a woman so we have
to call them a woman now.

1461
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:06,940
Okay.

1462
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,700
But can we just can see that he was a
man for 40 fucking years and has a Benz

1463
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,780
frame and is enormous.

1464
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,160
Like can we can see that being 50 is
probably a little old to be playing

1465
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,810
basketball against teenagers?

1466
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,081
No,

1467
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,730
because you've got to
protect people's feelings.

1468
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:22,630
We write letters and shit.

1469
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,021
Yeah.

1470
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:26,560
I mean look at the
whole thing is like her.

1471
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,480
Excuse me,

1472
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,380
but he went to Bruce Jenner thing.

1473
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,430
Where I found so interesting is,

1474
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,070
is that I feel like

1475
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,940
by what people would say,

1476
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,370
I'd be judged in my life as like phobic,

1477
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,330
whatever that word means.

1478
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,430
Yet I have no pr.

1479
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,451
I think you should be able to,

1480
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:42,290
whatever you want to do,

1481
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,580
if you want to cut your dick off to get
a pussy made by Dr. get your Dick cut

1482
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,150
off.

1483
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,380
But I don't think I should be judged
because I think that's bonkers.

1484
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,951
You know what I mean?

1485
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:52,731
Like if you want to do it,

1486
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:52,971
do it.

1487
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:53,451
I don't care.

1488
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:54,284
I'm not afraid of it.

1489
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,990
I wouldn't,

1490
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,770
I wouldn't not shake somebody's hand
because they were transgender in any of

1491
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:57,951
that.

1492
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:58,221
Okay.

1493
00:41:58,221 --> 00:41:58,820
But it's like,

1494
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,870
I still think it's like a fucking.

1495
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,540
I think it's a decision that you probably
should have been talked out of by

1496
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,021
somebody.

1497
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,820
So maybe and maybe not.

1498
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:05,061
See.

1499
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm not talking about you dressing like
a woman or being gay or feeling this

1500
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:09,350
thing,

1501
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,183
but

1502
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,590
I've made an argument many times and
I've got into many arguments about this

1503
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,300
because people just jumped
the gun on the words.

1504
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,650
But with gay I'm a,

1505
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,240
you know,

1506
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,580
my friend with me as gay here,

1507
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,720
I've tons of gay friends.

1508
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:26,030
I have no weirdness
with gay people at all,

1509
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,230
but I think it's like a deviate.

1510
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:31,010
It's like something that
went wrong almost like,

1511
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,873
you know,

1512
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,950
to the extent of like
webbed fingers or something,

1513
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,870
but there shouldn't be anything
wrong with it and people should.

1514
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:36,740
We have to do whatever they want to do,

1515
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:37,400
who gives a shit,

1516
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,233
you know what I'm saying at all.

1517
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,201
But to start,

1518
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:42,950
if you're gonna start monitoring your
body to do something where it's like,

1519
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,910
even when it's done,

1520
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,620
like no one's,

1521
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,100
no one's really happy from
the stuff I've read it.

1522
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,260
Read and watched elise
with their new pussy.

1523
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,371
I don't know.

1524
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:53,510
You could say that you have to

1525
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,200
say.

1526
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,033
Right?

1527
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,913
I

1528
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,580
said the stuff that I've
seen and read two things.

1529
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,020
One,

1530
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,340
the,

1531
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,460
the idea that they're all the same,

1532
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,500
like there's levels of,

1533
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,610
of everything you know,

1534
00:43:07,611 --> 00:43:10,640
and there's certain people that want to
be transgender and they still want to

1535
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:11,260
keep the,

1536
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,740
you know,

1537
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,573
which is fine too.

1538
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,710
I think there's some people that have
mental illness and there's some people

1539
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:18,080
that really do feel like they
were born in the wrong body.

1540
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,311
I agree with you.

1541
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:20,230
There's nothing that.

1542
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,910
Why would I?

1543
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,850
I think because I think
it's like a misfire though,

1544
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,630
but this is what I think is very rare
that you can cure something mental with

1545
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:27,440
surgery.

1546
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,610
It's very rare that there's something
that doesn't feel right to you,

1547
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,130
which I guess is a mental thing or the,

1548
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,003
you know,

1549
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,850
how you view yourself and you
could fix that with surgery.

1550
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,860
That gets real strange.

1551
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,240
That gets real strange.

1552
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:44,600
Like as far as like just accepting
who you are and what you are and what,

1553
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,120
what nature is a term.

1554
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,090
I would never want to be the
person to tell someone what to do.

1555
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,731
Like you and I,

1556
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,010
we both covered in tattoos.

1557
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:52,880
You know what?

1558
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,490
If someone came along and
tell us we couldn't do it.

1559
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,340
I love tattoos.

1560
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,720
I think they look bad ass now,

1561
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,590
Joe.

1562
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:58,790
Yeah,

1563
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,900
I heard I heard,

1564
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,480
but it's like I don't give a fuck man,

1565
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,410
do whatever you want to do.

1566
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:06,800
I don't have any problem with
it but I don't know what.

1567
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,780
I don't know what you're feeling.

1568
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,930
So for me to even comment on it in any
way is kinda kind of ridiculous for me to

1569
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,680
assume like I know what's going on,

1570
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:15,951
whether you're,

1571
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:19,610
I know you're crazy or whether I know
that you were actually really born a woman

1572
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:20,510
or whether you know,

1573
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:21,344
fill in the blank,

1574
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,050
a variety of reasons to decide
you're in the wrong gender.

1575
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:25,010
You get might get bored.

1576
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,023
Being a dude,

1577
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,330
you might have a bunch of women around
you that you like more than you like men

1578
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,320
and you wish you were one of them.

1579
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,010
I know a dude who

1580
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,850
for the longest time was
telling my wife he's gay.

1581
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,051
No,

1582
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:34,521
he's okay.

1583
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:34,891
He's okay.

1584
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,281
He's okay.

1585
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:35,641
Boom.

1586
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:36,031
He comes out.

1587
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:36,870
He's like 46.

1588
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,320
This poor bastard like wasted his whole
fucking life pretending that he wasn't

1589
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:41,250
gay and like,

1590
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,091
this dude is gay.

1591
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:42,924
I'm telling you he's gay.

1592
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,400
But he was always around these women.

1593
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:47,670
He would hang around them and
talk with them and be one of them.

1594
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,480
It's like you were,

1595
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,620
there was the energy in the room.

1596
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:53,280
Like there's an energy in the room
if there's a dude and like maybe his

1597
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:54,570
girlfriend or a bunch of their friends,

1598
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:55,231
there's an energy like,

1599
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:57,780
well there's guys here and
he's not going to talk like us,

1600
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,940
but this dude was in the mix.

1601
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,010
He was in the mix with
them about everything.

1602
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,030
Have you seen the new bag,

1603
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,910
like you would do that hand
stuff that girls do you know,

1604
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,200
he would.

1605
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,680
He would move like them man.

1606
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:10,350
And if you had gotten a hold of
that dude and talked him into it,

1607
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,090
he probably would have become a woman.

1608
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,540
Really.

1609
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:13,830
I could.

1610
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,520
I think he could have been hypnotized
him made him become a woman,

1611
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,990
but gay man.

1612
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,440
See,

1613
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,400
that's a weird one.

1614
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,540
I think first of all,

1615
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,920
definitely born that way.

1616
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,640
Definitely.

1617
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,030
I agree.

1618
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,430
I don't necessarily think it's like A.

1619
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,030
I don't think it's a bad thing.

1620
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:28,140
They seem to be enjoying it.

1621
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,560
I think the only way it would be bad
is if there wasn't enough people to

1622
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:32,394
reproduce.

1623
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,750
I think it's just a deviation.

1624
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,710
I think it's a deviation.

1625
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,670
Like some people are tall,

1626
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,660
but the exact thing is Dva,

1627
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,070
but I don't think it's A.

1628
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,740
I don't think it's a negative,

1629
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:41,590
you know,

1630
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,140
it just doesn't seem to be negative.

1631
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,540
The only thing that would be
negative is that they don't have a.

1632
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:45,931
correct.

1633
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:46,251
Hold on.

1634
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:46,640
Fuck.

1635
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,000
There's,

1636
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,850
there's this transgender Webcam room that
on chatter bait where you can look at

1637
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:54,500
transgenders doing webcam stuff.

1638
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,620
You just stumbled upon this and I know.

1639
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:56,980
No,

1640
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,570
I was with this girl that she's like,

1641
00:45:58,571 --> 00:45:59,590
you gotta check this out.

1642
00:45:59,591 --> 00:45:59,981
And I'm like,

1643
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:00,790
I don't want to look at this.

1644
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,121
She's like,

1645
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:03,010
I want to see a good fake vagina.

1646
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,770
And there was this one guy that
was looked like on the top look,

1647
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:06,604
just like Thompson girl,

1648
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,610
like a normal guy and on the bottom he
had a really well done vagina and it was

1649
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,130
deep.

1650
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:12,610
It was deep.

1651
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:17,610
She was jealous because he had like this
humongous vibrator in him and I didn't

1652
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:18,480
know some.

1653
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,360
You are haunting.

1654
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,850
I didn't know it was deep though.

1655
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,160
That's such a weird throughout.

1656
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,350
I've a world right now with that image
of the girl with a giant deep push.

1657
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,323
Robert Dawn,

1658
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,740
I thought that like the fake vagina.

1659
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,430
It wasn't a deep thing I thought
was just like kind of like outer,

1660
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,020
you know,

1661
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,620
you just split a Dick Open.

1662
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:43,530
I always assume it was as deep as long
as your dick was almost like it was as

1663
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:45,470
simple as just pushing the
dickhead like all the way back.

1664
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:47,530
And they do like real surgery now.

1665
00:46:47,531 --> 00:46:48,131
If I remember,

1666
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:50,890
I think they can actually
construct a tube in there.

1667
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,570
I'm sure it's advanced,

1668
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:53,081
but you know,

1669
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:53,840
I've interviewed,

1670
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,570
he was creamy,

1671
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:55,740
he was creamy like.

1672
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:59,030
So what's that cream is that code
has to be like some lube that.

1673
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,173
I mean it has to.

1674
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,920
How much did you watch spirit?

1675
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,950
Do you know that movie
x mocking other words?

1676
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,030
They weren't really robots,

1677
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,873
right?

1678
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:09,680
There's always.

1679
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,630
I've seen fake

1680
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,990
ges before for sure.

1681
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,040
I've seen some fake dongs torn.

1682
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,870
This is one guy.

1683
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:15,200
Every,

1684
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,400
every porn he does,

1685
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:19,340
he keeps his pants on and his fake
Dong just comes through the hole.

1686
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,610
They make them like ridiculously strap.

1687
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,210
It was a fake.

1688
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:23,661
I'm like,

1689
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:25,160
who wants to see this grove?

1690
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,900
Fucking this guy who's a liar.

1691
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,930
I've got a big rubber fake.

1692
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,150
I

1693
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,920
interviewed twice now the uh,

1694
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,560
the transgender chick that dated
Michael Phelps was born like both sexes.

1695
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:38,620
Oh,

1696
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,370
right.

1697
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:39,761
And then,

1698
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:40,020
uh,

1699
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,900
and became a woman.

1700
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,510
She had a lot of surgery but uh,

1701
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,910
but it's not transgendered than just,

1702
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:46,923
she just,

1703
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,520
she just did a porno porno and she
told me to look at the trailer.

1704
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,440
I watched the trailer and it's,

1705
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,280
it's,

1706
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,360
it's odd looking over jumping.

1707
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,550
She has a girl's body,

1708
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:00,640
but it is this available online vagina.

1709
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,493
You watch it right now.

1710
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,010
Okay.

1711
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,843
Pull it up Jimmy.

1712
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,030
As long as it doesn't get on the USTREAM,

1713
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,900
we don't want to get in trouble
and it's called going for the gold.

1714
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,823
But if she.

1715
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,440
Well let me ask you this
because it's so important.

1716
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,693
If she,

1717
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,160
if she was born with both with.

1718
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:15,701
Okay.

1719
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:16,534
Let me ask you,

1720
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,680
if you were born with both,

1721
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,550
would you make a decision?

1722
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,560
I think in this day and age you,

1723
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,370
you'd better,

1724
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,640
you'd be better off being that
one dude that can do it all.

1725
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,130
I mean good light.

1726
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,110
Yeah,

1727
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:29,441
I mean,

1728
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,221
unless you're home with him,

1729
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:30,941
he bit decision.

1730
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,110
Like I think crazy young,

1731
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,810
I think it's like a baby parents.

1732
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,993
Sometimes

1733
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,880
parents will your Dick
awakened gas pump into your

1734
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:49,390
parents would have way too much power to
decide which direction a kid would go.

1735
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,350
In that sense.

1736
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,720
People argue that the same
thing with circumcision.

1737
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,613
Well,

1738
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,000
circumcision circumcise and their dick
got cut off so they transitioned them to

1739
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:58,834
girls.

1740
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,543
Do you know that?

1741
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,940
Yeah,

1742
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,141
they,

1743
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,630
they lost their dick and
like intersex surgery.

1744
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,190
Mistake.

1745
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,660
What am I going to see your face like?

1746
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,590
Am I going to get the seed in
this [inaudible] this is the.

1747
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,550
They're going to show the box.

1748
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,630
Well she looks a lot like a Gal.

1749
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,081
Oh,

1750
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,220
so they have a swimmer?

1751
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,570
Come and meet her through the pool.

1752
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,160
Bam.

1753
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,950
How road.

1754
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,430
Whoa.

1755
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,090
What's that?

1756
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,860
Her whole hand is to say if he's got a
gay man having sex with what he's eating.

1757
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,350
It is.

1758
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:24,641
Okay.

1759
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,080
So is that guy what's going on?

1760
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,243
What's going on?

1761
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,971
What is that?

1762
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:28,420
How do you.

1763
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,530
What is that exactly?

1764
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,600
Like regular sex?

1765
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,031
Yeah.

1766
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:34,900
This totally looks like a man having
sex with a girl that looks like a total

1767
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,734
vagina.

1768
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,230
Like if you didn't enjoy that vagina,

1769
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:39,100
you're just picky.

1770
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,343
Oh wait,

1771
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,610
I thought this was their hermaphrodite.

1772
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:43,663
Okay,

1773
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,120
well we just saw jerk
off on a former male,

1774
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,250
a former male to male female trans.

1775
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,780
The box there,

1776
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,753
they showed it.

1777
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,040
I didn't see it close up.

1778
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,570
It looks like that.

1779
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,360
It's like a box with balls.

1780
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,720
It's a large stitches area.

1781
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:06,490
Above the box.

1782
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,550
Whole area lifts or a far left disturbing.

1783
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,650
It looks like there's
balls inside the lips,

1784
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,120
but again,

1785
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,030
like if you're trapped on a
desert island and you get,

1786
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,090
you get mad at this,

1787
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:17,000
you're a picky fuck.

1788
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,290
I trapped in a hotel lobby to give it.

1789
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,720
I'll give it a whirl.

1790
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,770
Being we're,

1791
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:25,480
we're all,

1792
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,080
you know,

1793
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,010
we're living in a weird
world where there's

1794
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,730
gonna come a time I think if not in our
lives and our grandchildren's lives for

1795
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,800
sure where they're gonna
be able to change your sex.

1796
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,420
Like you're going to be able to simply,

1797
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:35,750
yeah,

1798
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,880
they're just going to give you
some sort of a genetic alteration.

1799
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:38,714
You'll be a woman.

1800
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,900
I don't think that's going to be outside
the realm of possibility within the

1801
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:42,681
next hundred 50,

1802
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:43,514
200 years.

1803
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,750
They're just so they're so close to fixing
so many different things about people

1804
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,310
and then once they fix everything,

1805
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,140
I mean they're never gonna fix everything.

1806
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:54,050
We're always going to have some
diseases and colds and flus and shit,

1807
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,930
but I think they're going to be able to
do some pretty incredible shit to your

1808
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:59,240
body and then they going to get to
a point where people start going,

1809
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:00,074
you know what,

1810
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,120
there's a clinic in Thailand and all you
have to do is pay them $50,000 and you

1811
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:05,450
know,

1812
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,470
you can become a woman,

1813
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,830
like a real woman and you can
turn back if you don't like it.

1814
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,380
And they'll show clients that
every six years they go back.

1815
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:12,651
You know,

1816
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:14,250
I was a man for five years.

1817
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,180
I went,

1818
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,930
I enjoyed a lot of lovely things that
when I was a girl that you appreciate it

1819
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:20,760
more and then it's balanced.

1820
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,830
My perspective being a man for 30 years
and a woman for five than a mannequin,

1821
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,210
I just kind of get it.

1822
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,630
For years I just took off left and right.

1823
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,301
Maybe not.

1824
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,780
Maybe just if you could yoga,

1825
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:32,870
just live as a girl.

1826
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:33,190
That's it.

1827
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,100
Just do girl shit.

1828
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,491
Also,

1829
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,780
the other thing you're
going to have to deal with,

1830
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:37,370
it's like you see the perfect gal.

1831
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:37,631
You know,

1832
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:38,030
you see the fruit,

1833
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,770
perfect Gal walking down the street like
just big ass and thin waist big Jesus

1834
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:43,490
Christ.

1835
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,840
Your jeans just call out,

1836
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:45,260
right?

1837
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,610
Like your DNA just goes,

1838
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,870
oh my God.

1839
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:48,660
Like when,

1840
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,030
if a group of guys were like this,

1841
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:50,930
we're not rude,

1842
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,230
right?

1843
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,100
We're not rude people.

1844
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,530
But if we saw some gal and
she was outside of Ir Range,

1845
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,670
like she was walking down the street,

1846
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:56,281
you know,

1847
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,021
you would probably be like,

1848
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:57,291
dude,

1849
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:57,880
look at this.

1850
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,340
And you go,

1851
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,090
oh my God.

1852
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,610
Nature is amazing and
interesting to look at the poll.

1853
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:02,240
We're all like,

1854
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,950
this is like a sunset or
a fantastic art exhibit.

1855
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:07,191
You know,

1856
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,900
you're watching like nature's art.

1857
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,880
Walk down the street in the
shape of a beautiful girl.

1858
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,081
Well,

1859
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:12,350
what if you could just get that?

1860
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:17,780
Maybe use he just go to a doctor and
then your body straightens up and get

1861
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,470
straighter.

1862
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,651
You know,

1863
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:20,270
if you're a big boxy type Gal,

1864
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:25,271
your body to roll it slips down the ways
your ass pop south flunk your tits pump

1865
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,470
and then everybody looks hot as fuck.

1866
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,630
It's not like sexual
communism to some degree.

1867
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,950
You kind of want to keep it like

1868
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,360
sexual confidence.

1869
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,400
You really do want to keep because
don't you want to keep the elite?

1870
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:41,270
Because there is something.

1871
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,900
What I find interesting about
working about looking at like a,

1872
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,730
like chicks in that capacity at all.

1873
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,730
Is that like a,

1874
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,570
there's some that are
just fucking undeniable.

1875
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,823
Do you know what I mean?

1876
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,330
Girls who I thought were beautiful.

1877
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,400
My buddies like last night was like,

1878
00:52:58,401 --> 00:52:59,930
that's an La six and I'm like,

1879
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,040
I thought she was stunning.

1880
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,030
How about beyonce?

1881
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,440
If you don't think she's hot,

1882
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,100
you're gay,

1883
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,030
you have to be gay.

1884
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,390
If you don't look at beyond saying,

1885
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,310
go Jesus Christ that
what's that fucking song?

1886
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,091
If you like it,

1887
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,360
then you should've put a ring on it.

1888
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,450
Very sexy for sure.

1889
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,100
Oh yeah.

1890
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,683
Look at that.

1891
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,490
There's a lot of girls that are undeniable
that it's like they're attractive and

1892
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,970
pretty bummed about the undeniable
where everyone's like and

1893
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,730
her Prime Jennifer Lopez liable,

1894
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,220
but just go ahead and stuff.

1895
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:33,960
Fuck Salma Hayek and her problem
is just fucking Stein undeniable.

1896
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,250
Kate Upton for a couple of years.

1897
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,110
Undeniable.

1898
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,310
That's it is absolutely true.

1899
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,040
But there's some people that
no one could even argue like,

1900
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:41,461
oh,

1901
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:43,830
their asses too flat or
it's too big or it's too,

1902
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:44,540
you know,

1903
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,150
if you,

1904
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,720
you know,

1905
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,790
what's amazing to me,

1906
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,270
like you,

1907
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:48,120
Nicki Minaj looks,

1908
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,420
you know,

1909
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,540
some people think that's ideal.

1910
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,760
It's people like it's retarded looking,

1911
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:50,911
you know,

1912
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:51,200
it's like,

1913
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,020
it's ridiculous.

1914
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,800
Well the problem with that is
did she always looked like that?

1915
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:57,090
And if she didn't always look like that,

1916
00:53:57,091 --> 00:53:57,930
how's her house that big?

1917
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,180
Am I looking at bags of water?

1918
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,171
Like what am I looking?

1919
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,360
I just saw her on a,

1920
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,450
on snl because I've seen her wear her
ass looks big fat and like good and like

1921
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,021
the porn.

1922
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:07,950
So I guess kind of wig.

1923
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,211
When I saw it last time,

1924
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,260
she literally looks like a,

1925
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,520
like a battle droid,

1926
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,490
just like some kind of like what?

1927
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,580
Just like tank bottoms,

1928
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:18,414
you know what I mean?

1929
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,700
It's like we're in like the nineties.

1930
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,020
We never thought that was hot.

1931
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:24,160
We were like looking at
girls fucking fat ass dude.

1932
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,240
I was just going to bring that.

1933
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:30,000
Not that it was a fast but it wasn't
something that everybody aspires to.

1934
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,540
Like I was driving down the street the
other day and there was like some ad

1935
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,040
about building a better,

1936
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:36,060
but you know,

1937
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:40,170
like they're having classes at the
gym just to build better butts.

1938
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,150
I think it's like a
two and we're for real.

1939
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:45,300
It's built by solid but with out here and
then you see all these girls squatting

1940
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,140
and the back and like,

1941
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,130
oh Jesus Christ.

1942
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:47,970
Like what happened?

1943
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:48,923
What happened?

1944
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,610
Well that's a major shift.

1945
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,760
You know what it was black male culture
kinda dictated a the fashion and style

1946
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,950
and stuff for white dudes for a long time.

1947
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,420
Kind of taking over the style of that.

1948
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,650
And now like finally,

1949
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:05,070
like the black women are now kind of
setting the tone for like the body shape.

1950
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,660
I think it was the depression.

1951
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,270
I think people were so poor and starving.

1952
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,290
They forgot they liked big assets and
then it took a while before they woke up

1953
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,470
and then got through the fifties and
sixties and seventies and eighties.

1954
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:17,790
And then sir mix a lot.

1955
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:20,490
Came along and he had that one
song and everybody was like,

1956
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:21,300
yeah,

1957
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,133
wait a minute,

1958
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,120
why don't,

1959
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,300
why is it so great to me?

1960
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,020
And then you,

1961
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,853
you too,

1962
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,301
what the fuck?

1963
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:28,530
How can we be ignoring this?

1964
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,940
And it's almost like somewhere in there
there's a good research and now it's

1965
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:33,774
everyone.

1966
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,000
You talk to men like what's
the most important thing,

1967
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:36,541
you know?

1968
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:36,750
Uh,

1969
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,160
what's the most attractive
thing to a girl?

1970
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:39,510
Almost every guy says ass.

1971
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,160
Almost every guy is the cola wars cola.

1972
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,530
Warren.

1973
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,280
I'm a face guy of course.

1974
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,000
And you'd face is important phase.

1975
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,220
We'll do a lot also as a guy who
couldn't be picky when I was younger,

1976
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,090
I was a fat dude,

1977
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,890
like face meant a lot,

1978
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:53,911
you know what I mean?

1979
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:54,990
If I could go with a pretty face,

1980
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,430
I can look at it and if she was big like,

1981
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:56,620
you know,

1982
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,750
maybe she'll say yes,

1983
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,370
maybe she'll go back with me.

1984
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:02,970
It really sucks too when you get close
to a girl and then you notice like the

1985
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,320
sunlight shines on her face and like,

1986
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:04,740
oh shit,

1987
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,320
she's got whiskers or oh
she has no chin at all.

1988
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,154
She was like,

1989
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,750
no,

1990
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,290
I'm just saying that's how important
faces because like if it was tits or ass

1991
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:15,840
and tits had this
humongous brown mole on it,

1992
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,943
you'd be like,

1993
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:17,880
it's weird for me to.

1994
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,700
If someone said like tits or ass,

1995
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:22,680
like I over both of those,

1996
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,430
I'd rather see any girl's pussy.

1997
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,500
I don't know why that
means the world to me.

1998
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,251
You're a pervert.

1999
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,140
That's my gas.

2000
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,020
It's not even knowing that
even if it's just like,

2001
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,133
even when she was like,

2002
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:33,610
you know,

2003
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,900
hair like it just a,

2004
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,390
hey,

2005
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,200
I want to see the pubes just a
little bit just to the mountain,

2006
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:39,700
the pubic pubic bone,

2007
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:40,270
the hump.

2008
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,400
When I remember being a teenager,

2009
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:45,760
what bummed me out when girls all started
shaving their heads bald was some girl

2010
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,211
told me.

2011
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:46,730
She goes,

2012
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,020
I go,

2013
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:47,260
I go,

2014
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,071
let me see your pubes.

2015
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:48,461
And she goes,

2016
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:48,671
he goes,

2017
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,720
I shaved my pussy bald.

2018
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:50,501
I go,

2019
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:50,860
really?

2020
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,960
And then she pulled her pants down,

2021
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,550
click the top of her class.

2022
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,900
If you call it pussy slit I guess.

2023
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,563
And Gosh,

2024
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,300
what a good kid.

2025
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,350
It's amazing though,

2026
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,940
how not exciting it was to see
that if there was pussy here,

2027
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:04,390
there you'd be like,

2028
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,630
Oh,

2029
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,800
I'm not supposed to see that.

2030
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:06,800
But when there's nothing there,

2031
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:07,630
know what I mean?

2032
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,010
It takes away like a.

2033
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,520
and maybe it's maybe you know,

2034
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,460
I'm 37 is when I was a kid,

2035
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:13,300
like all porn.

2036
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:14,800
Everything was like pussy hair and if you,

2037
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,900
if you were.

2038
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,520
So maybe that's what I'm
just drawn to in that way,

2039
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,050
but I find it very like,

2040
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:20,330
uh,

2041
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:20,470
it,

2042
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,850
it really takes away.

2043
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:22,391
I mean,

2044
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:25,930
when a girl wears those bikinis where it
just comes like right above where their

2045
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:26,621
pussy starts,

2046
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,480
like you don't feel like you're
seeing anything that weird.

2047
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:28,750
But if,

2048
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,750
but if you saw a girl laying down and
some pubes are coming out the side of her

2049
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,591
bathing suit,

2050
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:36,400
that's actually,

2051
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,160
you feel like you're seeing more than
if you saw all the top of her posts it

2052
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:40,990
album.

2053
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,321
What's that?

2054
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:46,321
Black curly hair or America
does a great album cover.

2055
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,243
Pull that up.

2056
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:48,881
Hustler.

2057
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:50,890
I think that's a great album.

2058
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:53,470
Cover black crows or
the shit that big muff.

2059
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:54,980
I,

2060
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,500
uh,

2061
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:55,791
yeah.

2062
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:56,624
It's weird when you.

2063
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,670
I kind of forgot about pussy hair
and then when you see it you're like,

2064
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,043
you kind of miss it.

2065
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,933
I missed it.

2066
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:05,460
Weird because when were kids
it was like kind of iconic.

2067
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,030
It was like that represented like,

2068
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,600
like they would call it guys,

2069
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,590
we'll call it a beaver,

2070
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,603
you know,

2071
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,340
just a little bit of pubes Pocono number.

2072
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,130
Samantha,

2073
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,310
remember Samantha Fox in the eighties
and then they found out that like over in

2074
00:58:17,311 --> 00:58:20,250
England she did a bunch of like
naked naked pictures and like,

2075
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:20,580
yeah,

2076
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,420
big Bush.

2077
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,070
She was a page six girl,

2078
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,933
like they had that.

2079
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,390
They used to have page six of their
newspaper where they would show tits.

2080
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,060
That's why they were so much more
advanced than us with their art.

2081
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,980
That's why the Beatles and shit came from.

2082
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,680
There was so much more relaxed.

2083
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,310
They would chug debts in the newspaper.

2084
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,900
Relax.

2085
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,750
It's just tense.

2086
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,080
Everybody's so freaked out.

2087
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:44,540
And Harris was more of like an eyelash
for the vagina for periods and stuff.

2088
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:47,320
So when it get everywhere
and that's why girls are,

2089
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,223
that's not what it is.

2090
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,131
The uh,

2091
00:58:49,131 --> 00:58:51,020
the butthole hair was
always disturbing though.

2092
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:51,471
Yeah.

2093
00:58:51,471 --> 00:58:54,590
I don't like nobody ever liked the buddle
here because some girls just did not

2094
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,390
know what they're doing
when Kim to wiping.

2095
00:58:56,391 --> 00:58:59,450
And back then nobody had a bad
day and nobody had baby wipes.

2096
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,470
It was toilet paper.

2097
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,290
Sometimes some of it stuck around

2098
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,340
for a little gig

2099
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,720
super tightly rolled up.

2100
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,740
Did you know those little shit joint?

2101
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,240
Could you know those little notes,

2102
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:20,390
trimmers that you buy you,

2103
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,770
you use that for your asshole also?

2104
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,010
You

2105
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,410
can't.

2106
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,243
Yeah,

2107
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,600
I was unaware of the.

2108
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,521
Well,

2109
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:26,720
it's not rocket science.

2110
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:29,090
It's not like trying to
figure out solar power,

2111
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,030
nose hair trimmers on your eyes.

2112
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,570
It's just if it cuts hair cuts,

2113
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:33,400
hair,

2114
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,160
it just does.

2115
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,690
And it doesn't cut you and stuff.

2116
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,141
Well,

2117
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:40,250
couldn't you get like one of those face
shavers was little nice ones down there

2118
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:40,650
with your ass.

2119
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,060
So you have a shaving your hair.

2120
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:44,240
Oh,

2121
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,680
I just leave my girls.

2122
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,341
You know what though?

2123
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:49,940
You could do a way better job of
cleaning it if your asshole is shaved,

2124
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,060
but your asshole will grow
that hair back like wild Bush.

2125
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,180
And then in a couple of days you'll be
just squeezing your ass cheeks everywhere

2126
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,910
he go to keep from just
digging in there and crushing.

2127
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,440
Just clawing at your asshole like
a wolf trying to bury a Caribou.

2128
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:13,810
Fucking that stubble ball stuff.

2129
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,660
How come my face stubble
barely bothers me.

2130
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:20,330
My head stubble stubble up here right now.

2131
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:20,771
No,

2132
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,010
it doesn't bother me at all.

2133
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,240
But Jesus Christ,

2134
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:24,010
my asshole.

2135
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:24,843
Just

2136
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,460
moving around and your chair when you
wipe your ass and he grabbed like a bundle

2137
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,600
of hair on the way out.

2138
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,010
You know what's the best man?

2139
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:38,060
One Wipe Charlie's.

2140
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:38,661
You ever tried that?

2141
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:39,630
I want them so bad.

2142
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,380
It's like a dude wipe.

2143
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,430
Like that kind of a thing.

2144
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,780
He was a baby wipe.

2145
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,230
They made.

2146
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:45,921
They made for men,

2147
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:47,060
but they don't smell like flowers.

2148
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,920
Like you just got ass
fucked by a flower forest.

2149
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:52,900
Yeah.

2150
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,510
Well I.

2151
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,610
That Japanese thing is the shit man.

2152
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:57,783
Yeah.

2153
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,000
Install one in here.

2154
01:00:59,001 --> 01:00:59,211
Yeah.

2155
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:00,290
I'm going to install it in here.

2156
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:00,900
Eventually.

2157
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,380
Just kind of does it shoot
like high pressure water.

2158
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,130
The shit hanging out for an hour?

2159
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:06,690
Yeah.

2160
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,420
High pressure.

2161
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,091
Wind pressure.

2162
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:08,721
Water.

2163
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:09,890
Warm Air.

2164
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:11,510
It drives your asshole off.

2165
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,930
There's two different speeds to the
water shoots in your asshole totos.

2166
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,210
It also cleans your vagina.

2167
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:19,370
If you're a gal who cleans your vagina,

2168
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,660
you can back your badge up,

2169
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:21,530
get a little tingly,

2170
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:21,981
tingly,

2171
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:25,040
and if you know little time and the.

2172
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,720
You went to joe and said,

2173
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,150
Gal,

2174
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,990
we went to Japan.

2175
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:33,680
I just sat there for a half hour with
the one shooting in my asshole because it

2176
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:38,000
just felt so good because it hit like
the back wall butthole that long.

2177
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:40,910
I'd have to do it to feel
like I was like getting.

2178
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,950
I'm still going to have
to do paper afterwards.

2179
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:43,470
No,

2180
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,303
no.

2181
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,240
You didn't walk out with worried.

2182
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,390
It was so clean.

2183
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,730
It was like taking a
shower for your butthole.

2184
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,743
Pretty meticulous.

2185
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,940
It's not doing as good a job.

2186
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,871
I'm telling you.

2187
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:54,980
You just smearing.

2188
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,120
Even if you use baby wipes,

2189
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,290
you just smearing over your hair.

2190
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:58,701
Okay.

2191
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:02,350
Imagine if I took some shit and I
just rubbed into the top of your head.

2192
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:02,690
You're like,

2193
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,141
I'm good.

2194
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:04,130
I got a baby wipe,

2195
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,700
but if I had never accept that,

2196
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,810
if I get in the shower and you
would clean your asshole here,

2197
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,770
fair enough.

2198
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,083
But if he.

2199
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:17,900
You told me I had 70 baby wipes
and a roll of toilet paper.

2200
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,520
I'd take a shower.

2201
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,773
Jesus Christ,

2202
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,140
this fork and shit all day too.

2203
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:27,931
Don't worry about it.

2204
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:30,150
I rubbed it with 70 baby wipes.

2205
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:30,760
I be like,

2206
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,540
oh,

2207
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,400
that's not enough.

2208
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:33,870
You've got to watch this fucking thing.

2209
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,330
You've got to get it
in the washing machine.

2210
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,260
I didn't these hot water and Sun,

2211
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,120
but again,

2212
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,530
let's say baby wipes and vapor,

2213
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,830
just trying to get my method approved.

2214
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:44,840
It's still shit.

2215
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,160
You'd pick shower after the shower,

2216
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,130
but I also before and fairness.

2217
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,271
Yeah.

2218
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:51,900
I mean I don't do anything.

2219
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,490
I don't go out for the day though until
I shower after I stand up or to wipe or

2220
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,324
sit down,

2221
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,330
stand up,

2222
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,820
sitting on even a possibility.

2223
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,780
Fuck wipes or asked.

2224
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:01,351
Sitting down.

2225
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:02,700
You must have really shitty cuffs.

2226
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,180
I know.

2227
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:03,940
What are your cuffs?

2228
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:04,580
I don't do it.

2229
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,070
He does.

2230
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,180
I wanted you to do a second minute.

2231
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:06,961
I stand up.

2232
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:07,680
Find a target.

2233
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,461
Not going to stand up.

2234
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:09,294
Stand up.

2235
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:09,950
Stand up.

2236
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,250
I know there's people.

2237
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,290
Most people sit in

2238
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,880
their sleeves.

2239
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,980
Smeller watch.

2240
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:17,893
Guaranteed

2241
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,353
is that.

2242
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,281
One of my buddies told me,

2243
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:24,340
he goes from the front,

2244
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,510
reaching between his

2245
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:27,541
smell,

2246
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:28,374
his balls.

2247
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,233
I can.

2248
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,673
You don't.

2249
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,513
He's going to have.

2250
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,053
Damn.

2251
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,380
It is a very specific protocol.

2252
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,870
I imagine when people smelled like when
they hadn't figured out wiping and then

2253
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:43,320
someone finally figured out how to just
kind of clean the area off a little bit

2254
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:43,950
and everybody's like,

2255
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,280
Oh yeah,

2256
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:45,631
why don't we.

2257
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,880
Why don't you just be covered
with shit all the time.

2258
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:50,880
When they used to do this poll
on when it had red band.com,

2259
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:52,110
I did this point and I did.

2260
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:52,861
Who stands up?

2261
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,260
Who sits down and it
was almost 50 slash 50,

2262
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,810
don't have red band dot Com forwards now.

2263
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:58,723
Oh,

2264
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,431
but yeah,

2265
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:02,130
it was 50 slash 50 like I know all these.

2266
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:03,040
It's like the dress,

2267
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,830
the stupid dress take into accounts.

2268
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,250
Fifty percent of the people
that were going to your website.

2269
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,880
It's a small savages is weird.

2270
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:15,421
Yeah,

2271
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:15,901
it's very weird.

2272
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:17,940
You're not going to do a good job already.

2273
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,860
Sits in wipes and you can see it
in Juke lamb because he was right.

2274
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:21,743
It's documented.

2275
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,040
Well.

2276
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,760
He should have.

2277
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,760
If ever there was a fair where there
was a like a billboard for stand up and

2278
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:29,740
wipe your ass just

2279
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,810
because something's wrong with it.

2280
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,170
Especially that one.

2281
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,090
That video is so ridiculous.

2282
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,020
Already had like a homer
Simpson's mouth asshole.

2283
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,300
I watched it the other day.

2284
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,540
It's still in lively.

2285
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,643
The uncensored.

2286
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,770
Everyone in Washta.

2287
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:47,241
Well,

2288
01:04:47,241 --> 01:04:47,610
we had a,

2289
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,970
we had a whole episode of
my podcast Legion scanning,

2290
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:51,421
so I do it.

2291
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:54,180
And he came in and one
of our buddies said that,

2292
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,014
uh,

2293
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:56,640
one of,

2294
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,240
uh,

2295
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,810
one of our buddies that
he had a hemorrhoid and he
showed everyone is asshole

2296
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:01,950
already said,

2297
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:02,783
uh Oh.

2298
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,020
He said that he was like,

2299
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,280
do hold his asshole against lew Lewis.

2300
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,530
And I mean that's what blew everyone.

2301
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:10,940
I mean it was like uncommon.

2302
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,390
I told them that I was worried
about how something's wrong.

2303
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,090
I'm months threat.

2304
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,251
Oh yeah.

2305
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:18,520
No,

2306
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,630
it's going away,

2307
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:19,910
man.

2308
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,090
That's red is going to
have flare ups like that.

2309
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,380
He's still alive.

2310
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:23,921
He never killed.

2311
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,780
Did you claim so really?

2312
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,220
And he still has the skittle balls.

2313
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,040
Like I swear to God if someone
was going to but fuck already,

2314
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,200
I feel like you could pull
Ari's asshole up there.

2315
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:32,471
Dick.

2316
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,304
Like a sock.

2317
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,143
Well he's in.

2318
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,770
He's in Thailand right now.

2319
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,010
He's probably getting his asshole

2320
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,980
brody Stevens special police.

2321
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,660
Oh my God,

2322
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,250
that's ridiculous.

2323
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,170
Oh my God,

2324
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:47,920
why?

2325
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,060
What's wrong with that poor boy?

2326
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,253
Cause he put,

2327
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,281
wiping dry,

2328
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:51,671
wiping,

2329
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:52,450
I guess.

2330
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,400
Aggressive driveway.

2331
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,660
I mean I couldn't picture what
else would make that happen.

2332
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,880
We were all asked doctors.

2333
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:01,610
All of a sudden I remember
I reminded him Procta,

2334
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,220
remember that night that happened?

2335
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,570
I sent A.

2336
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:09,570
I sent Duncan trussell a screenshot and
then he calls me back and what the hell

2337
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,670
is he got?

2338
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,720
He got pink sock.

2339
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,310
I didn't even know what a pink sock was,

2340
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,870
but that's what it looked like.

2341
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,100
He got turned out.

2342
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,503
Yeah,

2343
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:21,490
he's got a prolapse prolapse.

2344
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:22,483
Good.

2345
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,680
Oh God.

2346
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:25,960
Jesus Christ.

2347
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,850
Skittle balls.

2348
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,480
I can't believe we were at the
comedy and Magic Club and we're like,

2349
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:31,651
all right.

2350
01:06:31,651 --> 01:06:32,081
All right.

2351
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:33,100
Show us your butthole.

2352
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:33,491
All right,

2353
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:37,030
now show us your boss and his boss
had all those little balls in it.

2354
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,530
There's little tiny skittles.

2355
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,510
No,

2356
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,800
that was at the comedy magic club

2357
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,280
already do stunts.

2358
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,110
Like a fucking autistic kid shows
your button at the end of the,

2359
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,890
at the end of the Juke clam.

2360
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:52,540
It's like six months later and you go,

2361
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,830
let's take a look back,

2362
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,713
or let's see what is,

2363
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,080
but what it looks like now,

2364
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,890
and we're in the comedy and
magic club and then with or no,

2365
01:06:58,980 --> 01:06:59,710
this was weird.

2366
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,400
Penny had skittles attached to his boss.

2367
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,360
His boss were really like,

2368
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,761
like they,

2369
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:06,550
they looked like they had egg sacks and
them or something like tons of little

2370
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,540
malls wrong with them.

2371
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,060
Yeah.

2372
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:08,820
But again,

2373
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,790
it ends with you going,

2374
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,670
what the fuck's wrong with your balls?

2375
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:15,280
I blocked that out like
a child molestation

2376
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:23,800
comics that we liked to show each other
our Cox and show each other assholes.

2377
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,710
I've seen when it comes
to like my friend's Dicks,

2378
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,270
I've seen so many of my friends,

2379
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:31,360
dicks like Chili de is used to pull his
dick out all the time and it would be

2380
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,070
hilarious.

2381
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,530
You know,

2382
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,660
Dunkin's pulled his dick out.

2383
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,080
I've never seen dog Duncan that voice.

2384
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,680
It's because you want to cross
all the lines that you can,

2385
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:43,810
that you can cross bike possibly,

2386
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:44,320
right?

2387
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,130
Like you could.

2388
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,350
I mean like I've got some weird ones,

2389
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:51,250
red balls out for like almost an
entire episode of Opie and Anthony.

2390
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,880
We gave this gal stocker patty.

2391
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,550
We gave her a fake breast trip,

2392
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,250
was just a regular listerine breath
strip and we told her that it was a

2393
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:02,230
psychedelic drug and she took it.

2394
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:05,590
We told that she's tripping
their balls off and so she,

2395
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:09,400
she's there and he pulls the sack out
and we pretend like we don't notice it.

2396
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,151
And she's like,

2397
01:08:10,151 --> 01:08:11,140
oh my God,

2398
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:12,810
his balls around.

2399
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:14,920
What are we,

2400
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,770
what are you talking about?

2401
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,480
Slow for this whole episode.

2402
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,350
We're pretending that red bar and she
is talking about how bad she's tripping

2403
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,250
about.

2404
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:22,550
Oh,

2405
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:23,331
she can't believe.

2406
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:26,840
Like it was complete power of
suggestion and placebo effect.

2407
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:28,730
Like she was tripping her balls off.

2408
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:30,020
Did you ever show your Dick and balls?

2409
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:31,220
Does anyone at the store early,

2410
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,263
early days?

2411
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:32,690
I don't know.

2412
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,650
Bobby Lee's another one.

2413
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,790
I've seen many pictures of bobby
tucked like a woman every day.

2414
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:41,170
His pants in the bar
area of the comedy store.

2415
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,670
I've only,

2416
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:46,040
I've only met bobby like four or five
times and I've seen his dick and I asked a

2417
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:46,581
couple times.

2418
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,750
I think Jamie only shows me as Joe.

2419
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:51,360
He's just always Kinda Tago not.

2420
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,230
I don't know guys with real big pieces.

2421
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,450
We'll pull them out pretty quick too.

2422
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,990
That's not true because
I've never done it.

2423
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,090
I was going with the fact
that I've never done it.

2424
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,580
I definitely can't say
I haven't shown someone.

2425
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:05,200
My Dick.

2426
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,160
Kevin pulled it out for whatever reason.

2427
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,570
I definitely have done it at least once,

2428
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,310
but it's not a mainstay.

2429
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,211
Like for Joey,

2430
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:12,650
for years it was a mainstay.

2431
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,890
Joey would have his pants
because you know Joe,

2432
01:09:14,891 --> 01:09:16,400
he doesn't really find belts at work.

2433
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,030
He doesn't find pants that fit
and so he's always an state.

2434
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,650
Always.

2435
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,670
We can just shake and his pants will drop

2436
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,740
his balls and Dick or just
hanging out in front of everybody.

2437
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:28,850
Joey did that.

2438
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,320
I don't know how many times I got a
picture of him carrying a waitress on his

2439
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:37,280
shoulder and his pants are down by his
knees and his balls and his dick is

2440
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:40,490
hanging out and he's in the back
parking lot area of the comedy store.

2441
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,570
And by the way,

2442
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,390
this was back when Joey had zero career.

2443
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,750
Joey gave no fucks even
when he was starving.

2444
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,471
Okay.

2445
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:51,050
Joey Diaz has been Joey
Diaz since the jump,

2446
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,880
like he's always been a madman.

2447
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:56,030
Like before he was killed on
the road and making great money.

2448
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,470
He didn't give a fuck.

2449
01:09:57,471 --> 01:10:00,060
Even back then it was barely
getting by trying to hustle,

2450
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,040
get gigs together,

2451
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,990
but he is always been like,

2452
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:07,640
that's like he's the flag bearer for
not giving a fuck on the west coast.

2453
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,170
You say you don't give a fuck,

2454
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,180
but you joey Diaz not give a fuck.

2455
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,830
That was always the flag bearer.

2456
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,330
He was always the standard,

2457
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:14,961
isn't it?

2458
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,970
Where the girls don't just
show their pussies more often,

2459
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,700
like they don't just get a check
up my pussy just like guys did.

2460
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,820
There's a couple of limits it.

2461
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,070
But how far that's come is way different.

2462
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,933
Like fast,

2463
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,130
average girls will pull them pussies out.

2464
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:29,090
It's pretty crazy.

2465
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,421
Well,

2466
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:32,000
I think there's a lot of competition now
too with all this tinder and all these

2467
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:35,450
different match.com and all these
different dating sites and shit.

2468
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,400
People are just getting
laid left and right.

2469
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,500
Like you get left out in the
cold if you try to hold back.

2470
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,360
I mean that,

2471
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,270
that fucking.

2472
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:42,340
What's that?

2473
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,160
The website's about Madison.

2474
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:45,440
Yeah,

2475
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:45,930
yeah,

2476
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:46,381
yeah.

2477
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:49,180
There's websites where it's like two
people to cheat to fuck you and imagined

2478
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:54,181
dating a girl that her job was like a
secretary to work for Ashley Madison.

2479
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,293
Never trusted her.

2480
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,060
I trusted nobody.

2481
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:00,230
You couldn't trust her.

2482
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:02,100
No one would trust things are great.

2483
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,010
It's hilarious.

2484
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:04,221
I mean,

2485
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:04,960
what a great idea.

2486
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,630
Make a website that helps people
cheat and what so smaller than their

2487
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:09,351
commercials too.

2488
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:13,130
They have it be a girl getting
caught by her husband using Ashley

2489
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
and then he goes,

2490
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:15,511
she's like,

2491
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:15,691
you know,

2492
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:16,860
I don't want to be celibate anymore.

2493
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:17,540
And he goes,

2494
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,660
I understand.

2495
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:19,560
He's like,

2496
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:19,801
she goes,

2497
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,011
you know,

2498
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,420
maybe you should try it too.

2499
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,680
Like you know exactly what you should.

2500
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,583
You should both just,

2501
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,410
it's probably not how it goes.

2502
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:26,820
It's going to gun's gonna come out,

2503
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:27,661
shots fired,

2504
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:28,494
cops show up.

2505
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,640
No one wants to go in the house.

2506
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:30,451
Domestic violence.

2507
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:32,700
Always this scary things
for police officers.

2508
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,050
And when we think on the computer,

2509
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,770
Ashley Madison come

2510
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,000
shooting back and forth.

2511
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,820
Ashley Madison,

2512
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:46,320
this is what we do.

2513
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:47,821
It's crazy,

2514
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:48,654
man.

2515
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:52,380
Five percent spike from women
on the day after mother's Day.

2516
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,190
Whoa.

2517
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,540
Well that's what they're saying.

2518
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,980
According to its data.

2519
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,173
Come on.

2520
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,150
Forty two percent increase in sign.

2521
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:00,984
That's what we expect.

2522
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:01,561
Come on.

2523
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:02,840
Where's your fucking data bits?

2524
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,381
Ashley Madison.

2525
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:05,214
Math.

2526
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,620
Different system is a fluff piece.

2527
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,191
You know,

2528
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,000
this ain't no.

2529
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,240
Scientists are doing studies on whether
Ashley Madison gonna Experience an

2530
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,380
uptake in business.

2531
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,690
They did that to make
people pay attention to.

2532
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,510
I'm not on my.

2533
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,220
I've never done tinder.

2534
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,180
Really?

2535
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,990
You don't need to use sexy
bitch will not my girl,

2536
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:25,920
my growing and Dick and tell them jokes.

2537
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:26,820
My girlfriend,

2538
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:27,654
uh,

2539
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,400
she's,

2540
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,270
she's on thrinder where you try,

2541
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,470
but that doesn't work ever.

2542
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,720
Will you become friends with.

2543
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,110
No,

2544
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,220
no,

2545
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:33,391
no.

2546
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,680
She's on thrinder where you like.

2547
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:35,900
It's trying to find threesomes,

2548
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:36,743
like fun girl.

2549
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,560
Yeah,

2550
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,170
but I don't know.

2551
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:39,270
It hasn't worked yet.

2552
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,780
I mean we've been a couple of weeks ago.

2553
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,330
You need cocaine for that.

2554
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,020
Yeah.

2555
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,410
That's the only way that we pulled it off

2556
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,880
start fires before they
figured out lighters.

2557
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:51,471
You're absolutely right.

2558
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:54,780
It wasn't so good sitting there
with some fucking moss and a stick.

2559
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,150
You're absolutely right.

2560
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:01,020
I guess calc without helps for sure.

2561
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,281
Yeah.

2562
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:01,640
That's.

2563
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,630
That's if he tried to get
her to post strippers,

2564
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:04,441
they're already cooked up.

2565
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:05,340
You don't have to worry about it.

2566
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,090
Look at you.

2567
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,811
You're thinking ahead.

2568
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:07,644
I love it.

2569
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:08,880
I love it.

2570
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,470
Just go to strip clubs.

2571
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:11,400
I mean,

2572
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,830
don't you feel like going with the Strip
club once it was her first time and she

2573
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:14,581
did pull a stripper.

2574
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,414
She was great.

2575
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,070
Some guys feel,

2576
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,000
at least that are comics
that like the lifestyle,

2577
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,270
so ridiculous.

2578
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,730
You're in a nightclub every fucking night.

2579
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,590
You're drinking all the time.

2580
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,150
You're smoking pot.

2581
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,590
If anybody's got mushrooms,

2582
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:30,200
you're going to do those to you're.

2583
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,780
You're eating at 3:00 in the morning,

2584
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:33,360
you're getting up whenever
the fuck you want to.

2585
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:34,740
You're hanging out with hilarious,

2586
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:37,860
ridiculous people that want to get
high and go to the movies at one in the

2587
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:38,641
afternoon and you're like,

2588
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:39,061
fuck it,

2589
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:39,894
let's do it,

2590
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,010
and you're laughing all the time.

2591
01:13:41,011 --> 01:13:41,844
You go down the road,

2592
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,880
hanging out and going
from airport to rental,

2593
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:45,840
car to hotel,

2594
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,820
all the cracking jokes like this.

2595
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:50,380
Very few people that can
relate to that kind of DEBACA.

2596
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,840
Most people are so tied down to some
crazy nine to five corporate life,

2597
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,340
job life,

2598
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,240
business life.

2599
01:13:57,241 --> 01:13:57,361
Well,

2600
01:13:57,361 --> 01:14:00,720
you've got to fucking pretend to
be somebody for eight hours a day,

2601
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:01,531
can't be loose.

2602
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:06,060
He can't be free and everybody's trying
to conform to that in there after work

2603
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:06,830
life too.

2604
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:11,830
Everybody's like this weird fucking
father knows best type clone figure

2605
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,111
of what a,

2606
01:14:13,111 --> 01:14:15,280
an adult and a family is.

2607
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,890
And comics were out there
living in this weird,

2608
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,450
chaotic life.

2609
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:19,950
But I've,

2610
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:20,190
I've,

2611
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,880
I've actually very young,

2612
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,820
had the really balanced
both those worlds and I did,

2613
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:25,120
you know,

2614
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,170
it was not the right thing to do.

2615
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,010
I guess in many ways,

2616
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:27,880
and it was done poorly,

2617
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,460
but when I got right
to the point in comedy,

2618
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:31,540
it was about like 23.

2619
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:32,560
I've been doing it for like three,

2620
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:36,450
four years and I was in a world where
now I was like going on the road and like

2621
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:40,000
if I was opening for a towel or patrice
and getting pussy and stuff like that

2622
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:41,070
and kind of living that lifestyle.

2623
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,500
I also was married with a baby doll,

2624
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:44,861
you know what I mean?

2625
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:47,170
Like my daughter is 12 now I'm 30,

2626
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:47,710
so you know what I mean?

2627
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:48,940
So almost 13.

2628
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,560
So it's like,

2629
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,760
it is weird.

2630
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,530
I did it to do both those worlds.

2631
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:53,790
So you know,

2632
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,220
I was picking up from school
every day and then you know,

2633
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,710
two weeks later I'm in Rhode
Island with my buddies and there's,

2634
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,040
you know,

2635
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,120
some fat girls blowing
everybody and shared,

2636
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:02,590
you know what I mean?

2637
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,251
Just like weird shit.

2638
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:04,031
Like you know what I'm saying?

2639
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:09,030
Like just like it was very weird to
straddle those worlds because you also try

2640
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:13,960
to instill morals and class and to
somebody while you're just like anything.

2641
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:14,351
And it was,

2642
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:16,900
I mean I did just like sexual stuff,

2643
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:17,710
especially man,

2644
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,150
like so much stuff just for like girls.

2645
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:20,240
I wasn't even attracted to anything.

2646
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:20,621
I'm just like,

2647
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,540
well she will blow me and you know,

2648
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,050
I have an opener with me and she'll
suck his dick to and whatever,

2649
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:26,301
you know,

2650
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:29,830
like just insane behavior
that most people,

2651
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,870
the average guy,

2652
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:32,900
even in the world of like,

2653
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,813
you know,

2654
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:37,390
sexual looseness that we're in kind
of now with that stuff with all social

2655
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:37,601
media,

2656
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:41,620
like not a ton of guys
have had threesomes with.

2657
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:45,460
It's even one of their two buddy's
fucking a girl or two girls at once,

2658
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:48,100
let alone some of the shit.

2659
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,280
Someone way better
looking than me has not.

2660
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,400
I've done a lot more stuff.

2661
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,373
They don't have the time.

2662
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,060
Most people going from college,

2663
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,880
whatever sexy you can get in
college and then you know,

2664
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:58,770
you're working all the time
trying to get your degree.

2665
01:15:58,771 --> 01:15:59,401
Then you get a degree,

2666
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:00,061
get a job.

2667
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:00,811
You did get in the job,

2668
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:01,621
you're working overtime,

2669
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:02,640
you're always exhausted.

2670
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,180
Like where's the time for threesomes?

2671
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,430
Where you fit in your coke time.

2672
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:05,911
You know,

2673
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:06,420
all that stuff.

2674
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,710
That's what I was gonna say is I like
a lot of comics relate to strippers

2675
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,210
because strippers are also live in this
crazy sort of de Bockarie filled life as

2676
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:15,780
well.

2677
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:15,991
You know,

2678
01:16:15,991 --> 01:16:17,910
they're making way more
money than the average girl.

2679
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:19,170
They're dancing on Paul's there,

2680
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,390
partying with friends there.

2681
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,460
They're totally irresponsible and they're
fun to hang around with because they

2682
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:27,480
don't judge you for being a fuck up
as much as say a gal who's a lawyer,

2683
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:27,901
you know,

2684
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:30,200
when you're a loser comic and you're,

2685
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:32,410
you're dating a girl
who is a lawyer as well.

2686
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,690
My daughter's mother's a lawyer.

2687
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,820
It is,

2688
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,540
it's pretty funny.

2689
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:37,220
Hilarious.

2690
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,370
So she went to school.

2691
01:16:38,371 --> 01:16:39,300
She did the whole thing.

2692
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:40,260
She did the hard work.

2693
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:42,030
She got her law degree.

2694
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,080
She took the bar.

2695
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:44,280
I mean fuck man.

2696
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:45,960
Yeah,

2697
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,580
like no shit.

2698
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:46,880
And,

2699
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,713
and,

2700
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,630
and I tried in years past to Kinda like,

2701
01:16:51,631 --> 01:16:54,950
there'd be these flickers where I try
to like bring her into the debauchery,

2702
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,380
you know what I mean?

2703
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:55,531
Like,

2704
01:16:55,531 --> 01:16:55,741
Hey,

2705
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:57,450
we should do some of
this weird shit together.

2706
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,520
And she would.

2707
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,510
But I felt like I was corrupting
a square to kind of wanting to be.

2708
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,290
You know what I mean?

2709
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,160
That she's a square.

2710
01:17:05,161 --> 01:17:06,240
I don't want to present like that,

2711
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:07,650
but it's just like I felt like I was like,

2712
01:17:07,651 --> 01:17:08,070
this is.

2713
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,070
You wouldn't be involved
in kind of creepy shit

2714
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,110
if it wasn't for me.

2715
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,870
This isn't where you want to.

2716
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,420
I this.

2717
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,010
There's nothing wrong
with the term square,

2718
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,140
but I agree with you.

2719
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,760
There's nothing wrong
with being a square to.

2720
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:20,160
Right?

2721
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:20,450
No.

2722
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,500
Like if that's what you're into.

2723
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,230
Like there's a lot of people
that just feel like going home,

2724
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,010
having tea and reading a book like
that is a nice night for them.

2725
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,083
They could.

2726
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,030
Why not?

2727
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,350
If it brings in genuine joy,

2728
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,240
why does it?

2729
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,230
Why do you have to go to a rave?

2730
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:33,591
You know?

2731
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:34,210
Why?

2732
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:34,500
Why do?

2733
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,460
Why do you have to go on
thrinder mother lost soul.

2734
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,620
Take this dance for lost souls.

2735
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,420
Asian lost souls.

2736
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,430
I mean every we just do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

2737
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,290
The more people will get over that.

2738
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,000
I think that's one of
the things that I really,

2739
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:52,970
truly have hoped for with
this new generation of kids.

2740
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,721
All these people,

2741
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:54,554
I think growing up,

2742
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,571
excuse me,

2743
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:57,530
growing up with the Internet,

2744
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:01,370
I think they're just going to have a
totally different acceptance of people

2745
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:02,204
being different.

2746
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,090
I just think that we
grew up in a weird time,

2747
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:05,660
man.

2748
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,350
We grew up.

2749
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,090
I mean I'm 10 years older than you,

2750
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,480
so I grew up mostly kind
of in the early eighties,

2751
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:11,740
you know,

2752
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,870
I went to school in [inaudible] 81
was my first year of high school,

2753
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:19,910
so I think that we just grew up in a
time where we were just guessing nobody,

2754
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,180
nobody kind of knew how many people
were out there that were filled with the

2755
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:24,200
same amount of angst.

2756
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:28,070
You kind of guessed by the movies that
we all gravitated towards or you guessed

2757
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:32,400
by the songs that we all listen to
fucking coffee with butter in it too.

2758
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,320
I might have to stop,

2759
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,600
might have to go straight
black heel back to starbucks.

2760
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,130
I'm not going back to starbucks,

2761
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:38,480
caveman coffee all the way.

2762
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,410
But uh,

2763
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,950
the butter man is not good pre
podcast for the phlegm production.

2764
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,020
So the point is we didn't know,

2765
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:45,500
man.

2766
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,400
Everybody knows.

2767
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:47,234
Now you know,

2768
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,310
like if you're like transgender
is a perfect example.

2769
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:50,840
We're talking about like
people that feel they were.

2770
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,580
If you were a fucking kid and you were
growing up in 1984 and you were a woman

2771
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:56,750
trapped in a man's body,

2772
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,300
you had no fucking friends.

2773
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:00,500
You had no recourse.

2774
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:02,930
Good luck trying to find out
other people just like you.

2775
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:06,410
What are you going to join
some club somewhere that
harbors them where they have

2776
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:08,090
to come out and admit
they're part of this.

2777
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:09,380
No Manal you go online,

2778
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,540
you could find a whole
community of people.

2779
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,050
Sure.

2780
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,700
For anything,

2781
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,680
for anything you say.

2782
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,171
But even like,

2783
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:15,501
you know,

2784
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,460
there's communities of fucking
pedophiles that the final chapter,

2785
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,520
which is horrible.

2786
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,720
That is horrible man.

2787
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:21,081
And that's,

2788
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:21,914
that's a real,

2789
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,940
that's a real issue.

2790
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:23,360
You know,

2791
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,580
that was one of those
was that fucking piece.

2792
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:30,581
There's a big expo is a piece about this
guy and his boyfriend who raised their

2793
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,500
son to be like a sex slave.

2794
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,730
They were bringing his son
to all these other grown men.

2795
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:38,541
I forget.

2796
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:39,470
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2797
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:39,771
Jamie?

2798
01:19:39,771 --> 01:19:42,010
Have you seen this guy,

2799
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,710
you know,

2800
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,480
I don't even want to talk about
because it's so disturbing.

2801
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:44,970
But it was,

2802
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:45,360
it was a,

2803
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,140
it was a crazy expos
where they followed these,

2804
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:48,890
uh,

2805
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:52,820
these guys for a while and they suspected
it and apparently they had kept this

2806
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:57,821
very close knit relationship with all
these rich pedophiles over the world and

2807
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:01,670
they brought their son all around them
and he was really young boy and they were

2808
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:05,090
using him as this sex slave
and they had figured it out.

2809
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:05,811
Somehow or another,

2810
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:08,790
they figured out how to crack
group of tight lipped people.

2811
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:12,810
Eventually someone email slipped out or
something and they figured it out and

2812
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:15,040
eventually brought these
guys to put this poor kid.

2813
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:15,331
I mean,

2814
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:15,991
what the fuck,

2815
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,410
man,

2816
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,550
these are the people that love you,

2817
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,870
your parents and your being paraded
around with them like you're the perfect

2818
01:20:21,871 --> 01:20:25,920
family and meanwhile you're bringing this
kid around to all these pedophiles and

2819
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:28,590
they're fucking sociopath or psychopath.

2820
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,690
I think that's both right.

2821
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:30,991
I mean,

2822
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:35,040
that's a sociopath in that you have no
empathy and a psychopath and that you're

2823
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:35,940
doing damage,

2824
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:36,241
right?

2825
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:36,761
Is that what?

2826
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:39,330
So what is the difference
between sociopath say that?

2827
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:43,920
Although path can feel
emotion final right now,

2828
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,330
psychopath does feel motion.

2829
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:45,690
Really.

2830
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,610
It's like a flashlight that can do chores

2831
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,780
is a horribly fantastic way to put it.

2832
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,270
It's like a room but with a butthole.

2833
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,201
Okay.

2834
01:20:58,201 --> 01:21:02,460
Here's the difference between a
psychopath and associate path for.

2835
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:03,383
Okay.

2836
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,381
Let's see.

2837
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:09,381
This society has conspired with Hollywood
to seemingly sexy psychological terms,

2838
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,010
door collective consciousness,

2839
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:12,180
psychopath and sociopath.

2840
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:17,181
Psychopath and sociopath
are pop psychology terms
for what psychiatry calls an

2841
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:19,440
antisocial personality disorder.

2842
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,011
Today,

2843
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:23,880
these two terms are not really well
defined in the psychology research

2844
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:24,690
literature.

2845
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,261
Nonetheless,

2846
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:28,230
there are some general differences
between the two types of personality types

2847
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,570
which will look in this article.

2848
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:34,530
Both types of personalities have pervasive
pattern of disregard for the safety

2849
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,730
and rights of others.

2850
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:40,200
Deceit and manipulation are
central features to both
types of personalities and

2851
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,460
contrary to popular belief,

2852
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:45,090
a psychopath or sociopath
is not necessarily violent.

2853
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:46,973
Okay,

2854
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,170
so psychopath and sociopath,

2855
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:50,970
they share a diagnosis.

2856
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,690
There's a antisocial personality as
someone who has three or more of the

2857
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:55,710
following traits,

2858
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,370
regularly breaks were flaunt the law.

2859
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:01,980
Big Jay Oakerson constantly
lies and deceives others.

2860
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,220
Brian Red Band is impulsive
and doesn't plan ahead.

2861
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:08,550
Joe Rogan can be prone to
fighting and aggressiveness.

2862
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:12,630
Joe Rogan has a little regard
for the safety of others.

2863
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,650
Brian red band,

2864
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,760
irresponsible,

2865
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,590
can't meet financial obligations.

2866
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,060
Doesn't feel remorse or guilt.

2867
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,253
That's none of us.

2868
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,190
We definitely feel guilt.

2869
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,060
Yeah,

2870
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:24,550
so Brian,

2871
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,100
you're most likely to be a psychopath.

2872
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,633
Yeah,

2873
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,740
most likely.

2874
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,900
One percent of the general
population sociopath,

2875
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:35,901
four percent both suffer from I'm
anti social personality disorder.

2876
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,390
Both lack empathy.

2877
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:42,990
Both demonstrate complete disregard for
the social rules and behavior standards.

2878
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:47,520
That's Brian both failed to
feel any remorse or guilt.

2879
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,510
That's not you at all.

2880
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,740
A are violent.

2881
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,760
That's not you at all.

2882
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,200
So that's weird.

2883
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,921
What's the difference?

2884
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:53,370
Okay,

2885
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:54,090
whatever.

2886
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:54,271
See,

2887
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:55,440
this is where I zone out.

2888
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,160
Pop.

2889
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,320
Pop psychology is a great word too,

2890
01:22:58,321 --> 01:22:59,850
because when it does get into the,

2891
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:00,684
uh,

2892
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,530
you don't want to become a part of
the collective consciousness is,

2893
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:04,051
as it says,

2894
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,640
like people just scapegoat
those things so much.

2895
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:08,890
How many people in your life to
just call themselves bipolar?

2896
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,850
Look at this key difference.

2897
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,100
Psychopaths are,

2898
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,390
is likely to be educated
and have a good career.

2899
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Sociopath is likely to be uneducated
and unable to keep a steady job.

2900
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,290
That's fucking interesting that they did.

2901
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:28,990
A lot of these and psychopaths
have controlled behavior.

2902
01:23:28,991 --> 01:23:31,450
Were sociopaths have erratic behavior.

2903
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,153
Huh?

2904
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,600
That's interesting.

2905
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,013
Yeah,

2906
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,500
that's fucking weird,

2907
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:39,060
man.

2908
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,730
We either way fucked up
both highly manipulative,

2909
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,631
impulsive,

2910
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:44,440
spontaneous,

2911
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,131
sociopath,

2912
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:47,500
more sponsor of a more,

2913
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:51,060
a spontaneous and psychopath,

2914
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:51,731
more manipulative.

2915
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:52,564
Fuck man.

2916
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:53,913
You could find.

2917
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,160
You could find yourself in a few of
those and then things that are definitely

2918
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:57,881
not you and all of them.

2919
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:58,001
So,

2920
01:23:58,001 --> 01:23:58,331
you know what I mean?

2921
01:23:58,331 --> 01:23:59,230
Like I've definitely like,

2922
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:00,220
there's definitely things in there where,

2923
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:01,054
uh,

2924
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,570
you know what?

2925
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:05,410
I'm feeling a downtrodden.

2926
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:05,591
I'm like,

2927
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:06,041
Oh my God,

2928
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:06,141
I'm,

2929
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,720
I'm like a highly manipulative person.

2930
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:09,100
It'll make me upset at myself,

2931
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:09,520
feel good.

2932
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,300
But that just the next
thing under there was like,

2933
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,550
it's because I have personal tab,

2934
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:14,860
I don't want to hurt people
or anything like that.

2935
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:15,693
You know what I mean?

2936
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:19,720
I just feel like when you break variables
down like that to like a two columns,

2937
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:20,350
that's what I mean.

2938
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:23,050
Four or $5 too much of yourself
and none of yourself and all of it.

2939
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:23,710
None of yourself.

2940
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:24,850
Your complex man.

2941
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:25,970
I mean you're a fucking year,

2942
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:30,070
a lot of different things and you're
a lot of different things from week to

2943
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,370
week.

2944
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,790
I mean you're a different person one
week and then the next week you know,

2945
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:36,880
things might be going way better
in your life and you just.

2946
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,670
I mean you might interact
with the exact same person,

2947
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:41,860
the exact same moment and
a totally different way,

2948
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,060
which makes you like pretty much a
different person in a lot of ways that you

2949
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:47,110
change all the time.

2950
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,090
I think the real thing is empathy.

2951
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:50,290
People who lack empathy,

2952
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:50,990
that really,

2953
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,030
really scares us.

2954
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:56,740
People who will victimize other people
grew and other people want to kill.

2955
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,900
Other people want to do
harm to other people.

2956
01:24:58,901 --> 01:25:02,080
Stopped going to be that kind of shit
that freaks us out and that's what we're

2957
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:02,831
really worried about.

2958
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,650
We're worried about someone
who goes after someone,

2959
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,380
like someone who tries to harm them,

2960
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,790
especially physically.

2961
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,020
That scares the shit out of us.

2962
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:11,620
Like someone,

2963
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,640
someone could just like.

2964
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:15,760
You've ever seen a video of this guy who
was into just stab people in the ass?

2965
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,480
No.

2966
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:16,661
Yeah,

2967
01:25:16,661 --> 01:25:19,150
he stabbed a bunch of people and
they got him on a security camera.

2968
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:20,860
This guy was in like a retail store,

2969
01:25:20,861 --> 01:25:22,150
just walked us some duty tap,

2970
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:22,350
tap,

2971
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,980
tap that just shanks.

2972
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:25,030
This guy in the ass like five,

2973
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:27,250
six times before he even doesn't
even know what's happening.

2974
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:28,930
It's a black dude doing
it to a white guy too,

2975
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,100
which makes it extra spooky.

2976
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:35,540
Like you the idea that you could just
zig when you should have zagged and then

2977
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:40,360
you run into some guy who has a buck knife
and he just shoving it in your ass in

2978
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:43,450
a department store like Dax possible.

2979
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:44,980
Like you could run into that guy.

2980
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,600
That kind of stuff freaks us out.

2981
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:47,140
There was a in the,

2982
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,080
in the East village maybe a year ago,

2983
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,330
and they've had video of it,

2984
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:53,510
which is pretty brutal.

2985
01:25:53,511 --> 01:25:57,730
It's just a little old Asian guy walking
home like I think it was even that late

2986
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:57,731
at night,

2987
01:25:57,731 --> 01:25:58,241
maybe like 10,

2988
01:25:58,241 --> 01:25:58,961
11:00 at night.

2989
01:25:58,961 --> 01:25:59,920
And I could be wrong about that,

2990
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,110
but there's this video of this
black dude goes up behind them.

2991
01:26:03,111 --> 01:26:03,944
It's a little

2992
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,970
old Asian guy and he just starts
beating him against the wall.

2993
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,460
He just beat him to death on the
middle of street out of nowhere,

2994
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:11,410
unprovoked it comes,

2995
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,280
comes up behind him and attack him.

2996
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:14,661
The word was,

2997
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:15,390
he was like,

2998
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:15,650
you know,

2999
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:16,820
all screwed up on drugs.

3000
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:18,500
The kid like whack down on some,

3001
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,393
on something.

3002
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,220
But the police station is on my block,

3003
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:23,210
uh,

3004
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:23,990
in the East village.

3005
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,711
So they brought them in there.

3006
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,530
So we saw all the news vans and
everything out there and you know,

3007
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,011
me and my,

3008
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:28,700
uh,

3009
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,050
my buddy went over and we just kind of
watched the guy come out and like to be a

3010
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:33,980
part of something like that.

3011
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,050
Like his face when they
brought them out was like,

3012
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,000
he definitely felt something.

3013
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:38,541
Do you know what I mean?

3014
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:38,970
Like he was,

3015
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,670
he had like a kind of a scowl on his face,

3016
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:42,560
but it didn't seem like remorse.

3017
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,970
Just the face of a guy who was involved
with just that violent have an action.

3018
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,410
Like there's a death,

3019
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:50,720
like a death happened and it was
all and it wasn't even like a,

3020
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:52,990
just like the idea of a,

3021
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:53,824
you know,

3022
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,130
we all fear those things.

3023
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:56,580
And also I don't see myself do,

3024
01:26:56,581 --> 01:26:57,414
I don't see my,

3025
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,540
I know,

3026
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,840
I know fight or flight obviously,

3027
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,850
but hitting someone in
the head with a hammer,

3028
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:03,210
like the thought of,

3029
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,670
of what that would just do,

3030
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:05,181
like the thing of,

3031
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:05,271
like,

3032
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:07,800
the actual physical action
of that is mind blowing.

3033
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,640
I couldn't possibly wrap my
brain around just being there.

3034
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,070
Just like how some
people are just so smart.

3035
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:15,290
You could barely understand half
the fucking shit they're saying.

3036
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,610
It's like when you talk to the particle
physicist and I'm talking about cern and

3037
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:19,940
these,

3038
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,350
these experiments to doing,

3039
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,700
trying to locate the large,

3040
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,181
you know,

3041
01:27:23,181 --> 01:27:23,331
the,

3042
01:27:23,331 --> 01:27:23,631
the,

3043
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:24,080
um,

3044
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,280
the,

3045
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:24,621
the,

3046
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:24,890
um,

3047
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:29,080
using the large Hadron collider and
tried to locate the Higgs Boson particle,

3048
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:30,050
like what the fuck,

3049
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:30,710
man,

3050
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,910
we really the same thing with this on
dude's whose brains go off in a different

3051
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:36,620
direction in a way that
you can't even recommend.

3052
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:36,980
Sure.

3053
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:40,700
Couldn't even recognize the thought
patterns of someone who just walks into a

3054
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:43,730
walmart with an ax and just
starts taking people out.

3055
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,170
Like those people exist.

3056
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,540
The Guy who got on the tower in an Austin,

3057
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:48,530
Texas that one day,

3058
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:52,760
the schools in the university and that
was back in the sixties or the seventies,

3059
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:57,260
and just started shooting people from the
tower pole until they finally took him

3060
01:27:57,261 --> 01:27:57,471
out.

3061
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:58,250
But fuck man.

3062
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:02,200
Did you know with a Ted
what the hell was in Bundy?

3063
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,540
And then I said the Charles Whitman.

3064
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,130
So you're talking about the
guy going to tower Texas?

3065
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:07,983
Yeah.

3066
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,240
Apparently when he was autopsied he
had a tumor on his temporal lobe.

3067
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,010
Took away all of it.

3068
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,490
So when it got big enough,

3069
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,990
it took away all inhibitions.

3070
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,200
He actually killed everything
he saw on his way to that tower.

3071
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:21,710
He killed it.

3072
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,880
He killed his dog at home.

3073
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,241
He killed it.

3074
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:24,080
I think maybe his girl,

3075
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,520
but he killed a few people on the way.

3076
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,570
So it was just,

3077
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:29,030
he would actually have been
found not guilty today.

3078
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:32,780
I've heard arguments about St Louis so
he would not be found not guilty day

3079
01:28:32,781 --> 01:28:35,210
because that was actually like
a physical problem that guy had.

3080
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,110
But,

3081
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:36,760
but you know,

3082
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,130
can,

3083
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:37,963
can you,

3084
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,471
am I saying the right word here?

3085
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:44,471
Behaviorally a teach someone to become a
psychopath because we're in la now too,

3086
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,430
which was always home of the crips,

3087
01:28:49,431 --> 01:28:49,941
bloods,

3088
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:50,631
gang wars.

3089
01:28:50,631 --> 01:28:54,890
I mean you just take these
kids that they're willing
to like shoot in the crowds

3090
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,500
indiscriminately and just kill people.

3091
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,353
And then you know,

3092
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,790
and later that night play madden.

3093
01:28:58,910 --> 01:28:59,750
Well you can,

3094
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,040
if you raise them in a totally fucked

3095
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,010
up way from the time they're born
and the worst possible environment,

3096
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:07,140
people imitate whatever
atmosphere they're in.

3097
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,460
If you're in an atmosphere that's filled
with violence and horrific crime and

3098
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:15,510
that becomes the norm and you get your
respect by committing more violent and

3099
01:29:15,511 --> 01:29:18,900
more horrific crimes so that everyone's
afraid of you and you become this bad

3100
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:21,390
motherfucker with a lollipop would
just shoot people in the face.

3101
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,510
There's a lot of dudes like that because
that's where they get that good feeling

3102
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,420
that you get the good
feeling of accomplishment
by being the biggest fucking

3103
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:28,350
psychopath around.

3104
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,330
That's just a total failure
of the environment that
person's being developed in,

3105
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,810
but that's also what they
have to do in warm and

3106
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,940
it was all about the psychopaths.

3107
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,370
Do you see that fucking thing
I posted on instagram today?

3108
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,660
Look at this thing and pull up.

3109
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,540
This image that I posted on
instagram was from World War One.

3110
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:50,250
Now look at this picture is 20 years
before King Kong and the picture is a

3111
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:55,150
propaganda picture depicting
the Germans as savages.

3112
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,220
This was about Germany CD.

3113
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:00,750
He's got this club in his hand
and the Club says Culture K,

3114
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,190
u l t,

3115
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,060
u r.

3116
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,440
that's a like,

3117
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,700
I guess I say it in Germany.

3118
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:06,330
Maybe,

3119
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,080
I don't know,

3120
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,290
but it's supposed to represent
German culture and this was,

3121
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,750
this predated King Kong
by 20 fucking years,

3122
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,870
but it's a gorilla like with like a crown,

3123
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:16,740
like a German,

3124
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,300
a German helmet with a spike on the top
of it and the grill is holding a woman

3125
01:30:21,301 --> 01:30:22,134
and her tits are.

3126
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,750
Tits are allowed to show tits back then.

3127
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:26,400
Even in an army propaganda film,

3128
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:30,030
you've got to protect the tits
and this gorilla with this club.

3129
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,520
It says destroy this mad brute.

3130
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,730
And then it says mayor list US army.

3131
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,130
And if you go to a Joe Rogan on Instagram,

3132
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:38,790
you could see it.

3133
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,571
It's pretty crazy.

3134
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:42,370
And it's in the sand that says
America that I wonder if they,

3135
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:42,740
they,

3136
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:43,130
they,

3137
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:45,510
they kind of stole the idea
for King Kong from that poster.

3138
01:30:45,511 --> 01:30:49,590
I wonder if that was a pretty well known
poster back in the day and got me the

3139
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:49,921
writer,

3140
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:53,490
got the idea from that kid
could have grown up seeing that,

3141
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:53,791
you know?

3142
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:55,650
And then 20 years later
made a movie like it.

3143
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,520
I mean,

3144
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:56,851
I think,

3145
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:57,810
but the idea of guerrilla,

3146
01:30:57,811 --> 01:30:58,530
you know,

3147
01:30:58,530 --> 01:30:59,400
at the time there,

3148
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,680
another really interesting
point at the time,

3149
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:04,380
mountain gorillas were
not even known to be real,

3150
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:10,030
like mountain gorillas really only
became known for sure in the early 19

3151
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:11,790
hundreds.

3152
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:16,410
So this is a relatively recent animal
and a lot of ways like gorillas,

3153
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:20,550
like there's always been talk of gorillas
and different types of primates and

3154
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:24,600
they've always known that chimpanzees
existed and orangutans were very confusing

3155
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:26,160
to people in the early 18 hundreds.

3156
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:29,070
But when they were documenting
all the different animals,

3157
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:32,550
they didn't definitively document the
mountain gorilla until the early 19

3158
01:31:32,551 --> 01:31:33,384
hundreds.

3159
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,190
So you're looking at
something probably if,

3160
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:37,650
I guess that's supposed to represent a
mountain gorilla or some kind of gorilla,

3161
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:42,270
you're looking at something that was
like a relatively recent idea to people.

3162
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:44,250
This picture of a gorilla and it's also,

3163
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,990
you're also looking at something
that's only probably 50 years after the

3164
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:50,340
invention of photography.

3165
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:51,261
You know.

3166
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:53,250
So I mean think about 50 years ago,

3167
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:53,591
you know,

3168
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,890
you're talking about like 1960 something,

3169
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:56,490
right?

3170
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:57,323
Think of that.

3171
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:58,051
Think of the 19,

3172
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:00,100
67 and we're still driving 19 sixties cars

3173
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,460
around.

3174
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:00,850
There's a lot.

3175
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:01,870
Those are classic cars.

3176
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,100
That was when the fucking full photograph
was invented for them and here they

3177
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:09,430
are looking at this image of a
gorilla carrying a woman like whoa.

3178
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:10,400
Like the idea of a.

3179
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:12,250
A gorilla was pretty recent,

3180
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,530
but that's Germany.

3181
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,560
Getting that crazy like France and England
were supposed to be civilization and

3182
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,021
Germany.

3183
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:23,530
These were mad barbarians
from the Roman days.

3184
01:32:23,531 --> 01:32:25,810
Like that's what the Germanic tribes.

3185
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,930
That's what we thought of
Germans in the 19 hundreds.

3186
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,880
They connected them to barbarians.

3187
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:31,690
Really?

3188
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,351
Yes.

3189
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:33,280
Isn't that amazing?

3190
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,290
So much so that when we
went to war with them,

3191
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,670
they couldn't have been more sleek.

3192
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,350
It was such like a.

3193
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:39,730
It was probably,

3194
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:39,961
you know,

3195
01:32:39,961 --> 01:32:41,760
they were so advanced in so many words,

3196
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:44,230
so much engine weaponry and all that shit.

3197
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:45,400
They were like pretty well.

3198
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:46,151
To this day,

3199
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:47,830
the automobile industry there,

3200
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:50,230
their cars are some of the most
advanced cars in the world.

3201
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:52,090
The Germans make Mercedes,

3202
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,610
they make BMW and they make Porsche.

3203
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,151
I mean,

3204
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:55,984
we're done.

3205
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,190
Those are like the three,

3206
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,083
like if you've,

3207
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:01,360
if you had to pick our
top three most advanced,

3208
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:04,150
best engineered high end cars,

3209
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:05,410
those are the three.

3210
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,170
Like those are the top of
the Ferrari's are bad ass,

3211
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:10,330
but everybody knows that
fucking thing is going to break.

3212
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:11,251
If you,

3213
01:33:11,251 --> 01:33:13,220
if you're one of those
guys bump into someone,

3214
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,610
you buy a fucking Ferrari like bitch,

3215
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,500
you know you can't go
to vegas and that thing,

3216
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,000
you're going to be halfway in
the desert and sudden bang,

3217
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:20,530
Bang,

3218
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:22,330
Bang one blah blah blah blah blah blah,

3219
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:22,930
blah blah.

3220
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:27,930
If he seen that car that goes on air like
blow or belief or something like that,

3221
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:33,970
it goes 100 miles on air and it has a
compressor in it that takes four hours to

3222
01:33:35,051 --> 01:33:35,884
charge.

3223
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:40,750
You just plug it in or you can go to a
gas station and if they have like the,

3224
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,980
like the compressor for,

3225
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,990
you could fill it up in four minutes.

3226
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,940
Do you got to be kidding now.

3227
01:33:45,941 --> 01:33:48,800
And what's crazy is that
it's already big in the UK.

3228
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:54,090
They're just now making a plant and
whole Wiley and it's only cost $10,000.

3229
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,860
That's a game changer.

3230
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,160
Especially on the.

3231
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:58,691
Yeah,

3232
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:02,480
it's probably the CEO because on
shark tank and they all in it.

3233
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:03,590
If you have a really strong longer,

3234
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,463
right.

3235
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:09,090
That should be like your workout everyday
is pumping your car or airplane ramp,

3236
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,560
but I mean you're going to have that.

3237
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:13,120
That's mostly people in
smart cars in New York.

3238
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:13,954
It's terrifying.

3239
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,880
That doesn't even have
two wheels in the front.

3240
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:16,983
That's a bike.

3241
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,610
I don't even know if that's the same one.

3242
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,640
I saw a bike with a helmet
and recall immobile.

3243
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:22,480
That's what it is.

3244
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,081
The air pod.

3245
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:24,550
The air part was on shark tank.

3246
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:24,820
Oh yeah.

3247
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,653
I guess that's it.

3248
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:30,430
Let's see a video on this pitch that
looks to me like a bike wearing a helmet.

3249
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,443
That's all it looks like.

3250
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:35,020
That does not look real and it doesn't
definitely doesn't look like something

3251
01:34:35,021 --> 01:34:38,680
you'd be safe and how does that pass all
the crash standards and all that shit,

3252
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:42,880
but that was one of the things like all
the sharks didn't invest in it because

3253
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:43,803
you know they don't.

3254
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,120
They only have three prototypes of this
and there it was just about to go into

3255
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:47,980
manufacturing.

3256
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:49,900
So they haven't done the actual test yet.

3257
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:50,830
Why don't you just google it?

3258
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:55,150
Jamie just googled airpod video because
we can't just go on their facebook page

3259
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:56,020
and click on every link.

3260
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:57,500
You're going to get this dog shit.

3261
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:58,590
This is how we made the seat.

3262
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:01,693
The seat.

3263
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,510
Yeah.

3264
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,460
You can travel a hundred
miles from the foam.

3265
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:06,270
That's very light so we can drive forever.

3266
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,670
I look at this fucking thing.

3267
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:08,504
Drive around.

3268
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:10,220
It's crazy too.

3269
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:11,750
That gets no traction.

3270
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,580
That's a scary.

3271
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:16,010
Imagine if you were on black
ice in that piece of shit.

3272
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,180
Can you imagine taking it?

3273
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:17,591
Same thing.

3274
01:35:17,591 --> 01:35:21,900
If you could pedal pedal something
that's probably pretty good,

3275
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:24,620
but could probably handle a
boost the pedal be a boost.

3276
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:26,203
It's a moped.

3277
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,960
Look how you get out though
that said Jetson Dick Dat,

3278
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,570
Dat,

3279
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,360
Dat,

3280
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,193
Dat,

3281
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:34,670
you control it using a joy stick,

3282
01:35:34,671 --> 01:35:35,630
like a video game

3283
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:38,263
trippy.

3284
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:39,230
That's true.

3285
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:40,760
But what if you want to text and drive?

3286
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:41,511
You can't even do that.

3287
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:43,130
You need two hands to control this pitch.

3288
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:43,761
I wonder the middle,

3289
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:46,460
like maverick from a
control of the joystick,

3290
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:49,550
that's probably a good idea to keep
people from texting and driving.

3291
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:53,480
Make them a controlled the
car with two joysticks.

3292
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:55,430
Year one fraternity for grilling.

3293
01:35:55,431 --> 01:35:56,090
Straightened back.

3294
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,110
But you can't look slick.

3295
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:00,200
Like if you're rolling your six four
and you got your hand up like this.

3296
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:03,810
But lending my six full
and all the hookers saying,

3297
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:11,140
let me write that long arm hold
onto the top of the steering wheel.

3298
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,860
Sup Boys Suck.

3299
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:13,753
You know,

3300
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,080
even with the windows go down.

3301
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:19,190
The fucking window is
blasting yourself with music.

3302
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,120
I think the front wheel,

3303
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,710
it's about as big as a tic TAC toe.

3304
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:24,410
Cartwheel.

3305
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,243
It's a wagon.

3306
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,070
Sounded like a child's toy.

3307
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:27,530
We'll.

3308
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:28,363
We'll.

3309
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,293
Yeah.

3310
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,040
So small.

3311
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,070
I mean look at this
weird fucking engine too,

3312
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:35,683
but hey man,

3313
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,700
do you think it has heat?

3314
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:38,901
That's a good question,

3315
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:39,590
right?

3316
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:42,470
Instead of heat doesn't have anything.

3317
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:43,400
How weird is this?

3318
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:44,000
Watch that thing.

3319
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,140
Fill up with air.

3320
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:48,580
What if someone comes along and just
shoots a hole in your air tank and he

3321
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:49,430
fucking explode?

3322
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:50,953
Right.

3323
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:52,003
Oxygen,

3324
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,240
oxygen.

3325
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,760
What's interesting though is
that this is even possible.

3326
01:36:55,761 --> 01:36:58,700
Can you imagine somebody like Porsche or
somebody getting behind in this kind of

3327
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:00,430
idea of we don't have.

3328
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,700
We're not even using fuel.

3329
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:02,511
We're using air.

3330
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:03,350
That's fun.

3331
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,213
Nuts.

3332
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:05,000
Yeah.

3333
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,770
Well,

3334
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:08,420
you know the problem with that and that,

3335
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:10,040
how are you generating that air?

3336
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:14,450
Like what are you doing to
get that compressed air and
how much fossil fuels are

3337
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:19,040
involved in making that air compressor
through that process might require some

3338
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:19,461
shit like that.

3339
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:21,020
I mean maybe they can do it with solar.

3340
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:26,080
Maybe there's a way to power some sort
of a generator with solar that pumps air.

3341
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:28,940
That seems possible.

3342
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:29,774
If that's true,

3343
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,201
boy,

3344
01:37:30,201 --> 01:37:32,120
that would be like the
greenest shit of all time,

3345
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,790
but it would also be real.

3346
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,141
Oh Wow.

3347
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:39,130
There's a back seat or no,

3348
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:42,970
it seems like she climbed in the back
or is this a different one that was just

3349
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,033
next to each other.

3350
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:44,781
Oh,

3351
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:45,371
so there's more.

3352
01:37:45,371 --> 01:37:45,770
More,

3353
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:46,880
more than one model.

3354
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:50,810
Do you ever watch that shark tank show?

3355
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:51,410
No,

3356
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,460
it's actually a pretty decent.

3357
01:37:52,461 --> 01:37:53,930
It's like find,

3358
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,280
find a lot of things in there that

3359
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,760
are like this company called
Bagel bites in New York now,

3360
01:37:59,761 --> 01:38:02,910
like addicted to them and they just send
you all these different kinds of bagels

3361
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:05,970
and they're just like little bagel
balls with cream cheese in the middle of

3362
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:06,071
them.

3363
01:38:06,071 --> 01:38:06,904
You put in your oven,

3364
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,430
support that show 100.

3365
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:09,570
I'm,

3366
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:12,720
I support anybody who is encouraging
people to come up with a good thing.

3367
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:13,623
Yeah.

3368
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,241
Fuck yeah,

3369
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:15,700
dude.

3370
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:16,510
Have you tried it?

3371
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:16,750
Oh,

3372
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,583
that's really good.

3373
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:18,540
It's pretty hard.

3374
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:19,381
He's a bad motherfucker.

3375
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:20,310
Dallas diamond page.

3376
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,151
I interviewed a Pto.

3377
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:21,351
We,

3378
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:21,571
we,

3379
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:22,050
uh,

3380
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:22,900
he gave me a copy of.

3381
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:23,851
I've been doing it on the road.

3382
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:23,941
Yeah.

3383
01:38:23,941 --> 01:38:26,240
It's a good thing to do in
hotels in the road to the yoga.

3384
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,040
Hard workout is hard to do.

3385
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:33,270
I would have left a yoga three years
ago and I'll show you a Hixon gracie

3386
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,620
documentary called choke,

3387
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,290
which shows hixon doing
yoga and you realize like,

3388
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:37,651
oh,

3389
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:41,560
I think I have a weird idea about yoga
because I think of all these chicks doing

3390
01:38:41,561 --> 01:38:42,050
it.

3391
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,140
Yoga is hard,

3392
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:43,560
man.

3393
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,280
It's really good for your body
and it's fantastic for your core.

3394
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:47,700
See,

3395
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,190
there's a lot of people that they,

3396
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:53,460
and I was guilty of this myself for
sure when you work out all sorts of

3397
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:54,360
different ways,

3398
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:59,540
but what you don't work out in your
body's ability to move as one unit and one

3399
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:05,031
unit and your flexibility and your
body's like balance and sovereignty,

3400
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:06,991
like where your body.

3401
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:10,470
You could do whatever you want to do
with your body like stand on one foot and

3402
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:12,180
just stick your leg
straight up in the air.

3403
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,590
There's a lot of people that can lift.

3404
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:15,000
I'll fuck load of weight.

3405
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:20,060
There's a lot of people that can run
upstairs and do laps on this fucking pool

3406
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:20,830
back and forth,

3407
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,360
back and forth,

3408
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,380
and they're just animals,

3409
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,660
but ask them to stand on one leg,

3410
01:39:24,661 --> 01:39:27,390
grab their foot and stick their foot
straight up in air and then bounced.

3411
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,620
They literally can't do it.

3412
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,450
They can't balance their body like that.

3413
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:35,160
It's because they don't have full control
of the body and what Yoga gives you is

3414
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:38,610
this weird control of your body
when you get really good at Yoga,

3415
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:40,590
like Hixon did you know,

3416
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:43,050
like he was one of the reasons why he
was one of the best Jujitsu guys in the

3417
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:43,380
world.

3418
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,230
It wasn't just that he
knew every move there was.

3419
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:48,840
It wasn't just that
his dad was Leo Gracie.

3420
01:39:48,841 --> 01:39:50,490
He was one of the
greatest Jujitsu artists.

3421
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:54,210
One of the most important martial arts
ever was also his physical abilities were

3422
01:39:54,211 --> 01:39:58,140
superior because he was into all that
yoga and all this bodyweight stuff.

3423
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,540
Like he would do all
these crazy exercises.

3424
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:01,170
Man.

3425
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:03,060
He would do all these
like balance beam things.

3426
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:03,780
It's pretty dope.

3427
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,910
There's a video of him on the beach in
Santa Monica and he's doing like these

3428
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:09,840
pistol squats on a balance beam,

3429
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:13,650
holding his foot up and sticks his foot
right above his head and he's a Jujitsu

3430
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:14,340
master.

3431
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,270
Put pull the video up.

3432
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:16,090
It's hits,

3433
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:16,480
hits.

3434
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:16,690
Oh,

3435
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:19,980
it's crazy to see because you think about
what you can do with your body and you

3436
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:22,890
think about like how much effort it would
take to be able to do this with this

3437
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:23,724
guy's doing right.

3438
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,280
Diamond Dallas page in his fifties,

3439
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:27,121
in the video,

3440
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:29,280
standing on one leg and
holding his leg up in the air.

3441
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:30,271
Oh yeah.

3442
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:33,630
And the way they pull it out to go up in
the middle and you pull it out and it's

3443
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,010
really impressive.

3444
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,730
He's kidding.

3445
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:37,500
Get even close to what he's doing,

3446
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,560
but he's done is fix a
lot of people's bodies.

3447
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:41,331
A lot of times.

3448
01:40:41,331 --> 01:40:41,990
My back a lot.

3449
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:43,770
My eye real annoying.

3450
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,920
Lower back problems for like about a
year and a half and it's made that much,

3451
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:47,754
much better.

3452
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:48,660
I bet it would.

3453
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,940
My data would strengthen your entire core.

3454
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:52,590
I'll show you machine
after we get out of here.

3455
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,490
I've got a thing in the
back for lower backs.

3456
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:56,170
It's called a reverse hyper.

3457
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,300
It was made by this Guy Louie Simmons,

3458
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:02,050
who's a world famous power
lifter guru from Columbus,

3459
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:05,340
Ohio and from west side
barbell and westside.

3460
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:10,380
Barbells is a organization that he came
up with this machine that it works like

3461
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:13,180
sort of like what your
legs are hanging like.

3462
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,320
You lean your upper body over like a
table and your legs are dangling from the

3463
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,950
waist down there dangling and they hook
up to these rollers like a leg curl

3464
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:23,080
machine sort of end with a straight leg.

3465
01:41:23,081 --> 01:41:26,440
You lift your leg all the way up and
then you let it go down and as it's going

3466
01:41:26,441 --> 01:41:27,340
down it,

3467
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,010
it pulls on your lower back.

3468
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,620
It's like an active decompression,

3469
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:33,860
so you lifted up.

3470
01:41:33,861 --> 01:41:34,601
It's strengthens.

3471
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:35,620
He lifted down,

3472
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,510
it decompresses lifted up its strength.

3473
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,040
If you want to look at it folks,

3474
01:41:39,041 --> 01:41:40,300
it's called reverse hyper.

3475
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,530
You can get it online.

3476
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,200
I bought mine from a company
called rogue fitness.

3477
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:46,570
This is all the crossfit stuff.

3478
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,440
They have all that cool shit,

3479
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:51,280
but I'm telling you this reverse
hyper has been amazing for my back.

3480
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,300
It's so good.

3481
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:52,910
Have you ever done.

3482
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:56,290
I was at my apartment in New
York is too small to store one,

3483
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:59,710
but I want to get an inversion
table so have to back there.

3484
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:01,960
One that you do from the waist down.

3485
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,420
You like lean forward on and
I'll show you both of them after.

3486
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,733
I'm so curious.

3487
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:07,690
Hang upside down like a bad every day.

3488
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,091
I do it every,

3489
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:08,441
every day,

3490
01:42:08,441 --> 01:42:08,921
every day.

3491
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:10,760
I do it every day for
five minutes every day.

3492
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,530
Every day.

3493
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,400
Every time I work out,

3494
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:13,300
every time I lift weights,

3495
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:14,830
especially if I lift anything heavy,

3496
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,740
like if I do squats or anything
like that in of when you do it,

3497
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:22,690
do it right after I'm done and I do
it for as long as I can until I feel

3498
01:42:22,691 --> 01:42:23,380
relaxed.

3499
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,740
I just want my back to open up because
everything you feel that happened to you

3500
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:28,790
actually feel it like
it a little ways at all.

3501
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,390
If you actually feel you
pulled out that noise,

3502
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:31,920
see this,

3503
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,770
that's what you're hoping for.

3504
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,840
Is that what you're hoping for?

3505
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:36,371
A magic cure,

3506
01:42:36,371 --> 01:42:37,120
but it's not.

3507
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:37,950
That's not really.

3508
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:38,470
That's not.

3509
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:39,460
Nothing's really happening there.

3510
01:42:39,461 --> 01:42:40,840
That's like nitrogen being released.

3511
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:42,310
It's not really fixing anything.

3512
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,630
It just sounds cool.

3513
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:43,990
Yeah.

3514
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:47,350
I love the sound like when I get go
to the chiropractor and I get cracked,

3515
01:42:47,351 --> 01:42:48,184
I love the sound,

3516
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,350
but the reality is that's
not what's fixing anything.

3517
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,870
What's fixing is the adjustment of the
spine and what's fixing when you're.

3518
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,600
When you're doing that,

3519
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,490
that conversion table inversion table,

3520
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:01,990
it's the decompression of your muscles
like your muscles relaxing and stretching

3521
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:07,260
be so you gotta be able
to actually concentrate on
relaxing your lower back and

3522
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:08,470
most people can't.

3523
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,221
Most people,

3524
01:43:09,221 --> 01:43:12,410
they tense up so even when they
lie hanging by their ankles,

3525
01:43:12,411 --> 01:43:12,621
like so,

3526
01:43:12,621 --> 01:43:16,810
one of the reasons why some doctors
erroneously think it's not effective,

3527
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:17,321
they go,

3528
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:17,591
well,

3529
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:19,420
you're just going to support
it with your back anyway.

3530
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,010
I'm a little,

3531
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,470
but if you understand how your body works,

3532
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:28,471
you can relax that area and I feel a
great difference between holding it tents

3533
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,430
and relaxing that there.

3534
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:35,260
I feel the stress on that lower back
area and it's lengthening the muscles.

3535
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:38,920
It's pulling them and stretching them
in a way that it's very hard to stretch

3536
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:39,754
those muscles.

3537
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,410
It's very hard to stretch them that way.

3538
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,870
You know like your body's malleable man,

3539
01:43:43,871 --> 01:43:44,380
like you can.

3540
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,730
The reason why some people are super,

3541
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:46,810
super flexible.

3542
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,400
There's a little bit of
genetics involved there,

3543
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:52,170
but a lot of it is just pushing
just hard work and pushing on

3544
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:55,100
the flexibility just everyday
making it move a little bit more,

3545
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,150
move a little bit more.

3546
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:58,550
Like when you see a dude with
crazy holes in their ear,

3547
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:59,623
that's like a.

3548
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,130
You can do that shit to your body.

3549
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:02,270
You can stretch things out.

3550
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:03,440
You can put a plate in your lip,

3551
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:04,070
you can.

3552
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:05,330
You can do that also,

3553
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:05,961
that kind of thing.

3554
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:06,794
Your neck,

3555
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:07,490
yeah,

3556
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,320
you can lengthen your
neck with those wires.

3557
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:10,430
Those crazy ladies put on,

3558
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:13,730
but you can also kind of stretch
your body out that way too.

3559
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,740
There's soft tissue manipulation,

3560
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:17,810
so only certain amount
you could get away with,

3561
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:18,800
but you can,

3562
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:20,360
if you push it hard enough,

3563
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:20,781
long enough,

3564
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:21,740
you're really dedicated.

3565
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:25,460
You can stretch a lot of shit and one
of the problems that people have with

3566
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:28,070
their lower backs especially
is their hamstrings.

3567
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,530
Like if your hamstrings are really tense,

3568
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,620
that puts a tremendous amount
of pressure on your lower back.

3569
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:35,210
And it also limits your mobility.

3570
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,990
It limits the way your body can move
around and that also puts pressure on your

3571
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:39,824
lower back.

3572
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,200
You stretch it all with your,

3573
01:44:41,201 --> 01:44:42,034
your hamstrings.

3574
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,070
I do,

3575
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:43,341
yeah.

3576
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:43,671
I've been,

3577
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:45,160
I've taken a lot more to stretching.

3578
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:45,570
I,

3579
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:50,540
I did crossfit for two years and I lost
a bunch of weight during which there was

3580
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:51,560
great in that regard.

3581
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:53,083
But uh,

3582
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:54,003
the damage,

3583
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:54,651
like speed,

3584
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:56,330
power lifting is not a good idea.

3585
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,200
Fucked up your back.

3586
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:58,041
That's what I think.

3587
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:58,311
Did it.

3588
01:44:58,311 --> 01:44:58,611
Yeah.

3589
01:44:58,611 --> 01:44:59,151
I mean just like,

3590
01:44:59,151 --> 01:44:59,680
you know,

3591
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:02,500
you would be one of them
swinging kettle bells sometimes,

3592
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:02,790
just like,

3593
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:03,201
not even that.

3594
01:45:03,201 --> 01:45:04,820
I don't really think kettle
bells were much of the things I,

3595
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,420
for some reason I was kind of able to
focus like my stance on kettlebells

3596
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,120
because it was never that heavy,

3597
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:12,040
but things where they,

3598
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:12,321
you know,

3599
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:13,154
they want you to do like,

3600
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:14,530
you know,

3601
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:19,530
like cleans or like a snatch and then
they show you the form for 20 minutes and

3602
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:22,730
then they go now as fast as
you can for eight minutes,

3603
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:22,990
you know,

3604
01:45:22,990 --> 01:45:25,810
and the best guys done this and you
don't want to be a loser like that guy.

3605
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,653
So you know,

3606
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,640
be as good as this,

3607
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:27,900
you know,

3608
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,000
try to do it fast.

3609
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:32,870
And how many people drop
those weights and sacrificed?

3610
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,520
How many people do you see
drop weights in their head.

3611
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:36,560
I actually know all the injuries that.

3612
01:45:36,561 --> 01:45:39,110
So people missing box jumps
let's people get hurt with the.

3613
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:40,790
Most of their shins
get busted up on those.

3614
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:43,340
Well,

3615
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:43,880
you know,

3616
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,010
that's the probably the easiest to fix.

3617
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,840
Assist to cut in a bruise.

3618
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,400
The real hard stuff to fix it.

3619
01:45:49,401 --> 01:45:50,180
The back stuff,

3620
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:55,180
you know when you start
doing power lifting in like
large repetition movements,

3621
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,450
fast,

3622
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,680
fast impresses.

3623
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:57,940
Yeah,

3624
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:58,760
you lose,

3625
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,200
you know,

3626
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,890
the most important thing
with power lifting,

3627
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:02,860
the most important thing is proper form.

3628
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:07,040
That's the most important thing by far
and you should never abandoned that ever.

3629
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,970
And that's one of the things
that people criticized.

3630
01:46:09,971 --> 01:46:10,611
Crossfit for.

3631
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:12,080
Steve Maxwell,

3632
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:13,040
who's a good friend of mine,

3633
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,300
who's a fantastic trainer,

3634
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:17,420
probably one of the most knowledgeable
people I've ever met when it comes to

3635
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,860
like fitness training,

3636
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,740
it's always on top of
the latest modalities,

3637
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:23,570
different techniques and stuff like that.

3638
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,403
He hates it.

3639
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,810
He thinks that I can see.

3640
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:27,110
I,

3641
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:27,943
I,

3642
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:28,761
I give it.

3643
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:32,100
It's due because like with the right now,

3644
01:46:32,101 --> 01:46:36,920
I die it much harder and I do more
yoga than I would say I do like,

3645
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:37,120
you know,

3646
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,000
heavyweight training.

3647
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,320
I try to do more stuff like that,

3648
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:39,741
you know what I mean,

3649
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:40,820
like cardio and stuff.

3650
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:41,654
I definitely,

3651
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:42,441
yeah,

3652
01:46:42,441 --> 01:46:43,310
that's insane.

3653
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,241
Watch the video though.

3654
01:46:44,241 --> 01:46:45,070
It's insane.

3655
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:45,641
Watch him,

3656
01:46:45,641 --> 01:46:47,630
watch him work out on the beach
because it's fucking ridiculous.

3657
01:46:47,631 --> 01:46:48,770
He just pistol squats.

3658
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,580
This is all different
things that he's doing,

3659
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,400
but you got to see the um,

3660
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,420
the gymnastics in Santa Monica.

3661
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:55,570
That's a totally different video,

3662
01:46:55,571 --> 01:46:57,480
just like channing tatum and foxcatcher

3663
01:46:59,360 --> 01:46:59,700
he.

3664
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,533
This is,

3665
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:01,890
this is from choke.

3666
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:02,970
This is a different one.

3667
01:47:02,971 --> 01:47:03,240
It's a,

3668
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,350
it's different footage.

3669
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:05,370
Um,

3670
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:05,650
it's,

3671
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:08,210
it's him on the balance
bar in Santa Monica beach.

3672
01:47:08,211 --> 01:47:09,240
He's doing that kind of shit,

3673
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:11,160
but he's doing it while he's
walking on a balance bar.

3674
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,190
It's nuts.

3675
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:13,140
But also those,

3676
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,610
those kind of like applied

3677
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,790
like muscle skills or greg,

3678
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:18,650
like American Ninja Warrior.

3679
01:47:18,651 --> 01:47:20,890
That's such a cool show or the original.

3680
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,460
You don't think any units
need like this stuff,

3681
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:25,930
like mixing Gracie to American warriors.

3682
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,480
Joe.

3683
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,680
Such a cool show.

3684
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:28,370
No,

3685
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:30,640
not just the idea that you could like,

3686
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:34,310
like the concept of hanging off the
side of a building terrifies me because

3687
01:47:34,311 --> 01:47:39,020
there's no chance I'll pull myself up
if I catch a ledge by my fingertips and

3688
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:39,320
effect,

3689
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:44,320
those guys can send on their
fingertips is fucking bonkers.

3690
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:48,530
Those free climbers are fucking
spooky that those guys are doing.

3691
01:47:48,531 --> 01:47:50,450
Like that dude we had on Alex Honnold,

3692
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,690
the guy who goes up the
side of mountains backwards.

3693
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:55,280
That guy's insane.

3694
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:56,143
Have you seen me?

3695
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,223
Have you ever

3696
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:01,430
park horror to good
way to break your neck?

3697
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:04,720
Did you ever see the Russian guys that
go on the crane and just do like chiclets

3698
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,780
we played every one of those.

3699
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:07,760
It makes my legs quiver.

3700
01:48:07,761 --> 01:48:08,750
Watching the videos.

3701
01:48:08,751 --> 01:48:08,871
Yeah.

3702
01:48:08,871 --> 01:48:09,704
My feet go numb.

3703
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:14,320
Couldn't even imagine trying to do that
whole body starts shaking because I'm

3704
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:17,820
watching them says video the other day
of this guy that goes out on this ledge

3705
01:48:17,821 --> 01:48:18,600
of this hotel,

3706
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:23,600
like super high up and he just
starts jumping from one like patio,

3707
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:26,030
like had that like this little part on it.

3708
01:48:26,031 --> 01:48:27,100
Just from one to another.

3709
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:28,760
Talking about that new cell phone video.

3710
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:29,540
Is that it?

3711
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:29,811
Yeah,

3712
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:33,890
it's for the Samsung Galaxy is
the galaxy note or galaxy s six.

3713
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:38,540
That was a Neil Brennan doing the
jump into fucking park cooler master.

3714
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:39,021
Yeah.

3715
01:48:39,021 --> 01:48:42,980
The guy like he straps the video camera
eight straps the camera on him and then

3716
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:45,800
turns the video on and then
jumps from building to building.

3717
01:48:45,801 --> 01:48:46,700
But it might be bullshit.

3718
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:51,170
It might be CGI and I'm not exactly sure
because he's doing some fucking insane

3719
01:48:51,171 --> 01:48:51,501
jumps.

3720
01:48:51,501 --> 01:48:55,260
I'm not exactly sure if he's
really doing those jobs right here.

3721
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:56,901
Oh No,

3722
01:48:56,901 --> 01:48:57,210
you're not.

3723
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:57,440
Hide it.

3724
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,790
That's never seen this.

3725
01:48:59,120 --> 01:48:59,780
I've seen this.

3726
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:00,490
Yeah.

3727
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:00,901
Look at this.

3728
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,720
This is an edge camera video.

3729
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,650
Look at this fucking guy,

3730
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:04,484
man.

3731
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:04,881
I mean,

3732
01:49:04,881 --> 01:49:05,714
it seems real.

3733
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,090
This is the one I'm
talking about right here.

3734
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:08,953
This

3735
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:16,480
takes a photo of their food guys jumping
off of buildings and shit taking photos

3736
01:49:16,481 --> 01:49:17,200
of food,

3737
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,430
but would you jump?

3738
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:21,680
You could definitely jump,

3739
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:22,460
you know,

3740
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,770
four feet with a run.

3741
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,720
You could definitely jump
four feet without a doubt.

3742
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:29,150
You can do that so you can jump.

3743
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,510
You can jump over a distance of four feet.

3744
01:49:31,511 --> 01:49:31,710
You know,

3745
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,361
for a fact.

3746
01:49:32,361 --> 01:49:33,440
You should absolutely do that.

3747
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:37,500
I wouldn't jump four feet from
building the building by me.

3748
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,353
I just got.

3749
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:38,841
I mean,

3750
01:49:38,841 --> 01:49:39,540
there's definitely a,

3751
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:40,281
an amount of money.

3752
01:49:40,281 --> 01:49:42,140
I guess I will do that for I suppose,

3753
01:49:42,141 --> 01:49:44,920
but I mean like I would still be married.

3754
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:48,640
I'd still be emotionally panicked,

3755
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:49,600
like going to do it.

3756
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:50,321
Even if I know,

3757
01:49:50,321 --> 01:49:51,310
even though I know I can jump

3758
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:53,830
significantly further,

3759
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:55,260
I'm checking my feet.

3760
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,690
How many,

3761
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,400
how many feet wide do
you think this table is?

3762
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,393
It's three.

3763
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:58,871
What do you think?

3764
01:49:58,871 --> 01:50:00,890
This is not more than three.

3765
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,350
What is this?

3766
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:03,280
Four feet wide?

3767
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:03,971
Yeah.

3768
01:50:03,971 --> 01:50:04,211
See,

3769
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:07,110
I could definitely jump over that
with avant and everything like that.

3770
01:50:07,110 --> 01:50:07,570
Of course.

3771
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:08,920
Even just standing broad jump.

3772
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:10,150
Definitely jump over that.

3773
01:50:10,151 --> 01:50:13,700
But if below was like hundred store.

3774
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,220
Yeah,

3775
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,053
that's what I mean.

3776
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,570
My hands are sweating dude.

3777
01:50:16,571 --> 01:50:21,571
I just said that my hands started sweating
because then I'd have to assume it's

3778
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:22,770
real.

3779
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:27,770
I have to assume is that Brian's video
will make you faint and I gave it to

3780
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:28,570
Jamie.

3781
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:28,900
No,

3782
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,920
but this is the one I'm talking about.

3783
01:50:29,921 --> 01:50:30,731
Look how high that is.

3784
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:35,170
And he just starts jumping from one corner
to one coronary and at the end he has

3785
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:36,610
to stop at.

3786
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:37,710
Do you have that?

3787
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:38,281
But you could,

3788
01:50:38,281 --> 01:50:38,560
um,

3789
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,393
you know,

3790
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,900
have you ever in your.

3791
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:42,100
I guess probably if you go on really hard,

3792
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:45,040
but if you've fallen off
of a chin up bar ever know,

3793
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,920
but you still would not
want to like take that.

3794
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:48,430
So you're,

3795
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:49,241
you're confident in your,

3796
01:50:49,241 --> 01:50:49,571
in your,

3797
01:50:49,571 --> 01:50:50,410
in your pull ups.

3798
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:52,570
And you wouldn't want to do it over those.

3799
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,130
Just land on your feet.

3800
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:55,391
Here it is.

3801
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:55,740
Check this.

3802
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,800
Oh my God.

3803
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:57,011
No,

3804
01:50:57,011 --> 01:50:57,990
he's not doing this.

3805
01:50:58,490 --> 01:50:59,323
What is he doing?

3806
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,753
Oh,

3807
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,400
this is fucked up.

3808
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,420
Oh my God.

3809
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,110
Oh my God.

3810
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:14,630
Dude.

3811
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:15,200
Look,

3812
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,120
they're dripping.

3813
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,680
My hands are dripping.

3814
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:19,280
Feel my hands.

3815
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,220
They're fucking soaking wet right now.

3816
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:22,360
It's a real anxiety.

3817
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:24,130
But it says for a guy you
don't know where anything was.

3818
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:26,770
The fact that that guy's out of his mind.

3819
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:27,873
The fuck is he?

3820
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,780
How much would someone
have to pay you to do this?

3821
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,300
Never.

3822
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:34,601
Never.

3823
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:35,080
No.

3824
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:35,950
I would faint.

3825
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:36,431
Yeah.

3826
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:36,641
This.

3827
01:51:36,641 --> 01:51:38,230
There's no amount of money for that.

3828
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,473
I would suck Dick.

3829
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:42,490
I don't think I have that
much faith in my coordination.

3830
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:43,030
Which sect?

3831
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,960
X before doing that?

3832
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,651
Probably.

3833
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:44,921
Yes.

3834
01:51:44,921 --> 01:51:45,280
Yeah.

3835
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,230
How many dicks have as many as they want?

3836
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:48,753
You know

3837
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:50,813
you can't die.

3838
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,680
You'd have to.

3839
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,100
You would know halfway through the deck.

3840
01:51:53,101 --> 01:51:54,160
This deck is spoiled,

3841
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,413
right?

3842
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:58,633
Sir?

3843
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:01,210
Do you have on?

3844
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,220
Because I am not going to get tricky
gnosis from your dicks or a gun.

3845
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:06,280
There is nuts for a stamp.

3846
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,020
The date stamp fucking Gardia from your,

3847
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:12,130
your your Dick Dying.

3848
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:14,240
Transgenders that have fake pussy.

3849
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:14,501
He's like,

3850
01:52:14,501 --> 01:52:17,440
if they feel like they can't
get a period that they're like,

3851
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:17,720
oh,

3852
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:20,270
only if I could get it
to do something else.

3853
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:20,651
That's what I'm saying.

3854
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:21,640
I don't think I'm super thrilled with it.

3855
01:52:21,641 --> 01:52:26,641
And also there's that weird
thing is because it does
it being made where the Deq

3856
01:52:27,191 --> 01:52:27,521
was.

3857
01:52:27,521 --> 01:52:27,871
So the,

3858
01:52:27,871 --> 01:52:32,050
it's also an oddly placed vagina
usually also it's kind of like high up.

3859
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:35,080
It's where the decal
seen one in real life.

3860
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:38,200
Do you think they'd put just chip packets
in there and they squeezed us to make

3861
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:38,860
it feel like,

3862
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,071
you know,

3863
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:42,160
like I think they probably
pretend here's Hickson crazy.

3864
01:52:42,161 --> 01:52:44,410
As crazy as that sounds crazy that sounds.

3865
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:44,921
Do that.

3866
01:52:44,921 --> 01:52:45,754
But I mean like

3867
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,641
they like,

3868
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:47,060
you know,

3869
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:48,320
girls who want to become men.

3870
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,940
Wear a fucking fake Dick all day.

3871
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:50,180
Yeah.

3872
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,110
Look at this difference.

3873
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:51,381
Yeah,

3874
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:52,214
that is true.

3875
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,720
There's a lot of girls who do do that.

3876
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,320
Maybe putting some may want to put

3877
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,910
exploding blood packs and the vagina.

3878
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:02,870
Those things thinking she wanted to
be a vampire or when you were a kid,

3879
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:03,920
look at this fucking balance.

3880
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:04,610
This guy has.

3881
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:06,020
He just sat down on it.

3882
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:07,920
He's putting his foot down and then watch.

3883
01:53:07,921 --> 01:53:10,310
He's going to stand up for
working for it though too.

3884
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,510
He's not watch this,

3885
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:14,480
but he's because he's standing
up on one day from his ass down.

3886
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:15,980
I'd also like a rounded pole.

3887
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:16,440
Looks like.

3888
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:16,780
No,

3889
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:17,180
no.

3890
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:18,050
That's flat on top.

3891
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:18,800
Like balls.

3892
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,490
Doe.

3893
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:20,680
Now Watch how he does this though.

3894
01:53:20,681 --> 01:53:21,514
This is insane.

3895
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:23,773
That's crazy.

3896
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,180
He stands up and then once he
gets all the way to the top,

3897
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:27,043
then he doesn't split.

3898
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:28,013
He grabs his foot.

3899
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:29,293
It's crazy.

3900
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,550
It's fucking balance is amazing

3901
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,010
and that was why one of the.

3902
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,110
You mean one of the
reasons why he was so good,

3903
01:53:36,111 --> 01:53:37,520
like he had a combination of everything.

3904
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:38,341
Look,

3905
01:53:38,341 --> 01:53:38,840
get that.

3906
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,740
Get the fuck out of here,

3907
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:40,574
man.

3908
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:42,050
That dude's doing a split.

3909
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:42,913
Look at this shit.

3910
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,600
Standing on a balance beam.

3911
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:45,663
I was like,

3912
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:48,140
that's like the ultimate control
of your body right there.

3913
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:49,670
If you can do that,

3914
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:50,870
you could basically do anything.

3915
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:55,780
He's the greatest Jujitsu fighter of
all time to like widely recognized by

3916
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:57,490
almost everybody ever as being a great,

3917
01:53:57,491 --> 01:53:58,270
greatest gracie.

3918
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:02,360
I don't think it's a coincidence that
it's also he can do ridiculous things with

3919
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:03,340
his body that like,

3920
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,360
I bet Lebron James can't do that.

3921
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,130
I bet coby Brian can't do that,

3922
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:07,700
you know,

3923
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,690
but what he can do,

3924
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,890
that's a very unusual.

3925
01:54:09,891 --> 01:54:13,420
I wouldn't bet a GSP
could probably do that.

3926
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:15,950
I think things similar to close.

3927
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,251
Yeah.

3928
01:54:16,251 --> 01:54:17,750
George is a pretty amazing athlete.

3929
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:22,040
He jumps up on those little
messages in between them and used.

3930
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,870
It goes up and down.

3931
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:23,090
I mean,

3932
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,923
that's like.

3933
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:24,530
Yeah.

3934
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:25,130
Well he also,

3935
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,360
he's very flexible too.

3936
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:27,800
That's a big flexibility move.

3937
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:30,290
You have to be really flexible just to
be able to hold your leg up there like

3938
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:30,980
that.

3939
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:31,221
You know,

3940
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:32,390
George is pretty flexible.

3941
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:34,690
Did you see the Pacquiao?

3942
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:35,623
Mayweather fight?

3943
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:36,390
Yeah.

3944
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:37,190
Yeah.

3945
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:38,023
What'd you think?

3946
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:38,940
I um,

3947
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:41,420
it was just boring.

3948
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:43,670
I thought you said you liked it.

3949
01:54:43,671 --> 01:54:44,060
Yeah.

3950
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:45,390
But I think that uh,

3951
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,610
most people were disappointed,

3952
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:47,444
right?

3953
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:49,010
I just was bored.

3954
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:50,000
I just call.

3955
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,040
I called it very easily
from the beginning.

3956
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,910
I never believe I asked you
if you're already talking.

3957
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:56,730
I know it seems like that UFC has.

3958
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:00,000
MMA is really spoiled
boxing for me because I,

3959
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:00,660
I just,

3960
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,430
I mean it's not like Mike Tyson days.

3961
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,240
It wasn't exciting like
that where you know,

3962
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:05,360
not going to be,

3963
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,740
but that was the best at their best.

3964
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,470
That's the best boxers right now.

3965
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,640
And if that's your best,

3966
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,301
why?

3967
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:13,740
Why are we watching 100 bucks?

3968
01:55:13,741 --> 01:55:15,420
That's twice as much as UFC.

3969
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:17,450
The UFC $60.

3970
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:17,970
Okay.

3971
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:19,180
Let's still deaf.

3972
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,520
It's a million fights.

3973
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:22,860
Yeah,

3974
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:23,040
tons of.

3975
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:23,671
Over the course of the night,

3976
01:55:23,671 --> 01:55:24,790
you get free fights,

3977
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,281
but don't you think?

3978
01:55:26,281 --> 01:55:27,000
Like everybody says,

3979
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:27,451
fuck this.

3980
01:55:27,451 --> 01:55:28,530
I never watched boxing again.

3981
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:29,640
I think that's bullshit.

3982
01:55:29,641 --> 01:55:31,080
I think they will still watch it,

3983
01:55:31,081 --> 01:55:32,700
but I'm not going to pay 100 bucks ever,

3984
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:34,150
but who's going to be a real?

3985
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:35,071
Who's gonna?

3986
01:55:35,071 --> 01:55:35,610
Who's gonna?

3987
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:38,280
Who's gonna tear through again,

3988
01:55:38,281 --> 01:55:38,941
like a Tyson.

3989
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:39,421
That's what you need.

3990
01:55:39,421 --> 01:55:41,990
You need somebody with that
kind of vicious knockout,

3991
01:55:41,991 --> 01:55:43,590
so you need to bring excitement to it.

3992
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,130
One

3993
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:44,963
thing,

3994
01:55:45,710 --> 01:55:46,830
there was excitement around this fight,

3995
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:48,540
but I never fully understood why.

3996
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:49,374
I really was like,

3997
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:51,380
I think I called that from the
second they announced the fight.

3998
01:55:51,381 --> 01:55:52,810
I go mayweather winds by the.

3999
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:54,420
What about Canelo Alvarez?

4000
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,030
I'm not familiar with a bad motherfucker.

4001
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,541
He's fighting.

4002
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:59,850
Next week is fighting
this upcoming Saturday.

4003
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:00,870
They're going to show the rematch.

4004
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,470
The floyd mayweather fight on Hbo and
then he's gonna fight Saturday or Friday.

4005
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:04,950
I don't know.

4006
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:06,900
I'd rather use from Australia.

4007
01:56:06,901 --> 01:56:07,734
Right.

4008
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:09,373
Let's cut.

4009
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:11,280
Boxing match I watched was uh,

4010
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,350
Chris Algieri beating that,

4011
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:13,980
uh,

4012
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,420
the Russian providing the coffee.

4013
01:56:15,421 --> 01:56:15,960
Yeah.

4014
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,370
That was a fun fight to watch.

4015
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:21,630
Did you see a lucas matea say versus
product off providing the coffin.

4016
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,970
Matisa go to a war for 12 rounds.

4017
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:25,530
It's fucking crazy.

4018
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:27,660
I mean it was a crazy fight.

4019
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:32,040
That's like the kind of fight that
everybody wanted from a pack out and

4020
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:32,893
mayweather.

4021
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,470
Like just show a couple of,

4022
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:35,520
just a few minutes.

4023
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:39,120
Show highlights of the [inaudible]
providing a cough fight.

4024
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,240
This fight was like some
crazy rock 'em sock.

4025
01:56:42,241 --> 01:56:43,200
'Em robots.

4026
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,030
Rocky five.

4027
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,000
Like it was a movie fight and,

4028
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:51,450
and all of a UFC and
boxing or MMA and boxing.

4029
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:51,900
For me,

4030
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:56,900
I'd say one of my top five fights of all
time is a boxing diego corral is versus

4031
01:56:57,151 --> 01:56:57,984
um.

4032
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:58,770
Oh,

4033
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,610
what was his name?

4034
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:02,940
It's one of those three names I believe.

4035
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:04,410
I know who you're talking about.

4036
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:05,340
Taylor,

4037
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,151
Jonathan Taylor.

4038
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:06,984
Thomas.

4039
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:10,560
He got pissed at the world.

4040
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:12,950
Was getting wobbly towards the center.

4041
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,100
I know you're talking about.

4042
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:16,230
I mean they fought in a,

4043
01:57:16,231 --> 01:57:17,100
in a phone booth.

4044
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:17,461
They said,

4045
01:57:17,461 --> 01:57:17,731
you know,

4046
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:19,740
for it was insane.

4047
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,090
And then,

4048
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:20,440
you know,

4049
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:23,130
it was a back and forth
knockouts Kinda like that.

4050
01:57:23,131 --> 01:57:24,360
Pat Barry Check Congo thing.

4051
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,230
This is the,

4052
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:27,850
this is these two guys fighting him
and this is providing the coffin.

4053
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:29,460
It was a crazy fight.

4054
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:31,920
They smashed heads right there.

4055
01:57:31,921 --> 01:57:32,754
But this,

4056
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,750
this was like one.

4057
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,870
If you want to watch like a blood and
guts fight like everybody wanted the

4058
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:37,830
mayweather fight to be.

4059
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:41,460
You got to watch this fight
because it was fucking incredible.

4060
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,030
She's,

4061
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:43,920
I mean these guys just back and forth,

4062
01:57:43,921 --> 01:57:45,120
beat the fuck out of each other.

4063
01:57:45,121 --> 01:57:48,630
Providing the cough takes a punch
better than any living human that's ever

4064
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:50,370
walked the face of this fucking planet.

4065
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:50,941
And when he's done,

4066
01:57:50,941 --> 01:57:51,720
he looks like a,

4067
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,070
like an Asian,

4068
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,330
like dry cleaner lady,

4069
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:55,880
old.

4070
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:56,701
But I mean he really does.

4071
01:57:56,701 --> 01:57:57,780
And he's always stretched out.

4072
01:57:57,781 --> 01:57:58,760
His face is bizarre.

4073
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:03,770
He looks like they pulled him out of like
a wooly mammoth Tusk in the middle of

4074
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:05,670
the fucking Himalayan or some shit.

4075
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:07,340
He's such a stud though.

4076
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:10,110
So it's like a fucking
animal as a fighter.

4077
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,221
And He,

4078
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:11,371
uh,

4079
01:58:11,371 --> 01:58:11,671
they did,

4080
01:58:11,671 --> 01:58:11,791
uh,

4081
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:12,480
um,

4082
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,000
uh,

4083
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,890
took photos of his drug test after
the fight and his urine was black.

4084
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:19,270
I mean the from below,

4085
01:58:19,271 --> 01:58:20,220
like coke,

4086
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,660
like Coca Cola,

4087
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:24,750
that's what it's piss looked like from
this fight because this fight was so

4088
01:58:24,751 --> 01:58:25,584
crazy.

4089
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,410
I mean it was just like one of the
nuttiest fights I've ever seen in my life.

4090
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:31,740
And that was the kind of
fight that Jose Luis Castillo,

4091
01:58:31,741 --> 01:58:32,070
right?

4092
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:33,300
Wasn't that it was.

4093
01:58:33,301 --> 01:58:33,930
Yeah.

4094
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:34,790
Deal Corollas.

4095
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:35,833
Yeah,

4096
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,240
yeah,

4097
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:36,690
yeah.

4098
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:37,230
That's it.

4099
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:38,490
And they went back and forth,

4100
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:39,661
back and forth,

4101
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:41,230
and they own each other was so good.

4102
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,220
God Damn.

4103
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:42,431
Yeah.

4104
01:58:42,431 --> 01:58:44,710
He had some great fucking
fighting and Diego has died.

4105
01:58:44,711 --> 01:58:46,030
And like not crazy long after that.

4106
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:47,420
He died in a motorcycle accident.

4107
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,543
No,

4108
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:48,910
yeah,

4109
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:49,810
he was a wild dude.

4110
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,280
It was wild dudes.

4111
01:58:51,281 --> 01:58:52,114
Just fucking

4112
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:54,990
but then don't make it.

4113
01:58:54,991 --> 01:58:56,680
Then they'll make the movie
of his life and he'll be like,

4114
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,930
I was just starting my charity work.

4115
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:02,170
I'm done.

4116
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:03,730
I'm done with this crazy fight game.

4117
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:06,310
I'm going to preserve my family
and stop cheating on my lady.

4118
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:07,560
What I'm going to do right now.

4119
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:12,610
Some of the help the little kids coming
up and then it'll be some kid drinking,

4120
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,833
laughing.

4121
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:18,010
He turns a corner and smashes into
them and there's a lot of people that

4122
01:59:18,011 --> 01:59:19,700
complain about the end of a,

4123
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:24,190
you know that guys being dripped dragged
over the coals now the he's dead now,

4124
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:25,030
but to Chris,

4125
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:26,020
the American sniper guy,

4126
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:28,030
Chris Kyle was like the same thing.

4127
01:59:28,031 --> 01:59:28,780
It was like,

4128
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:30,850
I'm going to go help this
wacky guy out and she's like,

4129
01:59:30,851 --> 01:59:31,451
you shouldn't do it.

4130
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:31,661
He goes,

4131
01:59:31,661 --> 01:59:32,494
hey,

4132
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:34,000
everyone deserves help.

4133
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,220
Every kid home that day.

4134
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:37,511
I bet he was just like,

4135
01:59:37,511 --> 01:59:37,940
you know,

4136
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:38,651
they probably all here.

4137
01:59:38,651 --> 01:59:38,861
I was like,

4138
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:40,930
fuck you fucking cunt.

4139
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,940
Well now I have to leave
your fucking concept.

4140
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:45,550
That's why I asked for breakfast to
be done an hour ago when I got in the

4141
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:45,881
shower.

4142
01:59:45,881 --> 01:59:48,850
You twat I'll be back at seven.

4143
01:59:48,851 --> 01:59:51,880
You fucking dumb or change your
attitude before I get back dead.

4144
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,130
Oh God.

4145
01:59:54,610 --> 01:59:55,630
You never know man.

4146
01:59:55,631 --> 01:59:57,160
You watched a movie about someone's life.

4147
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:57,460
They,

4148
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:00,080
most of the shit they're saying
they just did not see it.

4149
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:02,620
Do you try to not leave town or,

4150
02:00:02,621 --> 02:00:03,350
or hang up on it?

4151
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,441
I,

4152
02:00:03,441 --> 02:00:04,031
I never,

4153
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:05,780
I always say with like,

4154
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:08,740
I think any girlfriend I've
ever had or if it's like,

4155
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:10,330
let's not let me not leave town.

4156
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:12,220
Getting on a plane while we're in a fight.

4157
02:00:12,221 --> 02:00:13,720
Like I've thrown that all away.

4158
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:15,040
I will absolutely get on a plane.

4159
02:00:15,310 --> 02:00:16,150
And then while I'm on the plane,

4160
02:00:16,151 --> 02:00:16,301
I'm like,

4161
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:17,170
if this plane goes down,

4162
02:00:17,171 --> 02:00:19,480
let's get a fucking ruin
the rest of her life.

4163
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:20,613
Fuck her.

4164
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,360
That's so crazy.

4165
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,760
So this Baltimore thing,

4166
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,080
what was the,

4167
02:00:26,081 --> 02:00:26,914
um,

4168
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:28,930
what did they do to this guy?

4169
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,550
Because there's a catalyst.

4170
02:00:30,551 --> 02:00:31,480
You mean like the world was a,

4171
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,011
he,

4172
02:00:32,011 --> 02:00:33,610
he died in a police van,

4173
02:00:33,611 --> 02:00:34,444
right?

4174
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:35,910
They injured his,

4175
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,080
they hurt his back,

4176
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:40,180
his neck and spinal cord failure,

4177
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:40,690
right?

4178
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:41,440
Yeah,

4179
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,920
but I had read from a very

4180
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:49,900
non credible source that
he was already injured.

4181
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,083
That's not true.

4182
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:52,750
It's not true.

4183
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,120
So he died from an injury he sustained in.

4184
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:58,930
So all the stuff that everybody has
said about it being all the fake rumors,

4185
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:02,140
those motherfuckers
with their fake stories.

4186
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,490
Dangerous.

4187
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:07,300
My broken heart of that was hearing
other guys that were in the,

4188
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,220
in the van to like the
other criminals or you know,

4189
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:12,550
alleged criminals that
were in the van with them,

4190
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:15,880
like giving their account of it
was always great because it goes,

4191
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,690
it was welcome him and hurt him himself

4192
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,500
was of course the cups did.

4193
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:25,780
He can't hurt himself like that.

4194
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:26,290
Yeah.

4195
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:29,410
That's not the guy you
want to kill himself.

4196
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:34,650
NBC News Dot Com says disputed report
and then Freddie Gray hurt himself in

4197
02:01:35,861 --> 02:01:36,671
police van.

4198
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:37,504
Question Mark.

4199
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:39,440
That is not journalism.

4200
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,220
You shouldn't

4201
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,053
be able to do that.

4202
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:46,100
You shouldn't be able to say
disputed report and then the title,

4203
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:49,130
Freddie Gray hurt himself in police van.

4204
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:49,850
Question Mark,

4205
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:51,020
you just getting off the hook.

4206
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:53,450
You haven't done the fucking work
and trying to get the story out.

4207
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:55,820
He tried to get clicks
before you've done the work.

4208
02:01:55,821 --> 02:01:56,900
You don't know if that story.

4209
02:01:56,901 --> 02:01:57,734
Fuck,

4210
02:01:57,770 --> 02:01:58,760
you can't do that.

4211
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:02,330
Like that sneaky shit
for NBC News Dot Com.

4212
02:02:02,331 --> 02:02:05,150
That's really sneaky shit
because that's not a story.

4213
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:06,290
You know what that is.

4214
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:08,870
This disputed report on a new site.

4215
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:10,760
How about you do some fucking journalism.

4216
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:13,100
How about you follow up
and get an actual report?

4217
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:13,820
How will your.

4218
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:16,100
What you're doing is if you
say something like that,

4219
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:19,070
people like me just read the
headline and start repeating it.

4220
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:19,801
I already,

4221
02:02:19,801 --> 02:02:21,260
he hurt himself in the van.

4222
02:02:21,970 --> 02:02:23,120
I already tried to hurt something.

4223
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:26,630
The best guy hurt himself in the van.

4224
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:27,200
Okay.

4225
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,480
And that burden down the dry cleaners.

4226
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:31,580
The best example of how uh,

4227
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,360
easy that shit goes is,

4228
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:35,181
or what was it?

4229
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:35,460
There was,

4230
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:39,260
wasn't there as a comic at one point
that was like accused of something and

4231
02:02:39,261 --> 02:02:40,370
everyone just says like,

4232
02:02:40,371 --> 02:02:41,190
he did it.

4233
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:42,020
Who they go,

4234
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:42,853
I can't remember.

4235
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:43,720
Yeah,

4236
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:44,210
no,

4237
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:44,421
no.

4238
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:47,030
It was a comic a who
lives out here I think.

4239
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:48,120
Oh yeah.

4240
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,103
But a

4241
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:52,723
terrible example,

4242
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:53,510
let's,

4243
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:54,350
let's keep moving.

4244
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:57,670
Let's do another one years.

4245
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:02,690
Did you hear about having to do have
a kid in la that got shot by the cops?

4246
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:07,040
A 13 year old kid or it was 19 year old
kid is crying for his mom armed crime

4247
02:03:07,041 --> 02:03:08,840
for his mommy before he fucking died.

4248
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,630
The cops thought they
thought he had a gun,

4249
02:03:11,631 --> 02:03:13,280
shot him through a fucking screen window.

4250
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,480
Like there's som,

4251
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:14,871
you know,

4252
02:03:14,871 --> 02:03:15,700
you standing there,

4253
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,550
he's gonna be on bang.

4254
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,593
They just shoot them.

4255
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:18,720
It just wasn't doing anything.

4256
02:03:18,721 --> 02:03:19,970
He wasn't a criminal at all.

4257
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:24,830
Total accidental death from
some incompetent person
that happened to be a police

4258
02:03:24,831 --> 02:03:25,664
officer.

4259
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,360
And now this,

4260
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:26,860
you know,

4261
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,100
well hideous can become police officers.

4262
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:31,830
Suppose Got Duke Lacrosse thing is a
good example because people still say use

4263
02:03:31,831 --> 02:03:35,810
that as an example of like
a rapey situations like
telling Duke Lacrosse team.

4264
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:36,820
But yeah,

4265
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:37,380
didn't happen.

4266
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:40,730
And they're always kind of like
things people still say that,

4267
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:45,140
well people are terrified of fraternities
actually doing something like that.

4268
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:47,750
So the Duke Lacrosse case
is just one of those.

4269
02:03:47,751 --> 02:03:48,920
But like the Uva,

4270
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:52,220
the University of Virginia thing that
rolling stone printed this huge article

4271
02:03:52,221 --> 02:03:53,510
about never happened.

4272
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:55,400
They just did shit journalism.

4273
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,150
They failed at every level when it comes
to dirt and this goddamn rolling stone.

4274
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,200
But because it's such a sensitive subject
and people are really sensitive about

4275
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:08,080
calling out someone that may have actually
been a victim like being wrong and.

4276
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:08,391
Sure,

4277
02:04:08,391 --> 02:04:08,571
sure,

4278
02:04:08,571 --> 02:04:08,871
sure.

4279
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:11,840
And saying you were in a victim and
it turns out there were people are so

4280
02:04:11,841 --> 02:04:15,260
terrified of that that they actually
skirt away from the real journalism,

4281
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:15,910
you know?

4282
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:17,380
And that's what's happened because you.

4283
02:04:17,381 --> 02:04:17,511
Yeah,

4284
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:17,871
exactly.

4285
02:04:17,871 --> 02:04:18,800
If you don't want to get like,

4286
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:20,330
you don't wanna get in trouble
because if they're right.

4287
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:21,200
Yeah.

4288
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:21,381
Yeah.

4289
02:04:21,381 --> 02:04:21,550
But that,

4290
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:21,681
you know,

4291
02:04:21,681 --> 02:04:23,870
that thing that the Duke Lacrosse case,

4292
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:25,610
that was one of Nancy graces pets,

4293
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:27,020
those bars,

4294
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:27,501
right?

4295
02:04:27,501 --> 02:04:28,880
That girl,

4296
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,030
they tit,

4297
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:33,140
that girl did terrible things.

4298
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:33,710
I mean,

4299
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,880
she never apologized to them.

4300
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:37,920
I mean she was flat out accusing
them of that on television.

4301
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:38,600
You know,

4302
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,220
you can.

4303
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:40,470
That's kind of the same thing.

4304
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:41,610
It's not journalism.

4305
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:42,900
A story's not done.

4306
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,780
Did you don't know unless you were there,

4307
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,240
you got to fuck and get
all your ducks in a row.

4308
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:48,901
And even then,

4309
02:04:48,901 --> 02:04:49,170
man,

4310
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:50,160
people lie.

4311
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:52,240
There's a lot of weird shit going on when,

4312
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:56,030
whenever there's a story and then there's
two different sides of that story.

4313
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:56,913
Boy,

4314
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,900
this gets tricky.

4315
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,530
Trying to figure out who's telling the
truth and who's not telling the truth and

4316
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:03,450
what is what like fuck man.

4317
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:07,460
Just to like all the only witnesses
were the or the groups that were there.

4318
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:10,860
But those behind closed doors,

4319
02:05:10,861 --> 02:05:12,590
accusations are fucking meth.

4320
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,620
That's so man.

4321
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:14,580
Never want to be on those.

4322
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:15,640
Yeah,

4323
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:16,420
no shit.

4324
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:16,991
And it's also,

4325
02:05:16,991 --> 02:05:21,610
it's weird the difference in
like the stories that catch,

4326
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:22,481
you know,

4327
02:05:22,481 --> 02:05:26,500
there's stories that catch fire and then
everybody wants to walk in the street

4328
02:05:26,501 --> 02:05:28,330
and protest like this kid in La,

4329
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:31,390
this is not catching
fire for whatever reason,

4330
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,800
you're barely hearing about this.

4331
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:33,820
Baltimore's burning down.

4332
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:39,120
Baltimore is burning down and the guy
who was in police custody is an admitted

4333
02:05:39,731 --> 02:05:40,270
criminal,

4334
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:40,601
right?

4335
02:05:40,601 --> 02:05:44,320
Like everybody's kind of admitting that
this guy has done crimes before and this

4336
02:05:44,321 --> 02:05:46,900
is just simply a police brutality issue.

4337
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:51,310
But this kid who got shot
in La isn't even a criminal.

4338
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,420
He's just a kid.

4339
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:55,420
It was just a mistake like this is.

4340
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:59,200
That's terrifying to me that just
willing to shoot that 12 year old boy in

4341
02:05:59,201 --> 02:06:00,034
Cleveland,

4342
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:01,150
the guy gets out of the car,

4343
02:06:01,151 --> 02:06:03,280
a cop who was taken off of a,

4344
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:07,600
a different police squad because he
was dangerous because they didn't.

4345
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:08,440
They just like.

4346
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:08,741
They were like,

4347
02:06:08,741 --> 02:06:09,850
you gotta get the fuck out of here.

4348
02:06:10,030 --> 02:06:12,820
They kicked them off and another
department hires this guy.

4349
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,040
He gets out of a car in two seconds.

4350
02:06:15,041 --> 02:06:17,290
He's shooting at a 12 year old with a gun.

4351
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:21,310
And not saying that being a cop isn't
a fucking insanely difficult job.

4352
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,510
And not saying that I,

4353
02:06:22,511 --> 02:06:22,720
I,

4354
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,760
I've said many times I don't
think anybody can do it right.

4355
02:06:24,761 --> 02:06:27,550
I think it's just way too much
stress and way too much pressure.

4356
02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:32,380
But my point is how weird is it that
some stories catch at some stories don't

4357
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:33,641
like some stories.

4358
02:06:33,641 --> 02:06:34,474
They just,

4359
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:35,530
they just slip right by.

4360
02:06:35,531 --> 02:06:38,290
You hear about the guy getting shot by
the cops and there's no protests and

4361
02:06:38,291 --> 02:06:38,950
everything.

4362
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:40,280
It just becomes another story.

4363
02:06:40,281 --> 02:06:43,270
It just becomes another statistic
and then Freddie Gray boom,

4364
02:06:43,271 --> 02:06:45,370
or that kid in Ferguson,

4365
02:06:45,490 --> 02:06:46,120
boom,

4366
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:46,810
Michael Brown,

4367
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:47,321
boom.

4368
02:06:47,321 --> 02:06:50,080
It's just like catches and
then the fucking protest.

4369
02:06:50,081 --> 02:06:52,810
It gets crazy and everybody just
goes nuts over say cleveland.

4370
02:06:52,811 --> 02:06:53,381
So that kind of town.

4371
02:06:53,381 --> 02:06:56,380
But it is about the South Carolina
one where the guy got shot.

4372
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:57,370
They didn't burn.

4373
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:57,671
They didn't.

4374
02:06:57,671 --> 02:06:57,951
Bri,

4375
02:06:57,951 --> 02:06:59,410
that guy got shot in the back.

4376
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:00,100
Man,

4377
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:02,620
that guy shot in the back and
there's a fucking video of it,

4378
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:06,040
but there's no crazy riots
like there are in Baltimore.

4379
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,730
It's just,

4380
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:09,020
it's mob mentality,

4381
02:07:09,021 --> 02:07:09,290
man.

4382
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:14,290
If he can get them off to to start like
calming each other down like it spreads

4383
02:07:15,081 --> 02:07:15,710
that way.

4384
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:16,071
You know what I mean?

4385
02:07:16,071 --> 02:07:17,600
Like let's take this to the streets.

4386
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:18,450
Peaceful pro.

4387
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:22,400
But if like if the controlling interest
of people start going out there and just

4388
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:24,380
like kicking in cop car windows,

4389
02:07:24,381 --> 02:07:25,370
that's the way it's going to go.

4390
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:29,060
I that found that like I
don't think there's anything
good about the method that

4391
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:29,960
was terrifying.

4392
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:30,950
Watching people like.

4393
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:31,853
And again,

4394
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:34,480
if this was so much
wrapped around like we're,

4395
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:36,280
we're writing because we're

4396
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,821
pissed off,

4397
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:37,810
we're not going to take it anymore.

4398
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,340
Like high five.

4399
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,600
You see people laughing,

4400
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,590
eating candy in the background while
they're stomping on fucking cop cars.

4401
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:46,660
And it's such like a.

4402
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:48,580
It really is terrifying.

4403
02:07:48,581 --> 02:07:49,260
It's third world,

4404
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,080
the third world.

4405
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:51,520
I think the cops leave those cars there.

4406
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,833
I really do.

4407
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:56,230
I think they leave those cards there as
like something to take their anger out

4408
02:07:56,231 --> 02:07:56,860
on.

4409
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:57,693
Leave them a ca.

4410
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:03,200
I mean in street fighter is if you give
them a cop car to destroy and they have

4411
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:06,250
those cars are insured,

4412
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,960
it's a bonus level and they,

4413
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:09,610
it gives them something to destroy.

4414
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,720
And I really think that.

4415
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:13,000
I really think that that's probably
a strategy and a lot of ways.

4416
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:14,500
Take a cop car,

4417
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:16,490
leave it in an area where you know,

4418
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,390
there's going to be some protests
and just let him fuck it up.

4419
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:20,823
You know,

4420
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:25,070
Baltimore mayor gave those who
wish to destroy space to do that.

4421
02:08:25,071 --> 02:08:26,170
I got in trouble for saying that,

4422
02:08:26,171 --> 02:08:27,280
but okay.

4423
02:08:27,281 --> 02:08:31,270
But what she said was she was criticized
because they thought that she was

4424
02:08:31,271 --> 02:08:35,200
actually giving the green light
to go ahead and riot by a mayor,

4425
02:08:35,201 --> 02:08:37,330
not trying to calm people down,

4426
02:08:37,331 --> 02:08:39,040
but instead by saying something like that,

4427
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:43,540
the the interpretation was that what
she did was she almost gave them like a

4428
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:45,670
license to go out and smash it.

4429
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:47,271
She's a black lady.

4430
02:08:47,271 --> 02:08:47,500
Yeah,

4431
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,333
she's cute.

4432
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:52,540
We gave those who wished to
destroy space to do that as well.

4433
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:53,623
Hmm.

4434
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:54,461
She's black,

4435
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:54,820
right?

4436
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:55,653
Yes.

4437
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,770
Why You keep having to bring that up,

4438
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:57,080
man,

4439
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:58,000
because she asked because she,

4440
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:58,811
I don't see color.

4441
02:08:58,811 --> 02:09:00,280
I feel because I feel bad.

4442
02:09:00,281 --> 02:09:03,370
She has to answer like
for so many things also.

4443
02:09:03,371 --> 02:09:04,204
Do you know what I mean?

4444
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:05,253
Let me read that again.

4445
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:05,741
Yeah,

4446
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:05,891
no,

4447
02:09:05,891 --> 02:09:06,724
I hear you.

4448
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:08,500
Look at what's in this quote though,

4449
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:12,910
because while trying to make sure that
we are protected from the cars and other

4450
02:09:12,911 --> 02:09:14,170
things that were going on,

4451
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:18,640
we gave those who wish to destroy space
to do that as well and we worked very

4452
02:09:18,641 --> 02:09:22,300
hard to keep that balance and to put
ourselves in the best position to

4453
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:23,260
deescalate.

4454
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:26,230
That sounds to me that
she's very pragmatic.

4455
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:26,801
See,

4456
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:28,750
know what I read it in context,

4457
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:32,530
what that sounds to me like she's a
pragmatic woman and what she did was she

4458
02:09:32,531 --> 02:09:36,310
made a calculation and decided that these
guys are going to destroy things and

4459
02:09:36,311 --> 02:09:39,490
maybe that was admitting
that they left some cop cars.

4460
02:09:39,491 --> 02:09:40,900
They're too smart.

4461
02:09:40,901 --> 02:09:41,734
Move Right?

4462
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:43,190
Take a loss for the greater good.

4463
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:43,890
Maybe you know,

4464
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:44,610
but there's the,

4465
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:45,401
you mean the greater good?

4466
02:09:45,401 --> 02:09:47,050
But they burnt a lot of shit.

4467
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,490
They smashed a lot of things.

4468
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:50,140
A lot of cops got injured.

4469
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:50,951
Fuck.

4470
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:51,820
Being a cop man.

4471
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:54,040
It's too hard this day in age.

4472
02:09:54,041 --> 02:09:54,730
Fuck that.

4473
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:55,450
We need them though.

4474
02:09:55,450 --> 02:09:56,283
That's what's crazy.

4475
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:57,091
You know,

4476
02:09:57,091 --> 02:09:58,540
I'm really going to say this
is one of the things like,

4477
02:09:58,541 --> 02:09:58,661
well,

4478
02:09:58,661 --> 02:10:00,530
who's going to do it a certain size,

4479
02:10:00,531 --> 02:10:02,350
certain personality
that's going to go do it.

4480
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:04,833
You know,

4481
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:06,750
I mean there's,

4482
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:08,320
I guess there's multiple
ports now I can do it,

4483
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:11,620
but a lot of times ends
up being the same guy.

4484
02:10:11,621 --> 02:10:12,454
You know,

4485
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:12,880
it's,

4486
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:13,920
it can you know,

4487
02:10:13,921 --> 02:10:16,930
and obviously the abusive people
or when it becomes a problem,

4488
02:10:16,931 --> 02:10:18,190
but the really calm people,

4489
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:19,510
they're super valuable,

4490
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:21,580
super valuable asset to the community.

4491
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:24,580
If you have a really good calm cop
who actually can deal with shit,

4492
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:26,380
good luck finding one of those.

4493
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:27,730
Good luck being that guy too.

4494
02:10:27,731 --> 02:10:30,430
It's a hard road and you're not going
to get nearly the respect that you feel

4495
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:33,440
like you deserve or putting your fucking
life on the line on a daily basis,

4496
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,160
breaking

4497
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,160
up family disputes and stopping crime and
break ins and fucking car jackings and

4498
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:42,080
all kinds of crazy shit
you have to deal with.

4499
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:43,580
Everybody's lying to you.

4500
02:10:43,581 --> 02:10:44,660
I mean some of the worst things.

4501
02:10:44,661 --> 02:10:45,160
I was one of the.

4502
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:50,160
When a cop really does buddy up to you
and starts like opening up his weird

4503
02:10:50,271 --> 02:10:52,010
moral like world,

4504
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,780
like where his morals are to you.

4505
02:10:53,781 --> 02:10:54,011
It's,

4506
02:10:54,011 --> 02:10:55,370
it always blows my mind.

4507
02:10:55,371 --> 02:10:56,300
I've had them say things like,

4508
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:56,920
yeah,

4509
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,820
it sucks these fucking
homeless around here.

4510
02:10:58,821 --> 02:10:58,970
You know,

4511
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:00,440
we used to be able to beat their ass,

4512
02:11:00,441 --> 02:11:02,460
but now it's like they're
watching us everywhere.

4513
02:11:02,461 --> 02:11:02,840
You know?

4514
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,673
Really.

4515
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,810
I've heard him say a one guy was bragging
to me that he's never had even tried

4516
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:09,710
out.

4517
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:13,650
I was smoking weed in his presence and
he was a guy I wish I could smoke again,

4518
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:13,851
man,

4519
02:11:13,851 --> 02:11:14,151
but you know,

4520
02:11:14,151 --> 02:11:15,410
they just test this all the time.

4521
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:15,651
He goes,

4522
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:16,970
but you can check my arrest records,

4523
02:11:16,971 --> 02:11:17,121
man.

4524
02:11:17,121 --> 02:11:19,610
I've never had a never
arrested anyone for.

4525
02:11:19,611 --> 02:11:21,530
We'd never arrested for a Dui.

4526
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:22,300
And I was like,

4527
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:22,870
what?

4528
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:25,280
Like no man,

4529
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,450
like every Dui.

4530
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:27,611
Yeah,

4531
02:11:27,611 --> 02:11:27,931
exactly.

4532
02:11:27,931 --> 02:11:30,210
It be trying to court make
some correlation to me that I,

4533
02:11:30,211 --> 02:11:32,620
that I saw got drunk on
the road there at night,

4534
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:35,300
pretty short drunk sinking or
whether or not she'd call them.

4535
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:37,560
And so I got beside him in the lane,

4536
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:39,530
backed up and stayed behind them,

4537
02:11:39,590 --> 02:11:41,300
watching them weave in
and out of the land.

4538
02:11:41,301 --> 02:11:44,770
I couldn't tell if he was drunk or he's
tired because you keep it up for awhile

4539
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:47,360
and then he would drift and then
they come back in and keep it up.

4540
02:11:47,361 --> 02:11:48,194
And then he was good.

4541
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,431
It was hard to tell,

4542
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:50,450
but it's disturbing.

4543
02:11:50,451 --> 02:11:51,050
It's fuck.

4544
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:54,260
It's like all these cars are flying
around going 70 miles an hour and this one

4545
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:56,390
guy is not fully in control.

4546
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:00,590
I had to call a few times just because
every time I come home it's that time,

4547
02:12:00,591 --> 02:12:04,220
you know the bars are closing and so
once in a while you just have to do it

4548
02:12:04,221 --> 02:12:05,480
because you see how bad it is.

4549
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:05,990
Like all right,

4550
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,920
that's ridiculous.

4551
02:12:06,921 --> 02:12:07,910
I called in once,

4552
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:08,901
called him once,

4553
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:09,820
coming down the one-on-one.

4554
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:12,440
Some fucking guy was just taking two,

4555
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:13,580
three lanes at a time,

4556
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:17,690
just go straight across and then
back on straight for a little bit,

4557
02:12:17,691 --> 02:12:21,410
a little bit of wiggle drift
to the right back on straight,

4558
02:12:21,411 --> 02:12:21,741
straight,

4559
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,240
straight way.

4560
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:26,530
I mean he was fucked up and I knew that
that guy was going to crash and I called

4561
02:12:26,531 --> 02:12:27,290
the cops.

4562
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:28,123
I don't know what happened,

4563
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:29,030
never saw it.

4564
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,870
I did watch a guy.

4565
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:34,900
I was going 70 miles an hour and this
guy fucking flew by me on the highway the

4566
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:35,631
other day,

4567
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:36,840
just one long.

4568
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:37,880
And I was like,

4569
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:38,990
what the fuck?

4570
02:12:38,991 --> 02:12:39,280
I mean,

4571
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:39,860
dude,

4572
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:43,040
it was a crowded highway and
dude had to be going a buck 20,

4573
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:43,880
easy,

4574
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:48,880
easy buck 20 and then right behind him
the fucking cops were racing him the

4575
02:12:50,391 --> 02:12:51,171
entire time.

4576
02:12:51,171 --> 02:12:55,490
This asshole like thought he was like
being Joe Slick and driving fast with a

4577
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,470
car behind him and that car was a cop car.

4578
02:12:58,030 --> 02:12:58,350
So they,

4579
02:12:58,350 --> 02:13:00,150
they hit the lights and
they're right behind them.

4580
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:01,761
Oh my God.

4581
02:13:01,761 --> 02:13:03,860
He was driving so fast
because I was watching this.

4582
02:13:03,861 --> 02:13:04,131
I was like,

4583
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:06,470
this is not like an empty
road on the way to Vegas.

4584
02:13:06,471 --> 02:13:08,510
There's no one in front of you and
your fucking listening to radar.

4585
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:09,350
Love this.

4586
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:11,930
This is the one on one in Hollywood,

4587
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:12,501
you know,

4588
02:13:12,501 --> 02:13:13,700
at 7:30 at night,

4589
02:13:13,701 --> 02:13:16,970
very crowded road and this
guy was following Elian.

4590
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,170
It's so that the
scientists in on that shit.

4591
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:21,951
You know what I mean?

4592
02:13:21,951 --> 02:13:22,784
Like those things,

4593
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:23,390
they don't.

4594
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:24,440
They end bad a lot.

4595
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:24,861
Yeah,

4596
02:13:24,861 --> 02:13:25,694
they do.

4597
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:29,720
Car Chases are fucking terrifying for
cops to imagine if you're a company

4598
02:13:29,721 --> 02:13:32,740
plowing or someone and kill them when
you're trying get some bad guy flood.

4599
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:33,743
It happens.

4600
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,860
Of course it happens with your
fucking going 150 miles an hour,

4601
02:13:37,170 --> 02:13:39,350
whatever the hell you going
going around corners and how,

4602
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:41,430
how good exactly as they're driving.

4603
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:43,260
Did you oversee the,

4604
02:13:43,261 --> 02:13:44,094
uh,

4605
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:49,340
those videos of cops getting hit by
cars while they're like checking ids and

4606
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:49,921
said,

4607
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:50,460
oh yeah,

4608
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:51,230
that's awful.

4609
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:51,451
I mean,

4610
02:13:51,451 --> 02:13:53,100
where they stand for that is ridiculous.

4611
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:54,990
Almost most of them don't do that anymore.

4612
02:13:54,991 --> 02:13:56,130
They stand on the outside,

4613
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:57,690
they go on the other side.

4614
02:13:58,110 --> 02:14:00,300
But there's a danger issue,

4615
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:00,941
you know,

4616
02:14:00,941 --> 02:14:02,610
like when you're approaching cars,

4617
02:14:02,611 --> 02:14:03,840
you've got to see someone's hands.

4618
02:14:03,841 --> 02:14:06,180
You got to make sure that they
don't have any weapons on them.

4619
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:08,340
Every cop has to approach every car.

4620
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:08,551
Like,

4621
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:10,740
this is the guy that might keep
you from seeing your family.

4622
02:14:10,741 --> 02:14:11,460
Again,

4623
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,140
that's just a crazy job,

4624
02:14:13,141 --> 02:14:13,890
man.

4625
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:15,330
It's a crazy way to make a living.

4626
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:17,160
It is a shame because
they said those videos.

4627
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,360
That's why I said I've,

4628
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:22,620
I've actually never had cops be very
helpful to me or nice to me ever.

4629
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:23,960
It's very rare.

4630
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:24,360
Yeah.

4631
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:24,961
It's very weird.

4632
02:14:24,961 --> 02:14:25,160
I.

4633
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:25,993
Well Look at you.

4634
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,360
You look like a fucking monster.

4635
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:27,730
I mean,

4636
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:28,120
yeah,

4637
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:30,380
it's a fucking torture basement.

4638
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:32,350
This brass again.

4639
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:32,881
What's,

4640
02:14:32,881 --> 02:14:33,060
uh,

4641
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:33,600
what's under that?

4642
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:34,160
Carson,

4643
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:34,620
Jay,

4644
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:35,011
nothing.

4645
02:14:35,011 --> 02:14:35,770
It's just carpet.

4646
02:14:35,770 --> 02:14:36,511
Just 14.

4647
02:14:36,511 --> 02:14:41,330
Philippians boys were pulled from a
trunk and this man's do from pope fixing

4648
02:14:41,331 --> 02:14:42,000
that.

4649
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,060
Bring up the gimp guys
putting up the gimp.

4650
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:45,480
You one of the guys,

4651
02:14:45,481 --> 02:14:45,840
right?

4652
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,400
A grown man with long hair.

4653
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:47,730
I was like,

4654
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:48,540
hm.

4655
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:50,460
You don't follow the rules,

4656
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:51,180
do you?

4657
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:52,900
What else do you not follow the rules on,

4658
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:53,430
sir?

4659
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:54,480
It's usually the button which is.

4660
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:57,030
I do play by the rules in a button.

4661
02:14:58,880 --> 02:14:59,880
Well that's the new rule.

4662
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,800
You get a man thing the top,

4663
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:03,390
like a pony pony.

4664
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,720
And then on top of the girl up here and
you heard the newest trend for women is

4665
02:15:06,721 --> 02:15:11,700
actually putting it in Old Lady Hair
Bun and actually dying your hair graze

4666
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:11,940
that.

4667
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,230
Like people are dying their hair.

4668
02:15:13,231 --> 02:15:13,580
Great.

4669
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:16,650
I met a girl that's so stupid.

4670
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:19,770
Nose rings looked weird and
that's a high pants as mom.

4671
02:15:19,771 --> 02:15:21,530
Gene shared done yet,

4672
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,380
you know,

4673
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:23,310
there's always going to be something.

4674
02:15:23,311 --> 02:15:27,180
People are always exhausted
with the options that are
available and they're just

4675
02:15:27,181 --> 02:15:27,331
like,

4676
02:15:27,331 --> 02:15:27,570
look,

4677
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:28,440
I just need something to do.

4678
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,353
I'm going,

4679
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:30,473
fuck it.

4680
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:31,020
I'm going,

4681
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:32,310
I'm going to fucking tattoo my face.

4682
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:37,020
I thought those guys on a lockup raw or
something where they tattoo their eyes.

4683
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:37,801
Oh yeah.

4684
02:15:37,801 --> 02:15:38,540
I've seen a tattoo.

4685
02:15:38,540 --> 02:15:39,720
The wetsuit on black

4686
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:41,581
dye.

4687
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:43,440
Their hair gray for the granny hair.

4688
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:44,161
Well,

4689
02:15:44,161 --> 02:15:45,750
if you're fucking hot as shit.

4690
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:46,710
Like those girls.

4691
02:15:46,711 --> 02:15:47,071
Yeah,

4692
02:15:47,071 --> 02:15:48,210
you can do silver.

4693
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:48,990
It's not even great.

4694
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:49,980
Who's going to get mad?

4695
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:51,120
Like a hot those girls.

4696
02:15:51,121 --> 02:15:51,211
Oh,

4697
02:15:51,211 --> 02:15:52,140
that's ridiculous.

4698
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,281
They're so hot.

4699
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:54,540
Who gives a fuck if they have gray hair,

4700
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:55,374
you shave your head.

4701
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:56,071
You know,

4702
02:15:56,071 --> 02:15:58,080
like I was say like when someone say,

4703
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:59,490
do you think girls attractive?

4704
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:01,890
There's a lot of girls that
are undeniably attractive,

4705
02:16:01,891 --> 02:16:03,870
but do they pass the shaved head?

4706
02:16:03,871 --> 02:16:04,770
No shirt test.

4707
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:07,440
And if a girl passes the shaved head,

4708
02:16:07,441 --> 02:16:08,280
no shirt tests,

4709
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:10,770
that's a ridiculously hot girl,

4710
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:11,430
right?

4711
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:12,810
All these girls in this,

4712
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:14,220
in this montage,

4713
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:15,660
past these shaved head,

4714
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:17,520
no shirt test like this.

4715
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:18,541
I can't say.

4716
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:19,301
I'm surprised.

4717
02:16:19,301 --> 02:16:20,280
I can't say.

4718
02:16:20,281 --> 02:16:21,600
I'm surprised that granting Harrison,

4719
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:22,921
they're hot,

4720
02:16:22,921 --> 02:16:23,440
they're hot.

4721
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,030
I'm just a fuck.

4722
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:25,020
They have black eyelashes.

4723
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,831
That's what's my point.

4724
02:16:25,831 --> 02:16:27,120
It's not even granny hair.

4725
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,021
If it's,

4726
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:29,800
if they're that hot take,

4727
02:16:29,830 --> 02:16:34,180
it doesn't take on that look like they
want to like slow it down a little there

4728
02:16:34,181 --> 02:16:35,014
too hot,

4729
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:36,213
you know?

4730
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:37,890
Try to put some roadblocks in the way.

4731
02:16:37,950 --> 02:16:38,150
Yeah.

4732
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:38,700
Like it's just,

4733
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:39,820
just too many dudes.

4734
02:16:39,821 --> 02:16:40,654
You're hitting on me.

4735
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:46,070
I'm going to fail her to
suck his Dick for ready.

4736
02:16:46,301 --> 02:16:47,920
I've got too many dicks coming my way.

4737
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:51,910
Did you see that episode of
workaholics that they talk about?

4738
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:53,680
That was so fucking good.

4739
02:16:53,681 --> 02:16:54,910
I've never watched that show before.

4740
02:16:54,911 --> 02:16:56,170
It was hilarious.

4741
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,470
Yeah,

4742
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:57,370
I didn't watch it.

4743
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:58,840
I saw some of the clips online,

4744
02:16:58,841 --> 02:16:59,571
but I didn't watch it.

4745
02:16:59,571 --> 02:17:02,410
And how much of this show is
dedicated to making fun of a.

4746
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,810
It was a lot.

4747
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:08,070
What happens is they eat pod and
throughout the thing they just,

4748
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:09,380
they're quoting you and,

4749
02:17:09,710 --> 02:17:10,510
and then.

4750
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:13,360
And then there was some like silly
quotes we're going to like know Joe Rogan

4751
02:17:13,361 --> 02:17:16,420
says we got to trip on
acid and do Jujitsu.

4752
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,690
I laughed my ass off.

4753
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:22,210
It's called a pea pod.

4754
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:22,961
It forward,

4755
02:17:22,961 --> 02:17:24,280
it's emphasis season five,

4756
02:17:24,281 --> 02:17:25,320
episode 12 it.

4757
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:26,770
I've watched it four times.

4758
02:17:26,771 --> 02:17:27,520
It's hilarious.

4759
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:28,450
It's a funny show,

4760
02:17:28,451 --> 02:17:29,050
man.

4761
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:30,370
I just haven't had a chance to watch it.

4762
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:30,551
Oh,

4763
02:17:30,551 --> 02:17:32,410
I barely can keep up with game of thrones.

4764
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,360
I don't have time to do anything,

4765
02:17:34,361 --> 02:17:34,511
man.

4766
02:17:34,511 --> 02:17:36,040
I'm just too fucking busy these days.

4767
02:17:36,041 --> 02:17:36,130
We,

4768
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:40,020
seth rogen and all the time we need
to Joe Rogan at once in a while.

4769
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:42,250
That's hilarious.

4770
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:43,241
That's hilarious.

4771
02:17:43,241 --> 02:17:44,074
That's an honor.

4772
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:45,003
That's an honor.

4773
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:46,173
That's really cool.

4774
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:47,801
When I saw it online,

4775
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:48,041
I was like,

4776
02:17:48,041 --> 02:17:48,281
wow,

4777
02:17:48,281 --> 02:17:49,114
that's crazy.

4778
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,830
It's funny when you go either way,

4779
02:17:50,910 --> 02:17:52,240
when you're referenced in the show.

4780
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:53,170
Like I was talking,

4781
02:17:53,171 --> 02:17:54,460
I was talking to already laying,

4782
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:55,710
uh,

4783
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:56,890
like two weeks ago or something.

4784
02:17:56,891 --> 02:17:57,280
He was,

4785
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,150
and he told me that,

4786
02:17:58,151 --> 02:17:58,984
uh,

4787
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:00,430
he thought it was an honor,

4788
02:18:00,431 --> 02:18:03,640
but you've got a reference
on Cleveland show one time,

4789
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:04,031
but it was,

4790
02:18:04,031 --> 02:18:04,930
the reference was a,

4791
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:06,280
I guess the,

4792
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,170
the mom was buying food one day at a time.

4793
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:08,411
He was like,

4794
02:18:08,411 --> 02:18:10,240
nobody buys food one day at a time,

4795
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:12,190
except for already my God.

4796
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:14,810
It's kind of a weird way
to have like a punchline.

4797
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:15,650
Shitty.

4798
02:18:15,650 --> 02:18:16,400
Yeah.

4799
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,530
Let's kind of saying you eat a lot.

4800
02:18:17,531 --> 02:18:18,364
You Fuck?

4801
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:20,193
Yeah,

4802
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:21,790
fuck say yeah.

4803
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:22,860
That shows a good show man.

4804
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:23,081
Too.

4805
02:18:23,081 --> 02:18:23,914
Funny fucking show.

4806
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:24,910
It's really well written.

4807
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:25,531
It was.

4808
02:18:25,531 --> 02:18:28,180
It was surprising because I
never had watched it before.

4809
02:18:28,190 --> 02:18:30,340
Now that in a broad city,

4810
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,180
have you ever watched that?

4811
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:31,421
It's like,

4812
02:18:31,421 --> 02:18:31,900
no.

4813
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:32,410
It's like,

4814
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:34,030
sorry man,

4815
02:18:34,031 --> 02:18:35,620
I haven't seen amy Schumer's show either.

4816
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:37,960
I keep hearing really good
things about Amy Schumer show.

4817
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:39,453
Have you seen it?

4818
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:40,270
I've watched it.

4819
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:40,720
You know,

4820
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:41,800
the cool thing about broad city,

4821
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:43,540
it's kind of like sex and the city,

4822
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:48,010
but our generation and they just
smoke weed and like do gross shit,

4823
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:50,290
but it sounds like sex in the city at all.

4824
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:51,800
It's not city.

4825
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:55,600
It's about two girls and it's just,

4826
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:56,800
you know,

4827
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:59,020
follow the pink pigs.

4828
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:00,820
Hannibal buress.

4829
02:19:01,390 --> 02:19:05,550
He plays like a guy in it that's
like a real artist and it's,

4830
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:05,771
I,

4831
02:19:05,771 --> 02:19:06,760
I highly recommend it.

4832
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:07,560
Damn.

4833
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:08,560
There's so many good shows now,

4834
02:19:08,561 --> 02:19:08,861
man.

4835
02:19:08,861 --> 02:19:11,170
This is a silicone valley's fucking great.

4836
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:14,290
I've missed a bunch of show
then you can't go back to.

4837
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:16,060
There's too many new ones coming out.

4838
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:16,371
Yeah,

4839
02:19:16,371 --> 02:19:16,721
if you.

4840
02:19:16,721 --> 02:19:17,441
If you're behind,

4841
02:19:17,441 --> 02:19:19,270
if you like never watched
all the breaking bads,

4842
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:21,520
you can't just start
with better call Saul.

4843
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:22,480
You're fucked.

4844
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:22,601
Yeah,

4845
02:19:22,601 --> 02:19:23,500
I didn't watch breaking bad.

4846
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:23,831
So yeah,

4847
02:19:23,831 --> 02:19:24,230
that's a good hair.

4848
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:24,430
I'm not,

4849
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:24,930
I don't know.

4850
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:25,600
I just don't know.

4851
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:28,160
I watched the first season
and it was really good,

4852
02:19:28,161 --> 02:19:29,180
but I just kept busy.

4853
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:31,670
It's just a matter of just
totally a matter of being busy.

4854
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:34,340
I made through dexter and that got
really disappointed at the end.

4855
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:35,310
I gave up on text.

4856
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:38,030
I finished it and it disappointing.

4857
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:39,050
Super disappointed.

4858
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:43,050
Well it got when I talked about this
100 times when John Lithgow killed a

4859
02:19:43,051 --> 02:19:45,560
chicken a bathtub and gave
her a shitty rear naked choke.

4860
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:48,050
He put her in like a
lame rear naked choke.

4861
02:19:48,051 --> 02:19:48,291
I'm like,

4862
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:48,501
Piss,

4863
02:19:48,501 --> 02:19:51,530
you are not choking anybody
with that fuck this show.

4864
02:19:51,531 --> 02:19:52,220
And I just,

4865
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:57,220
I literally got rid of the legitimacy
of mixed martial arts moves so you can't

4866
02:19:57,861 --> 02:19:58,370
just fake.

4867
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:01,430
It's like if you were doing a documentary
and Jimi Hendrix and you plant a fake

4868
02:20:01,431 --> 02:20:03,350
guitar and you didn't really
know what you're doing,

4869
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:04,610
I could tell you didn't
know what you're doing.

4870
02:20:04,611 --> 02:20:04,881
I go,

4871
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:05,900
fuck this documentary.

4872
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:06,740
You know?

4873
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:09,320
That's how I feel about John Lithgow
and his shitty run naked choke.

4874
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:11,040
Plus when you choke somebody,

4875
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:12,450
they fight back like they try.

4876
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:13,430
They try to stay alive.

4877
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:14,540
They're freaking the fuck out.

4878
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:16,850
You don't just stay in
place so you could do it.

4879
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:17,631
They fight,

4880
02:20:17,631 --> 02:20:18,560
they kicked their legs,

4881
02:20:18,561 --> 02:20:19,970
they fucking thrash around.

4882
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:23,030
It looks like Elizabeth Berkley
in that coke seen the pool,

4883
02:20:23,031 --> 02:20:25,220
which was trying to bang kyle mclachlan.

4884
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:27,150
Whenever she's flying around,

4885
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:28,790
really look like if someone's,

4886
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:29,900
if you're trying to choke somebody,

4887
02:20:29,901 --> 02:20:30,711
they would start kicking.

4888
02:20:30,711 --> 02:20:32,480
They've realized their life is in danger.

4889
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:33,643
They don't just

4890
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:37,730
join third rock and kill me.

4891
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:38,541
I love you.

4892
02:20:38,541 --> 02:20:40,730
And Harry and the Hendersons
the fuck Outta here.

4893
02:20:40,731 --> 02:20:41,540
He's not a killer.

4894
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:43,310
Stop too much.

4895
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:43,881
You know,

4896
02:20:43,881 --> 02:20:44,990
I don't want to typecast the man,

4897
02:20:44,991 --> 02:20:46,280
but the fuck out of here.

4898
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:49,070
You didn't like him in
that at all that you know.

4899
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:49,670
Oh Wow.

4900
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,151
I really did.

4901
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:50,984
Look,

4902
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:54,170
my favorite season to couldn't get
past the Shitty Jujitsu technique.

4903
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,080
I can't believe that.

4904
02:20:57,081 --> 02:20:58,520
I wish they would redo it.

4905
02:20:58,530 --> 02:20:59,850
Like Greek or deny it.

4906
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:00,703
Star Wars.

4907
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:01,910
Who shot first or something?

4908
02:21:01,911 --> 02:21:03,620
Just a fixed that scene for you?

4909
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,400
Nope.

4910
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:05,233
Nope.

4911
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,780
No.

4912
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:06,051
I mean,

4913
02:21:06,051 --> 02:21:06,441
was he good?

4914
02:21:06,441 --> 02:21:06,951
Other than that,

4915
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:08,060
the show was already know the show.

4916
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:09,870
The show got shitty right from there.

4917
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:11,210
Pretty much what happened.

4918
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:13,160
It was so good at one point in time,

4919
02:21:13,161 --> 02:21:17,030
but something happened and it just
got really off the rails every year.

4920
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:20,740
They kept exposing like an
end of series secret and then.

4921
02:21:20,990 --> 02:21:24,260
And then when they get another season
they'd have to incorporate that into the

4922
02:21:24,261 --> 02:21:24,650
store.

4923
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:25,101
You know what I mean?

4924
02:21:25,101 --> 02:21:28,850
So it was like his sister
was never supposed to find
out he did that and then it

4925
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:31,450
was like multiple seasons
of her knowing he was a,

4926
02:21:31,650 --> 02:21:32,130
you know what I mean?

4927
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:36,890
Like they got over it very quickly as
a cop killed his spoiler alert when it

4928
02:21:36,891 --> 02:21:37,820
killed his wife.

4929
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:39,111
When it goes wife,

4930
02:21:39,111 --> 02:21:39,860
I was like,

4931
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:41,770
when I think a lot of
people always like that,

4932
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:46,280
should've mentioned when
John Lithgo killed his wife.

4933
02:21:46,281 --> 02:21:47,114
Really?

4934
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:48,560
I didn't know that ups

4935
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:51,433
the ending of that.

4936
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:57,080
Here's the Shitty rear naked choke lit
piss poor Jujitsu techniques or you're

4937
02:21:57,261 --> 02:21:58,220
not even flexing.

4938
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,240
He's not even a flexing.

4939
02:21:59,241 --> 02:22:02,690
I just had a bathtub that
I could do that in person.

4940
02:22:03,410 --> 02:22:04,910
That bathtub.

4941
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:07,880
It'd be way easier to get a bath
tub to do that and then to do that.

4942
02:22:07,881 --> 02:22:08,301
If you do that,

4943
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:09,081
you have to kill somebody.

4944
02:22:09,081 --> 02:22:09,800
Okay.

4945
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:10,550
Do you have a good math?

4946
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:10,731
Yeah.

4947
02:22:10,731 --> 02:22:11,564
I'm sure you do.

4948
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,533
Good bath.

4949
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:13,420
Yeah.

4950
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,031
Get a bath tub,

4951
02:22:14,031 --> 02:22:14,300
son.

4952
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:14,510
Hey,

4953
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:15,620
this is America still.

4954
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:19,250
No one's ever said that.

4955
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:25,010
Freestyle from the movie and now who
played Biggie and how did this kid was?

4956
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:25,680
Good?

4957
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,131
11,

4958
02:22:26,131 --> 02:22:28,350
2011 as a four year old movie.

4959
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,120
Yeah.

4960
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,000
It's been around for a long time.

4961
02:22:30,001 --> 02:22:31,080
We're getting here is freestyle.

4962
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:33,800
Oh,

4963
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:34,633
want to hear this

4964
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:35,550
battle?

4965
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:36,383
Stop running.

4966
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:37,961
Stop talking.

4967
02:22:37,961 --> 02:22:38,650
Shit.

4968
02:22:38,650 --> 02:22:39,483
Whoa.

4969
02:22:39,820 --> 02:22:40,070
Oh,

4970
02:22:40,070 --> 02:22:41,320
they're angry with each other.

4971
02:22:42,580 --> 02:22:43,760
This is really happening.

4972
02:22:44,110 --> 02:22:49,110
I don't want to see in the
streets and videos can be,

4973
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:53,120
y'all know who killed

4974
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,760
Dj on the streets.

4975
02:22:58,010 --> 02:23:01,090
Just handed me a microphone
in the middle of the street.

4976
02:23:01,410 --> 02:23:01,860
Is that.

4977
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,750
Let me tell you those
stories by the football.

4978
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:06,640
Prepare for like Mr. Clean,

4979
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:07,851
fresh,

4980
02:23:07,851 --> 02:23:09,680
like average springs around.

4981
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,840
I'm raining and it's coming
from the new suite on a mic.

4982
02:23:15,221 --> 02:23:17,450
So you might get to play slow jams.

4983
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:19,123
Your

4984
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:23,290
friends talking shit to him.

4985
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:27,040
This was little camp.

4986
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:32,170
Now piggy takes the mind.

4987
02:23:33,310 --> 02:23:34,510
Let's hear what he has to say.

4988
02:23:34,511 --> 02:23:35,830
I assume it will be better.

4989
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:39,900
Let's start wrapping your what I'm saying.

4990
02:23:39,901 --> 02:23:40,730
Shit.

4991
02:23:40,730 --> 02:23:41,640
Y'All

4992
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:48,420
niggas want to know how I lived my life.

4993
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:49,433
Making money.

4994
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:54,203
The microphone

4995
02:23:56,130 --> 02:23:57,590
close to Salt Lake.

4996
02:23:57,980 --> 02:23:58,960
Come step into me.

4997
02:23:59,130 --> 02:23:59,963
That's what

4998
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,613
comes to mind.

4999
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:04,880
Like Tina Turner

5000
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:10,950
because she will sweep even the guy who's

5001
02:24:11,150 --> 02:24:11,821
tended to be big.

5002
02:24:11,821 --> 02:24:12,654
He is awesome.

5003
02:24:12,710 --> 02:24:13,010
Yeah.

5004
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:14,610
It's just more comfortable to listen to.

5005
02:24:14,611 --> 02:24:15,444
It's relaxing.

5006
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:18,470
Well if you listen to
like biggie's real shit,

5007
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:22,670
like if you ever seen the video of him
freestyling when he was 16 years old,

5008
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:24,410
that's where you got to see Brooklyn.

5009
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,490
So go to this,

5010
02:24:25,730 --> 02:24:27,620
being able to just spit till that,

5011
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:31,610
go to the Goto Biggie
when he was 16 years old.

5012
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:32,331
Is that it?

5013
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:32,690
Yeah.

5014
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:32,871
Oh,

5015
02:24:32,871 --> 02:24:33,740
you play this?

5016
02:24:58,710 --> 02:24:59,543
God

5017
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:18,540
Damn.

5018
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,023
Keep going.

5019
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:38,240
Damn.

5020
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:39,140
That's 17.

5021
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:40,340
How good was he?

5022
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:42,040
The son,

5023
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:46,550
but freestyle know that there's
not sec roast roast jokes,

5024
02:25:46,551 --> 02:25:47,570
but how about the fact?

5025
02:25:47,571 --> 02:25:47,901
First of all,

5026
02:25:47,901 --> 02:25:48,734
it's not freestyle

5027
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:51,133
freestyle.

5028
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:52,280
Those were written rhymes.

5029
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:53,780
He freestyles are.

5030
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:54,703
A lot of them are,

5031
02:25:54,770 --> 02:25:58,340
but it's like being able to flow like
on the point and then have the right

5032
02:25:58,400 --> 02:25:59,270
things to say,

5033
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:00,290
but that's just.

5034
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:02,030
You just got to appreciate
what he just did.

5035
02:26:02,031 --> 02:26:02,340
Like what?

5036
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:03,860
He just did a microphone.

5037
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:05,090
Old schooling microphone.

5038
02:26:05,091 --> 02:26:05,770
Like Chris Rock,

5039
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:07,090
one of those posters.

5040
02:26:07,230 --> 02:26:08,810
You Know Lenny Bruce,

5041
02:26:08,811 --> 02:26:09,870
those old ones.

5042
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:10,723
He's got one of those.

5043
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:14,360
He's standing on a corner in front of a
grocery store on the street and there's

5044
02:26:14,361 --> 02:26:18,320
people all around them and there's an
actual rap rap battle going on on the

5045
02:26:18,321 --> 02:26:19,154
corner.

5046
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:19,900
I mean that.

5047
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:21,460
That's one of the greatest video.

5048
02:26:21,550 --> 02:26:25,280
A Korean guy just loading buck
shots into a flooded in bedstuy.

5049
02:26:25,310 --> 02:26:28,040
That's one of the greatest videos
in the history of pop culture.

5050
02:26:28,041 --> 02:26:31,340
You want to talk about a talented
motherfucker in his environment,

5051
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,121
the environment.

5052
02:26:32,121 --> 02:26:32,691
When we were,

5053
02:26:32,691 --> 02:26:36,780
he developed and grew and you see how
good he is and in his hand he's got notes,

5054
02:26:36,781 --> 02:26:38,420
stewed and his left hand.

5055
02:26:38,421 --> 02:26:39,620
He's got his fucking lyrics,

5056
02:26:39,621 --> 02:26:39,980
man.

5057
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:41,300
Most likely look at that.

5058
02:26:41,330 --> 02:26:41,481
I mean,

5059
02:26:41,481 --> 02:26:42,710
whatever he's holding in his hand.

5060
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,260
I would assume that
that's probably as notes.

5061
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:47,150
Yeah.

5062
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:49,460
I never even noticed that
in the sand before the cash.

5063
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:50,431
It could be cash,

5064
02:26:50,431 --> 02:26:51,151
but it's weird shape.

5065
02:26:51,151 --> 02:26:51,351
Money.

5066
02:26:51,351 --> 02:26:52,700
It's like Bolivian money or some shit.

5067
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:54,620
Yeah.

5068
02:26:54,620 --> 02:26:55,760
I mean it doesn't look like cash.

5069
02:26:55,761 --> 02:26:56,390
Right?

5070
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:57,380
It looks like notes.

5071
02:26:57,410 --> 02:27:00,290
It looks like he's got a notepad
or maybe it might be one towel.

5072
02:27:00,291 --> 02:27:01,100
Yeah,

5073
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:01,940
that's one thing.

5074
02:27:01,941 --> 02:27:02,930
He always was sweaty.

5075
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:05,810
He's a bad motherfucker dude.

5076
02:27:05,811 --> 02:27:09,110
I mean it's just amazing to see
how good his flow was at 17.

5077
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:10,220
He's my all time.

5078
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:11,870
My all time favorite rapper.

5079
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:12,890
That's right there.

5080
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:13,640
Him and Nas.

5081
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:16,010
Nas is like my all time best lyricist.

5082
02:27:16,370 --> 02:27:19,220
I think Nas was like the most
complex and the most like,

5083
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:21,330
like I would listen to
Nas lyrics and girl,

5084
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:22,430
God damn,

5085
02:27:22,431 --> 02:27:23,270
this dude's brilliant.

5086
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,920
Just brilliant lyrics.

5087
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:26,443
But uh,

5088
02:27:26,450 --> 02:27:26,841
you know,

5089
02:27:26,841 --> 02:27:28,040
a band that doesn't get enough.

5090
02:27:28,041 --> 02:27:28,240
Uh,

5091
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:29,061
a group rather,

5092
02:27:29,061 --> 02:27:29,841
it doesn't get enough credit.

5093
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:33,680
Gangstarr doing great dude.

5094
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:34,221
Fuck.

5095
02:27:34,221 --> 02:27:35,300
They were amazing.

5096
02:27:35,810 --> 02:27:39,020
Gangstarr was this fucking great arena.

5097
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:40,233
Yeah.

5098
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:41,450
Started Locke wrote,

5099
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:42,830
but it was the worst ever.

5100
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:43,940
Nice and smooth.

5101
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:45,463
Nice and smooth.

5102
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:45,830
You remember?

5103
02:27:45,830 --> 02:27:48,980
Nice and smooth enough junkies where
they use the partridge family song.

5104
02:27:49,060 --> 02:27:49,430
Oh,

5105
02:27:49,430 --> 02:27:50,210
you've heard that?

5106
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:50,541
No,

5107
02:27:50,541 --> 02:27:51,374
I haven't.

5108
02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:53,810
Apps and they were nice and smooth world.

5109
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:55,910
If you like a Butthole,

5110
02:27:55,911 --> 02:27:57,620
I blocked it out if you like,

5111
02:27:57,621 --> 02:27:58,430
um,

5112
02:27:58,430 --> 02:27:59,270
gangstarr there.

5113
02:27:59,271 --> 02:28:00,104
The song.

5114
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:00,331
Okay.

5115
02:28:00,331 --> 02:28:01,820
I might not actually know about this.

5116
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:04,370
They did this song dwek through or,

5117
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,403
or.

5118
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:07,060
Well,

5119
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:07,520
I don't know.

5120
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:07,940
Go to.

5121
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:09,650
Sometimes I'm slow
sometimes where I'm quick.

5122
02:28:09,651 --> 02:28:10,190
You don't remember that.

5123
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:11,830
So I do remember that.

5124
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:12,681
See?

5125
02:28:12,681 --> 02:28:14,690
But that's kind of like what year was.

5126
02:28:14,691 --> 02:28:16,460
These guys are so not in the mix.

5127
02:28:16,461 --> 02:28:16,571
They,

5128
02:28:16,571 --> 02:28:16,820
they,

5129
02:28:16,820 --> 02:28:17,990
they actually grew old.

5130
02:28:18,110 --> 02:28:19,340
No one killed them or nothing.

5131
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,160
Doing

5132
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:22,993
fantastic.

5133
02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:24,070
401Ks.

5134
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:24,913
Yeah.

5135
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,671
What does that say?

5136
02:28:25,671 --> 02:28:26,504
Ninety one,

5137
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:29,150
91 man.

5138
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:30,140
I was out of the loop.

5139
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:35,180
That was like when I was struggling
hardcore as a comedian dog.

5140
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:37,250
That was three years
into my comedy career.

5141
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:38,560
I was doing nothing but doing standup.

5142
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:38,960
I didn't.

5143
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:41,210
I didn't go to any clubs
where I would ever hear this.

5144
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:42,650
If you want to chuckle,

5145
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:46,370
play the first verse of Hip Hop Junkies.

5146
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:48,170
It's reasonable about lyrics.

5147
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:50,580
He says everything is nonsequitor.

5148
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:52,070
It's not a cool thing.

5149
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,180
He just says words that rhyme there.

5150
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,460
That's like zero.

5151
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:56,480
Nothing makes any sense.

5152
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:58,130
Ninety one.

5153
02:28:58,130 --> 02:29:00,600
So when I lost my virginity till
the audio for the youtube videos,

5154
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:03,380
it doesn't get as these fucks a podcast.

5155
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:04,243
Audio should be able to hear.

5156
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:05,113
Okay.

5157
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:07,340
Do you think nice and smooth?

5158
02:29:07,490 --> 02:29:12,080
Does they do drm list for us?

5159
02:29:12,081 --> 02:29:12,914
Let's hear this.

5160
02:29:13,290 --> 02:29:13,660
No,

5161
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:14,493
I don't hear anything.

5162
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,550
We don't hear anything,

5163
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:20,103
so let's give it up.

5164
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:21,910
Oh,

5165
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:23,210
is this in living color is.

5166
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:24,641
Oh Wow.

5167
02:29:24,641 --> 02:29:25,750
In living color.

5168
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:31,350
Then I remember this.

5169
02:29:31,410 --> 02:29:33,810
Do you remember this down?

5170
02:29:33,970 --> 02:29:34,803
Wow.

5171
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:37,900
Okay.

5172
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:40,810
See I went for a period of a
few years where I never want.

5173
02:29:40,811 --> 02:29:42,610
I watch very little TV.

5174
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:47,840
I didn't watch much pop culture stuff.

5175
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:53,380
I don't know this at all.

5176
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,500
Oracle was a great big whale.

5177
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,450
I knew a girl who broke the scale.

5178
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:00,821
Man.

5179
02:30:00,821 --> 02:30:01,930
Check out the fly girls.

5180
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,073
Hmm.

5181
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:07,091
He,

5182
02:30:07,091 --> 02:30:08,020
they were sagging.

5183
02:30:08,270 --> 02:30:10,060
They were sagging even way back then.

5184
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:11,183
Whoa.

5185
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:12,790
So this is 91.

5186
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:16,690
Shawn Wayans was 20 years
from doing an open mic.

5187
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:18,323
Yeah.

5188
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:21,410
How dare you.

5189
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,370
He's a nice fellow.

5190
02:30:22,430 --> 02:30:23,510
Sw One.

5191
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,061
Okay.

5192
02:30:26,061 --> 02:30:27,890
You can stop this before we all die.

5193
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:30,500
Die Of fucking shitty music overload.

5194
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:31,730
Black eyes and orange chats.

5195
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:32,900
Remember those days?

5196
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:35,510
Now compare that to big when he was 17.

5197
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,373
Place more of that.

5198
02:30:37,250 --> 02:30:38,083
Play this.

5199
02:30:41,640 --> 02:30:45,730
I bet if black people kept dressing
like heavy d or like a different world,

5200
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,300
there wouldn't be people
getting killed in the street.

5201
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:49,330
It looks like you're just playing golf.

5202
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,870
Really stressed.

5203
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:53,520
Like a little kid.

5204
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:53,920
Black Kid.

5205
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:54,753
School sector.

5206
02:30:55,450 --> 02:30:55,650
Alright.

5207
02:30:55,650 --> 02:30:56,483
Alright.

5208
02:30:57,070 --> 02:30:57,231
No,

5209
02:30:57,231 --> 02:30:58,570
come comparison.

5210
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:01,060
I did not like that other stuff's now.

5211
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:01,241
No,

5212
02:31:01,241 --> 02:31:02,074
it was horrible.

5213
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:03,423
The worst ever.

5214
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:05,770
I think that's probably the
one of the worst rappers ever.

5215
02:31:06,910 --> 02:31:08,260
I tried to concentrate on the best.

5216
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:09,550
I try to see the best in things.

5217
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:11,130
Jokers exception of like maybe like,

5218
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:11,350
uh,

5219
02:31:11,350 --> 02:31:13,600
didn't like dee dee ramone make a
rap album or something like that.

5220
02:31:13,630 --> 02:31:15,410
Who's Didi ramone from the ramones?

5221
02:31:15,411 --> 02:31:15,920
No Way.

5222
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:16,661
Joey ramone.

5223
02:31:16,661 --> 02:31:17,301
Didi Ramone,

5224
02:31:17,301 --> 02:31:17,830
yeah.

5225
02:31:17,830 --> 02:31:19,890
Do you remember when he
was on heroin made a rap?

5226
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:21,330
A rap video?

5227
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:22,360
I thought no.

5228
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:24,450
I'm pretty sure why.

5229
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:25,620
Because he was on heroin.

5230
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:27,091
Heroin,

5231
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:27,510
money.

5232
02:31:27,510 --> 02:31:31,200
Didn't Chris Cornell from soundgarden
make some really bad pop album?

5233
02:31:31,850 --> 02:31:32,910
Like really poppy,

5234
02:31:32,911 --> 02:31:34,920
Britney Spears III type music?

5235
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:37,980
I don't know.

5236
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:38,813
What is this?

5237
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:39,940
What are you playing?

5238
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:40,200
Ed?

5239
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:40,621
Kangaroos.

5240
02:31:40,621 --> 02:31:41,454
Rap Album.

5241
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,420
No Way.

5242
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:45,300
This is Didi ramone.

5243
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:46,861
Let's see.

5244
02:31:46,861 --> 02:31:48,840
You see young is what he called himself.

5245
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:54,253
Got to see him.

5246
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:55,071
Stop.

5247
02:31:55,071 --> 02:31:55,580
Stop this.

5248
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:56,241
Stop this right now.

5249
02:31:56,241 --> 02:31:56,700
Stop talking.

5250
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:56,771
Yeah.

5251
02:31:56,771 --> 02:31:57,120
Tim,

5252
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:57,531
do you remember?

5253
02:31:57,531 --> 02:31:58,364
Oh my God.

5254
02:31:58,550 --> 02:31:59,241
What do you think?

5255
02:31:59,241 --> 02:32:00,650
This is like he's being silly.

5256
02:32:00,651 --> 02:32:00,861
I mean,

5257
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:04,190
he got up and his place is a
mess in this pizza on the floor.

5258
02:32:04,191 --> 02:32:05,870
He's lived in that rock
and roll lifestyle.

5259
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:07,071
Oh God,

5260
02:32:07,071 --> 02:32:07,904
this is awful.

5261
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:09,050
Okay.

5262
02:32:09,050 --> 02:32:09,590
Stop it.

5263
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:10,423
Stop at.

5264
02:32:10,790 --> 02:32:11,840
What was the other one that we just said?

5265
02:32:11,870 --> 02:32:12,051
Oh,

5266
02:32:12,051 --> 02:32:13,670
the Chris Cornell stuff that went down.

5267
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:14,533
I remember that.

5268
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:18,500
It was like wild widely
decided that that was good,

5269
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:21,040
but he was so fucking
good and soundgarden,

5270
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:23,000
it's hard to imagine
it was bad in anything,

5271
02:32:23,630 --> 02:32:24,020
you know,

5272
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:27,050
listen to blow up the
outside world and go look.

5273
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:29,090
That kind of gets a pass forever.

5274
02:32:29,330 --> 02:32:30,530
If he can do that,

5275
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:30,921
you know,

5276
02:32:30,921 --> 02:32:32,660
you can try all your fucking goofy.

5277
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:33,411
Garth Brooks,

5278
02:32:33,411 --> 02:32:37,010
Chris Gaines type projects
sometimes that works.

5279
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:37,701
I mean no sugar.

5280
02:32:37,701 --> 02:32:40,160
Ray was like a quick speed metal band.

5281
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:41,180
What?

5282
02:32:41,180 --> 02:32:41,990
Sugar Ray?

5283
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:42,190
Yeah.

5284
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:45,290
They have a song called
mean machine is like,

5285
02:32:45,291 --> 02:32:45,891
there was,

5286
02:32:45,891 --> 02:32:47,300
there was there one like you know,

5287
02:32:47,510 --> 02:32:49,880
sort of radio hit and then they were like,

5288
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:50,481
you're good.

5289
02:32:50,481 --> 02:32:50,920
Look at Man,

5290
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:55,400
like cut that hair and
frosted tips and Mark Mcgrath.

5291
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:56,090
Yeah.

5292
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:58,340
How did that guy wind up on entertainment?

5293
02:32:58,341 --> 02:33:00,740
News reporter has to look at.

5294
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:02,170
He's beautiful to look at,

5295
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:03,620
but he was a really good musician,

5296
02:33:04,340 --> 02:33:05,770
but I think he probably wanted to.

5297
02:33:05,771 --> 02:33:07,090
I bet he doesn't believe in it.

5298
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:11,000
If your heart heart's probably in the
music you don't succeed with if you're.

5299
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:12,140
That happens to you.

5300
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:14,330
So he changed that style of music.

5301
02:33:14,331 --> 02:33:15,200
I just want to fly.

5302
02:33:15,201 --> 02:33:16,170
I don't think it's what he wanted to,

5303
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:17,000
if you hear his,

5304
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:17,620
the original,

5305
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:22,620
but they have like videos of like the
original way the band was and they changed

5306
02:33:23,181 --> 02:33:23,840
completely.

5307
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,340
I heard incubus did that too though.

5308
02:33:25,341 --> 02:33:26,150
I was not.

5309
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:29,150
I didn't know very much
before the radio hits,

5310
02:33:29,151 --> 02:33:32,330
but like my by my body
tells me all the time,

5311
02:33:32,331 --> 02:33:34,510
but they were like a pretty
like big into psychedelics.

5312
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,750
Like psychedelic metal band.

5313
02:33:35,751 --> 02:33:36,280
Yeah.

5314
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:36,590
Thank you.

5315
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:38,060
Bus before they did like,

5316
02:33:38,061 --> 02:33:38,301
you know,

5317
02:33:38,301 --> 02:33:41,090
wish you were here and all that stuff
like they already values to with corn and

5318
02:33:41,091 --> 02:33:41,630
deaf tone.

5319
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:43,600
They weren't Oz fest before.

5320
02:33:43,660 --> 02:33:45,890
What made them change money?

5321
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,750
Record executives come in and go,

5322
02:33:47,751 --> 02:33:48,710
you're really handsome.

5323
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:49,100
Like clean.

5324
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:51,520
Because he was like a dirt bag
to like on God and then he uses.

5325
02:33:51,580 --> 02:33:52,361
He's a pretty boy.

5326
02:33:52,361 --> 02:33:52,430
Yeah,

5327
02:33:52,430 --> 02:33:52,521
they,

5328
02:33:52,521 --> 02:33:53,750
everyone knows it was a pretty boy and,

5329
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,613
and Oh,

5330
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:55,670
that's weird.

5331
02:33:55,671 --> 02:33:56,031
Wow,

5332
02:33:56,031 --> 02:33:56,864
that's great that,

5333
02:33:56,990 --> 02:33:59,610
that's the untold stories of the music.

5334
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:01,310
Music business to manipulation.

5335
02:34:01,311 --> 02:34:02,720
Just like we were talking about movies,

5336
02:34:03,130 --> 02:34:03,380
you know,

5337
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:05,300
it's got to be a lot of that
in the music business as well.

5338
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:06,890
They're going to make it work.

5339
02:34:06,910 --> 02:34:08,830
The beauty and rappers either
when they get angry at each other,

5340
02:34:08,831 --> 02:34:11,090
they started explaining who
had the better childhood.

5341
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:11,830
They started shooting.

5342
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:15,780
You don't talking about what a mother
fucker went to private school like that's

5343
02:34:16,010 --> 02:34:18,040
always expanding on education.

5344
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:20,440
Remember that was the big thing with it.

5345
02:34:20,441 --> 02:34:22,240
I mean eventually got a super exposed,

5346
02:34:22,241 --> 02:34:23,021
but Dr Dre,

5347
02:34:23,021 --> 02:34:26,900
like right before Nwa was
wearing Makino glittery thing.

5348
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:28,450
It was like whatever they there.

5349
02:34:28,460 --> 02:34:29,111
I figured they were called.

5350
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:31,960
I just watched that welcome the
death row documentary the other day.

5351
02:34:31,961 --> 02:34:32,730
That is.

5352
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:35,770
I can't give an Nwa should ignite is just.

5353
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:37,210
That's a scary dude,

5354
02:34:37,211 --> 02:34:37,720
man.

5355
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:40,690
Was this sugar ray machine sugary
out with original thing was.

5356
02:34:40,691 --> 02:34:41,020
Yeah.

5357
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:41,853
Let me hit this.

5358
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:44,873
It's terrible.

5359
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:51,183
Whoa.

5360
02:34:51,770 --> 02:34:52,330
Yeah.

5361
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:53,800
It looks weird too.

5362
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:56,860
It's not just just looks.

5363
02:34:57,130 --> 02:34:59,050
It looks in the early nineties.

5364
02:34:59,080 --> 02:34:59,740
These guys,

5365
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:04,740
someone needs to take them out for a
hard night somewhere outside of Orange

5366
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,793
County.

5367
02:35:06,050 --> 02:35:10,040
Take them out of Laguna beach and
bring them to like have really.

5368
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:13,060
They need scars and tattoos
and some life experience.

5369
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:16,720
You can't pose a different guys
in front of that old Cadillac.

5370
02:35:16,930 --> 02:35:17,920
Just stop that.

5371
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:19,570
That does not make you slick.

5372
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:21,460
That's not your car is it?

5373
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:24,130
Is that it's not your fucking car.

5374
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:24,821
For some reason,

5375
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:28,030
I believe like Maroon five was always
Maroon five though they've actually

5376
02:35:28,031 --> 02:35:30,640
evolved with the times to go
towards more popular music.

5377
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:31,950
That does look like the comedy store,

5378
02:35:31,951 --> 02:35:32,784
Jamie.

5379
02:35:33,300 --> 02:35:33,811
Oh my God.

5380
02:35:33,811 --> 02:35:34,650
It is the comedy store,

5381
02:35:34,651 --> 02:35:35,130
isn't it?

5382
02:35:35,130 --> 02:35:35,820
No,

5383
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:37,050
it's the state that might be.

5384
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:38,220
That's the main room stage.

5385
02:35:38,221 --> 02:35:39,054
Do Small.

5386
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:39,600
No,

5387
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:40,440
just with the camera.

5388
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:41,910
It's the angle of the camera,

5389
02:35:41,911 --> 02:35:42,181
man.

5390
02:35:42,181 --> 02:35:42,960
Holy Shit.

5391
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:46,470
It is also a whole drum kit and
it's very possible we'll find out.

5392
02:35:46,490 --> 02:35:46,650
No,

5393
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:47,040
it is.

5394
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:50,760
That totally is 100 percent
stairs on each side.

5395
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:52,320
I mean if it's not,

5396
02:35:52,321 --> 02:35:54,030
it's a very similar design.

5397
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,350
Now it's the same dick.

5398
02:35:55,351 --> 02:35:57,050
A lot lights inside.

5399
02:35:57,060 --> 02:35:57,211
Yeah,

5400
02:35:57,211 --> 02:35:57,511
that's it.

5401
02:35:57,511 --> 02:35:59,040
I just was full with the camera in.

5402
02:35:59,070 --> 02:35:59,900
Wow.

5403
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:01,710
That's fucking crazy.

5404
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:04,080
That comedy store,

5405
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:07,170
main room stage has
seen all a lot of shit.

5406
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:10,820
That's what Richard Pryor film live
at the sunset strip right at that,

5407
02:36:10,821 --> 02:36:12,000
so I'm pretty sure.

5408
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:13,140
Pull that.

5409
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,940
Richard Pryor live at the sunset strip.

5410
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:16,950
I think I'm almost positive.

5411
02:36:16,951 --> 02:36:18,210
It was filmed at the comedy store.

5412
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:19,770
One of them was filmed
at the comedy store.

5413
02:36:19,790 --> 02:36:20,623
Right.

5414
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:23,350
There wasn't say the roxy.

5415
02:36:23,420 --> 02:36:23,550
Well,

5416
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:24,840
the kinison done one.

5417
02:36:24,870 --> 02:36:27,300
The Hbo Special was filmed at the roxy,

5418
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:29,160
you know,

5419
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:29,970
for whatever reason,

5420
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:32,970
probably banned from the comedy store
when it went down because he was always

5421
02:36:32,980 --> 02:36:33,813
like,

5422
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:37,680
they fucking repaired the
bullet hole in the back sign.

5423
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:38,191
I was like,

5424
02:36:38,191 --> 02:36:39,960
why did you do that?

5425
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,411
Like,

5426
02:36:40,411 --> 02:36:41,670
why would you do that?

5427
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:43,800
We'll fix that from Kennison.

5428
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:47,430
Kenny shot a gun in the
parking lot to scare dice.

5429
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:50,880
He shot the fucking sign and there
was always a bullet hole in it.

5430
02:36:51,290 --> 02:36:51,690
I was like,

5431
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:53,010
why would you fix that?

5432
02:36:53,011 --> 02:36:53,221
And like,

5433
02:36:53,221 --> 02:36:54,870
we didn't know thought
was a good idea to fix it.

5434
02:36:54,871 --> 02:36:55,950
No,

5435
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:57,331
God damn it.

5436
02:36:57,331 --> 02:36:58,410
How could you fix that?

5437
02:36:58,430 --> 02:36:58,680
They're like,

5438
02:36:58,680 --> 02:36:58,831
well,

5439
02:36:58,831 --> 02:37:00,210
there's still the whole in the back of it.

5440
02:37:00,211 --> 02:37:00,420
I'm like,

5441
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:01,440
not good enough.

5442
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:02,873
Not good enough.

5443
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:04,590
You need to leave the whole whole,

5444
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:05,633
the whole thing.

5445
02:37:05,670 --> 02:37:06,330
Where was it?

5446
02:37:06,330 --> 02:37:06,691
Hollywood,

5447
02:37:06,691 --> 02:37:07,524
palladium,

5448
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:09,500
palladium on the rest of them.

5449
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:10,710
Carlos,

5450
02:37:10,710 --> 02:37:11,543
California.

5451
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,533
Well,

5452
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:13,733
wait a minute.

5453
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:14,880
Live on the sunset

5454
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:19,190
was all done at a different
place except for one part of it.

5455
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:20,630
That's crazy.

5456
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:23,750
So wasn't on the sunset
strip and a year later.

5457
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:25,293
What?

5458
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:27,080
How is that possible?

5459
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,093
Two months later.

5460
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:29,190
Wikipedia though.

5461
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,700
So I mean it could or
how is that possible?

5462
02:37:32,710 --> 02:37:33,740
I can get lost on,

5463
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:35,990
on looking at track
listing names of comedy.

5464
02:37:35,991 --> 02:37:36,710
Albums are always the.

5465
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:37,730
But these aren't so bad,

5466
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:39,410
but sometimes they are just hilarious.

5467
02:37:39,830 --> 02:37:40,170
You know?

5468
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:42,410
Did one of the funniest
show pull up a video of it.

5469
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:46,190
You know that one of the funniest a
track listings that you know Nate Barr,

5470
02:37:46,191 --> 02:37:47,024
gatsy.

5471
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:48,710
He's very funny car.

5472
02:37:48,711 --> 02:37:49,530
My neighbor gets.

5473
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:50,301
He has a special.

5474
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:51,620
Actually it was on comedy central.

5475
02:37:51,621 --> 02:37:53,030
I heard this this last week,

5476
02:37:53,031 --> 02:37:54,440
but his album,

5477
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:55,940
the tracks are just called.

5478
02:37:55,941 --> 02:37:56,320
It was like,

5479
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:56,820
all right,

5480
02:37:56,820 --> 02:37:59,710
good start to get them to.

5481
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:03,470
It's like starting to lose them to how
the crowd was reacting to just fucking

5482
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:04,160
pretty high.

5483
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:05,050
That's a funny thing.

5484
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:06,140
Losing them now.

5485
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:06,981
Funny he's up.

5486
02:38:06,981 --> 02:38:07,790
Got Him back.

5487
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:08,220
I was like,

5488
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:09,053
got them back.

5489
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:10,330
Did you find it?

5490
02:38:10,330 --> 02:38:13,730
It is really weird how the east coast
comics in the west coast comics rarely

5491
02:38:13,731 --> 02:38:14,564
know each other,

5492
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:16,430
makes us crazy,

5493
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:17,270
so this is.

5494
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:21,530
He probably wore the same suit everywhere
and did it a bunch of different

5495
02:38:21,531 --> 02:38:22,364
locations,

5496
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:26,780
but decided not to use the ones on the
sunset strip for most of the recording.

5497
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:31,460
That's crazy and you can't really
tell because he's in a dark stage.

5498
02:38:31,550 --> 02:38:33,560
He made it just like a regular show.

5499
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:35,210
That's one thing that was really smart,

5500
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:38,960
like he didn't make the audience all
lit up like they do in these new comedy

5501
02:38:38,961 --> 02:38:39,830
central specials.

5502
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:42,710
Those motherfuckers are obsessed
with lighting the room up.

5503
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,630
They want a light everybody up like,

5504
02:38:44,631 --> 02:38:44,781
Hey,

5505
02:38:44,781 --> 02:38:45,230
fuck head.

5506
02:38:45,230 --> 02:38:47,720
That's not how it looks at a
comedy show and when you do that,

5507
02:38:47,721 --> 02:38:48,650
the audience gets weird.

5508
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:49,531
Like,

5509
02:38:49,531 --> 02:38:49,691
see?

5510
02:38:49,691 --> 02:38:49,851
Yeah,

5511
02:38:49,851 --> 02:38:51,410
you can kind of tell that's not the store.

5512
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:52,700
Yeah.

5513
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:54,320
I don't know why I did think it was.

5514
02:38:54,470 --> 02:38:55,710
I haven't seen this in a while.

5515
02:38:55,980 --> 02:39:00,350
This'll probably one of the all
time greatest comedy document.

5516
02:39:00,351 --> 02:39:00,531
I mean,

5517
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:05,531
not probably one of the all time
greatest comedy specials ever and just a

5518
02:39:06,771 --> 02:39:08,180
documentary as well,

5519
02:39:08,181 --> 02:39:09,080
kind of because you're,

5520
02:39:09,081 --> 02:39:09,914
you're sort of,

5521
02:39:10,070 --> 02:39:15,070
you're looking back into this time and
to 1982 when Richard Pryor was on fire.

5522
02:39:16,611 --> 02:39:17,030
I mean,

5523
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:18,740
just literally and physically,

5524
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:19,250
right?

5525
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:21,480
This is after he freebasing
what do you know?

5526
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:26,500
He did really get burnt and freebase
accident said he did lit himself on fire.

5527
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:31,490
The reality is he threw some liquor
on him and lit himself on fire.

5528
02:39:31,730 --> 02:39:33,830
That's what actually happened
to make a steevo way or like,

5529
02:39:33,831 --> 02:39:34,750
I'm going to end it all right now.

5530
02:39:34,751 --> 02:39:34,940
I'm good.

5531
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,271
All right.

5532
02:39:35,271 --> 02:39:35,780
Now just,

5533
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:38,360
just down in the deepest,

5534
02:39:38,361 --> 02:39:38,900
deepest,

5535
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:40,790
darkest hole after freebasing.

5536
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:42,021
That's why,

5537
02:39:42,021 --> 02:39:42,260
um,

5538
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:43,400
he admitted it later,

5539
02:39:43,430 --> 02:39:44,270
later in life,

5540
02:39:44,390 --> 02:39:44,720
you know,

5541
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:46,610
that he had tried to kill himself,

5542
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:49,520
that he lit himself on fire
and they look just after that.

5543
02:39:49,521 --> 02:39:52,880
Here he is on stage killing
and everybody loved him.

5544
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:54,740
Talk about balance.

5545
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:55,940
I mean,

5546
02:39:55,940 --> 02:39:56,773
that's like,

5547
02:39:58,260 --> 02:39:58,910
you know,

5548
02:39:58,910 --> 02:40:02,480
to be normal and have it goes cohesive
thoughts and put those things together

5549
02:40:02,481 --> 02:40:02,901
like that.

5550
02:40:02,901 --> 02:40:07,730
And then at one point this year
or a year or so before this,

5551
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:09,740
you're just in that kind
of down that rabbit hole.

5552
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:11,390
Look at backup a little bit.

5553
02:40:11,391 --> 02:40:11,751
Jamie.

5554
02:40:11,751 --> 02:40:13,440
Backup to that side view of him again.

5555
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:14,040
I want to point

5556
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:14,873
something out here.

5557
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:16,350
Watch the way he moves.

5558
02:40:16,351 --> 02:40:19,380
Like pay attention to his hands as he's
talking because we can't hear what he's

5559
02:40:19,381 --> 02:40:19,960
saying.

5560
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:21,420
Look at the rhythm to the.

5561
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:22,283
He's like doing.

5562
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:24,570
He's putting on a show with his hands,

5563
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:26,280
like while he's performing,

5564
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:31,350
his hands are moving in this
delicate controlled way that are.

5565
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:35,520
It's kind of cool to watch and it
accentuates the material itself.

5566
02:40:35,521 --> 02:40:37,020
It accentuates the joke.

5567
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:39,570
He's moving his hands through the air.

5568
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:40,800
Then it's like,

5569
02:40:40,801 --> 02:40:42,060
it's weird to watch.

5570
02:40:42,061 --> 02:40:45,210
It's like he's doing a little dance
while he's also telling the joke,

5571
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:48,600
his hands going up above his
head to emphasize things.

5572
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:49,980
Hands moving around.

5573
02:40:49,981 --> 02:40:50,161
No,

5574
02:40:50,161 --> 02:40:50,341
no,

5575
02:40:50,341 --> 02:40:50,551
no.

5576
02:40:50,551 --> 02:40:50,941
It's not.

5577
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:52,660
It's performers hands is.

5578
02:40:52,661 --> 02:40:54,610
He's just a really great standup.

5579
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,010
This is not a guy just standing
in front of a microphone talking.

5580
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:01,470
There's a way that he's moving.

5581
02:41:01,471 --> 02:41:02,400
That was also funny.

5582
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:02,760
It was like,

5583
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:04,140
it's cool to watch,

5584
02:41:04,590 --> 02:41:07,920
like there's a rhythm to the
way he would like go and,

5585
02:41:07,921 --> 02:41:10,320
and now like he's relaxing you by walking.

5586
02:41:10,530 --> 02:41:11,820
He's in between bits,

5587
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:12,300
you know,

5588
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:14,730
and now he's starting another one
of the hands start moving again.

5589
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:16,950
It's like he's doing a
puppet show or something,

5590
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:18,730
you know,

5591
02:41:18,730 --> 02:41:19,620
look at the way he moves.

5592
02:41:19,621 --> 02:41:22,200
Like we're not hearing them
so we can only see him,

5593
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:27,440
but we can hear the rhythm in the type
of material he wasn't doing just by the

5594
02:41:27,691 --> 02:41:31,010
way he's moving his
hands and there was like,

5595
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:32,370
that was part of what,

5596
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,601
what his,

5597
02:41:33,601 --> 02:41:34,680
his act was.

5598
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:35,161
It was.

5599
02:41:35,161 --> 02:41:37,530
His actual physical movements were funny.

5600
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:39,060
They were vulnerable,

5601
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:39,561
they were,

5602
02:41:39,561 --> 02:41:39,890
there were,

5603
02:41:39,890 --> 02:41:40,980
there were gentle.

5604
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:44,580
They were rhythmic and they were
hypnotic like you could use.

5605
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:47,460
There was a hypnotic aspect
to the way he actually moved,

5606
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:49,570
but it doesn't I guess.

5607
02:41:49,571 --> 02:41:50,231
I guess not all of them,

5608
02:41:50,231 --> 02:41:55,231
but a lot of good comics have that
element I think because you have to stay

5609
02:41:55,961 --> 02:42:00,961
captivating for all time and then
there's the people who get called on like

5610
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:02,351
there for you.

5611
02:42:02,351 --> 02:42:02,501
I mean,

5612
02:42:02,501 --> 02:42:03,850
that was like the dig on.

5613
02:42:04,340 --> 02:42:06,760
I came in comedy at a time where like,

5614
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:09,760
I didn't know Dane Cook enough to be like,

5615
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:11,470
oh that assholes making it,

5616
02:42:11,471 --> 02:42:12,850
but there was a lot of around me,

5617
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:13,500
people that,

5618
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:13,691
you know,

5619
02:42:13,691 --> 02:42:13,871
it's like,

5620
02:42:13,871 --> 02:42:14,111
oh,

5621
02:42:14,111 --> 02:42:18,400
he's just hurricane and jerking around
on stage and that's all it is and a bunch

5622
02:42:18,401 --> 02:42:19,001
of nonsense.

5623
02:42:19,001 --> 02:42:19,361
But I was like,

5624
02:42:19,361 --> 02:42:19,610
mom,

5625
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:20,470
I think there's something to it.

5626
02:42:20,471 --> 02:42:20,651
I mean,

5627
02:42:20,651 --> 02:42:22,260
there was definitely an element
of what he did with that.

5628
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:24,540
That was something to what he did.

5629
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:25,330
You know what I mean?

5630
02:42:25,330 --> 02:42:25,751
I'd be,

5631
02:42:25,751 --> 02:42:27,640
I'd be lying if I said Dane
Cook and make me laugh.

5632
02:42:27,641 --> 02:42:28,960
I man my life through a bunch of stuff.

5633
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:29,460
Will,

5634
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:31,730
a bunch of people enjoyed his movements,

5635
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:32,061
you know?

5636
02:42:32,061 --> 02:42:35,300
But there's a thing about
that style of comedy and like,

5637
02:42:35,301 --> 02:42:35,631
okay,

5638
02:42:35,631 --> 02:42:36,080
here's another,

5639
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:36,980
here's a better example,

5640
02:42:36,981 --> 02:42:37,431
like emo,

5641
02:42:37,431 --> 02:42:38,264
Philips,

5642
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:38,841
Emo,

5643
02:42:38,841 --> 02:42:39,261
Philips.

5644
02:42:39,261 --> 02:42:41,570
That Shit works when you're 25,

5645
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:43,490
that shit works when you're 35,

5646
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:46,130
but when you're 45 people start going,

5647
02:42:46,131 --> 02:42:46,581
hey man,

5648
02:42:46,581 --> 02:42:48,050
why you talking like that?

5649
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:48,591
You know,

5650
02:42:48,591 --> 02:42:49,820
like why you doing that?

5651
02:42:49,821 --> 02:42:52,190
Like what is that that I'm pretending,

5652
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:54,190
especially when that I know,

5653
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:57,920
especially when you pull the curtain
and you do interviews and shit.

5654
02:42:57,921 --> 02:42:58,754
Like bobcat.

5655
02:42:58,790 --> 02:43:00,500
Bobcat had abandoned his,

5656
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:01,940
his early persona.

5657
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:03,080
He's pretty open about that.

5658
02:43:03,081 --> 02:43:04,070
He talks about it but his,

5659
02:43:05,740 --> 02:43:06,450
you know,

5660
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:07,283
you know,

5661
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:07,940
he would,

5662
02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:12,100
he would have this crazy
wild fucking pulling his hair

5663
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:15,080
and screen and innovate
really funny shit it.

5664
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:15,840
Yeah.

5665
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,440
And you could watch that one.

5666
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:18,251
I don't know what it was called,

5667
02:43:18,251 --> 02:43:19,084
but I remember running into.

5668
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:21,390
We used to when I was younger
is that he's wearing like a,

5669
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:24,910
like a sleeveless cowboy shirt almost
on the cover of it and he's like super

5670
02:43:24,911 --> 02:43:27,610
sweaty and he areas area can tab Kohl's,

5671
02:43:27,611 --> 02:43:30,850
but he actually stops doing.

5672
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:33,400
He never announces it just
somewhere in the middle of the set.

5673
02:43:33,401 --> 02:43:34,000
It just,

5674
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,460
that fades away that
the character is doing.

5675
02:43:36,461 --> 02:43:37,120
Huh?

5676
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:40,930
We'd probably got annoyed with it after
awhile and putting it in the middle of

5677
02:43:40,931 --> 02:43:42,090
that actual set as well.

5678
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:43,630
I mean he still had the
long hair and everything.

5679
02:43:43,631 --> 02:43:44,464
It was like a.

5680
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,320
He was,

5681
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:45,520
yeah.

5682
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:46,450
Just stops doing in the middle.

5683
02:43:46,451 --> 02:43:48,850
Which I thought was interesting was odd,

5684
02:43:48,851 --> 02:43:51,580
but when you commit to that character
full time at you and you have to worry

5685
02:43:51,581 --> 02:43:52,180
about the emo.

5686
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:53,080
Philips is a good example.

5687
02:43:53,081 --> 02:43:55,750
I wonder about a Mitch Fatel,

5688
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:56,440
Mitch.

5689
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:57,880
Very much like A.

5690
02:43:57,881 --> 02:44:00,690
I mean like I've worked with
him and recently it's a.

5691
02:44:01,810 --> 02:44:03,190
When you starting to
show age on your face,

5692
02:44:03,191 --> 02:44:04,570
it's hard to be at the Manchild,

5693
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:05,201
you know what I mean?

5694
02:44:05,201 --> 02:44:07,010
It's still tiny guy so
it works and everything,

5695
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:10,490
but I just like how long
will it like right there.

5696
02:44:10,530 --> 02:44:12,220
There might be a very definitive

5697
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:14,663
on that.

5698
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:15,701
Yeah,

5699
02:44:15,701 --> 02:44:17,350
like a bomb shelter type ceiling.

5700
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:18,491
Yeah man.

5701
02:44:18,491 --> 02:44:19,450
Like the Emo,

5702
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:21,250
Phillips was the big one.

5703
02:44:21,670 --> 02:44:24,190
That was a big one because I remember
watching him all of a sudden just do

5704
02:44:24,191 --> 02:44:25,270
regular standup and I was like,

5705
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:28,990
but I've watched like a transitionary
time where he wasn't just doing regular

5706
02:44:28,991 --> 02:44:33,520
standup was kind of like doing a softer
version of his old self the way he used

5707
02:44:33,521 --> 02:44:34,360
to do comedy.

5708
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:35,080
He.

5709
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:35,441
Oh yeah.

5710
02:44:35,441 --> 02:44:37,120
So I'm on at midnight doing it,

5711
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:38,261
which was weird.

5712
02:44:38,261 --> 02:44:39,070
He was doing it on,

5713
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:40,000
on that show.

5714
02:44:40,001 --> 02:44:40,490
He was tall.

5715
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:41,323
He

5716
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:43,600
just very,

5717
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:44,434
very weird.

5718
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:45,011
I mean,

5719
02:44:45,011 --> 02:44:46,210
you can't fault that if it works.

5720
02:44:46,260 --> 02:44:47,450
Hi Chris Hardwick.

5721
02:44:49,950 --> 02:44:52,510
How do you properly
dispose a bacon grease?

5722
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:55,670
You gotta throw in the garbage
or you know the garbage or.

5723
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:56,471
Yeah,

5724
02:44:56,471 --> 02:44:57,251
you can throw it in the garbage.

5725
02:44:57,251 --> 02:44:58,150
Not In the pipes.

5726
02:44:58,210 --> 02:44:58,440
It's.

5727
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:58,651
Yeah.

5728
02:44:58,651 --> 02:44:59,530
Don't throw the pipes.

5729
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:00,371
It's like,

5730
02:45:00,371 --> 02:45:01,150
um.

5731
02:45:01,150 --> 02:45:02,800
I mean it's like Flash,

5732
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:03,101
you know,

5733
02:45:03,101 --> 02:45:04,930
it's like if you aren't
going to get rid of fat,

5734
02:45:05,050 --> 02:45:05,980
how would you get rid of fat?

5735
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:08,530
Throw it outside.

5736
02:45:08,531 --> 02:45:09,090
Yeah,

5737
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:11,880
I mean why would you put it on a tree?

5738
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:12,820
You mean under a tree?

5739
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:14,410
Like it's like fertilizer.

5740
02:45:14,530 --> 02:45:15,363
Just dry my dog.

5741
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:15,740
Next.

5742
02:45:15,740 --> 02:45:16,660
Turn that shit in the soap.

5743
02:45:16,661 --> 02:45:18,550
Like fight club dude bro.

5744
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,713
Yo Bro.

5745
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:23,110
These human bodies fight club or
something like that was a human fat.

5746
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:23,830
Yeah.

5747
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:25,590
Human fat from a liposuction clinic.

5748
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:30,130
I think you want to fight
club to that comic book.

5749
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,410
He wrote the book.

5750
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:33,071
Oh,

5751
02:45:33,071 --> 02:45:33,940
he just wrote the book.

5752
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:34,481
Oh,

5753
02:45:34,481 --> 02:45:35,314
is it done?

5754
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:37,980
It just came out or it's
about to come out here.

5755
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:41,350
Did the cover artwork really?

5756
02:45:41,410 --> 02:45:42,243
No Shit.

5757
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:44,200
So are they going to make another movie?

5758
02:45:44,290 --> 02:45:45,123
I hope so.

5759
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,080
Best movie ever it was.

5760
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:50,680
There's a part two that was
so not the best movie I love.

5761
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,290
Have you rewatch that horse?

5762
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:52,910
I rewatched.

5763
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:54,010
It was fun.

5764
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,870
I liked the movie heat a lot,

5765
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:57,430
but I don't want to heat too.

5766
02:45:57,640 --> 02:46:01,270
It's fun up until the moment where you
find out that he's the same guy and

5767
02:46:01,271 --> 02:46:01,690
you're like,

5768
02:46:01,690 --> 02:46:03,630
get the fuck out of here.

5769
02:46:03,631 --> 02:46:03,970
That's it.

5770
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:04,890
You watch memento.

5771
02:46:06,230 --> 02:46:07,270
Memento is good.

5772
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:10,490
You hate it that you hated
the Switcheroo so stupid.

5773
02:46:10,491 --> 02:46:10,670
Like,

5774
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:10,881
Oh,

5775
02:46:10,881 --> 02:46:11,950
you're the same guy.

5776
02:46:11,951 --> 02:46:14,780
Is this guy that you've
been falling around and he's
been teaching you to fight.

5777
02:46:14,781 --> 02:46:15,614
That's you.

5778
02:46:15,750 --> 02:46:17,660
You just forgot and now you remember,

5779
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,340
oh great,

5780
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:20,920
now you're going to blow up a building
or something stupid like the fuck out.

5781
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:22,830
When I've watched it,

5782
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:26,670
I've been convinced to
enjoy it much more as a.

5783
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:31,070
But when I saw it in the theater the
first time and that was like one of the

5784
02:46:31,071 --> 02:46:35,390
first movies in the theater I saw that
was like a little odd and different.

5785
02:46:35,391 --> 02:46:35,781
You know what I mean?

5786
02:46:35,781 --> 02:46:37,190
Like I usually just kind of went saw,

5787
02:46:37,191 --> 02:46:38,630
like whatever the blockbusters were.

5788
02:46:38,631 --> 02:46:41,420
I was pretty middle of the road
on my movie tastes at that age,

5789
02:46:41,421 --> 02:46:42,380
but like when I went to go see that,

5790
02:46:42,381 --> 02:46:42,591
I was like,

5791
02:46:42,591 --> 02:46:43,840
it was so bizarre at the ending.

5792
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:44,121
I was like,

5793
02:46:44,121 --> 02:46:44,751
I just kind of law.

5794
02:46:44,751 --> 02:46:45,990
I didn't even get it for me,

5795
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:47,160
I guess it was a safe person,

5796
02:46:47,161 --> 02:46:47,990
but I was just like,

5797
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:50,660
there's just like a weird shit at the
end of the movie and also for me falls

5798
02:46:50,661 --> 02:46:53,630
into that same sort of categories
of fake Jimi Hendrix guitar thing.

5799
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:55,520
I'm watching people beat the
shit out of each other and like,

5800
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:56,180
look,

5801
02:46:56,180 --> 02:46:57,950
nobody wants to fuck beat out of them.

5802
02:46:57,951 --> 02:47:00,440
You certainly not going to get a whole
basement of dudes willing to beat the

5803
02:47:00,441 --> 02:47:01,280
fuck out of each other.

5804
02:47:01,281 --> 02:47:02,240
It's just not going to happen.

5805
02:47:02,241 --> 02:47:02,620
And then like,

5806
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:03,030
you know,

5807
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:04,040
will die for you.

5808
02:47:04,420 --> 02:47:05,061
Let me tell you something.

5809
02:47:05,061 --> 02:47:08,240
You get hit once you get really
bare knuckled once in the face,

5810
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:10,850
very unlikely you're
going to keep doing that.

5811
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:12,100
Very unlikely.

5812
02:47:12,530 --> 02:47:14,810
Showing up at work with
black eyes all the time.

5813
02:47:14,811 --> 02:47:14,991
Like,

5814
02:47:14,991 --> 02:47:15,620
really?

5815
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:17,300
Why wouldn't you just
learn how to fight it?

5816
02:47:17,301 --> 02:47:18,081
A martial arts school?

5817
02:47:18,081 --> 02:47:18,914
You fucking idiot.

5818
02:47:19,180 --> 02:47:21,500
You got to meet with some
asshole in a parking lot.

5819
02:47:21,501 --> 02:47:23,180
You guys are going to beat
each other's brains out.

5820
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:24,390
You gotta get on top of you.

5821
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:25,430
You're pretty anymore.

5822
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:29,730
Remember that with jared Leto to beat
them bloody until his fucking face was can

5823
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:30,733
come on.

5824
02:47:31,130 --> 02:47:31,870
That's a good movie.

5825
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:32,703
I.

5826
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:34,060
what'd you feel about.

5827
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:34,900
What'd you feel about?

5828
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,830
I thought one of the
dumbest scenes to me was,

5829
02:47:36,831 --> 02:47:37,664
uh,

5830
02:47:38,830 --> 02:47:41,660
when Edward Norton was that 25th hour.

5831
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:43,700
Did you ever see that at
the end when he's like,

5832
02:47:44,030 --> 02:47:45,950
I can't go and look in
this pretty so beat me up.

5833
02:47:45,951 --> 02:47:46,370
He goes,

5834
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:49,100
you're going to be pretty
again in a couple of weeks.

5835
02:47:49,980 --> 02:47:52,150
Was going to buy your
butthole like four weeks.

5836
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:55,940
It just go and pretty and fight
that guy like to tried to fuck your.

5837
02:47:55,941 --> 02:47:57,480
But how stupid is that?

5838
02:47:58,640 --> 02:47:59,600
He's that certain.

5839
02:47:59,610 --> 02:48:01,730
He's going to get fucked
in the ass right away.

5840
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:06,230
I guarantee that some more Hollywood
fuckery that some stores has never been

5841
02:48:06,231 --> 02:48:08,750
punched and I think you
should go and beat up.

5842
02:48:08,751 --> 02:48:09,080
He's gonna.

5843
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:10,040
Get his buddy to beat him up.

5844
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:11,790
This is the big term,

5845
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:13,190
mercifully by the way,

5846
02:48:13,210 --> 02:48:13,670
it was like a.

5847
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:14,850
It was like a crazy bad.

5848
02:48:14,851 --> 02:48:16,510
You lose your vision from those sometimes.

5849
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:17,031
Sometimes you lose.

5850
02:48:17,031 --> 02:48:19,820
Your sense of smell is
guys lose their tastes.

5851
02:48:19,821 --> 02:48:22,490
They can't taste things after
they get punched in the head.

5852
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:24,550
It literally don't know
what things taste like.

5853
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:27,170
Like this idea that someone's just going
to punch you and you just get a little

5854
02:48:27,171 --> 02:48:28,010
bruised up a little.

5855
02:48:28,130 --> 02:48:29,150
It's not a Charley horse.

5856
02:48:29,151 --> 02:48:29,460
Okay.

5857
02:48:29,460 --> 02:48:31,070
He's punched in your fucking brain,

5858
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:33,320
punching where you store your brain.

5859
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:36,620
This is the container where your brain's
in and it only has so many times.

5860
02:48:36,621 --> 02:48:37,790
It could even move like that.

5861
02:48:37,850 --> 02:48:40,520
Getting bounced off the
curb the fuck out of here.

5862
02:48:41,090 --> 02:48:42,170
It's just ridiculous.

5863
02:48:43,010 --> 02:48:48,010
The trivialization of brain hemorrhaging
and brain trauma and beat downs like

5864
02:48:48,111 --> 02:48:48,351
that.

5865
02:48:48,351 --> 02:48:49,184
It's like,

5866
02:48:49,310 --> 02:48:50,510
I can't go along with that.

5867
02:48:50,511 --> 02:48:51,171
I know too much.

5868
02:48:51,171 --> 02:48:54,110
I've seen too many people get the
fucking brains beaten out of them.

5869
02:48:54,140 --> 02:48:55,310
I've seen it too many times,

5870
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:56,810
so I didn't like fight club,

5871
02:48:57,170 --> 02:48:59,300
but I didn't like it.

5872
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:00,413
You like warrior?

5873
02:49:00,710 --> 02:49:01,220
Yes,

5874
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:02,390
but it was bullshit.

5875
02:49:02,650 --> 02:49:04,010
You can't fight two days in a row,

5876
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:06,980
you just can't be so fucked
up from the first fight.

5877
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:07,823
No one gets

5878
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,630
fired back to back.

5879
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:10,170
Yes.

5880
02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:11,790
I would take back in one day.

5881
02:49:11,791 --> 02:49:12,660
Any day over that.

5882
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:13,591
Well,

5883
02:49:13,591 --> 02:49:17,100
I think fight club is a better movie
than warrior is definitely a better as a

5884
02:49:17,101 --> 02:49:17,460
movie.

5885
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:18,293
Well better,

5886
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:19,261
much better movie.

5887
02:49:19,261 --> 02:49:19,940
It's just that,

5888
02:49:19,940 --> 02:49:24,240
that one reveal I can almost deal with
the idea that these guys like were filled

5889
02:49:24,241 --> 02:49:25,051
with angst so much.

5890
02:49:25,051 --> 02:49:27,360
They were wanting to beat each other
up just so they could feel alive.

5891
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:29,580
I could kind of get that for a little bit,

5892
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:30,790
but.

5893
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:31,150
No,

5894
02:49:31,150 --> 02:49:31,370
no,

5895
02:49:31,370 --> 02:49:31,580
no,

5896
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:32,790
no one had any technique,

5897
02:49:32,850 --> 02:49:36,060
no one that doesn't make any sense to
me that guys wouldn't actually learn how

5898
02:49:36,061 --> 02:49:38,220
to fight sweet little titties.

5899
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:39,330
Um,

5900
02:49:39,330 --> 02:49:40,280
but uh,

5901
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:41,233
what was I gonna say?

5902
02:49:42,470 --> 02:49:43,303
Um,

5903
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:46,440
you bought into the fact that
they were just at the turnaround,

5904
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:47,270
the flip,

5905
02:49:47,270 --> 02:49:47,431
the,

5906
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:51,930
the reveal that it was the same guy
was just so dumb and if it gets cold,

5907
02:49:52,890 --> 02:49:54,570
you can't pretend that he was just,

5908
02:49:54,571 --> 02:49:54,790
Oh,

5909
02:49:54,790 --> 02:49:59,760
it was just a dream to make your whole
movies based on like a switcheroo.

5910
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,590
Like the whole movie is a big switcheroo.

5911
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:04,400
Did not see that latest
episodes of grey's anatomy.

5912
02:50:04,430 --> 02:50:05,010
Then when.

5913
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:07,440
Mr. Don't worry about that.

5914
02:50:07,900 --> 02:50:12,900
You do a Switcheroo oh there's that
thousand horrible switcher in that you do

5915
02:50:13,801 --> 02:50:16,110
not have to worry about me watching.

5916
02:50:16,111 --> 02:50:16,944
That's what the,

5917
02:50:16,970 --> 02:50:18,360
the ending of Dexter.

5918
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:18,960
No,

5919
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:20,570
just to the shittiest thing of all time.

5920
02:50:20,610 --> 02:50:21,960
Don't do it to me so much.

5921
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:22,823
I can't do it.

5922
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:25,080
It was horrible.

5923
02:50:25,230 --> 02:50:28,470
Well that was one of the things that I
really appreciated about the movie is

5924
02:50:28,471 --> 02:50:29,310
there's none of that.

5925
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:30,660
Every scene in that movie.

5926
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:31,780
Did you see it now?

5927
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:32,581
I'm seeing a jamie.

5928
02:50:32,581 --> 02:50:33,370
You saw tomorrow.

5929
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:34,590
That's fucking bad ass.

5930
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:36,510
It's so smart.

5931
02:50:36,511 --> 02:50:39,390
It's so well done that you
buy every step of the way.

5932
02:50:39,391 --> 02:50:40,860
Like there's never one part in the movie.

5933
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:43,050
We like get the fuck outta here
because they're dark flick.

5934
02:50:43,960 --> 02:50:45,080
It's good dude.

5935
02:50:45,090 --> 02:50:45,923
It's good.

5936
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:47,070
It's creepy.

5937
02:50:47,071 --> 02:50:47,820
It's good.

5938
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:49,380
It's like it puts you in a position like,

5939
02:50:49,381 --> 02:50:49,741
fuck.

5940
02:50:49,741 --> 02:50:50,610
I don't know man.

5941
02:50:51,050 --> 02:50:51,440
It's,

5942
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:52,180
it's about A.

5943
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:53,100
I can't tell you bitch.

5944
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:54,103
It's about Ai.

5945
02:50:54,450 --> 02:50:54,931
It's pretty.

5946
02:50:54,931 --> 02:50:56,490
It's pretty fucking good man.

5947
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:58,710
Like one of the best movies
I've seen in many years.

5948
02:50:59,490 --> 02:51:00,001
Have you seen this?

5949
02:51:00,001 --> 02:51:00,834
Elon Musk,

5950
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:02,610
the tesla firewall,

5951
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:03,661
this new,

5952
02:51:03,661 --> 02:51:06,720
very affordable solar power
battery that he's invented.

5953
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:08,410
There's 3,500 bucks.

5954
02:51:08,411 --> 02:51:09,960
They could charge a fucking whole house.

5955
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:10,570
Wow.

5956
02:51:10,570 --> 02:51:12,330
A total game changer.

5957
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:13,171
Have you seen this shit,

5958
02:51:13,171 --> 02:51:14,004
Jamie?

5959
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:14,970
It's incredible.

5960
02:51:14,971 --> 02:51:15,631
There's a video,

5961
02:51:15,631 --> 02:51:16,464
if you go on.

5962
02:51:16,650 --> 02:51:20,490
My twitter feed is a video that I
retweeted that somebody sent me a youtube

5963
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:21,810
video of him explaining it.

5964
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:27,410
It's a fucking complete total game changer
when it comes to batteries and a wall

5965
02:51:29,101 --> 02:51:30,030
mounted units.

5966
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:33,600
You can stack as many as nine
of these wall mounted units.

5967
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:34,890
That 3,500 bucks,

5968
02:51:34,891 --> 02:51:36,420
which is solar power,

5969
02:51:36,421 --> 02:51:38,670
was like really prohibitively
expensive for most people.

5970
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:39,151
Like super,

5971
02:51:39,151 --> 02:51:39,811
super expensive.

5972
02:51:39,811 --> 02:51:40,644
Those batteries,

5973
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:42,390
the techs all fucked up.

5974
02:51:42,391 --> 02:51:43,021
They stink.

5975
02:51:43,021 --> 02:51:44,130
They're all they overheat.

5976
02:51:44,131 --> 02:51:44,964
They're dangerous,

5977
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:46,860
but apparently this
fucking dude is nailed it.

5978
02:51:47,370 --> 02:51:48,203
I don't know.

5979
02:51:48,280 --> 02:51:48,520
I mean,

5980
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:50,670
I'm obviously not a fucking
expert on batteries,

5981
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:52,170
but people are very,

5982
02:51:52,171 --> 02:51:53,730
very excited about this fucking thing.

5983
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:55,420
That cars.

5984
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:56,930
We'll take our air corps to go Baltimore.

5985
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:57,510
Yeah.

5986
02:51:57,510 --> 02:51:58,321
Give us some volume.

5987
02:51:58,321 --> 02:52:00,310
We'll close out with this because
we've got to get the fuck out of here.

5988
02:52:00,390 --> 02:52:02,670
Twenty minutes long will give us
just a little bit of volume here.

5989
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:03,180
Jamie.

5990
02:52:03,180 --> 02:52:03,931
Play a little bit of.

5991
02:52:03,931 --> 02:52:05,590
It was a beautiful man.

5992
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,600
Beautiful Iron man type motherfucker.

5993
02:52:08,090 --> 02:52:12,200
We call the Tesla powerwall and if
you look back against that wall,

5994
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:14,660
you'll see a whole bunch of them
as well in different colors.

5995
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:17,730
How long for this guy
makes an iron man suit?

5996
02:52:17,731 --> 02:52:19,020
You can pick your favorite color.

5997
02:52:19,710 --> 02:52:20,330
He's Ironman

5998
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:22,640
and it looks like a beautiful
sculpture on the wall.

5999
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:25,530
So it's very important.

6000
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:29,000
I want to point out a few things
that are very important about this.

6001
02:52:29,270 --> 02:52:30,103
Um,

6002
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:32,450
the fact that it's wall mounted is,

6003
02:52:32,470 --> 02:52:36,230
is vital because it means you
don't need to have a battery room.

6004
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:39,470
He don't have to have some room
filled with nasty batteries.

6005
02:52:40,490 --> 02:52:45,490
It means that a normal household can
mount this on their garage or on the

6006
02:52:45,771 --> 02:52:49,490
outside wall of their house and
it doesn't take up any room.

6007
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:50,790
It's,

6008
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:51,000
it's.

6009
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,580
I mean it's flat against the wall.

6010
02:52:52,581 --> 02:52:53,060
It,

6011
02:52:53,060 --> 02:52:55,370
it has all of the
integrated safety systems,

6012
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:56,660
the incredibles

6013
02:52:57,420 --> 02:52:58,253
dcdd

6014
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:00,473
design.

6015
02:53:01,080 --> 02:53:01,913
Something

6016
02:53:03,710 --> 02:53:05,440
like this guy is like a guy in a movie.

6017
02:53:05,470 --> 02:53:05,810
It,

6018
02:53:05,810 --> 02:53:07,220
it addresses all the needs,

6019
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:08,301
so watch that.

6020
02:53:08,301 --> 02:53:08,540
Folks,

6021
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:09,890
do you want to watch because
we're out of time here,

6022
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:12,350
but this guy's like a guy in the movie.

6023
02:53:12,351 --> 02:53:17,351
He's like a super billionaire
genius inventor from a
movie mean makes a car that

6024
02:53:17,541 --> 02:53:18,530
everybody falls in love with.

6025
02:53:18,531 --> 02:53:20,420
It's got a God damn laptop
in the middle of it.

6026
02:53:20,610 --> 02:53:21,620
You ever seen those?

6027
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:21,880
Yeah.

6028
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:23,890
My friend got one.

6029
02:53:23,891 --> 02:53:24,724
It's amazing.

6030
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:25,710
There's no,

6031
02:53:25,710 --> 02:53:27,320
there's no feeling of shift at all.

6032
02:53:27,321 --> 02:53:28,640
It's just this acceleration.

6033
02:53:28,730 --> 02:53:30,460
There's a new one that
comes out next year though.

6034
02:53:30,461 --> 02:53:31,490
That's going to be a lot better.

6035
02:53:31,491 --> 02:53:32,210
I heard.

6036
02:53:32,210 --> 02:53:33,110
Well she forgot.

6037
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:34,340
I don't know if it's next year.

6038
02:53:34,770 --> 02:53:36,710
His a new tesla or tesla.

6039
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:39,690
We had a new model that he gave
you that's unbelievably fast.

6040
02:53:39,730 --> 02:53:41,840
Zero to 60 in like
three something seconds.

6041
02:53:41,990 --> 02:53:42,823
All Electric,

6042
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:43,873
all electric,

6043
02:53:43,910 --> 02:53:45,230
but they still can't go to vegas.

6044
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:47,000
Still can't go to vegas.

6045
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:47,510
Why?

6046
02:53:47,510 --> 02:53:48,343
You have to stop.

6047
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:51,650
Stopped halfway there and charge up in
the middle of fucking desert at some

6048
02:53:51,651 --> 02:53:52,061
creep.

6049
02:53:52,061 --> 02:53:53,960
Head fucking Weirdos.

6050
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:58,190
Stop where you plug in and you got to
wait for half an hour while they circle

6051
02:53:58,191 --> 02:54:00,500
you like buzzards because they
know you can't go anywhere.

6052
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:01,101
Hey man,

6053
02:54:01,101 --> 02:54:02,650
you can't even drive with that right now.

6054
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:04,730
If you gone drive with that and right now,

6055
02:54:04,731 --> 02:54:05,930
how far do you think you get?

6056
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:07,033
How long does it last?

6057
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:07,930
How long does it last?

6058
02:54:08,330 --> 02:54:12,200
You might get 350 miles out of a tank.

6059
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:13,060
You know,

6060
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:14,000
a charge rather.

6061
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:14,893
You might.

6062
02:54:15,020 --> 02:54:17,810
But if you're driving fast
you won't be driving fast.

6063
02:54:17,811 --> 02:54:18,350
Is gonna eat it?

6064
02:54:18,350 --> 02:54:20,720
I'm usually more having
a bunch of apps open.

6065
02:54:20,730 --> 02:54:21,140
Yeah,

6066
02:54:21,140 --> 02:54:21,980
it's going to eat it up.

6067
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:27,160
So like when it starts slowing a DMZ
inside lights does all the shit do a.

6068
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:32,360
like Aubrey has won the almost almost
died out on his way home one night because

6069
02:54:32,361 --> 02:54:33,830
he left it at his office.

6070
02:54:33,831 --> 02:54:35,180
And when you leave it somewhere,

6071
02:54:35,181 --> 02:54:36,560
it slowly drains the battery.

6072
02:54:36,561 --> 02:54:36,800
Yeah.

6073
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:39,820
Like you can't leave it and just go away
for three weeks and come back to fully.

6074
02:54:39,830 --> 02:54:40,401
It'll be typed up.

6075
02:54:40,401 --> 02:54:41,210
Battery.

6076
02:54:41,210 --> 02:54:45,440
It'll be hurting having your iphone and
just leaving it on the kitchen table for

6077
02:54:45,441 --> 02:54:45,780
a week.

6078
02:54:45,780 --> 02:54:46,660
Leaving it on.

6079
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:47,230
Yeah.

6080
02:54:47,230 --> 02:54:47,810
Yeah,

6081
02:54:47,810 --> 02:54:48,643
because it's also,

6082
02:54:48,650 --> 02:54:49,700
it's also an iphone,

6083
02:54:49,880 --> 02:54:50,111
like a.

6084
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:51,320
not like a cell phone.

6085
02:54:51,321 --> 02:54:52,700
It's got a three g connection,

6086
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:53,810
only three g,

6087
02:54:53,810 --> 02:54:54,643
which is wack.

6088
02:54:54,950 --> 02:54:57,170
But it's constantly
connected to the Internet.

6089
02:54:57,171 --> 02:55:02,171
So like you could say google a flock of
seagulls and it'll pull up flock of and

6090
02:55:03,381 --> 02:55:04,100
you'll start play

6091
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:08,380
flock of seagulls and we'll give you some
options and you just start with a far

6092
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:09,440
as streaming,

6093
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:10,273
like out of nowhere.

6094
02:55:11,330 --> 02:55:12,400
That's what I would have picked this.

6095
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:13,400
I know.

6096
02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:14,270
That's why I said it.

6097
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:15,920
I knew it was your shit man.

6098
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:16,970
What is your shit?

6099
02:55:16,970 --> 02:55:17,500
If you have,

6100
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:18,590
if you're going to talk to your Tesla,

6101
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:19,370
what would you tell it?

6102
02:55:19,370 --> 02:55:19,581
Where you.

6103
02:55:19,581 --> 02:55:20,630
Where your punisher shirt?

6104
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,530
Oh Man.

6105
02:55:21,530 --> 02:55:22,670
It depends.

6106
02:55:23,610 --> 02:55:24,470
Depends on the mood.

6107
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:25,970
Quite honestly be.

6108
02:55:25,971 --> 02:55:26,601
It could be metal,

6109
02:55:26,601 --> 02:55:27,500
it could be a

6110
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,200
little river band,

6111
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:35,300
bunch of goofy like soft rock hits if
you want to say eighties music or rap or

6112
02:55:35,811 --> 02:55:36,150
whatever.

6113
02:55:36,150 --> 02:55:37,760
You see a really bad movie.

6114
02:55:37,820 --> 02:55:39,860
See the Dolph Lundgren
version of the punisher

6115
02:55:41,390 --> 02:55:42,040
movie.

6116
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:43,180
I went to theater for that.

6117
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:44,590
Did you ever see the short.

6118
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:47,030
They did a with Thomas j Dot Thomas.

6119
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:47,500
Janet.

6120
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,650
Here's it's even better.

6121
02:55:48,651 --> 02:55:51,530
It's so bad and it's low
resolution back then.

6122
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:52,250
Right?

6123
02:55:52,250 --> 02:55:53,060
And so they.

6124
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:56,210
He couldn't grow a beard and the
punisher had to have a beard,

6125
02:55:56,360 --> 02:55:59,240
so they smudge makeup on his
face to pretend it's a beard.

6126
02:55:59,390 --> 02:56:01,400
See and pull it up and we'll
end with this because we'll.

6127
02:56:01,401 --> 02:56:03,300
We'll get a nice hardy man.

6128
02:56:03,390 --> 02:56:03,660
Laughs.

6129
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:06,020
It was all three of us
can grow an actual beard.

6130
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:06,921
Look at this.

6131
02:56:06,921 --> 02:56:08,510
Pussy is Dolph Lundgren.

6132
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:08,981
Meanwhile,

6133
02:56:08,981 --> 02:56:09,814
he's a stud.

6134
02:56:10,100 --> 02:56:10,621
Bruce Jenner,

6135
02:56:10,621 --> 02:56:11,830
rogers chance proof.

6136
02:56:11,850 --> 02:56:12,800
Sharing their personal understanding.

6137
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:13,550
Yeah.

6138
02:56:13,550 --> 02:56:13,860
Bruce.

6139
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:15,410
Janet has it all lasered off.

6140
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:19,310
Fuck can I say my podcast before everyone
gets made at using skank because we

6141
02:56:19,311 --> 02:56:21,320
just gangs and the Sdr
shows on all things.

6142
02:56:21,321 --> 02:56:23,510
Comedy was same as what is the sdrs show,

6143
02:56:23,540 --> 02:56:23,811
sex,

6144
02:56:23,811 --> 02:56:24,021
drugs,

6145
02:56:24,021 --> 02:56:24,680
and rock and roll.

6146
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:26,600
She's interviewed Porn
Stars and rock stars.

6147
02:56:26,601 --> 02:56:27,610
You guys are crazy,

6148
02:56:27,611 --> 02:56:29,390
but we ended some interview Tesla,

6149
02:56:29,391 --> 02:56:30,260
but not that guy.

6150
02:56:30,320 --> 02:56:30,970
The band.

6151
02:56:30,970 --> 02:56:31,700
Tesla.

6152
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:32,750
My best to kind of interviews.

6153
02:56:32,750 --> 02:56:33,030
We do.

6154
02:56:33,030 --> 02:56:33,591
It's fun.

6155
02:56:33,591 --> 02:56:34,100
Very Fun.

6156
02:56:34,100 --> 02:56:35,690
Is it available on itunes?

6157
02:56:35,691 --> 02:56:36,830
All of them available on itunes.

6158
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:37,870
All available on itunes.

6159
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:40,550
A Sdr show is on all things comedy.

6160
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:44,060
See if you could go back to see if
you find a good picture of his face,

6161
02:56:44,130 --> 02:56:46,460
like a google image
because it's so stupid.

6162
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:48,313
He couldn't.

6163
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:49,101
Oh,

6164
02:56:49,101 --> 02:56:49,671
I guarantee you.

6165
02:56:49,671 --> 02:56:50,504
There's one.

6166
02:56:50,830 --> 02:56:52,430
Look at this fucking smudgy.

6167
02:56:53,090 --> 02:56:53,960
There we go there.

6168
02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:56,030
It's so vague.

6169
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:58,190
It's like fake beard on.

6170
02:56:58,220 --> 02:56:59,010
It's like a really.

6171
02:56:59,010 --> 02:56:59,340
No,

6172
02:56:59,340 --> 02:57:00,173
that's not ed second.

6173
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:00,320
Well,

6174
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,700
it's funny if you see
the one where he's at,

6175
02:57:01,701 --> 02:57:04,610
the bullets on his chest like you can
see when it's too light that he has no

6176
02:57:04,611 --> 02:57:05,444
beard at all.

6177
02:57:05,950 --> 02:57:06,730
It's.

6178
02:57:06,730 --> 02:57:09,710
It's hard to tell a little bit there.

6179
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:10,730
That may be pissed me off.

6180
02:57:11,090 --> 02:57:12,470
He's like a 12 year old Cuban kid.

6181
02:57:12,900 --> 02:57:14,930
Will you be so good at
your as Drago though?

6182
02:57:15,830 --> 02:57:16,830
He was so good as drug.

6183
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:17,270
Yeah,

6184
02:57:17,270 --> 02:57:19,320
and that's what the punisher
would have looked like.

6185
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:22,370
Presenting Hillston was so good as
Mrs Drago and she fucks flavor flavor

6186
02:57:22,371 --> 02:57:22,851
eventually.

6187
02:57:22,851 --> 02:57:23,684

6188
02:57:23,750 --> 02:57:24,850

6189

We're going to end with that
because that shit's real as fuck.

6192

Again,

6193
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:34,870
cheap meals and remember too that she
used to be smoking copas Wednesday night.

02:57:34,890 --> 02:57:36,620
