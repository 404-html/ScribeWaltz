1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,790
Let me tell you something.
You know how bad to the bone I do this.

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,660
I was just still on the way up beat
Eddie Bravo is the one who called me and

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:10,380
reached, turned me on to Tom Petty.
Tom Petty was bad about the firearm.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,020
That fucking, that something
song was on the way up. Yeah.

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,660
I almost crashed the fucking cop.
He doesn't get much respect.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,360
I don't know why people when
they talk about like rock stars,

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,780
they really love you don't hear a lot of
people like people go off about like I

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:24,960
always go off back a Hendrix or
people go off about certain artists,

9
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,840
but you don't hear that much of a
fucking Anthea. That's that what it is.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,790
But you don't like Getty Lee, same thing
for us. That fucking guy drives me crazy.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,310
Yeah, no, that shit drives me crazy.

12
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,290
It's singer from reo Speedwagon with
the needle shoulders and Mario Spit,

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,890
which had a good life
back when we were kids.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,890
That was a bad ass fucking or we'll come
back back on the Road Gan given that

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,150
what time I'm leaving, uh,
they were fucking bad ass.

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,120
But the prom with Tom Petty's,
it looks like a rat.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,880
But if you know anything about Tom Petty,
he's deep in it. Dog. He's like, Hey,

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,760
he's a good Gracie. He took guitar
lessons from the guitar player,

19
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,140
from the Eagles in high school.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,640
Did you get from that area where
white people and I trash white trash,

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,260
but they know how to fucking play an
instrument like, like at Jacksonville,

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,090
that area. He's from like
Jackson's though. Uh, okay.
So Jacksonville is like them.

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,170
Uh, you know, not to let us get it,
but the other band that was, uh,

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,120
that Jackson's the Allman brothers
like gap. You can see it. Oh,

25
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,000
I get it now I get the whole,
Oh,

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,950
that's what the Allman brothers
from Florida to yas, Bro,

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,020
that neighborhood is leaked. Or like
if you go online, that neighborhood,

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,940
like I went online one day, um, I know
that it's either or either Tom Petty.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,090
Just think about that.
The guitar player from Eagles,

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,930
the one that wrote Hotel California,

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,220
when they threw out that lives right
up in Topanga Canyon. That dude,

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,350
that dude's a powerhouse,
all that [inaudible] now all that was him.

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,150
Joe Walsh joined later.

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,200
But the early power house was that dude
when he has rings around his nose on

35
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:05,730
Hotel California with blow, that dude's
a savage and he and the high school,

36
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,880
he gave Tom Petty Guitar lessons
and people don't know that.

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,790
And they can you imagine and that's
like, that's like, you know, that's like,

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,870
that's like the Machados Gracie's
like they were just hanging out in the

39
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,450
basement. They were cousins.
That's what they did.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,940
And they all launched from there.
The Allman brothers.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,770
It's gotta be somebody
else from that area.

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,770
I don't know who it is that's
from that fucking area.

43
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,590
A lot of people don't know that. That's a
weird, you're getting it from that area.

44
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,010
Yeah, I mean just get it. Oh,
I'm in brothers and Tom Petty.

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,430
I know for a fact I could,
I can't lose this argument.

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,360
Tom Petty's got 10 songs that
we've all sung at one time.

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,280
That fucking song from when
the guys dancing naked and
the, and silence Atlanta.

48
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:48,330
So there's Dick between his legs,
American girl. That's all time batty guys.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,440
That's all time patty. The one with
Brock, the dude that good looking guy.

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,970
Pirates of the Caribbean.

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,250
Remember he had that video with the dude
from the pirates of the Caribbean with

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,130
dance, with Mary Jane Doe. That dude

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,460
does not the one with Stevie
nicks when we were kids.

54
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,030
Stop dragging my heart around. Fuck
yeah, I forgot about me not gonna. Look,

55
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm getting goosebumps cause
he's like Muhammad Ali.

56
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,981
He just stuck around for 20 that's
83 it's 2000 fucking 15 that's seven.

57
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,590
That's 17 that's 32 fucking years.
I know he's still around and he's still,

58
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,910
he's still around. Wow. You know, you
forget about those fucking guys. Like how,

59
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,460
but that area, what is the
water? It's gotta be something.

60
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,190
They just had something at that time.
You know what that was like.

61
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,080
They're all growing up in the 70s and
the culture was probably exploding from

62
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:38,381
the whole,

63
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:42,520
all the crazy shit from the 60s a lot of
people from the east coast escaped and

64
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,190
they went down to Florida. You know,
that's what happened to a lot of people.

65
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,960
A lot of mob guys went down to Florida.

66
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,110
A lot of people went down to
Florida to go on the land.

67
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,390
A lot of people went down to Florida to
get away from debts to get away from the

68
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:57,391
east coast like the Florida is a big part
of Florida is like escape savages from

69
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:01,750
like Jersey and New York. That's a,
that's the dirty secret about Florida.

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,020
There's as many New York accents
and some parts of Florida.

71
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,120
Is there anywhere else you want to Tampa?
Yeah,

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,280
Yankee hot dogs and that's where
the Yankees spring training. Listen,

73
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:11,380
when I rubbed that jewelry store,

74
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,470
I went to Sarasota and the laminate
e three that was nothing to do.

75
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,720
I had to go to watch the road
warrior every day for a month.

76
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,840
I got it was theory about Florida.
I got a theory about Florida.

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,230
I think it's too hot. I think that's
why people are so dopey down there.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
I think it's too hot. No, I think you can.

79
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,480
If you take those animals from New
Jersey and New York that was in the set,

80
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,090
they're like, it just got there.
They just got their, they,

81
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,730
their personalities were
developed in the cold weather.

82
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,740
Their personalities would develop it.
You've got to get shit done. It's cold.

83
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:40,900
You got a fucking shovel your car out and
then you'd go down to Florida and it's

84
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,450
just swatting bugs and sweating.

85
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,600
Just that deep,

86
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,810
deep fog of a hot day in Miami fog.

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,890
The fog of the moisture in the air.
Fuck.

88
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,460
What about an Arizona though?
We didn't know that. My aunt,

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,160
southern Florida morning,

90
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,550
you know when you're there when you wake
up and there's dew on the window and

91
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,140
you opened up and it smells
tremendous of a flyer.

92
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:12,400
The morning Chenelle was tremendous.
That grass with that moisture on it.

93
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,540
But now tell me about this thing
outside of Fort Lauderdale.

94
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,620
You were telling me once and then somebody
was telling me in Fort Lauderdale one

95
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,220
time, what's going to happen in that
ocean? It's going to sink. There's,

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,420
there's an area around Miami,
like all around southern Florida,

97
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,850
which the ground is very porous.
It's,

98
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,610
it's not like Louisiana where you can
like put up a levee and you can keep the

99
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,920
water from coming in. You can't stop
it. It's going to come through the,

100
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,410
through the ground. The
ground is not this, you know,

101
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,640
rock hard from ground that we get up
here while we're right next to the water.

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,160
It's not like that.
So as the water level rises,

103
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,920
it's going to be no way to stop it. It's
going to come right through the ground.

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,190
Swampy. Yeah. When it comes to the
ground, that's the everglades and that's,

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,490
you know, any, any swampy type area.
And when it comes to the ground,

106
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,550
it's gonna eat up Miami. It's just going
to eat it up. It's not going to last.

107
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,130
Miami not going to be here in a hundred
years ago. Who used to say that?

108
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you know who my mother's, that's why
she didn't go to Miami. She's smart.

109
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,170
She left Cuba, kept asking, why didn't you
ever go to Miami? Those Cubans? She goes,

110
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,850
and I'm like, it that. She goes,

111
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:20,090
they position those missiles
from there to shoot or something.

112
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,960
She was telling me,
Oh yeah,

113
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,520
that's where I don't want to fucking human
being something about Miami. The land,

114
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,310
the land's not going to be right there.
And she hated it.

115
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,840
She fucking hate in Miami with a passion,
especially in her era. Uh, you know,

116
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,350
that was when the Cuban missile crisis
was going on and everybody felt that the

117
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,890
Russians are going to launch nukes
from Cuba's right there. I mean,

118
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:43,280
a lady swam it, she swam it. I mean,

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,280
what the fuck man do you
mean you could probably,

120
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,110
I mean it people, everyday
people raft it, that little boy.

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,100
Remember that little rap that every day
when you go to Cuba right now and you

122
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,000
put it on this street, I'm digging
it, going out this be some Guy Mackey,

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,970
and he'll break it down to you don't
leave at six because the high tide,

124
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,190
they already have it. They've
done it. They've done it,

125
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,270
and maybe come back and got arrested in
Cuba and the United States and come back.

126
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,781
You know,

127
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,500
they said there's a point when you're out
there that you just see all the wraps.

128
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:16,760
If people that have failed, oh my God.
And that's when, you know there's like 30,

129
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,980
40 miles out of Miami, you know, uh,

130
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,690
50 miles out of the United States.
They say it crack a lot.

131
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,780
That's where you really tight.
That's the fifth round.

132
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,570
And this is silver is on top of your
ground and pounding and you're, you know,

133
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,080
it's, you're just looking into
the abyss. There's nothing.

134
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,150
And once it gets dark they say you just
hear some fucking wall noises, man.

135
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,043
Oh,

136
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,190
so fucking while noisy.
No,

137
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,740
you can't drink the salt water.
So you got to bring the water with,

138
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:52,490
you got to keep the raffle light. So
you've got to bring like saltine crackers.

139
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,680
I mean it's, it's any days it take, it's
all depending on the time, you know,

140
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,370
I don't really know.
I've spoken to people who have done it.

141
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,760
Cubans that you up to like listen to
your conversation about the fucking show

142
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,000
last night and listened to
this like they have yet.

143
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,010
And all the fucking documentaries they
do have not sat down like a family like

144
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,990
that came with six and they lost three.

145
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,870
And you talked to those mother
fuckers and you haven't,

146
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,090
don't look at the picture from
the Yankees. Eight his hand,

147
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,370
he started cannibalizing
his own fucking hand. What?

148
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,670
Because he and then he broke down in it.

149
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,310
I get emotional thinking of just
like psychological, psychological.

150
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,800
He started eating his hand,
had no food, so when he,

151
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:34,220
the first time the Yankees
gave him 10 million,

152
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
he went into the clubhouse and he
saw the cold cuts and he broke down.

153
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,210
He had a nervous breakdown.

154
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:46,211
He had never seen that much food like
fruit and cold cuts and bread and you know

155
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,330
sodas. He had never seen that.
That's just the intensity of it,

156
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,620
but there's nobody yet. There's
a, there's a documentary.

157
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,610
It's real interesting and
called bud settle about size.

158
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,890
That's that generation. The Cubans having
the Marielle escape, Lomaia lethal.

159
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,880
Those are the ones that
came in [inaudible] 79 and
then you have the 90s ones

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,900
and they called the Cubans look down on
them. The Marielitos like, fuck you punks.

161
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,650
Your boss said it was, they're the
ones that come and truck tires.

162
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,330
Jesus fucking truck.
How many days does it take?

163
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,760
Normally three to at all.
You know,

164
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,230
I this be intelligent people watch the
show and that sitting there going Joey,

165
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,171
it all depends.

166
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:28,530
It's not like you could count the
days wherever the tide takes you,

167
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,710
you know it was going to be, my
question is do people ever miss I? Why?

168
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,980
Do you ever like go? Does it take
you out to see every x? Some people,

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,350
the tie goes a different direction.

170
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm sure that when you go to,
they have the jets rooms.

171
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,590
I mean not the jet streams,
like pretty predictable.

172
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,630
Like that's how they have
those garbage patches, right?

173
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,720
Some people get caught in
those islands by The Bahamas.

174
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,280
You have to look at the
map and we could really,

175
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,710
some people actually landed on
the island by the heart pump.

176
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,270
You're still not home because you're
still, they could still a restaurant.

177
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,680
So if I'm choke, Fidel has flights going
through out there looking for people.

178
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,530
Those mother fuckers,
they get back to Cuba and a restaurant.

179
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,660
So until you touch the United States,
what are you writing? A tide map.

180
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:14,820
There's such things as tight
naps for boating and stuff.

181
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,540
That would show you the tides of the
eye unless you touch the sec. So,

182
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,780
so close. So those islands
right there from, I see the tip,

183
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,070
you probably have to leave from the
northwest dial, like right under key west.

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,460
You'd have to leave.
But I guarantee there's a problem.

185
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,770
I guarantee there's some type of problem.

186
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,410
So you have to hit it
depending on what's going on.

187
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,670
Some people live lead lead from the
southern point and they catch something at

188
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,080
The Bahamas,
those little islands,

189
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,720
The Bahamas has over a hundred
little islands over there,

190
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,610
a hundred little islands by The Bahamas.

191
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,190
All those little islands used
to be drug smuggling islands.

192
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,990
That's the midway point. So
that, that, that's it right
there. But think about that.

193
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:58,920
That's 90 miles. That's from head
to San Diego. That's a legit,

194
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,080
so the first 30 miles is pretty easy.
The next 30 of the real fucking deal.

195
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,610
And then I imagine you start seeing
land, but uh, once you run out of water,

196
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,570
you start hallucinating when you
can't drink the salt water. Correct.

197
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,620
So you started loosening.
I mean,

198
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,680
I've heard different things and
let's put that back up again, Jamie.

199
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,280
That'd be a very interesting documentary
that just see somebody take off from

200
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,640
Cuba and fucking just
like a survivor man thing,

201
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,860
but that seems like something he was,
yeah,

202
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:30,330
that's a look at that fucking look
at the distance. It's so small.

203
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,040
She would looks bigger
than I thought it looked,

204
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,530
but these maps were really like distorted.

205
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,270
It's very difficult to
gauge the perspective, like
how big Cuba actually is.

206
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,430
Like a, when you look at like Africa
and the United States on a map,

207
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,920
like a lot of times it doesn't look
like Africa's that much bigger.

208
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,010
But then if you actually
see how big Africa is,

209
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,160
if you ever seen that Africa fits like
almost all the other countries, it's like

210
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,930
you're, yeah, it fits everything.

211
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,490
Like pull up a map of how many different
countries fit inside Africa because

212
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:04,150
it's, it's pretty crazy to look at. It's,

213
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,690
it's so big. Look at
that. That's All Africa.

214
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,740
So I look at all the different
fucking Sylvia, the United States.

215
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,610
It's like a little piece of it.
It's like maybe a quarter of it.

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,620
Look all of eastern Europe. China.
Yup. China fits in in, in Africa.

217
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,460
That's how big Africa is. Spain,
France or excuse me, for Rawls,

218
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,320
Germany, Italy, eastern
Europe and fucking India.

219
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,580
Good Lord.
And then it says India part too.

220
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,790
So I guess that's another segment of
India or they just stuffed in there and I

221
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,560
made it feel like a fucking Africa. And
that's when you just get petrified. Oh,

222
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,990
and all the UK,
the whole UK fucker.

223
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,340
When you see what's an Africa is when
you really fucking just shut the map.

224
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:48,851
Like you're like,

225
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,890
I could sell y the x asis was that
cause in my mind the exorcism is dead.

226
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,500
That's where it started. Look at the
fucking countries, like everywhere.

227
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,450
There's always a fucking
fentanyl going on.

228
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,660
Always something going on
Morocco that smoking Hash,

229
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:05,320
Tunisia who fucking know Libya.
They fucking up, you know,

230
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Sudan and fucking up Egypt.

231
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:11,600
That fucking Ethiopia is the fucking
up look at all the fucking reason.

232
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,300
You know Rwanda, there's a war always. I
mean there's always signed goal, a Zombie.

233
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,660
I mean there's always something.
So Bob Way, Africa, Zimbabwe,

234
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,420
Somalia, the most corrupt city in
the world supposed to be Nigeria.

235
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,430
Nigeria is that Nigeria, one of those
where they have all the uh, Ma, uh,

236
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,740
the scams on emails where your
money's in an African Bank.

237
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,090
That's the most corrupt
city, the cops, everything.
Everything goes down in Africa.

238
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,700
Look at that, look at
that. Where's the Liberia?

239
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,970
You ever see those of vice specials on
Liberia and fucking of Somali and pirates

240
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,270
come fucking crazy mother
fuckers that are out there. Yeah.

241
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,220
Well you know the Somalian pirates,
you know how it all got started.

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,520
There were fishermen and a,

243
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,010
the Europeans kept dumping shit into
the ocean and they were killing all the

244
00:13:57,011 --> 00:14:00,520
fish are throwing like nuclear
waste overboard and shit
and all kinds of fucking

245
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,540
chemical pollutants.

246
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:06,130
They just would dump their waste out
outside the shore of Somalia and it was

247
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:10,360
killing all their fish and these people
were starving so they started kidnap and

248
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:14,830
these boat guys and you know, holding
them for ransom saying, hey, you owe us.

249
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:16,230
You've been fucking up our ocean.

250
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,510
You know we want money and they were
making so much money doing that.

251
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:24,310
They said fuck fishing and they just
started robbing people and they take this

252
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,640
stuff called cat. It's like
a, it's like an amphetamine.

253
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,630
It's a plant that they chew and that
it has like an amphetamine effects.

254
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,750
So they're fucking just hopped
up on speed all day long,

255
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,510
just gay and they're running around
with guns and they're just fucking,

256
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:46,750
they give a f zero fucks.
They don't give a fraction of a fuck.

257
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,990
When they get on those speed boats
and head towards your oil tanker,

258
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,700
they start throwing anchors up there,

259
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,280
grappling hooks and
shit pull themselves up.

260
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,560
They're just not scared of you at all.

261
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,430
Their crazy fucks those guys are,

262
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,590
have you ever seen videos with those
guys? But they're scary. It's scary.

263
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,900
They're wild man. They come after people
up, going on the ship around. Anyway,

264
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,400
with those motherfuckers out there,

265
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,750
in a lot of ways it's very lord of
the rings s you know, it's like,

266
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,460
it's kind of like unbelievable when you
see these groups of dudes that are all

267
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:24,020
skinny and kind of cracked out and they
got machine guns and then her a rubber

268
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:28,820
tube with a fucking engine attached to
it and they're shooting at this giant

269
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:32,000
boat and they throw it hooks up
and climbing up, getting inside.

270
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,940
How is that any different than some
scenes from the Lord of the Rings?

271
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,600
That's crazy. That's like the elves
versus the trolls and Shit, you know?

272
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,420
I mean these guys are mad men.

273
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,550
The Matton men and most likely all that
shit started out because people were

274
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,020
fucking with their livelihood.

275
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,010
They're like a peaceful fishing village
and people were polluting their water

276
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,530
and they didn't have any food,
so they started getting dangerous.

277
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,450
They started getting desperate. That's
a crew. They call themselves the,

278
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,450
the volunteer coast guard of Somalia.
That's what they started off as.

279
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,000
It makes sense. Fucking totally makes
sense. Why they would be so angry. Well,

280
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,540
I mean, well, how come
they never did it before?

281
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,260
How come Somalia doesn't have like a
deep history of pirating? You know,

282
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,610
it's not like we know, you know, it's not
like we think of them as like Vikings.

283
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,340
You know, if Vikings started
robbing people again, we'd be like,

284
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:21,080
it's in their blood.
The video I seen,

285
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,680
there wasn't one FESA Molly and
they're all fucking bony up like Jesus,

286
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,130
this skinny as fuck.
And they move Jack.

287
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,720
They pull up next to a ship and they
move. It's like flux, Swat. Fuck.

288
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,860
These guys don't give a fuck. And they
throw all this shit out of, they lock up.

289
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,750
But these guys don't get wet.
And like the legal,

290
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:43,120
it looks like Jimi Hendrix or goggles on.
He doesn't know about fashion. Not Can,

291
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,330
you know, it's uh, it's fucking
scary. I Dunno. Different world.

292
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,870
It's a different for fog. You grow up
in that world and stayed out here, man.

293
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,210
Those more the fuck is a savage is
like real living fucking savages.

294
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,860
And it's kind of interesting,
Joe,

295
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:02,630
if you really think about it like we don't
have to be like that, but here we are.

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,590
It's 2015 in the same time when you
and I are alive and very peaceful and

297
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,800
getting along with everybody. This is
going on in another part of the world.

298
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,060
That's, that's the weird
thing. It's like there's,

299
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:15,740
we're not much different than them. We
just, we was just, we're super lucky.

300
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,350
We're super lucky. We got born
into a better situation than them.

301
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,270
These people are there right now in a
war zone. That's like a Mad Max movie.

302
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,820
I mean their life in a
lot of parts of Africa,

303
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,880
their life might as well be some crazy
end of the world apocalypse movie.

304
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,110
You know, if you go to watch the
watch, the vice pieces on Liberia,

305
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,850
it's Candace. This is like
some of the shit. Fuck yeah.

306
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,570
That's what part of it is. Okay.
Right. The cannibalism selling.

307
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,730
He said this guy was selling meat like
human meet on the street in Kabobs and he

308
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:53,130
said he recognized it because he knows
what human meat tastes like because he

309
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,950
used to kill babies as
he used to fight naked.

310
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,690
This guy to calm general button naked.

311
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,370
He would take off all his fucking clothes
and going into combat with a machine

312
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:07,320
gun, naked killing everybody
killed thousands of people,

313
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:11,400
thousands of people.
Eight babies used to cut their heart out.

314
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,030
You can find an innocent child of,
of the enemy killed them,

315
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,660
cut their heart out and eat pieces of
their heart and they were immune to, to,

316
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,200
to being damaged in battle. They
couldn't die. That's what they felt.

317
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,280
So they would do that. He's admitting
this on this fucking special.

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
Now here's where it gets really crazy.

319
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,950
He became religious afterwards and now
he's like a minister and he teaches,

320
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,840
he preaches Christianity and because of
that they're going to absolve him for

321
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:42,570
all of the people he's killed.
Who, who? The same guy,

322
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,100
the country of whatever country he's
in and I be Liberia. They absolve him.

323
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,450
They like let him off the
hook because he's like a
Christian now. It's like, Whoa,

324
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:54,090
like this is going on right now.
I mean,

325
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,880
that guy killed thousands of people,

326
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,910
thousands and admits on camera that that
part of their ritual was to eat babies

327
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,770
and people were like, well, you know
it's a, he's different now. Now he's,

328
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,490
he's found Jesus guy.
He's got to pay for this somewhere.

329
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,900
This one with the next one.

330
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,520
But what my point was is like
this is a very different world.

331
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,840
How please not just a little limits,
it's another day, Jack. It's another day.

332
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:25,530
Traffic to us is another day.
People somewhere else in the standards.

333
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,650
These mother fuckers ain't and kids arts,

334
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,560
babies' hearts not only die like how
many atheists do you think are in Africa?

335
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,430
I Bet I bet a lot less
about a lot less than here.

336
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,180
So when a guy says something like, I've
found God now, now I've found Jesus.

337
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,940
That actually means something
to them. Whether they go, wow,

338
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:43,140
he's found God like this is,

339
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,820
you're talking about a world that looks
like a movie. That's what Africa is.

340
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,350
I mean it's a world that looks like
a move, like a crazy chaotic movie,

341
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:57,351
like an asteroid hits China and kills
almost everyone outside of the United

342
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,130
States and kills 30 40% of the United
States and then that that's Africa,

343
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,730
the highly populated areas and be
like Africa [inaudible] nine yeah.

344
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:11,670
That movie just took nine very, very
similar. Yeah, that's part of it.

345
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,730
I mean then you also have Johannesburg.
They also have like real stories.

346
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,330
I mean it's weird to just
so it's so fucking giant.

347
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,860
I think the craziest thing I was so out
of where I am was like the Bronx in the

348
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,370
80s I certain parts of the Bronx,
I would leave there like going,

349
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,870
I'm going to have a common here again.
That was a crazy,

350
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,170
should we ever saw here again.
Yeah.

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,110
I can write one that I made a mistake
like in 1980 and went through the Bronx to

352
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:37,920
get drugs.

353
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,450
I thought I was cool with some friends
and we fucking went into a war zone.

354
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,810
They were wars,
which I don't know who was fighting.

355
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,970
I have no idea but it was
just dark and weapons. Nah,

356
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,680
I like the regular things. I don't need
to be in this fucking, that's the worst.

357
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,310
I saw. I would a building on fire and
not, I went, there was a building on fire,

358
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,350
people yelling at the fire department.

359
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:03,070
We didn't even go in because they know
that the fucking people would rob him.

360
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,060
It was like that movie I told you
to watch robbed about Ken Norton.

361
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,500
Muhammad I late that.

362
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,150
It wasn't that that Muhammad Ali lost
to Ken Norton that night. The decision,

363
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,030
it was what was going on
outside in New York City.

364
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,260
How people getting robbed on the streets.

365
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,400
He you have him for the cops and the
cops are turning their backs because they

366
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,410
were overwhelmed.
It was like four to one.

367
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,160
They couldn't get all the cops and there
they had blocked. They did it perfectly.

368
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,940
They block cars and shit so no
horses could get him at nothing.

369
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm telling you watch this.
You're going to be like, what?

370
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,150
How did this happen in 1970 that people
from Manhattan rich are getting mugged

371
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,470
and they are yelling for
the cops to help him.

372
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:46,390
And the cops were walking away like
that's how crazy the Bronx was at one time

373
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:49,120
when I was a kid and I didn't go up.
That didn't live up there.

374
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,130
I'm going to pet it, get
drugs thinking, you know,

375
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,970
like coke or weed or something
stupid. That's the worst. Well,

376
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,970
there's so many people.
The Bronx is so huge.

377
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,590
There's so many people in like bad
neighborhoods like or quote unquote bad

378
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,610
neighborhoods, you know, lower class,
poor neighborhoods in New York there's,

379
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,570
there's big areas, big giant areas
that have like a lot of, you know,

380
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:14,710
what's the correct onset, lower class.
What do you want to say? Like, uh,

381
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,690
people that live in poverty, but
there's, there's some spots, you know, I,

382
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,490
uh, when the first one, the first
things I did when I moved to New York,

383
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:25,350
because I drove to Harlem and I'm like, I
want to see what this is like, you know,

384
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,150
I'm like, all right, I got
here. It was my first day here.

385
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,560
Let me go see what Harlem is like.

386
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,350
Fucking drove all the way up and as you
get uptown and things get weirder and

387
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,040
Weirder,

388
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,040
and this is 90 1990 and it was before
they cleaned up times square to it was,

389
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:45,610
it was still kind of a freaky
spot and as I'm driving up there,

390
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:49,240
it just started getting crazier and
crazier and then all the sudden you're in

391
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:53,380
neighborhoods where you're like,
I have to get the fuck out of here.

392
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,070
Like this is, this is not
safe. Like this dangerous.

393
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,580
I was driving through a spot that
had garbage that was stacked seven,

394
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,430
eight feet high,
five feet wide,

395
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,990
stacked down blocks.
I mean put blocks.

396
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,110
There was like long blocks of
garbage hills and you're like,

397
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:19,300
what the fuck is going on? Where there's
some sort of a garbage strike for,

398
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,320
I don't know what the details were,
but there was rats running back and forth.

399
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:27,010
You could see him running back and
forth. And you know, I grew up in a,

400
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,580
like when I lived in Boston,
I lived in a suburb in Newton.

401
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,710
That's why I went to high school. It
was like the calmest, quietest place.

402
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,540
It's very nice place.

403
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,140
So here I am just a couple of years
removed from that and I'm walking down

404
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:41,591
Harlem,

405
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,950
watch these rats dart back and forth
and people are stepping out of liquor

406
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,040
stores holding 40

407
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,360
ounces like it's a movie. I'm
like, Whoa, this place is crazy.

408
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,740
This place is crazy.

409
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,850
For 16 from 15 to 22 that was my backyard.

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,461
Really.

411
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:03,461
My backyard was from a hundred and 13th
and fifth which is right by the park to

412
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:08,210
178 by port authority and Joe Rogan.
I had,

413
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,280
I knew every nook and cranny like I knew
where all the weed was. The coke was,

414
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,200
the pills were, the weapons were white
and I had, I had been pretty much the,

415
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,180
I had been pretty much my mom's best
friend lived on 113th and the fifth and

416
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:26,570
that was a horrible by the at night.
That turned into something else.

417
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,060
And then with it being
in the number of state,

418
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:32,870
when I was a kid with my parents were
the Cubans have their main numbers thing

419
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,400
is by a place called La Marqueta.

420
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,360
There's a train and they have all these
little markets and it's on a hundred and

421
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:43,361
18th and a used to be Spanish back in
and then the seventies sixties and early

422
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,650
eighties and what you do as my mom would
have a bodega and she'd have sodas and

423
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,550
cigars and maybe books or dreams
and people come in and they say,

424
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:55,040
I had a dream about a truck
getting hit by a fucking monkey.

425
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,560
I Trump this 50 and a monkey's three.

426
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,800
So they put $5 on three 50 you know,

427
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,210
and $5 pays you $2,500 that night.
Cash,

428
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,540
no fucking drama. And all the banks
would be upstairs. So the Bot,

429
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,510
you'd have bodegas all around Harlem,

430
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,430
but the bank would be centralized on one
building. And the summers I would have,

431
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,470
I would have a couple of
different jobs in the summers.

432
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,780
I would either help them to Bodegas,
you know,

433
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,150
stocking shelves and
running money up the stairs,

434
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:27,500
or I answered the phones and how to
yell the numbers to the dude's and they

435
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,110
would flip it.
So if you get too much action,

436
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,660
let's say on 604 after you get
$50 on that number, you got to,

437
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,610
let's say you get $82 on that number,

438
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,560
you have to take $32 and dump it off to
a different bank because you could only

439
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:47,561
get killed if you give away $50 that
means you're losing $25,000 for the day.

440
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,350
So it was always happening.
It's a very interesting fucking racket.

441
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,060
It's not huge anymore because the
picket came in. So the lottery,

442
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,440
the one of the biggest lotteries,

443
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,830
I don't know if they still do as a
Puerto Rican lottery, you buy the sheets,

444
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,640
you buy it by the sheets and that's big
and that part of the country. But uh,

445
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,560
their talent, it was invented by Strap
Santo traffic, aren't they? In Miami?

446
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,560
And he brought it from Cuba
and it's called policy. So
then the Italians took it.

447
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,030
They were a big thing of it,

448
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,570
but the ethnics were where the monies
that they're the ones that have the dreams

449
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,980
and that poor. So that's what the
ethnic took that market from the Mafia.

450
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,180
He said how ironic.

451
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,400
It's a lottery is coming for the all
that money's coming from the poor people

452
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,950
playing it.
People that have the dream.

453
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,190
The next time you go to seven 11 and
you go get where you want rolling papers

454
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:41,390
and you're fucking thirsty. Look who's
in front of you. Some fucking guy. Huh?

455
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,700
Let me get the tech health floor,

456
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,950
which you know he's in
fucking seven or 11 eh,

457
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,390
this fucking Isis substation
with a fucking dream. He's
going to win the lottery.

458
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,130
You know,
it's a fucked up dream.

459
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,510
I see people in my seven 11 all
the time buying 25 30 tickets,

460
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,800
but I also, part of it makes me giggle.
A lot of it reminds me of being a kid.

461
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:02,634
My mom,

462
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,790
my mom's number habit was Harvard
hall played the numbers constantly.

463
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,230
If she walked in here and you have like,

464
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,020
what's the sand Cronk 31 give
me the number before 31 Jo,

465
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,710
five blank called New York.
Five 31 $20 Bam.

466
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,560
So anywhere she went and she
saw a number that was weird.

467
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,760
She blast that motherfucker.

468
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,050
The only times I hit the number when I
was a kid just fucking around with her.

469
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,720
I would have joined like a football
team and I would come home and she'd go,

470
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,560
what's that number on your shirt?
57 put a number in front of that five.

471
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,650
She called the book, five
57, $10 $5,000 for dinner.

472
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,020
Another time I hit it
on my birthday to 19.

473
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,360
I used to hit that motherfucker
constantly on my birthday,

474
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,220
but that was my mother's fucking main
thing was numbers, numbers in Harlem.

475
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:51,300
So I got to walk around there as a child.
Then as I got older,

476
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,120
my first arrest wasn't home.

477
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,930
I got caught smoking weed
on 160 first street in 1983.

478
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:01,890
The first day after the
Superbowl, I want $800 on the, uh,

479
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,630
when the triple, what's the Miami?
These, the, the sleeping and the bees,

480
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,030
whatever the fuck they were
when they beat the Redskins.

481
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,740
And I went into a health food store.

482
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,520
In those days we'd stores were
health food stores in Harlem.

483
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:19,410
So what does the health food store can
complain of you who's no protein drinks

484
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:23,910
in those days it was it
protein powder, you know,

485
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,330
vitamins.
And then if you knew the right people,

486
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,600
you want to know you're not in
the glasses wall bulletproof. Wow.

487
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,660
And you went in and they, you'd say,
what do you have? Let me get to raise.

488
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,220
And they,
excuse me,

489
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,910
they put the weed and the glass you
take and give them the $30 and you'd ask

490
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:42,240
permission can I wrote it in the corner
and you rolled the joint in the corner

491
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,620
and then you could go
outside and smoke it.

492
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,700
I wrote it in the corner and when I lit
it in the corner, because it was windy,

493
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:50,910
it was January, when I went to
put the light into the joint,

494
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,330
a fucking mailman put a gun to my head
and he goes, get on the floor. He goes,

495
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:57,840
if you got more than 20 singles on you,
I'm going to beat the fuck outta here.

496
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,431
I got on the floor,

497
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:04,020
I had 800 I had one 800 probably
had seven 40 and he goes,

498
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:07,140
what'd you get this money from me and
I want some cops started pulling up and

499
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:10,710
they were looking for people who was
selling loose joints to kids two blocks

500
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,170
away. So when they realized
I lived in Jersey and,

501
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,930
and I had no idea in those days,
I didn't walk with an ID dog.

502
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,760
My word was my shit. No idea. In
those days I throw away the ID,

503
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,680
fucking no idea. You
want it, you're a cop.

504
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,700
Figure it out the fuck you're
fucking conquer or the tactic.

505
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,110
Figure it out, bitch. And the cop
told me, tell me the truth, your name.

506
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,570
I told him the truth. And they put
my finger on one of those things.

507
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,250
That was the early technology.

508
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,460
New York had lake three vans
that have that shit on it,

509
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,090
fingerprint thing and it came back. Jose
Diaz and blast, they let me go. In fact,

510
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,750
the cop took wheat out of my bag,
put it on the floor and said,

511
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,860
now it's nine grams. I you could
keep it and I'll give you a ticket.

512
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,450
And that was my first legitimate arrest.
I got arrested for that in Manhattan.

513
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,160
I did six months,
the first sentence.

514
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,000
And I moved to Colorado and I had to
write the guy a letter on the first and

515
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,430
call him on the fifth and they let me go.

516
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,950
So they looked at your fingerprints
and they found your name for the quick

517
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,070
quick. And I was never, never
been arrested before. Never.

518
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,360
So how are your fingerprints in the
record? Wouldn't know. Fuck him.

519
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,170
I the hospital maybe. I have no
idea. I didn't ask no questions.

520
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:19,380
That's interesting. I wonder
if everybody's finger, I mean,

521
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,070
especially with like apple,

522
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,320
like that was one of the big things
that people were worried about with the

523
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,270
iPhone Raaga already on again. Yeah.
That apple thing is fucking up or ready.

524
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,320
Well,
I'm not even talking about that.

525
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm just talking about the ability to
use your fingerprint because you can get

526
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,860
your fingerprint from this. Like
as you're pressing it, right? It's,

527
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:38,560
it's leaving your fingerprint and that's
how it recognizes your fingerprint.

528
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,100
And the idea is that that all
goes to a database. You know,

529
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,710
we want to know if Joey Diaz touched
anything with his finger. Well,

530
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,340
let's look at the database. Oh look this,
we got his fingerprint. It's right here.

531
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:51,190
Run it. And so they have your
fingerprint at my school.

532
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,750
They did it in middle school.

533
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,800
We all had to clarion thumbprints down on
both sides. And it was kind of like we,

534
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,250
we learned about thumbprints, prints and
we're like, where did that go? You know,

535
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,310
we just, I don't remember
whether or not I did that,

536
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:07,000
but I probably did it when I was a kid.
P A L I was a big PA guy.

537
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,990
You weren't sure if you didn't have the
police athletic league. You want to shit.

538
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,190
Really? Yeah. When I was a kid out of
12 we won. I came from Cuba. There was,

539
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,000
they taught you how to play pool.
They look fucking listen.

540
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,380
They would just regular
comps and this was that.

541
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,390
This is a job to get away
from their wives with the pal.

542
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,160
There's a bunch of Puerto Rican
kids and I little Irish dirty kids.

543
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,700
And what's a great way to
make a relationship with
the cops today? What Bro?

544
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:34,090
They tonight to fucking the precinct
and they let you shoot a gun. They kept,

545
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,770
you kept a target.
You kept a bullet.

546
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,550
They fingerprint that year they took
a picture of you and you did. It was,

547
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:42,820
they took us on fucking basketball trips.
They took us to the Yankee stadium.

548
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,990
I had a great relationship. But then in
like the seventh grade, eighth grade,

549
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,071
Mr. Moreno,

550
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:52,300
it took us to fucking Detroit for a
little bitty basketball tournament and we

551
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,600
found some guy in the street that buys
a case of beer and it was all a little

552
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,690
bit the fucking shot Jack. That
mother fucker said, it's over.

553
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:00,880
We're not even playing a game.
He drove him was right back home.

554
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:01,990
We didn't get to play a game.

555
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,280
We drove debt and get a case of beer
and we drove right back for eight hours

556
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,460
right back to fucking jersey. So
I'm a, I'm a p a l I always was.

557
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,180
So maybe that's how they
got my fingerprints. Was,

558
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,110
was that the end of the
relationship with pa out? Uh,

559
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:21,550
no. I think I used to still go for,
it wasn't why I grew up in Jersey.

560
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,370
The pal or is geared more towards boxing.

561
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,110
When I was in New York City, it was a, it
was a place that they had like a boxing,

562
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,670
they had a pool table, they had a,
you know, sodas and shit like that.

563
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:38,650
Activities you may like ceramics and
shoe depending on your age. And Jersey.

564
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:41,990
It was more Mr Gameo.
Mr Gameo was a Cuban dude.

565
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,740
He ran the boxing program and I used
to know his two sons, Julio and season.

566
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,350
They got me a job at putting on
the field and they were like,

567
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:49,430
listen to when you get the job,

568
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,120
you got to rob Putnam fields right
by Seacaucus off of route three.

569
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,690
It's dirty truck. People
go in there. Any job.

570
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,960
I lasted about three weeks
before they fired me,

571
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,740
but I left that and after three weeks
the guy at night was a half a momo.

572
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,930
His name was Freddy,
even though it's telling you this,

573
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,110
so we robbed the one that we go listen,
we're just going on and be Freddy up.

574
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,550
We were like sophomores in high school.

575
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,140
We'll put mask on me and deedee
can Tara and when he comes out,

576
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,760
because in Jersey you pay the gas guy,
you don't go into a store,

577
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,910
you know they pump your gas.
So if you robbed the Guy,

578
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,250
you basically robbed the joint.
Do you follow me?

579
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,510
Only Oregon and New Jersey is where the
people pump your gas. Everybody else.

580
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:30,440
You walk in with a cart, so we were kids.
We were like, let's rob fucked up. Freddy,

581
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,730
you know when I worked at,

582
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,580
I got to know Freddy Freddy's wife
looked like honey boo boos mother,

583
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,640
but he was a little guy but he,

584
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,960
his wife was like 400 pounds and the only
way she would let him fucking as if he

585
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,400
brought below home and he was a skinny,
tiny guy like Eddie Bravo.

586
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,400
She was like three 90 and she would
actually put the Bikini and they,

587
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,920
they were such white trash.

588
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,280
They lived in a studio apartment and they
would rent the Jacuzzi and putting the

589
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:58,160
living room.
These people were fucking,

590
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,010
they lived on the third floor
studio did your part, but my God,

591
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,120
and it was the worst building in the
neighborhood and they had black model.

592
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,340
She was the only black girl in
the neighborhood, black bottle.

593
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:10,370
I don't know what black Marlowe is today,
but she's the Real Martin Luther King.

594
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,630
She was the only black girl in a
white neighborhood and Jersey thugs.

595
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:17,570
That girl torture. She got tortured.
I always loved Black Marlo.

596
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,340
Marlo was tight with me. Her mother was
white. Something had happened for houses,

597
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,150
fucked up. That building was fucked up.
So I used to go with it as selling blown.

598
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,760
I remember Freddy opening up the door
and they were like a robot and his,

599
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,570
his fat wife and living with heels
with a bikini on and he's like,

600
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,950
thank you for bringing it to me.
Like he really was like,

601
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,190
when you brought them the blow, he was
fucking thankful that you fucking like,

602
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,990
thank you man. I'm
like, we'll see tonight.

603
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,140
Like she would not give me my hand job
if he didn't have blow. So finally,

604
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,500
so finally one day me and Deedee can tell,
we decided,

605
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:54,620
let's go down there and rob this
motherfucker on a Saturday night.

606
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:58,090
Let's wait until about midnight when he's
got a grand on them because you don't

607
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,611
drop two,

608
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:03,170
you get 2000 so every 2000 you'll make
a drop in the floor safe and you can't

609
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,004
get back in there.

610
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,280
So me and Dee Dee went behind the building
by sea cock and there was right next

611
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:09,050
to this hot dog place,
snappy nappies.

612
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,010
The rumor was that's what the ice man
killed somebody and put them in a tank by

613
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,920
snapping that it's, no, this
is a real fucking area jersey,

614
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,730
this is across the street was one of the
biggest strip clubs in the east coast.

615
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,840
Not when I was there. Robin. Freddy couple
of years after that, like the army base.

616
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,850
So you remember if you lived in New York,

617
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:29,390
they called us to the air force
base some basis, some shit.

618
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:33,140
But when we were kids we went there
like at 12 and we took Freddy down dog.

619
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,330
We just tagged with a
master like kicking him.

620
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:40,080
Like they kicked the whatever his name
is and that Deniro movie in the bar and

621
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:44,250
we took his little person, we ran away
and he gets it like it took him a week.

622
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:47,400
He's like, you guys robbed me last
night cause we had masks on and shit.

623
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,120
We're like Freddy, it wasn't us. He's
like, yeah, so was I heard your voices.

624
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,390
Then he came back to us. He's like,
listen, I'll let you rob be once a month,

625
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,250
but you got to split the money with me.

626
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,990
So I could buy an eight
ball to fuck my wife.

627
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,640
So once a month we go down
and give a steady Freddy,

628
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,690
you're beaten and we kick
the fuck out of them.

629
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,900
Just I'm pressing let you do it. He
wanted to with the cops, you know,

630
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,280
that's the only way to cops and we
did it like eight times. So rob,

631
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,300
did you give him black eyes?
Bloody noses.

632
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,300
Some of the stomach couple of times
that we need them. Neon belly,

633
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,370
I don't even know what it was.
No video back then either.

634
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,690
She had it leave marks on them. Yeah,
you have like kick him a few times.

635
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,780
I couldn't do it. I had too much of
a heart, so I always had a higher,

636
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,850
like I had to bring like
one of my crazy friends

637
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,440
that was having like a bad week. There's
a kid in Miami today that everyone,

638
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,070
every time I place south Florida,

639
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:44,610
he shows up with his girlfriend and he
gets fucked up and he tells a story.

640
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:49,290
When I knocked on his door with a diagram
on how we were going to rob Freddy and

641
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,740
he goes, that's when I knew that
you were fucking for real. He goes,

642
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,300
I was eating dinner with my family.

643
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,090
You knocked on the door and
had a sketch like the deal,

644
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,460
how you were going to kick him and run
into the weeds and go right to the coke

645
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,270
dealers house. Like I had a plan.
We had done it so many times,

646
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,350
but I had to keep getting different
partners because I couldn't hit Freddie.

647
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,490
All I could do was tackle them.

648
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,670
I was good at tackling them and then
we want to go down and have my friend

649
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:15,240
kicked him a few times. It just fucking
horrible, but when you're 16 Joe,

650
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,250
what the fuck though? You've got
to have a good time. You know

651
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,340
you're not going to kick study Freddy
where you're going to kick Jesus Christ.

652
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,020
You're so right about the numbers.
My grandmother loved.

653
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,330
That's big Italian big and this is silly.

654
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:35,220
And then they have dreams and dreams.

655
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:37,170
The vesper came from them
in the middle of the night.

656
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,180
It's my grandma told him to play six 44.
Yup.

657
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,990
My grandmother would never
not shut the fuck up about it.

658
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:44,820
And then they give you a
little note and they fucking,

659
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,600
and this is psyllium is
almost as bad as the Cubans.

660
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,680
The old school, she's silly and are
very stupid. Stitious with the eyes.

661
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,960
They make those fucking soups with the
eye and shit. And I had fucking, I had,

662
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,870
I had to seal ends in my neighborhood
that I'm still very tight with.

663
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,520
I still talk to her a lot,

664
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:07,500
but even the way they spoke
Italian schedule like the way they,

665
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,520
the ferociousness and they're fucking
language cause they got beat up for years.

666
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,270
The history assists. Lee's a very
fucking sad one, but it's so, uh,

667
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,190
you know, there's that expression.
Never feel Rome. The snakes lot,

668
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,810
the snake lies coiled and a golden nugget.
The snake,

669
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,440
Laos called and Naples,
you know,

670
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,500
nobody ever gave Cecily respect that we're
like the best fucking child. You know,

671
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,590
the kids I grew up with have
blonde hair and blue eyes,

672
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,920
which really puts in doubt.

673
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,641
You know,

674
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:40,540
other people say that the
Moore's conquered sizzling
and raped them and shit.

675
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,110
And we discussed it to the night of the
vespers when all the men got up and cut

676
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:46,820
that big off and shit.
That's why it's happened.

677
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,290
If you look it up on Wikipedia at night
of a thousand vespers or something,

678
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,260
look it up guys. Let's get this
fax right. If a thousand vests,

679
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,580
s'mores with torturing the Sicilians in
the 1400 tortured and 15 hundreds and

680
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,810
they were fucking raping that women.

681
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,280
And One night the Sicilians got together
and fucking couldn't take it no more.

682
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:07,960
And they got up and I know one night
and they killed these mother fuckers,

683
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,720
but they cut that Dick's off and
shoved them in the fucking mouth.

684
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,560
And that's why it Sicilians are very
sensitive when it comes to the issue of

685
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:18,700
rape. They can't, they can't because
it's in their DNA. Like they can't,

686
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,520
they got raped. They got slaughtered.
It's an that fucking thing.

687
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,170
These Moore's the Moore's or who like
crazy black people from Africa that

688
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,300
fucking left age. I think they
offer map. Yeah. That's from Africa.

689
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:33,301
The Moore's guys we know is the whole
premise of that scene and I'm a true

690
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,520
romance.
The Sicilian vespers,

691
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,540
the name given to successful rebellion
on the island of Sicily that broke out in

692
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,600
the Easter of 1282 against the rule.

693
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,180
The French Capetian King Charles
the first, yeah, it was wrong.

694
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,960
Who had ruled the king of Sicily
since 1266 within six weeks,

695
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,170
3000 French men and women
were slain by the rebels,

696
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,770
the rebels and the government of King
Charles lost control of the island.

697
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,630
It was the beginning of the
war of the Sicilian vespers.
Hmm. Like get to go down,

698
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,950
but it got people [inaudible]. Once you
get to the Moise Sicilian or breast,

699
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,050
that's a fucked up country.
That's like Cuba.

700
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,520
So they fucking sac that belief
in the Catholicism religion,

701
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,990
but a little more like most
people. That's my people. Yeah. No,

702
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:18,370
a little more than most people.

703
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,600
They really believe and they put them a
Luke on yet and I hope you fucking die.

704
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,610
They spit on themselves.
You know,

705
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,270
my mom couldn't say cancer without
spitting on herself. What does,

706
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,730
somebody would say cancer.
My mom will,

707
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,230
I do it all the time now. People
talking about cancer, about myself,

708
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:43,120
I spend on myself and so weird.
That was my grandmother.

709
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,160
My grandmother was so crazy,
man.

710
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,670
My grandmother went to jail because she
wouldn't write out the mom because she

711
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,500
was running numbers. My grandmother
was running numbers. We,

712
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,110
she went to Jeff for six months.
We'd always be like, where's grandma?

713
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,490
She's with an aunt Annie. Where's
grandma? She's with at marine like,

714
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:00,010
why isn't she with Amory?
Like doesn't make any sense.

715
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,870
Then one day when I was like 20 they told
me, Greg, you know, grandma was in jail,

716
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:08,950
right? And I was like,
what? She was crazy.

717
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,280
She had a monkey named Chichi.
The monkey lived in the attic.

718
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,030
My grandmother was off the charts crazy.
She was very artistic

719
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,310
and a Chichi fucking hated
everybody except my grandma.

720
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,760
My grandma would feed this monkey gum,
the gum,

721
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,580
the monkey would take a stick of gum,
unwrapped the gum.

722
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,600
Let me start chewing gum in front of you.
The monkey knew that it was gum.

723
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,010
It didn't try to eat.
It just chewed

724
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,370
it like you would chew gum. The monkey
would sit there and chew fucking gum.

725
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,240
He would eat. He would peel
bananas in front of you to
be, you have come near him.

726
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,051
When he was with her,

727
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:46,400
he will bite your fucking face like no
one could come near Cigi she was the only

728
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,720
one, so there's like crazy lady had a
monkey and her base or in her attic.

729
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,020
So we would come over to hang out. My
Grandmother, she'd make homemade pasta.

730
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,830
They would make homemade sauce from
the tomatoes that my grandfather grew,

731
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,170
those jersey beef, steak,
tomatoes. He always had a garden.

732
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,180
My grandfather always had.

733
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,110
He always had a big fucking
fenced in garden in his back,

734
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,030
like he was growing all kinds of things.

735
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,000
He would tell you how to grow and
he was very meticulous about it.

736
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,900
Like he was really invested in this
garden and they would take the tomatoes,

737
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,550
they would make fresh tomato sauce.

738
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,000
My grandmother would make fresh homemade
pasta. It was fucking sensational.

739
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,720
The food was sensational.
My,

740
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,910
my grandmother's homemade pasta has a
taste that liked to this day I don't,

741
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,280
I don't think I've ever experienced
it anywhere else before.

742
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,910
Cause you can get really good
homemade pasta at a restaurant.

743
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:36,320
You can get really good homemade pasta,
you know, in a nice place or some,

744
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,670
some folks know how to make it.

745
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,940
But when you're getting it from someone
who's like literally making it in the

746
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:46,670
same way that the,
the original immigrants,

747
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,650
it's very different than
the way Italians make it.

748
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,150
The Italians in North America have
a very different style of, of food,

749
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:56,180
of cooking with red sauce.
You're like, that's not as,

750
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:59,060
that was not as popular in
Italy is it wasn't miracle.

751
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:02,090
All this pasta and meatballs,
Spaghetti and meatballs,

752
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,240
these are American Italian dishes and
my grandmother was a master at those.

753
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh my God.
She would make these fucking meatballs.

754
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,710
You would walk in the house
and they'd be cooking.

755
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:17,180
You'd hear the crackling and the you like,
good fucking Lord.

756
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,610
She would cook them on a frying Pan,

757
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,420
just get these motherfuckers perfect and
crackling and then she would cook them

758
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:28,340
in the sauce for hours,
had sausage, blip, blip,

759
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,360
blip, just simmering for hours. She would
check it, stick a wooden spoon near him,

760
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,140
put that fucking live right
back on and walk away.

761
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:40,100
She knew when it was done and you
would have this fucking Italian food.

762
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:44,840
It was just so ridiculous, so ridiculous,
but it's, they've been Americanized,

763
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:47,330
but if you go to some homes I got,

764
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,240
there was a hole in my neighborhood
who were very nice people and the

765
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,900
grandmother always cooked and
her dishes were never red sauce.

766
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:57,380
There were always based with
pasta with beans, which I love.

767
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,130
I love teaching pasta. I love
Pasta for Zul at Spanish. Lissa,

768
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,490
there's no better mail for you as a
health thing. I don't give a fuck.

769
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:06,050
'Em some people say Pasta,

770
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,880
a zoo and some fast because
they would go to olive garden.

771
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,330
But what is the right way to say, oh
no, I don't know because my credit,

772
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,520
my family always said
[inaudible] foster for a zoo.

773
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,820
But what is positive as Jolie?
That's the same thing.

774
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,990
You don't know how it breaks it a dialect.

775
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,980
It's got that stuff and it's not spinach.
If something else is there,

776
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:29,720
the different dishes. Uh, I'm
not, it's the same dish. Gyro,

777
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:32,490
Euro. Honestly, I think it's everybody

778
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,170
has it.
You know,

779
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,240
somebody possibles rule is completely
different than if you go to whole foods.

780
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,990
It's completely different than when
I go to my friends and jerseys.

781
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,440
It's a thicker stock.
It's got the spinach with uh,

782
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:51,270
with the beans and the little fucking
pastas in it and they freeze it.

783
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,590
And that's where the strength comes in.

784
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:56,010
It's like get stronger and
stronger and that garlic,

785
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:59,610
and in the winter that's what they
offer you. But that's port map. See,

786
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:00,780
Italians were very poor,

787
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,120
so all the dishes are based around really
potato beans and pasta and bread and

788
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,260
bread.
Bread was big.

789
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,760
My grandfather used to go to this bread
store that was a bakery that was down

790
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:14,100
the block. We would walk down
the block on North Ninth Street.

791
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,360
We'd go about two blocks down and we
walk into this old school Italian bakery

792
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:21,540
that, you know, it's since
1926 I'm shelling the on the,

793
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,750
on the sign and you would get basically
the same kind of bread every day.

794
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,640
And it's sensational.

795
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,320
Had fucking real Italian bread
from New York, New Jersey,

796
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:34,080
like that area from the immigrants.
Holy Shit was that good.

797
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,790
And he wasn't just get bread brown cross
got that motherfucker with a serrated

798
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,730
knife and it's just so,
it's just delicious.

799
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:44,370
Like you don't get bread like
that out here for some reason.

800
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,200
And if it was a good day to
motherfuck was making separately,

801
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,360
oh what kind of them in the bag would
leak on the sugar and on the way home

802
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:56,250
you'll be inhaling bread and fucking
Zappa. Lee's and nobody gained a pound.

803
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,230
Nobody was allergic to gluten.

804
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,240
It was not people rub example is on their
fucking faces cause I was one of them.

805
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,020
Let me tell you what, what
meal I discovered like at
12 and the Italian house.

806
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,550
Fucking Cannoli, because from
Hoboken Karma, mine would
go to Hoboken and pick up,

807
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:15,570
I know he's a guy would only make 16 of
them on Fridays. So you had an older guy.

808
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,680
He only gave me for that type
of shit. Like that family.
It was that type of shit.

809
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,360
Hoboken's very Italian.

810
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,540
What happened to Hoboken was like
anywhere else and we don't want to live in

811
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:27,660
Hoboken no more. We're going to
move to, you know, Jersey City.

812
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,570
So all those areas got to
taste the whole booklet.

813
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,960
But all of that northern New Jersey Shit,
that's all whole boat.

814
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,340
And at the end of the fucking day,

815
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,210
those are years and years of Italians
that were in Hoboken, you know,

816
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:42,600
working on the trains and all that
shit. You know, Hoboken, when we,

817
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,860
if you ever saw Hoboken in the
eighties it was a fucking die.

818
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,850
You would go to fourth street, all
that shit. You get mugged on it.

819
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:53,790
They were fucking around when Bob Dubois
and all those guys are Mondo a rebus.

820
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,300
We're running fucking
basketball down there. You went.

821
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,610
I used to take a bus to Hoboken
to play basketball and pro.

822
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:03,120
You had a guard that fucking ball.
You gotta Watch your hooded sweatshirt.

823
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,800
They would jack your shit though.

824
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,610
But I knew the benders down there and
I used to go down and I used to go to a

825
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:12,680
place down there that
had that bread the point,

826
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,520
because it's not round that that's
the shit you see now. I see it.

827
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:22,500
At times it would get round. Loves to,
Oh my God, at the top of the witch's hat,

828
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,360
take that mother fuck off and put a,

829
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:27,840
put a piece of hotel Bob Butler in
that mother fucker and let it come out.

830
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,700
Good googling you.
Feel your heartbeat now.

831
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,030
And this is appellee's now that
you'll never see that again.

832
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,930
I think that there's still parts of the
city and somebody, one of those guys,

833
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,640
I think Anthony Bordain went to Brooklyn
a few weeks ago and he went to one of

834
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,590
those places that had Zappa.
He's somebody.

835
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,660
It Bordain went into this one.
There's like a,

836
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,210
an Italian Deli that serves lunch.

837
00:47:50,211 --> 00:47:54,560
They'll serve like pasta with red sauce
and a meatball and the place has been

838
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:59,561
under the same family's ownership since
the 18 hundreds some crazy like that.

839
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,470
And this guy who was running it was a
little boy. He's a, he's an old man.

840
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:07,250
He was a little boy when he started
working there and so Bordain she's showing

841
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,810
these pictures of him and he's old school,

842
00:48:08,811 --> 00:48:12,560
black and white pictures of him in this
place and now hearing is running it.

843
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,630
It's crazy.
Like those,

844
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,980
that's like a direct connection to the
people that came over on those boats.

845
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,260
That's, that's wild shit man. I don't
think about it too much, but when I do,

846
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,450
my grandparents were both
born in other countries.

847
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,530
They were both born in Italy and
my grandfather on my father's side,

848
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:33,980
I was born in Ireland. My grandmother
on my father's side was born in Italy.

849
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,410
They were all immigrants,
all of them.

850
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,360
They all came over in a
wave and the twenties and
thirties and they survived the

851
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:44,990
fucking great depression dev or
a different kind of human being.

852
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,150
There are different kinds of human beings
then we are today so much show the,

853
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:55,151
the metamorphosis of the human race from
the time that people came over on boats

854
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,230
to what we are today. It's,
it's bananas. I mean it's,

855
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,450
it's almost like one of the
biggest leaps of, of like,

856
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,700
of like a culture changing.

857
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:11,870
I'm going to wrap it away like the human
beings have today in comparison to the

858
00:49:11,871 --> 00:49:16,640
human beings have, you know, naming to
[inaudible] number a hundred years ago,

859
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,660
you know,
cause my grandparents,

860
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,960
it's basically almost a hundred years
before they came over here. It's crazy.

861
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,000
That's a crazy world.
They lived in Joey,

862
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,360
they didn't even have a video of
what the United States look like.

863
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,350
And they had the balls to get in the
boat with kids and come across the ocean.

864
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,820
No, it was supposed to be a
better life. And it was, you know,

865
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,140
people don't know is an episode of
Sopranos when he explains how, uh,

866
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,170
they all came to a neighborhood,
remember there's a beautiful episode.

867
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:45,410
And he goes, oh, when they
tried to buy the eggs member,

868
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,680
they tried to buy the store where they
had eggs on the corner. And he goes,

869
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,530
let me tell you something.
He goes, we came here,

870
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,320
my family came in 80 years ago and
we all moved to a neighborhood.

871
00:49:54,321 --> 00:49:58,820
That's what families did show all
the Rogan's would live on third,

872
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,500
every Rogan cousin, you know, they
weren't all Rogan's, uh, whatever.

873
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,910
They are regular on all those.
They will all know my,

874
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,530
my grandfather's name was rogue, rogue.
And so they all moved into an area.

875
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,440
And then when they got,
when he said that goes down,

876
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,620
they went up to get the Gulch.

877
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,950
He goes and they all went to
Broomfield and he goes, you know,

878
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,560
is the only place in the neighborhood
that you could still go and get chicken

879
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:23,220
eggs, not those fucking supermarket eggs.
He goes, I can't sell it ticket. And it,

880
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:28,000
and it was all those neighbors, whether
it's whole book and uh, Brooklyn get

881
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,190
all those Canarsie,
those Italian people came over,

882
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,040
they live nine to one apartment,
you know, and you know,

883
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:39,041
what really saddens you that those people
that came over and never got to see

884
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:41,090
the fruits of their labor,

885
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,230
they never got to see what their great
grandson did or what do you know what I'm

886
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,190
saying? Like in a way,
yeah, but they did. I mean,

887
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,860
I think they got to see the world change.
You know,

888
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:54,620
anybody that came over from the
1920s and went through World War II,

889
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,220
you've got to see some goddamn
crazy changing the world. You know?

890
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,530
And I think back then to a greater
sense that the good guys won. You know,

891
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,220
right now the lines kind of blurry the
United States back in the 1940s after we

892
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:08,880
won World War Two and
it was over and they ha,

893
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,760
they show people like
kissing in the streets.

894
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,290
You're not going to see that shit again.
That's,

895
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,070
we don't have the same
enthusiasm about wars.

896
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:19,550
They did that because back then they
really thought there was good guys and bad

897
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:21,900
guys. It was real simple.
There was Nazis back then.

898
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,070
There was kamikaze is back then.
It was crazy method up.

899
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:29,720
Japanese dudes were flying planes into
fucking boats. They attacked Pearl Harbor.

900
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,500
They get, they didn't give
a fuck. This was a dangerous
time. So when the, when the,

901
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:34,780
when Japan won,

902
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,890
when Japan signed and after
they bombed Hiroshima, Nagasaki,

903
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:44,891
when they eliminated those fucking cities
and Japan signed the trust agreement

904
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:50,360
or whatever the fuck it was,
that was everybody was, it
was over. Like we had one,

905
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,020
like people were happy as fuck back then.
So they went through that,

906
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,760
which is a pretty crazy time.

907
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,650
They went from the time of no movies
to movies. That's a crazy time.

908
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,620
They went to see movies.
They like one of the first,

909
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,590
well their generation was
the first have televisions.

910
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,560
Like he saw TV for the first time
when there was no TV before them.

911
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,120
No one had ever had TV before.

912
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,500
When people return home from World War
Two where they treated the way when

913
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:17,360
people came back from Vietnam?
No,

914
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,320
I told him he would spit on totally your
fucking baby killer and all that shit.

915
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,480
That fucking stinks.

916
00:52:22,481 --> 00:52:27,080
Start when was it fucking good to go
to the airport after a war and spit at

917
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:28,340
people went over there.

918
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,700
You have a fucking opinion about somebody
who went over there and actually put

919
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:33,710
his life up,
whether he knew what not.

920
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:36,230
What the fuck is going on in
your 18 fucking years old?

921
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,740
I think when World War Two didn't they
take give you a dirty fucking five

922
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,950
minutes. Give a fuck. Right. A World
War One. I think those fucking whores,

923
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,010
I don't know if anybody really did
spit on anybody in calm baby killers.

924
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,670
They did some and deserves all the
hippies and all that shit. There was a,

925
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,730
that was a part of the thing that someone
refuted about the Chris Kyle Story

926
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:57,310
Cause Chris Kyle said
that that happened to him.

927
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,830
Someone calling him a baby killer and
he was saying that this is all like what

928
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:03,530
he's doing. He's repeating something
that someone else had. Man,

929
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,790
I need to look into it more.

930
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,840
But for sure they were treated like a
lot of people thought the Vietnam War was

931
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:09,674
a bad idea.

932
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,100
They didn't think it was the same as
the way they thought of World War II,

933
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,070
World War II. It was like a war that
everybody kind of agreed how to happen.

934
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,340
There was a crazy guy in Germany that
was taken over the world and he was

935
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:23,360
killing Jews. He killed millions of
fucking people. Then there was a Japanese,

936
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:26,340
they were in on it together.
Somehow mean didn't even make any sense.

937
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,830
They don't even speak the same language.
They're in cahoots.

938
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,910
So it was the Japanese and then there was
the fucking Americans and the Russians

939
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:36,480
were involved and like fucking Christ.
So when that was over,

940
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,860
those people would experience some
gigantic change. They felt like,

941
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,140
probably made sense that
they came over here.

942
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:45,630
They came over to the baddest
fucking team ever, you know,

943
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:49,800
and everybody was like a part of it.
When when you see that celebration,

944
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,820
everybody's kissing in the streets and
everything after the Japanese surrendered.

945
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,650
That's a,
that's a powerful,

946
00:53:55,651 --> 00:54:00,300
iconic slice of like that embodies like
what that time meant to a lot of people.

947
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,580
That shit doesn't happen now.
So they,

948
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,640
I think they experienced
a lot of pretty cool shit.

949
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,750
They experienced a lot of God damn change
and the what we're living right now,

950
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:12,180
I mean there's an amazing
as this world is right now,

951
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,980
if we keep going at the same rate,

952
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,260
I think a hundred years from now people
are going to look back at this time.

953
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:18,750
I go, look at these silly fucks. God Damn,

954
00:54:18,751 --> 00:54:21,900
these people were suffering that
he's still got colds. You know,

955
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:24,990
they still had to worry about losing
weight. They still had to worry about,

956
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:28,710
you know, getting enough sleep. Like
they were worried about their health.

957
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,280
Like these poor fuckers, if they
got the flu, they had to stay home.

958
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,710
Like this is going to be some
shit a hundred years from now.

959
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,560
It's going to just fix everything.
Anytime anything's wrong.

960
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,260
There's not going to be, there's not
going to be more health concerns.

961
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:44,610
Our concern is going to be making sure
that we don't have too many people on the

962
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:47,550
earth. That's going to be our number
one concern in like a hundred years,

963
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,420
but it's the things that we
look at now and we think, God,

964
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:56,040
I couldn't imagine living like they lived
in 1920s fuck that little stupid ass

965
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:58,920
TV.
The little tiny as black and white TV.

966
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,370
That was the size of a laptop and it was
in a cabinet that looked like a fucking

967
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:04,830
gun safe.
You remember those stupid things?

968
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,250
Giant ass cabinets with his little stupid
screen that was black and white and a

969
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,810
record player on top and it
would lift the whole thing.

970
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:17,460
We'll lift up on top and he had all the
speakers on the TV in the middle with

971
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:21,900
the controls over here that you had to
lift up and over here was directed play,

972
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,550
so we had a switch TV to stereo and then
the speakers were over here and they

973
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:28,950
both came and Jesus.
Those things are cool.

974
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,650
That's what I watched superman
on for my first time as a kid.

975
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:33,300
I remember watching it
on TV on one of those,

976
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,600
I watch a lot of fucking Yankee Games
and my grandfather's and you don't do it,

977
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:40,470
dude. When the TV would go bad,
they'd put a smaller TV on top of it.

978
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,470
They didn't want to get rid of
the cabinet, so cause the cabinet,

979
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:46,080
it was so nice and then TV
started becoming smaller.

980
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,830
They became like a plastic box,
like a shitty kind of plastic box.

981
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:51,450
I take that shitty plastic box,

982
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,780
put it right on top of the other
fucking teeth like everybody did that.

983
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,000
Everybody had a TV on
top of the broken TV.

984
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,020
My mom put a TV on top of [inaudible].

985
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,280
She could see the mets and
the Yankees at the same time.

986
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,570
That's how my mom does that.
Cuba, they loved that baseball,

987
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,070
she loved the beds,

988
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:14,310
put sewer love like what we was
playing the Yankees or whatever.

989
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:19,290
So she was the original sports
bar at the house, at your house,

990
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,420
but she was the original sport
where you go to a sports bar,

991
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,160
you're overwhelmed by the amount of
different games that are going on at once,

992
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,731
but that will show,

993
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:29,731
remember the fights I saw at a
bar like at her bar I saw it was,

994
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,080
I got an education that I don't remember.

995
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,910
Lot of those fights even have to tell me,

996
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:38,830
but I saw all the great fights that
were on ABC sports center at that bar.

997
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:41,770
When they fight in the afternoons,
four 30 in the afternoons on Saturday,

998
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,100
I still remember this is how fucking old
guy am I did a scam for with these Jews

999
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,170
with side learns, his fucking
Jew in Jersey where he, for
years he used to bug me.

1000
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:54,280
Listen,
if you ever need any money,

1001
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:57,040
we exclude somebody and when
he would do is in the daytime,

1002
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:01,660
he'd go around and look for holes and
then consistency in supermarkets and shit

1003
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,600
and he set up the whole thing for you.
All you have to do is fall.

1004
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,580
God, it's so crazy. The

1005
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,290
guy was a genius.
They paid them,

1006
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:21,291
the major colleges and some pro football
teams paid him and he would fly out and

1007
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:25,020
scout other teams. That's how much
of a genius he was. He was, he was,

1008
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,740
what do you call those people are not
dunks. And he always says those people,

1009
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:33,360
they're good at. They're only good at one
thing. Idiot savant. He would, I mean,

1010
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:38,160
he was missing a tooth. His shorts
had piano. He looked in a garage.

1011
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,110
Okay, because every dollar he spent was
it the generate gamma. Oh, but that's,

1012
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,650
that's what he did. He went around in
the daytime looking for holes and shit,

1013
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,080
and he's like, wait, what do you
want? What do you need? Plenty. Geez,

1014
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,120
I'll make it 20 it.
When we go to the supermarket,

1015
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,430
I don't knock over the apple sauce.

1016
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,550
You fall down and stayed down
to like give you the nod. Right?

1017
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,720
You start yelling and screaming. Then you
pass out. And when the lady comes over,

1018
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:02,640
he had the whole scan.
The next day he picked you up.

1019
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,420
He took it to the attorney's office.
He took it to the hospital,

1020
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,470
he took it to the chiropractor's office.
He took it to everywhere you had a beat.

1021
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,070
And his philosophy is he got you
with as many doctors as he could.

1022
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:14,940
You got to quit your job,

1023
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,960
you got to quit your day job because
all he did was make appointments for you

1024
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,290
and everybody was in on the scan.
So when his world,

1025
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,270
the more the higher your doctor bills,

1026
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:29,070
you got 10 times that Shaviah doctor
bills are like fucking or something like

1027
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:30,810
that.
If your doctor bills were half a million,

1028
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,430
he could get you a hundred
thousand 200,000 you know,
like if you lost a finger,

1029
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:39,900
he had the home menu or you need 60,000
give me a finger, you know, fuck it.

1030
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,710
Let's lose a finger on the top and
shit like that. He was that crazy. Wow.

1031
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,580
So I had to go to a chiropractor and
he tells me that's how he sold it.

1032
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,450
You want to make money,
you got to punch in.

1033
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,130
So you've got to go to all those doctors
every day and take the treatment.

1034
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,820
And the doctors have to
give you the treatment even
though they know it's a scam,

1035
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:01,470
they're rent on it. So that I
remember going to the chiropractor,

1036
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,150
he would put those laser beams on me,

1037
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,840
those pads and my back and just walk
out of the room and then come back.

1038
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,490
But I went up there the day,
boom. Mcne killed the Korean guy.

1039
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,540
It was on wide world of sports. I'm a
Saturday afternoon and I had none of that.

1040
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,340
It was like time stopped.

1041
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,540
Like the phone was ringing
at the chiropractor's office
and nobody was Hansard.

1042
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,380
That's how much of an
intense fight this was.

1043
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:27,920
Like the people came out from behind
the counter and it was on regular TV.

1044
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,980
I think Fox had just come in.
Fox wasn't still around.

1045
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,650
I don't think it was around, you know,
there was like ABC wide world of sports,

1046
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,490
83 83 one year to Fox come around.

1047
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,160
It was when I was in high school.
So that was in high school.

1048
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,730
They had a,
the Simpsons and America's most wanted,

1049
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:51,380
so 88 86 no shit.
I was out of high school.

1050
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,310
Wow. So it must've been when I
was still living at home. This,

1051
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,350
I remember the Simpsons.

1052
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,970
I mean that was when it didn't
Fox start with the Simpsons,

1053
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,040
the Tracey Ullman show. When did
the Simpsons since 1989, Tracy,

1054
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,390
all men had the Simpsons
are in it. It was, uh,

1055
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,860
like really horrible animation
in the Tracey Ullman show.

1056
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,670
Remember the Simpsons looked all weird
and they all look messed up and I don't

1057
01:00:14,671 --> 01:00:18,690
really remember my,
that, my memory of that.

1058
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:20,040
It's foggy shit.

1059
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:23,880
But I do remember watching those fights
on ABC wide world of sports. You know,

1060
01:00:23,881 --> 01:00:26,190
they had a,
NBC had boxing on a Friday night,

1061
01:00:26,191 --> 01:00:29,190
recently pit world
champion or maybe Saturday,

1062
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:34,290
but a Adrian Broner versus a John Molina.
And then they had,

1063
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:37,080
um, what's the other fight? Uh,

1064
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:41,910
Keith Thurman Versus um,
Robert Carrera, good fights,

1065
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,340
but they went the distance.
Bolton,

1066
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:48,120
what the distance when you watching
boxing on regular TV? It feels weird.

1067
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,760
I was like, Whoa, it's box on TV again.

1068
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,400
Like it's been off of regular
TV for a long ass time.

1069
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,350
I think that, uh, that's one
show they should bring back.

1070
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,100
I think that was my first discovery
channel was wild world of sports.

1071
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:05,180
That was one of the most interesting
shows when I was growing up because you

1072
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:06,470
didn't know what you were going to watch.

1073
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:11,030
Sometimes I don't think wide world of
sports with lasted a bar that I like or

1074
01:01:11,031 --> 01:01:14,570
even then because every once in a while
they to have like ballet from China.

1075
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:19,910
Hong Kong people go ape shit.
I still remember watching Arron banks,

1076
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,930
uh, karate championships. I'm
wild world of sports as a kid.

1077
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,630
I used to go to the garden
to watch this. Uh, but uh,

1078
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:32,360
his big closer was the guy who they put
a mirror in front of and they'd shoot at

1079
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:36,710
them when they're 22 and he'd put a
mouthpiece in his mouth and he catched the

1080
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,870
bullet.
Come on you guys.

1081
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,370
The guys doing the trick
though, right? I listen.

1082
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:47,240
I'd love to fucking tell you know, I think
I'm pretty sure that's a fucking jerk.

1083
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,890
He catches it and then he spits the bullet
on the frying pan and smoke comes out

1084
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:55,880
of the fucking bullet. I don't know.
You know, but that was his main thing.

1085
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,050
It's some sort of, how do
you practice? I mean that,

1086
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:00,230
that was what I always wanted to know.

1087
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,200
What the fuck do they have a
practice here? Eat Bullets.

1088
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,300
Who's going to let you
come over and you shoot.

1089
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't want to 22 it's taught
by throwing grapes in his mouth.

1090
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,860
Are you fucking crazy? A great bit
of bullets. Two different bodies.

1091
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:16,100
But you got to start slow. Oh my God.
That's how I used to figure it out.

1092
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,160
Nobody could just just do it one time.
You got to practice that shit and

1093
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,780
tell the timing and fucking Pam and
no to twist. And that's a carny trick.

1094
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,950
And if they did do it,
there's gotta be some bodies involved.

1095
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,540
Like we got to do a documentary on them,

1096
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,030
whoever the bodies of the people tried
to catch bullets with their teeth.

1097
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:35,640
Like let's not try the shotgun this time.

1098
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,480
It's just try regular gun
or a BB gun or something.

1099
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,860
Well they definitely have killed people
accidentally and those like stupid like

1100
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:47,310
magic tricks, stunts. It's definitely
happened. It's definitely happened.

1101
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,570
I know I've read it.

1102
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,900
I've read stories about people
dying doing crazy magic experiments.

1103
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:57,000
When you try to like really
push the limits, you got a
lot of variables involved.

1104
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,420
One could go wrong. Next thing
you know you're fake gun. Like,

1105
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,040
like when Brandon lead died,

1106
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:06,640
he died on a set of a movie in a special
effects scene. They shot him with a,

1107
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,910
a fake gun,
a gun with blanks.

1108
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:12,990
But there was some piece of a shell or
something that was still in the chamber,

1109
01:03:12,991 --> 01:03:15,660
that gun and that shot into him.
You know,

1110
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:20,580
that was what the triads got them.
Do you think so? You really do.

1111
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,910
You know those people, that Sicilian
dog. Listen, you don't want,

1112
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:28,140
I'm going to kill you and your fucking
son. They did it. That's what it is.

1113
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,930
Cause I had heard that he died,

1114
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:34,800
that Bruce Lee died from some sort of an
allergic reaction to a drug or listen,

1115
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:35,611
he,
he was doing,

1116
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:39,780
he did three or four movies with
these fucking have fucking salesman.

1117
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,670
They invested $6,000 and they fucking
went to the bank and said they made

1118
01:03:44,671 --> 01:03:47,190
millions. Nobody knows how
much enter the Dragon, man.

1119
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,620
Nobody knows it's 42 years and correct.

1120
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,010
80 90 it's 42 years and see what
that made worldwide the first week.

1121
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,530
You know what I mean? Fucking copies.
Enter the dragon are not there.

1122
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,630
That's Raymond Chow after fucking Raymond
chowder the business with the studios.

1123
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,380
Amen. Enter the Dragon. I don't know if
he, it was Raymond Chow, the other guy,

1124
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,350
sterling silhouette or one of those
fucking guys. After Bruce Lee die,

1125
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:15,060
there's a Raymond child really fucking
blew up and he was a heroin fucking guy

1126
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,380
through him. He ended up, he ended up,
what are your own child? Child stood.

1127
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:21,240
What was the name of Ron? Ron
Chow. Run one child studios.

1128
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:25,050
They ended up doing Charles Bronson
movies and Clint Eastwood Movies and Shit.

1129
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:30,040
They gave him a color. The action
somewhere. Another. Wow. This is a,

1130
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,830
this is crazy. It says he died
from a cerebral edema. Right?

1131
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,650
Some Chinese guy could tell you anything.
Listen, my father died of a cocaine,

1132
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:39,930
heroin overdose of heroin overdose.

1133
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,540
They told me he died of a heart
attack and then never signed the death

1134
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,460
certificate.
Where's that doctor today?

1135
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,150
I guarantee you got hit by a bus two
weeks fucking later after they signed that

1136
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,070
cerebral Herbert told,

1137
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:52,530
but that guy died two weeks later
and a fucking building fire.

1138
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,310
He could go out of the fucking elevator.
This is what it says here, Ron,

1139
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:59,910
at the time, I mean obviously when
someone's writing something in Wikipedia,

1140
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:01,980
decades after the fact,
who knows?

1141
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,930
Who knows how much they went to some
chicks house off the bat, he was adultery.

1142
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,480
They paid that chick to bring them over
and that's what they fucking whacked

1143
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:11,730
them.
It says around the time of Lee's death,

1144
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:15,900
numerous rumors appeared in the media at
least iconic status and unlikely demise

1145
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:18,220
fed many wild rumors and theories.

1146
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:22,360
These include murder involving the triads
and it's opposed as a curse on him and

1147
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:25,160
his family.
That's all I tell you.

1148
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,090
What the fuck we can get used.

1149
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:32,800
Electrical muscular stimulation that
may have exacerbated or resulted in his

1150
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:36,790
condition. That doesn't make any sense.
So what they're saying is his conclusion.

1151
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,540
David, a tier a forensic scientist, uh,

1152
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:44,710
recommended by Scotland Yard
who'd overseeing a thousand
autopsies was assigned

1153
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:45,520
to the case.

1154
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:50,520
His conclusion was death by misadventure
caused by an acute cerebral edema to a

1155
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,170
reaction,
uh,

1156
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:56,770
to compounds present in the
combination medication equip Jessic.

1157
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,150
I don't know what that shit is.

1158
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,580
Pain relieved rule for a
headache or something like that.

1159
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,590
So all this side kicks he took to the
fucking head and all the aspirins,

1160
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:05,361
he took an China.

1161
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,800
It never affected them until that fucking
night when he went to madame choose

1162
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,030
fucking house.
I mean,

1163
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:14,260
he died with his Stan because
he was actually in bed with
her. He was in her bed.

1164
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:18,400
I mean, a bunch of stories change to make
them look bad at the end when he left,

1165
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:22,720
uh, those people that do enter the dragon,
he pissed off a lot of people. Man.

1166
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,490
He was making them a lot of
fucking money. Well, you know what?

1167
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:28,780
Apparently he was already having seizures.
There was a doctor,

1168
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:33,781
a neurosurgeon who treated a Bruce Lee
during his first seizure in May of 1973

1169
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,810
he was eating hash to fucking
come down from the pain.

1170
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,300
He was one of the first people that
figured out that has sheets was what's,

1171
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,400
what's Advil when you'd take
it? What's Advil? Ibuprofen.

1172
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,090
What's the really duty beside
killed playing? What's, see,

1173
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,510
it's called a nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory hash is
and anti inflammatory.

1174
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:55,360
That is marijuana.
So Bruce Lee figured it out first.

1175
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:00,160
Bruce Lee used to eat hash after fucking
working out to, to reduce the thing.

1176
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,610
He would've died a long fucking,
he was brain wouldn't swallow.

1177
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:06,340
Long time ago that guy
died and the height guys,

1178
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:07,990
nobody right now.

1179
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,760
Right now there's not too many
people to remember the day he died.

1180
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:16,240
I've been first role and nobody even
heard the day he died because news didn't

1181
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,340
travel that fast.
There was no internet.

1182
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:20,860
We got it like two days
later that he died.

1183
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:24,580
And I remember half of Americans walking
around fucking wounded and that was one

1184
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:28,030
of those people. And I didn't believe
it because he was fucking healthy shit.

1185
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:31,150
He was flying through the air.
He was making it fucking happened,

1186
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,960
but he went back to China and God knows
what they did to him over that dog,

1187
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,660
and we'll never know. Here's
a, a preliminary appearance.

1188
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,250
This is really interesting of doctor
preliminary opinion of Doctor Peter Woo.

1189
01:07:42,251 --> 01:07:46,720
The neurosurgeon who treated lead during
his first seizure was that the cause of

1190
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:51,721
death should have been
attributed to either a reaction
to cannabis or equal just

1191
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:55,540
sick cannabis like his fucking this
is that, you know, it's bullshit.

1192
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,790
His doctor is telling them
that it might've been,

1193
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:00,770
we'd very potent Nepali
Hash Killed Bruce Lee.

1194
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,540
He was a Hashtag [inaudible]
he discovered it first. Listen,

1195
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:08,170
they used to be cookies at Kush
mark that whatever you wait,

1196
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,630
whatever you weight
during the week was good.

1197
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:14,430
But when he used to have these cookies
that were oatmeal in fuse would hash

1198
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,540
shore. And guys, that was
when I first started my diet,

1199
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:22,100
when I was 418 pounds and I couldn't walk
how sore and my ankles and I would eat

1200
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:25,690
two of those hash cookies and the next
day my ankles would be like a fucking

1201
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,970
pick the fucking hash
with reduce everything.

1202
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,640
I wouldn't even feel it bent over rows.
Nothing.

1203
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:35,090
My Back Hash is the best.
It's amazing.

1204
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:39,200
And he was fucked up Joey.
Okay. This is a, this is a fact,

1205
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:43,400
he had a ruptured disc in his back
that someone had given them. Yeah.

1206
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:46,790
But this is one of the reasons why he
was taking all kinds of different shit to

1207
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:50,600
try to deal with the uh, with the
pain. And He'd already had seizures.

1208
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,460
So he had seizures.

1209
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,880
He had a ruptured disc in his back
and he was getting medicated. Wayne,

1210
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,150
the seizure they talking
about is the shit.

1211
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:03,530
They tried to throw it into the dryer and
the biography about him cause he would

1212
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:06,050
go away.
Like he would go away,

1213
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:10,820
like he would go away and get
up to say Jo Jo Jo, oh sorry.

1214
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:13,070
But the doctor said it's saying seizure.

1215
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,540
It says neurosurgeon treated
him for his first seizure.

1216
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,110
It's the same guy that says that pot
might've killed them too though I don't

1217
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:25,100
believe nothing and I love Chinese people
and I loved the theories and stuff.

1218
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,740
You just think they killed him, Huh?
They killed him. They killed that.

1219
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:32,450
Chuck Norris said that his death was
a reaction between the muscle relaxant

1220
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,110
medication that had been taken
since 1968 for rupture disc,

1221
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:40,130
so he was taking that the ruptured disc
shit for a long time because he died in

1222
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:44,510
[inaudible] 73 he's still alive, but he's
not getting kicked in the head either.

1223
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,160
He switches. How many times do you think
he fell downstairs? Come on Joe Rogan.

1224
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,760
How many times you think Keith
Richards fell on the thing?

1225
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:53,780
You think you look like that?

1226
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:56,690
Because he seems like the type of dude
that would be able to figure it out

1227
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,530
correctly. This fucking guy
went into, listen, Joe Rogan,

1228
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,620
when you fucking with that type of
environment, you fuck with them.

1229
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:06,770
You could kill their mother and they don't
give a fuck when you hit their pocket.

1230
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,440
They don't deal with that shit.
They Chinese listen,

1231
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,850
the mafia concept was stolen
from the triads. There's still,

1232
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,320
they're the smartest guys in the world.
They still,

1233
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,090
they're probably at war with
the government from who's
bringing the heroin and

1234
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,770
they brought heroin in. Fee is
not one DEA case, not one da case.

1235
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:29,140
And go talking mole lane for heroin as
ever been caught on us from with genius

1236
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:32,780
geniuses. They pay everybody. These
guys, when it comes to that paper,

1237
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,960
they don't fuck around.
In 1985,

1238
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:40,280
they got sick and tired of giving the
mafia pounds a hand on a for $50,000.

1239
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,580
The Mafia was cut at 10 times making a
half a million and a $50,000 investment.

1240
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:51,910
They got sick and tired. The Chinese go
to go to fucking go to fucking, uh, uh,

1241
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:54,670
whatever. Now see how small little Italy
is. Who Do you think it took him from?

1242
01:10:55,270 --> 01:11:00,170
The Chinese. They don't fuck around
dog. They don't fuck around that.

1243
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,780
I don't like that.
That's still out there.

1244
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:04,700
There's motherfucker
when you go to Wyoming,

1245
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:08,450
why is there a Chinese restaurant that
you think Chinese people like Wyoming,

1246
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:10,730
all this state after the fucking hat,
the railroads,

1247
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:14,010
and then they got cutting on the fucking
heroin through it. I think that everyone

1248
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,340
gets to Wyoming. So fucking white
people and envelopes. Fuck, no,

1249
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,940
it's those Chinese people.
I don't really believe that that's a joke.

1250
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:26,700
But uh, I, I, when I was a kid, I
heard a lot of stuff about the Chinese.

1251
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,370
I don't want, I don't like to
believe crazy conspiracy theories,

1252
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:31,830
but if I was going to believe anyone,

1253
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,390
I would believe that the Chinese mob
would kill you if you somehow or another

1254
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:40,770
fuck the amount of money. I mean, that's,
that's one that seems like, let's go.

1255
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:43,320
All right. They made him famous too,
right? I mean, he wasn't famous for,

1256
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:48,090
for those movies. He was famous dog.
By the time he hit Chinese connection,

1257
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,890
I still remember the two hand punch.

1258
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:53,520
The two hand punching the school
was down the fucking commercial.

1259
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,050
We're watching happy days.

1260
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:59,130
Bitch was sitting around 20 fucking
Puerto Rican kids wear robes on at a

1261
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:02,170
Catholic school, pajamas on and
ready to go to bed and awesome.

1262
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:04,380
They go this Friday coming through
the movie through the play,

1263
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:08,190
the trailer with Chinese connection.
Jamie play the fucking trailer.

1264
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,830
It's a trailer.
Play the fucking trail.

1265
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,820
You've got to see the one
from the French connection.

1266
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,440
You would have to see the
one from the mechanic. Ooh,

1267
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:21,320
Ooh,
Ooh.

1268
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,620
Hard times has a phenomenal trailer.
Hard times have they had prayers,

1269
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,720
but it was the voice,
the tone of his voice.

1270
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,750
It was the voice before this
voice and he was a little mean.

1271
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:33,610
I got type of guy say then
play the children's hours,

1272
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:37,140
but I still remember the best trail
of all time is the French connection.

1273
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,340
Why they're shooting him in the bath as
he's going up to train and gene Hackman

1274
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:42,061
goes freeze.

1275
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:45,630
It's pop by and shoots him in the back
of me and they locked it and it said

1276
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:49,410
filmed in New York where it happened.
Look at the fucking look.

1277
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,240
A trailer for Chinese collection is shit.

1278
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,870
[inaudible].
Yup.

1279
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:56,863
Wow.

1280
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:01,550
Bruce Lee is the real
superstar and the week of his,

1281
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,460
what do you do if you excite
you right now? Watch this.

1282
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,660
What do you do if you're
a bigot? Bam, Bam,

1283
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:13,460
Bam. Nobody can tell you right here. What
do you do when you're ready? You'll move.

1284
01:13:13,461 --> 01:13:16,770
Fuck Buffy for whitetail.
What's this bliss.

1285
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:26,000
You lose your fucking mind. Fuck
God. Zillow. Plumbing's would,

1286
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,830
this was the first police would he went
back to the time they left his role in

1287
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,380
people to the fucking air with each hand.
Look at this.

1288
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:35,510
This was a trailer is when they
killed his teacher. Look at them.

1289
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:39,470
That's the opening. Look at it. Look at
young. This is a movie you have to watch.

1290
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,980
This is one of the greatest
movies of all time.

1291
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:48,710
He had fucking Steve Mcqueen and his,
he robbed the phone down of what?

1292
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:52,470
The doe
all dub.

1293
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,920
That wasn't even his voice because
they didn't like the way he talked.

1294
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,170
Look at this guy.
He kills this motherfucker.

1295
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,200
Hags that's how angry
he wasn't this movie,

1296
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,020
so Nah, don't dump. Don't, oops.

1297
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:11,790
Sounds like Bobby. Like watched it. This
one. He made them meet the guidelines.

1298
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:12,070
This is

1299
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,330
tremendous,
but down attack them.

1300
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,640
Everybody wanted to be Bruce.
He stopped the new judge in this movie.

1301
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:25,870
Oh you didn't bust the mind and fist of
fury, which became Chinese connection.

1302
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:29,860
He busted a mountain. This one. That's
when he made them meet the fucking glass.

1303
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,940
That's when he hung to the people.
That's when he killed the first Russian.

1304
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,020
Come on now who fucking
thing get dealing with?

1305
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,370
He does a move and that movie dog
that is so sensational. His anger,

1306
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,880
you know he started hanging motherfuckers,
nobody be hanging.

1307
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,360
That's Clint Eastwood Type Shit and hang
them high and we got to check the dates.

1308
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:52,240
Maybe Clint would rob them.
Of course he did.

1309
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,500
This is the harvest party
was hanging people back then.

1310
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,920
Do you bring the Chinese fucking people
had a had a chick to the fucking drama

1311
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:03,310
to see if they got the other trailer cause
see if they got the other really good

1312
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:06,340
trailer thing. Notice how he has to
make out with a Chinese check too.

1313
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,790
Would they have movies back then were
Chinese guy would make out with a white

1314
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:16,800
girl on film. Did they have movies
like that back then? I don't know what,

1315
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:21,700
enter the Dragon. Jimmy Lee. Fuck the
Chinese church, right? James. James Kelly.

1316
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:24,820
What was his name was Jim Kelly.
Jim Kelly. Jim Kelly fucked.

1317
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:29,620
I remember he could hit like eight of them
sent to his room. John Sax at the Wig.

1318
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,480
Is there another team? I remember
Chuck Norris versus Bruce Lee. Yeah.

1319
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:37,150
Let's watch that real quick. That's,
that's sensational. That's, yeah.

1320
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:41,230
See if he could find Chuck Norris
versus Bruce Lee came on HBO and my head

1321
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:42,064
almost.

1322
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,390
I made my mother get me Hbo on the
roof to came on because the chicks ran

1323
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:51,391
through the jungles with tits group tube
is cousins with Kentucky Fried Movie.

1324
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,530
What is it? I've never even heard of it.
I can take a free movie. No, the group,

1325
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,330
the groove tube is move to prove tube is
Saturday night live. Before Sinai lie,

1326
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:05,080
they made two movies called the Groove
Tube and Kentucky Fried Chicken,

1327
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,090
Kentucky Fried Moving Kentucky, Kentucky.
If I move, oh shit. Look at this.

1328
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,940
This is the game though. That's
the game. God Damn. Look,

1329
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,970
Chuck Norris taken off his black belt.
Look how young he is.

1330
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,323
Okay,

1331
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:21,170
and Bruce Lee, this is a gay porn. Look
how slowly they are on the roving. Oh,

1332
01:16:21,171 --> 01:16:23,660
this is the game.
And look at how we look at Charles Norris.

1333
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:26,420
Chuck Norris is chest. Charles
Norris. Look at his chest.

1334
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,560
It's all Harry and shits before dude's
figured out shaving your chest and when

1335
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:32,300
you see this,
and then you don't like wrestling,

1336
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:35,570
what do you think the big differences
like you know the movie mother fucker.

1337
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:40,720
That's it. That's all you're going to
see us play. This was Brian. This was,

1338
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,840
look, I'll rip Bruce. This was
something that you cannot imagine.

1339
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:49,340
This was every nerd had a hero.
Every immigrant out here, bro.

1340
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:53,120
Everybody had a hero. They'll give a
kitten. Look at the fucking kitten.

1341
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:57,250
Everybody had that place. Has a million
cats on there. The Roman Colosseum though.

1342
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,530
Look what he's warming up.
They're both warming up.

1343
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:03,650
They're doing cod a warm up for the fight.
We're looking at each other.

1344
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:07,040
This is the craziest ones.
I've seen tremendous shit, man.

1345
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:11,930
America has to put these four on and
realize why stop [inaudible] I'm Bruce Lee

1346
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:15,410
changed my life. You only saw one
fucking movie. You got to see all four.

1347
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:19,280
Forget the game of debt with Kareem
Abdul Jabbar. That's a harvest show.

1348
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:23,650
Just watch this one. Look at this.
That's what he does when he me out.

1349
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:25,630
It's just one of the fight
starts looking at him dog.

1350
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:30,380
He had like 6% body fat at this time.
This guy wasn't gonna die.

1351
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:34,640
Joe Rogan. People like this don't die.
Don't fucking insult me. He didn't die.

1352
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:37,400
They killed this poor little kid.
But this is really fascinating.

1353
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:42,401
I've never seen a movie that I recall
were two guys warmed up like this before a

1354
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:43,480
fight.
But that's,

1355
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:46,850
but this is fascinating how they
just don't even look at each other.

1356
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,751
They move away.

1357
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,810
They go in their own little fucking world
for awhile and they meet in the center

1358
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:55,130
like these are, this is a different
thing than a fight in a movie. You know

1359
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,610
I,
this is two guys agreeing.

1360
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,360
We have to find out who's the baddest
mother fucker alive. You know,

1361
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,640
they agree to do it the right way.
Everybody warms up.

1362
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:09,590
Bruce Lee catches a good sweat, so
it was chuck. This is crazy shit man.

1363
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:14,080
I forgot how crazy this is a,
this is the beginning guys. Well,

1364
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:18,980
Joe and I talked about the movies in
1973 you really want to watch this shit

1365
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:21,110
today. Go ahead. But
this is where it starts.

1366
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,530
This is where all these movies are stolen
from and they can't even steal them.

1367
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,600
They don't know why they even did this.
Okay?

1368
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,130
Bruce Lee is getting into his fighting
stance. You're the cap. Bam, Bam, Bam.

1369
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,880
Yeah.

1370
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,180
The bolts were on front leg roundhouse
kicks to open up with in front leg

1371
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:37,080
sidekicks.

1372
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,640
Okay.

1373
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,610
No one's hit anybody that
block and everything. Oh,

1374
01:18:42,611 --> 01:18:47,350
Chuck Norris scores or the wheel
kick to the face and smiles.

1375
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:52,300
He doesn't even follow up. He said,
gentlemen, no ground and pound, right.

1376
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,940
Oh Shit. Chuck is putting a
beating on him. Oh my goodness. Oh,

1377
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:00,850
Bruce Lee grabbed the god damn chest hair.
It's not fair.

1378
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,510
It's rude is this is also the beginning
of tank pseudo when chuck Norris split

1379
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:08,140
from tank taekwondo and he could
recreate this shit. Really? Yeah.

1380
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:11,050
He's a tank pseudo guy. Yeah,
but he, I don't think he created,

1381
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,870
well supposedly he had his, his style.
I mean it was definitely a style,

1382
01:19:13,871 --> 01:19:16,990
but it existed before, so they did
two different tanks who dose, right.

1383
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,560
This tank Sudo Su bog doll and
I think he went the other way.

1384
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,360
There's a superbug Dole that they all,

1385
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:24,970
they all started together but he
went the other way. Yeah. Tanks.

1386
01:19:24,971 --> 01:19:26,900
You don't have a little bit
of grappling in it. Yes.

1387
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,890
They had more grappling it then talk
to doe did they had like some risks,

1388
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:33,100
locks and joint locks and stuff.
Hey, we go. So he gets his timing.

1389
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:37,780
He starts fucking jumping up and
down and it's all fucking lights out

1390
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,410
motherfucker. But the beauty of this is,
this is going to remind you something,

1391
01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:45,460
Joe, just keep watching watching. Oh Shit.

1392
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,790
Isn't it dishonorable to grab some of
these chest hair and Rick and off them

1393
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:52,470
though when you were in the Colosseum,
whatever happens happens in this family.

1394
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:55,000
You're trying to, as long as you
don't lie, but watch all these,

1395
01:19:55,001 --> 01:19:58,870
watch all this is still slow mall. Nobody
knows nothing. Why? Hold on. Hold up.

1396
01:19:58,871 --> 01:20:01,330
How fake is this role of calcium?
They're finding and look,

1397
01:20:01,331 --> 01:20:03,010
I'll thinking that brick
wall was behind them.

1398
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,820
They keep showing like a picture of
the Coliseum and then a brick wall.

1399
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,870
This is crazy shit.
Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee,

1400
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,080
they slow everything down.

1401
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,520
This is hilarious.

1402
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:31,420
The sound that it makes every time
they throw kicks this hilarious too.

1403
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:37,603
Yeah,

1404
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,920
it's 40 years ago. Look at the camera
work. The guys trying Matt. He's like,

1405
01:20:44,921 --> 01:20:46,750
kick the fucking camera.
He's trying.

1406
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:50,440
He wanted us out poster of the
Roman Colosseum mine poster.

1407
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:54,580
They probably shut this in.
Laurel Canyon. Laurel Canyon.

1408
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:55,820
Yeah.

1409
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,690
Chuck Norris is wash his feet. He
kicks him in the face. Oh Chuck.

1410
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:05,760
Oh, hands down. Damn. Damn. What? Wow.

1411
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:10,510
To Chuck. Just shook it off.
Beautiful Hair back then.

1412
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,873
Okay.
Hi.

1413
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,680
Oh,
the oblique kick.

1414
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:20,681
Look at John Jones style son Bruce Lee
was the first oh front leg round cake to

1415
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:25,550
the face. Chuck Norris
goes down, don't it?

1416
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,180
Nobody's ever seen anything like this
before. Back then, this didn't exist.

1417
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,280
Never saw a fight and moved to 11 and
Tonya head almost blew up. You left.

1418
01:21:34,281 --> 01:21:38,630
They're looking for some, you'll say
something to you, Oh fuck them up.

1419
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,490
Including your dad. You didn't give
a fuck when you left these movies.

1420
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:44,363
Joe Rogan,

1421
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:49,500
you know whether or not Bruce Lee ever
competed. You know, I mean, that was like,

1422
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:52,950
the big thing about him is that he never
fought like Chuck Norris was like world

1423
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,050
middleweight kickboxing champion.
At one point in time.

1424
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,380
Bruce Lee definitely did
a lot of spark for sure.

1425
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:02,080
There's no way it give you this good.
The way his timing in his movement,

1426
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,660
his understanding of what would and
wouldn't work like these in a lot of ways,

1427
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,460
even though some of it is ridiculous,

1428
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:12,630
some of his movements are more realistic
than shit you see in the movies today.

1429
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,940
The way he checks with
that old bleak kick.

1430
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,820
The weight counters when you're moving in,
it's very realistic.

1431
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,920
Like these scenes like
the way he's fucking,

1432
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:23,670
this dude up is a lot like the way someone
who's at a really high levels fucking

1433
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:26,340
somebody up in the UFC.
It's really a kind of ironic,

1434
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:30,950
like the way he's the shit that
he's doing. What he does. No Bow.

1435
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:36,090
That's a move and a half. I told you
in the 70s everybody swept Joe Rogan.

1436
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,380
Everybody. You had a watch that
front leg you will get the sweat.

1437
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,280
Once you got into range and you can two
punches laid out that you will get swept

1438
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:45,850
dog.
Everybody sweat.

1439
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:52,200
The sweep has disappeared from our
society. He broke his thought. Oh,

1440
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:54,060
he broke his leg.
There you go.

1441
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:59,460
What the fuck you think it dealing
with farmers leg zoos arm is it?

1442
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,940
That's how my hand when I was out
of the eight balls, that's how

1443
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:09,100
he did. He broke his arm and his legs.
Legs fucked up. He fucked them up.

1444
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:14,800
He's trying to listen. Watch. This is
a tremendous movie. This is tremendous.

1445
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:18,610
Guys. Next time you see Chuck Norris
dump looking dumb with the wig.

1446
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,050
Think about this. Think
about this move. Look dog.

1447
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:26,410
He gets up even though if it's a
movie. Bruce was very smart. He goes,

1448
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:29,410
let this fucking guy out.
It's a great scene though.

1449
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:35,140
It can't stand,
but he gets up.

1450
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:39,400
This was a good fucking scene. He
gets up. This is tremendous guys

1451
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,730
at him. Look at him. He's trying
to throw kicks. Can't get up.

1452
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,520
I forget how it ends. Does it? He
kill him. Just boil alert. Beautiful.

1453
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:58,120
It's a beautiful ending. Even got up
correctly with the fucking damaged leg.

1454
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:02,293
The cat.

1455
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,080
Oh yeah. Mother fuckers. This
is cinematography one on one.

1456
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,030
It you gotta make good team.
Oh my God.

1457
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,070
He killed him.
The gets him first time ever.

1458
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,400
He's upset that he had to kill him.

1459
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,260
Dove might've been the first
guillotine ever in a movie, I believe.

1460
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,630
Backing up a second,
I believe that was an arm in good team,

1461
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:31,980
which is particularly difficult
to pull up. I don't think, uh,

1462
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:35,800
I don't agree with his technique here.
Let me say back it up. Just so hair.

1463
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,250
Is that a arm in?

1464
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,020
Let's see here.

1465
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,300
Can't see his other arm.

1466
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:46,020
I feel like that's a arm and
gaiety in which I call bullshit.

1467
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:52,860
No, it's not our men isn't it? Looks like
it is. It's hard to finish that one, man.

1468
01:24:52,861 --> 01:24:54,090
You've got to get up high on the neck

1469
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,760
or you got to have an unbelievable
squeeze. Let's see. What do you get? Nope.

1470
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:01,740
I don't know.
Tough to tell where his arm was.

1471
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,220
It was if Chuck Norris had the under
Hook there. It's very hard to, well,

1472
01:25:05,221 --> 01:25:08,040
why don't turn it off. Watch
what he does. This is, this is,

1473
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,080
this is tremendous guys,

1474
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,880
which he was a fucking soldier
and he wrote all these, you know,

1475
01:25:14,881 --> 01:25:17,790
he wrote all of these
though. Look, watch, watch.

1476
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:24,220
Oh, the music plays. Dusts off
his Kung Fu Dragon. By the way,

1477
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:25,900
how many black guys dressed like that?

1478
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,600
I turned 1970s and
eighties has a full outfit.

1479
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,330
My mom was gonna send me back the Cuba.

1480
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,580
They sent me to the Santa Maria praise
and didn't know what was wrong with me.

1481
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,740
Here we go guys. No, no, no, no, no.

1482
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,520
What happened there?

1483
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:43,180
Just a youtube comment at the home and
he goes and gets his g and puts it on the

1484
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:48,181
back of my car like is he back on top
of that his belt and makes it look nice

1485
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:52,810
for him. Very nice group.
That's the guys. Come on.

1486
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:55,600
Do you think that this is garbage?
This is not good. This is not good.

1487
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:58,140
This is garbage, don't you?
How dare you? You know what?

1488
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:02,750
Pull up the trailer to hard times.
Pull up the trailer.

1489
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,270
Heart

1490
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:08,090
team 73 watching trail was. Then we'll
go to the mechanic. Watch the trailer.

1491
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:13,310
You got to see the trailers to the good,
the bad, the ugly, all those movies.

1492
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:17,000
It was a different type of editing.
It was a different type of cut.

1493
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:17,834
Very impressive.

1494
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:28,790
Fuck man. It was a different world
back then, man. A different world,

1495
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,880
a lot more believable back
then. Charles Bronson. James,

1496
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:33,430
why does it say Charles prostanoids chair

1497
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:42,030
pick up
the money's made on?

1498
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,290
What does it feel like
to knock somebody down?

1499
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,390
It makes me feel a hell of a
lot better than it does him.

1500
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,970
1933 America had hit the skids.
People were out of work.

1501
01:26:54,971 --> 01:26:57,860
Wow, I'm out of luck. Third refill cost.

1502
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,790
Life was as tough as a cheap steak

1503
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:06,820
was hard at the time.
I got a husband in jail.

1504
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,730
No job and no prospects.

1505
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:16,210
A man had to live by his wits.
Know he was when they made this movie,

1506
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:20,260
good would have gets long odds. What
kind of ads you talking to? Five to one

1507
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:26,290
d deal by his fists.
Columbia.

1508
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:30,820
There's an old dude, great shape.
That was dude that he fights.

1509
01:27:30,821 --> 01:27:35,440
It was a gas station attendant. I get
enough across from paramount. He got that.

1510
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:39,730
He got that in the longest yard.
Really soft

1511
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:47,530
and hit hard.
James Coburn as speed born con man,

1512
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,680
50 50 and I'll scratch best and expenses.
Oh side bets.

1513
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:55,740
I keep 75% who could make a fortune and
a day I propose a toast to the best man.

1514
01:27:57,401 --> 01:28:01,780
I know. Meat and flat broke.

1515
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:06,310
I need some money fast.
You don't want no trouble.

1516
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,260
Just you pay your debts.

1517
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,160
Spi was the hustler broke
his car or the sledgehammer.

1518
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:17,050
When you change about
that shame was the her.

1519
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,510
You ever get scared when you do live

1520
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:25,210
together?
They just couldn't be beat.

1521
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,510
You give us their money.
Now that money take,

1522
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,160
you want to see another Charles Bronson,

1523
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:49,780
James Colver, Jill ironman and
Strother Martin. There are knockout

1524
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:53,800
in hard times.

1525
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:57,940
God Damn we punch has the
exact same sound effect.

1526
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,043
Every punches.

1527
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:07,430
It's such a weird artificial sound
like why didn't they like have someone

1528
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,560
actually punt then and like
get the sound from that.

1529
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,370
Then somebody wants make that sound
and then everyone just accepted that so

1530
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,100
because why wouldn't you just sit there
and just go like that instead? Well,

1531
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,790
you know they have those Foley artists,

1532
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:24,870
those guys that make sound for movies
and they just decided on a sound.

1533
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:28,260
It's like would clap and together
or something like that. No,

1534
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:31,350
you want to see a real trailer.
Let me show you a real train trailer.

1535
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,360
This is what took trailers
to the next level.

1536
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,840
Scheft please see all Hunky Dory music
shaft took it to the next level of shaft.

1537
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:42,310
Woke you up in the movie
theater with that Funky Guitar.

1538
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,670
I remember this one would
be, yes, this, there was a,

1539
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:49,470
they did a documentary on John Fitch
and it was a really good documentary.

1540
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:52,290
Hold on, sorry. And but
one part of it was like,

1541
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,650
it was all about the gritty
real life of a contender.

1542
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,840
A guy like fighting GSP for the title.

1543
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,210
But when they showed some
of the fight footage,

1544
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:04,730
they had sound effects over
the punches. It was like, Shh,
shh. And I was like, Whoa,

1545
01:30:04,731 --> 01:30:06,330
Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1546
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,940
Like you guys have like
the realest Shit on earth.

1547
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:14,040
You're showing guys fighting in a cage
and you're having sound effects over over

1548
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:17,730
punches. I don't know if they kept
it in. I didn't get it. See it again.

1549
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,340
I only saw like it was,
I think it's called such great heights.

1550
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:24,960
It's a documentary. They made a
way back. Um, what year was that?

1551
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:27,950
I was right up to the
fight. The GSP. Yeah,

1552
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:31,050
they shot the documentary
with him beating GSP.

1553
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,440
They thought he was going to be cheap.
My page GSP. So that was, it was good.

1554
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:37,320
I watched your documentary but I
mean I don't think they've shot it.

1555
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:38,970
Thinking he was going to beat him.
Did they deserve,

1556
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:40,830
they shot it hoping he
was going to beat him,

1557
01:30:40,831 --> 01:30:44,700
but knowing that this is a really
tough fight and, but I just was like,

1558
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:46,050
why are they have sound effects?

1559
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,050
I hope they pulled it out because other
than that it was a great documentary.

1560
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,500
It's um,
it's just weird when you get,

1561
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:56,700
like you start mixing things like you're,
you're adding sound effects.

1562
01:30:57,180 --> 01:31:00,810
Talking an actual fight. Like imagine
if like UFC started doing that.

1563
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,630
Like every time somebody hits
somebody they added a sound effect.

1564
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:08,130
Like you wouldn't know what, what's real,
what's not. The lines get super blurry.

1565
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:12,000
They have a guy like in the truck that's
like got a button they press is every

1566
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:16,080
time you fuck somebody he's had
three different sounds. Boom.

1567
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,120
Pish posh.

1568
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,480
It's possible one day
someone's going to do it.

1569
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:23,910
So I'm going to doll
up some fake ass shit.

1570
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,040
I don't like it when they do it with
stand up. Oh that's bad. Don't know it.

1571
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:31,290
They do it with TV shows.
I don't like what they do with it.

1572
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,660
Just something it lets me,

1573
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:38,070
makes you out of it just makes me
not want to watch it no more. Yeah,

1574
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:41,940
laugh tracks and sitcoms are
very confusing, very confusing.

1575
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:43,650
They use these laptops,

1576
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,160
laugh tracks on sitcoms sometimes when
the sitcoms aren't even shot in front of

1577
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:50,550
an audience or they did at one point
in time that it wasn't just the,

1578
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:53,550
they added last juice up a joke,
which they definitely do,

1579
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,560
but it was also that
they did it like they,

1580
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,040
they weren't even in front
of an audience at the time.

1581
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:02,380
Then they added like some fake laughs
where they thought it should be funny,

1582
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:06,690
which is so weird because you're watching
it at home and you're supposed to Lego,

1583
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,470
you're supposed to like go along with it,
but it's so inorganic.

1584
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,680
It's almost like a light goes off.
It tells you time to laugh now.

1585
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:17,110
Time to laugh now and I
kind of has the same effect.

1586
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,500
It's so weird watching Lucky Louie,

1587
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:23,490
which was Louis C k his first show because
it was in front of a laugh track or a

1588
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:24,031
studio,

1589
01:32:24,031 --> 01:32:26,430
I think it was a studio audience and it
was just so weird because he would like

1590
01:32:26,431 --> 01:32:30,660
get something out of the
fridge or be like, oh no, Hey
Jim Norton and to be there,

1591
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,850
it's so awkward. Well, yeah, that
didn't work out that show. But uh,

1592
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,910
he figured it out. You figured out
how to do it, just do it all yourself,

1593
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:41,010
which is really crazy
that someone does that.

1594
01:32:41,011 --> 01:32:44,150
And he does the whole thing
himself. Pretty amazing. You know,

1595
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:48,620
a lot of the writing produces it himself,
edits it.

1596
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,590
He used to edit it on a little laptop. I
mean, I don't know how he's doing it now,

1597
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,030
but back in the day he's talking about,

1598
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:55,460
I use editing is showing
a 12 inch Mac book.

1599
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:59,070
He's still always do
his own for his website.

1600
01:32:59,071 --> 01:33:01,560
He should always do his
own stuff like videos.

1601
01:33:01,561 --> 01:33:04,970
And he had like podcasts a long
time ago that he used to do himself.

1602
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:10,260
It was like little youtube. Yeah, youtube
videos. And then the podcast, well,

1603
01:33:10,261 --> 01:33:12,690
he had a video podcast.
So if you,

1604
01:33:12,691 --> 01:33:16,710
if you go on iTunes right now and look
up Louis C K podcast is actually still up

1605
01:33:16,711 --> 01:33:19,910
there. It's really weird. How
many times did he do it? Not many.

1606
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:24,240
Like six or seven times, but
I remember back in the day
before, uh, that Dane Cook,

1607
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:27,450
Louis C K audio thing. I would always
try to help them out. Like, like, Hey,

1608
01:33:27,451 --> 01:33:29,760
would you like any help doing videos?
And he's like, I got it. I know how to,

1609
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,910
I know how to edit video. And then I'm
like, oh damn. That's pretty sweet. Yeah,

1610
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,550
he always edited and he was,
well he was a director too.

1611
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:40,230
You can directed Pootie Tang back in
the DNA. That's right. Yeah, he's a,

1612
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:42,720
he's done a bunch of different
things. Fine. He's a creative dude.

1613
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:47,310
He's got all those guys weird. He's
weird, you know, take on things.

1614
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,780
It's a very uniquely him.
And you see that on the show too,

1615
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:54,460
that show Louie doesn't remind you of
any other show. It's weird, you know,

1616
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:54,810
it's like

1617
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:57,890
very uniquely him.
You know his idea of what's funny,

1618
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,820
watch what the show is successful
because he does it from a to z.

1619
01:34:01,821 --> 01:34:05,770
Well this shame he has to do
everything for a year but you ADC.

1620
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,220
But that's how it becomes good.

1621
01:34:07,221 --> 01:34:10,480
I think that's the only way to
make anything and not like you.

1622
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:13,370
You're going to have a different idea
of how to do something then Brian is,

1623
01:34:13,371 --> 01:34:16,580
and Brian's going to have a different
idea than Sam Tripoli and it's just down

1624
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:18,020
the road. It's the, no matter what,

1625
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:21,020
it's real hard to get everybody to
agree on shit and it's real hard to,

1626
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:26,530
one of the things that make someone look
really funny is their own unique like

1627
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:31,250
sense of humor and when you add in a
bunch of other people's sense of humor,

1628
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,600
sometimes that original,

1629
01:34:32,601 --> 01:34:35,030
whatever would be funny about the
original thing just doesn't come out.

1630
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:38,030
It's not the same anymore because there's
so many different like things that

1631
01:34:38,031 --> 01:34:40,700
you've added to it.
It's kind of like changing water down.

1632
01:34:40,701 --> 01:34:44,380
It doesn't feel like Joey Diaz his words.
Like if I saw Sitcom,

1633
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,950
somebody put a sitcom around you but you
had a bunch of other guys writing for

1634
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:51,830
you, man, I, I'm pretty
sure I'd be able to tell.

1635
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,370
I'm pretty sure I'd be able to tell
that it's not the guys riding from me.

1636
01:34:55,371 --> 01:34:58,310
It's what the network does
to it. That too. That's

1637
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:03,310
why Louie controls the thing a to z
because we all know that you do the table

1638
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:06,650
read on Tuesday,
you rehearsed fucking Wednesday,

1639
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:10,850
you rehearse Thursday morning and Thursday
afternoon you do a run through and

1640
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:14,210
the fucking network comes in and the
producers and then that night before you

1641
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:17,240
leave they give you notes and then you
do it again the next day in front of

1642
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:19,490
those fucking people again
you to give you a note.

1643
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,490
Then you're shooting in front of a live
audience or whatever the fuck you do on

1644
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:25,610
Friday night at six o'clock. So
it's, it's really weird. Like,

1645
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:28,970
sometimes you might have a great
line and the audience laughs,

1646
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:32,310
but they'll come back and say,
take that line out because a,

1647
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:35,390
it offends somebody or our next
episode, you know, and you're like,

1648
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:37,550
what the fuck you talking about it?
This is a great line.

1649
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,650
I can't put them with this shit.
But that's uh,

1650
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,190
what Louis success comes in that
he went to the network and said,

1651
01:35:45,191 --> 01:35:48,950
let's not do this and I'll take
this money. But this is my end.

1652
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:54,040
I'm handling this remade the z the
first time since 25 year old we know,

1653
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:55,130
comes in with a suit,

1654
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:57,770
just graduated from Syracuse
to tell me how to do my comedy.

1655
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:01,040
The deal is over because
that's what ruins all of them.

1656
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,640
That's the tough part of the comic.
And you, when you're, uh, doing a,

1657
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,630
a TV show,
it,

1658
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:09,740
you're on the weekends out there talking
about getting stabbed and eating some

1659
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:13,130
of these asshole and now you're doing
a Disney show from Tuesday to fucking

1660
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:17,390
Friday telling me you can't say
how you got to say something else.

1661
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,860
And the show sucks.

1662
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,730
One of the great successes that you have
to take it off for Roseanne Barr was

1663
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,460
that when Roseanne Barr went for it,
she went for it.

1664
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:28,700
When they told her that they wanted
her to not Cosby out of the box,

1665
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,470
she went for it.
But you know what she did?

1666
01:36:30,471 --> 01:36:34,160
She went back to the comedy store and
she hide all those guys that she thought

1667
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:37,400
the Quirky. Even if she could get
one line per show out of them,

1668
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,960
they would work the $5,000 and guess what?
Sometimes you know those riders,

1669
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:44,330
they give you a networks now 10 times.

1670
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:49,690
They don't learn how to write a fucking
Columbia or I'm gonna fucking Philly or

1671
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,740
University of Houston, wherever they
went to fucking do you know what?

1672
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,840
We were heading on a drop of a dime,
bro.

1673
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,940
I like when you get a couple of comics
with a couple people that know how to

1674
01:36:58,941 --> 01:37:02,390
write and put that together,
but I don't want four guys.

1675
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:06,950
They just specifically writers for a
comic like myself, don't work for comic,

1676
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:11,330
like uh, the bacon guy or somebody
who's clean or something like that.

1677
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,160
But for guys like Jim Jeffrey,

1678
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:16,370
you're not going to get network fucking
writers to write with his fucking

1679
01:37:16,371 --> 01:37:17,630
craziness and his mind.

1680
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:21,860
You got to get two guys with a similar
thing and mix them with two guys that

1681
01:37:21,861 --> 01:37:25,430
know formats and maybe and yeah,
that's how I don't think,

1682
01:37:25,431 --> 01:37:27,780
I think he's got to write his own
stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. And then,

1683
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,070
and then you come in
there. No, no, listen.

1684
01:37:30,071 --> 01:37:33,590
And they'd give you a line and how many
times have they given you a fucking line

1685
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:36,170
and why you're looking at
it after you rehearse it.

1686
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,780
I go with what my gut tells me.
Well,

1687
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,660
if you say aligned to me and
rehearsal and I spit it back at you,

1688
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:44,210
I say the first thing I say
is what my gut tells me.

1689
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,970
Then they'll come over and send
the bitch with the glasses and say,

1690
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,870
the line is that you're going to kill
the cat yellow, right. Watch this, Bam.

1691
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:52,820
And it works again.
What's the line here?

1692
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:56,220
The line is the one I just said to
kill a cat and getting no fucking funny

1693
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:59,580
response. But the network will want you
to say killed the cat. I'm just saying.

1694
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,040
Right, because of the writers will tell
you the writers to tell you I've, yeah,

1695
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,730
I've seen that many, many. So
if the comic says fuck you,

1696
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:10,170
I'm going to do this line. You mix that
with the two guys you got and that,

1697
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,810
because the comedians are coming
from a different school of thought,

1698
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:15,120
the guys that are writers,
they don't have a structure.

1699
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,720
I'm talking about structure and what's
going work and you're gonna get four

1700
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,830
comedians together.
Yes.

1701
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:22,440
So we'll have an explosion and we'll
have helicopters and the chick flies out

1702
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,230
that cost $1 million. Oh,
they didn't know that.

1703
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,020
Now they've got to
rewrite it all over again.

1704
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,180
You get two guys that know what the fuck
they're right and the structure Shit,

1705
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:34,500
you get too crazy fucking comedians to
write for you and then you add to the

1706
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:37,470
fucking mix. But guess what?
Your Rogan, that's a lot of work.

1707
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,710
And even then it's hard to do. That's
a lot of work. It's hard to do.

1708
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,940
It's hard to pull off.
You're not going to write.

1709
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,450
It's not that many of you that you're
not going to write and do everything.

1710
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:46,620
What you gotta do is get,
listen,

1711
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,630
10 years ago I would watch Chris
Rock and I always admired that.

1712
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,800
And then I found out the
real story when Chris Rock,

1713
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,440
Chris rock would use his specials.

1714
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,120
He would hire neck Louie and
Richard and Richard, Jenny,

1715
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,480
he had that much faith on.
They all came up together.

1716
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:06,180
And if you watch two of
his specials in those days,

1717
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:09,460
you see all three of them in this special,
you could see what his son,

1718
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:12,690
Nick Dipaolo joke in there.
You know, and I'm not saying,

1719
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:15,030
I'm going to tell the joke
that Joe Rogan gave me.

1720
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,890
I'm going to add my flavor to it.
You know, you're never going to,

1721
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:20,230
you're never going to have somebody
come up there and go, Joe, dude,

1722
01:39:20,231 --> 01:39:22,800
this line on stage state,
you never that type of guy,

1723
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,290
but somebody might give you a
good idea premises probably.

1724
01:39:26,291 --> 01:39:28,890
It'll give you some good prompts.
And if you watch, uh, you know,

1725
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:33,180
even just the fat hanging over the heel,
that's a nick depalo type of thing.

1726
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:35,970
And then when he says that
joke, you know, you saw it,

1727
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:41,040
you saw the development of the special,
you saw that maybe it's an hour special.

1728
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:44,670
He put 30 minutes in,
nick put 10, Richard,

1729
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:49,050
Jenny put three and Louie put 20.
He had enough trust in those guys.

1730
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,700
That's when the specialist good.

1731
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:54,030
When you have guys who really know you
guys that could go to, you know what?

1732
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,120
You might have somebody like that, right?
Something and they go, you know what?

1733
01:39:57,121 --> 01:40:00,510
I wrote something. It's a little too wild
for me, Joey. Maybe it'll work for you.

1734
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:02,880
And you hear it out and you're like,
maybe it was,

1735
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:05,550
I'm not going to use it
because somebody else wrote it.

1736
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:09,720
But you understand me sometimes once you
have that type of trust and that level

1737
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,900
and you could see, you could see
it in Christmas specials. It's,

1738
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,930
it's a comedy collaboration and it works.

1739
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:19,770
But somebody in there has to be
structured. I'm funny. Joe Rogan,

1740
01:40:19,771 --> 01:40:22,620
I don't know how to say shut off the kick,
but I'm not structured.

1741
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,260
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not structured well,

1742
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:28,290
that's because the beauty of what
you do is not as structured thing.

1743
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,590
You know when you're, when you're on
stage, it's just wild loose thing.

1744
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,320
That's part of the fun of it.
That's the vibe.

1745
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:37,170
That's part of the fun
of like how you perform.

1746
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,480
So like when you try to
turn that into a sitcom,

1747
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,030
it's like you're capturing
lightening in a bottle.

1748
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:46,140
Lightning only exists for a brief
moment of time flashing through the sky.

1749
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:49,530
You know, they got, they were about to
make uncle buck again. It was a black guy,

1750
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:54,010
black guy, Mike Abbott, who I liked,
who I is doing a lot of shit he's doing

1751
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,280
prior to, he's doing prior to the
prom with uncle buck is anybody they,

1752
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:01,060
uncle buck, when they write it,
they write it as a crazy guy.

1753
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:06,940
That guy has to be naturally crazy to
sell this. You know, anytime they'll,

1754
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,930
they'll sell it now though.

1755
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:12,430
Saw the guy who smokes a cigarette
and goes to the gym. Oh, he's edgy,

1756
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,773
you know,
goes to,

1757
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:17,740
he's playing like volleyball with
a beer in his hand or you know,

1758
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:21,880
something stupid where that's what
they're selling instead of the attitude.

1759
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:25,270
That's what, that's what you
want to see is the attitude.

1760
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,100
It's not what the riders,
you know,

1761
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:29,450
his words just don't want to
see another uncle buck. Yeah.

1762
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:32,530
I don't want to see a guy who takes
the kids to the track that's been done.

1763
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,730
That's been done. Leave it alone, you
know. But that's where it's at. But again,

1764
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,480
the remake, all that shit, but they
don't put on wide world of sports,

1765
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,640
which is a real education. You
understand me? And now we got,

1766
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,170
we got real sports on HBO who
they tackle those subjects.

1767
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:49,960
They go to India and watch the young
kids with the Campbells and the whole

1768
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:52,910
fucking deal. So, and yeah, it was last
time it was talking about the, the,

1769
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,160
the people in Nepal, the Sherpas, the US
people up to the top of Mount Everest.

1770
01:41:57,161 --> 01:42:01,330
Holy Shit. They make like
$5,000 a year. Like 24 of them,

1771
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:04,270
25 of them have died over the
last couple of years. Scary.

1772
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:07,780
Scary Shit is only a hundred of them and
these people are carrying all this shit

1773
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:10,660
up to the top of Mount
Everest, day in, day out.

1774
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:14,770
You know they spend long fucking hours
sleeping on the side of a glacier.

1775
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,410
It's scary shit.
Wild Shell man.

1776
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:20,300
He did a really good job of
capturing all wide world sports.

1777
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:24,070
I mean I'm real sports with Bryant Gumbel.
Well you St Brian,

1778
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:29,060
have you seen the new
Nirvana? A documentary that
was just announced? It's a,

1779
01:42:29,061 --> 01:42:33,630
it's actually court. Courtney has
lent all her personal movies for one.

1780
01:42:33,631 --> 01:42:38,260
So like her home movies and stuff and
there's also a 13 minute song that Kurt

1781
01:42:38,261 --> 01:42:42,590
never released and stuff and it's,
it's heartbreaking if you watch it.

1782
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:45,890
It's really well done and it's
coming out next month or so.

1783
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:47,860
But it's a check it out.
There's a lot it,

1784
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:51,710
they mix the animation and a lot of
different medias with it and it's pretty

1785
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:52,544
depressing movie.

1786
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:56,030
It's hard to believe that guy killed
himself even after it happened and killed

1787
01:42:56,031 --> 01:43:00,730
them, killed them. She tried that killed
him. She poisoned them. I don't know.

1788
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:03,650
She put the gun. Those are this
whole conspiracy theory up there.

1789
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,730
Do you believe you gotta Sneeze? I
don't blog. I used to believe it,

1790
01:43:07,731 --> 01:43:10,290
but the more I watch
and learn about current,

1791
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:13,970
it seems like he was just a tortured
soul and yeah, it seems like he was,

1792
01:43:13,971 --> 01:43:18,410
I mean heroin especially like severe
heroin addictions. Very depressing.

1793
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:19,453
Very depressing.

1794
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,300
You know what's beautiful though?

1795
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,650
What the sky,

1796
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:29,940
how America gets always whenever they
find the recordings and the safe.

1797
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:33,730
I gotta take a leak or who recorded it
sounds last 13 minutes from him. Listen,

1798
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:36,090
if it's any good, he would have
fucking released it. All right. Yeah.

1799
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,120
America loves buying shit that
somebody founded a fucking safe.

1800
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:43,530
It's fucking amazing. Oh, America
loves it. Oh these are the rereleased,

1801
01:43:43,531 --> 01:43:47,780
the unreleased Tupac, the Ga. That shit.
That album was fucking terrible. Yeah.

1802
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:50,760
He's two pocket. If he wanted it release,
he would have fucking released it.

1803
01:43:50,761 --> 01:43:52,040
All right.
The reason why it's

1804
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,580
unreleased cause he listened to
it and said this fucking blows.

1805
01:43:56,270 --> 01:44:00,500
I think this movie definitely he is
going to make a huge new surge of Nirvana

1806
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:04,640
fans that it may be,
haven't really fallen into that whole yet.

1807
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,130
You know,
there's a lot of young kids.

1808
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:12,131
I didn't even know what Nirvana is
still me doing not doing nothing.

1809
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,840
Fuck is wrong with you. Well how does
that you, you uh, you, the podcasts,

1810
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:19,640
you do a church of what's happening now.

1811
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:23,450
You guys now have ahd HD cameras and
you're doing it. I do. You do it.

1812
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:25,850
How many times a week do
you do it now? Twice. Twice.

1813
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,310
And have you switched it
from the six in the morning?

1814
01:44:28,311 --> 01:44:32,900
Shit that used to do now it's
normal times. Yeah. What time is it?

1815
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:33,880
Certain days

1816
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,970
different tomorrow. Two o'clock with
Steven about where every day is different.

1817
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,570
We used to do it Mondays on Wednesdays,
but I had some shit going on today.

1818
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:43,390
I could only do this with Joe.
So you have to be flexible.

1819
01:44:43,391 --> 01:44:47,940
I'm home the next four weeks so I can do
it whatever fucking bad one thing. Yeah.

1820
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:53,200
Great. I usually always do one Monday.
Monday, you got to have one of the week,

1821
01:44:53,201 --> 01:44:55,330
Wednesday or Thursday,
he'd do what the fuck you want.

1822
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:58,950
Did you see ra or boy,
Ari Shaffir this Friday he not only had,

1823
01:44:58,951 --> 01:45:03,930
is a special that they have
is also followed by his new
TV show. Uh, uh, you know,

1824
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:07,770
at the storytelling show. Come
on. Yeah, it's great. Come on.

1825
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:11,730
And this was like the couple of days
after that Howard stern was just like,

1826
01:45:11,731 --> 01:45:13,590
who is this Ra guy?
Meanwhile,

1827
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:18,120
he has like two shows on a Friday night
at midnight on comedy central and it's

1828
01:45:18,121 --> 01:45:21,410
billboards everywhere of him in the
fucking middle of it. All right.

1829
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,330
Well he's got one billboard on sunset,

1830
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:27,350
but it's beautiful having it right
in front of his house. You know,

1831
01:45:27,351 --> 01:45:31,100
Howard does that. He pretends he doesn't
know what you're doing, you know,

1832
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:34,820
and PR pretends he doesn't know like
that the kid is a successful comic.

1833
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:37,190
You just, he mocks people,
you know, it was, I mean,

1834
01:45:37,191 --> 01:45:39,230
someone's talking shit about him.
He's going to mock them.

1835
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:42,380
It not going to bother Google
searching him. Why would he do that?

1836
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,760
Whatever he says like in his, in
his reach, you know, it's Gospel.

1837
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:49,940
So Ari becomes a loser. It's
the whole thing. Kind of funny.

1838
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:52,980
I can't believe that he talked
about him for 25 minutes. I'm just,

1839
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:54,200
I understand that.

1840
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,290
And he backtracked so many times.
Did he listened to it?

1841
01:45:56,291 --> 01:45:57,340
Cause he said that he never,

1842
01:45:57,341 --> 01:46:02,140
I mean he literally said podcasts are
for losers and he kind of backtrack that

1843
01:46:02,141 --> 01:46:07,141
whole saying and he's just not paying
attention to what everyone else is talking

1844
01:46:07,811 --> 01:46:10,720
about. He's just kind of like, no, no,
no, no, no. If you want to be in radio,

1845
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,760
and we're like, we're not trying
to be in radio. He's just,

1846
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:16,420
you think he's just protecting
his value before Sirius radio?

1847
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:20,080
I think he's talking shit.
And when he talks shit, people
start talking about him.

1848
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:22,930
I think he's just, he's a smart
guy. He knows what he's doing.

1849
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:28,360
He's like by by saying things
that he like saying that our,

1850
01:46:28,361 --> 01:46:30,700
he's like doing a standup into a podcast,
you know,

1851
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,070
just I guess he's buying well if you
want to be by yourself and no one's

1852
01:46:33,071 --> 01:46:36,190
listening, you know, get a
job and terrestrial radio,

1853
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:39,220
those jobs don't even exist anymore.
I mean try and try and get,

1854
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:41,560
and not only that,
that's not what a podcast is,

1855
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:44,710
what a comic is doing in a podcast and
just having a good time just sitting

1856
01:46:44,711 --> 01:46:47,070
around and talking shit.
You're not trying to like,

1857
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:51,490
like the idea of like the pressure of
being hired like somehow or another.

1858
01:46:51,491 --> 01:46:54,630
That's good. This is what's good.
What's good is the creative process.

1859
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:57,840
Like what comes out of a podcast when
you're putting it together and the

1860
01:46:57,841 --> 01:46:59,160
conversations flowing,

1861
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:01,740
you're trying to figure out what story
to tell and how to say it and it comes

1862
01:47:01,741 --> 01:47:05,940
out and people who are listening, the
entertainment value, that's undeniable.

1863
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,440
That's what,
that's what's important.

1864
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,800
If you want to just talk about how much
money's being made and where it's like

1865
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:14,010
you're missing the entire point,
like the missing the entire point.

1866
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:16,650
If that's what you're talking about with
stand up. If you were saying, you know,

1867
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:19,260
will your stand up, you stand
up, you're not making any money,

1868
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:22,560
you don't even know what you're doing.
You know I've sold out arenas,

1869
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:23,570
but your standup is not.

1870
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:27,270
Imagine a comic saying that to another
comic who was trying to figure out how to

1871
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:28,590
do it. What's, what's,

1872
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:32,910
what's good about standup and what's good
about podcasts is that people enjoy it.

1873
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,670
That's it. That's what's good about
everything. Everything you make,

1874
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:39,210
whether it's a movie or a song, do
people enjoy it? If they enjoy it,

1875
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,520
then you're successful,
then it's successful.

1876
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:45,060
The idea that you can't make any
money on it, it's just not true.

1877
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:47,730
So if he says that,
I feel like he's trolling,

1878
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:49,950
I feel like he's trying to
get people to talk about them.

1879
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,390
If that's what he always did,
man,

1880
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,850
you've got to understand
how clever that dude was.

1881
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:56,250
He would go into markets and you can't,

1882
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:58,500
you don't just compete with
a guy in a market. Okay?

1883
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,710
You go into market and you own him.
You go into market,

1884
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:03,780
you put up fucking posters.

1885
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:08,160
You said you stage a fake funeral for mark
and Brian, you see, give him a funeral,

1886
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:11,670
man. You, you, you mock
people to the end of time.

1887
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:14,400
You spend hours talking shit
about them on the radio.

1888
01:48:14,401 --> 01:48:18,690
It's some gangster shit and that's what
he always did. It's straight gangster.

1889
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,850
He would go in and just jack at town.

1890
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,980
But you've got to understand
what you're dealing with.

1891
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:26,400
Like this guy's not stupid man.
If he's talking shit,

1892
01:48:26,401 --> 01:48:30,930
he wants people to talk shit back.
He knows it does a shitload of podcasts.

1893
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:34,290
And when you start talking shit back then,
you know,

1894
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:37,270
you're comparing your accomplishments
with his accomplishments in his head.

1895
01:48:37,271 --> 01:48:41,100
And in his mind he can't lose.
But he, I think he trolls.

1896
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,660
I used to just too smart.

1897
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:46,560
It's not just that he doesn't believe
that like keeps saying to get a job in

1898
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:49,290
terrestrial radio. He doesn't even
have a job in terrestrial radio.

1899
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,251
You know what I mean?

1900
01:48:50,251 --> 01:48:53,940
He's on serious and you can't just
jump right into serious obviously.

1901
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:58,830
But for comics, like that's
not a smart move. You want
to be nationwide, a podcast.

1902
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:03,210
Like he's got to know that guys use
podcasts to sell tickets and people that

1903
01:49:03,211 --> 01:49:05,430
most people have never heard of,
you know,

1904
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:07,950
outside of the standup
comedy and podcasts world,

1905
01:49:07,951 --> 01:49:10,110
like Thompson Gora is
not a household name,

1906
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:14,340
but that mother fucker is selling
out places all over the country.

1907
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,340
Small theaters. He,
yeah, everywhere he goes,

1908
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:21,660
he's selling out clubs and it's directly
because of his podcast to say that

1909
01:49:21,661 --> 01:49:24,180
that's not a good idea and that he
should be on the radio in Connecticut

1910
01:49:24,181 --> 01:49:27,060
somewhere is that's not
true. So he, I don't believe,

1911
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:29,550
I don't think he believes that.
I think he's just talking shit.

1912
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,000
I think Ari Shaffir ears
podcasts probably has led him to,

1913
01:49:33,001 --> 01:49:37,530
a lot of it is a success and comedy
central and in his TV show and the

1914
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,080
storytelling show and like there's a path,

1915
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:43,500
you know from Ari starting
that podcast too, you know,

1916
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:48,330
and keeping up with standup comedy that,
that he can't deny has helped his career

1917
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:52,880
100%. Everybody that does a podcast
has benefited from their podcast.

1918
01:49:52,881 --> 01:49:54,350
If they do stand up every single bump

1919
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:59,330
person, w w this guy named h diesel,
he does a podcast out of Austin.

1920
01:49:59,331 --> 01:50:02,690
He's the one that first turned me onto
this whole Howard Stern podcast thing. Uh,

1921
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:06,680
he, uh, made a great point
is if you look online,

1922
01:50:06,681 --> 01:50:09,650
if you go to youtube and you
find some low recent channel,

1923
01:50:09,651 --> 01:50:14,210
our recent shows of Howard stern on there
and then you look at recent shows have

1924
01:50:14,211 --> 01:50:17,720
you, it's amazing the
difference of the numbers.

1925
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:21,260
It's like there was one that he brought
up that was like hundreds of thousands

1926
01:50:21,261 --> 01:50:23,440
of somebody just, you
know, you know, put up a,

1927
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,980
an episode or you put up an episode
on Youtube, uh, hundreds of thousand.

1928
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:30,500
Then there was like one in the same
time period of Howard Stern, 2000,

1929
01:50:30,501 --> 01:50:34,340
but this is like the main guy that puts
up Howard stern show every day on the

1930
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:38,360
youtube. So it's just interesting. What
is his numbers? Cause none of us know,

1931
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:40,520
serious probably doesn't even know,
you know.

1932
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,710
Well they know, they know he's huge. Don't
get it twisted. Howard Stern's gigantic.

1933
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:48,370
I don't, I'm not saying it's not gigantic,
but what is his numbers? Well, who cares?

1934
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:51,120
That's your, you're doing this. You're
playing the same game as he's playing now.

1935
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:54,670
You can't win. He's, he's Howard Stern.

1936
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,250
Like you gotta like what does his numbers?
Jesus Christ,

1937
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:59,980
it's probably like 20 million people.
Who the fuck knows what it is?

1938
01:50:59,981 --> 01:51:02,890
I don't know how many people have
Sirius satellite radio. Well,

1939
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:05,500
I guarantee you if people have Sirius
satellite radio and they're listening to

1940
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:08,830
the morning, Howard Stern's, the number
one thing they listen to a guarantee you,

1941
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,090
I guarantee you.
I know.

1942
01:51:10,091 --> 01:51:12,730
It's why a lot of people I know
bought series in the first place.

1943
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:15,610
100% it's not a small number.

1944
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:19,010
I mean the reason why this already
thing got so huge, it really,

1945
01:51:19,011 --> 01:51:21,160
like a lot of people might
not listen on Youtube,

1946
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:23,920
but a lot of people are
definitely listening on satellite.

1947
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,650
100% like on Xm and Sirius,
whatever it is,

1948
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,350
that 100% there's a lot of
people listening to that.

1949
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,300
It's not a flop by any imagination.

1950
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:34,900
So if just because things
don't get traction on Youtube,

1951
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,180
you know people listen
to that show in your car.

1952
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,030
That's what the stern show is always been.
You listen in your car,

1953
01:51:40,031 --> 01:51:40,960
you listen on the way to work.

1954
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:44,380
When you're commuting you listen home
and now because series has two channels,

1955
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:47,470
they have Howard 100 and
Howard 101 you get his show,

1956
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:52,510
they get replaced throughout the day and
then on 101 you get all these old shows

1957
01:51:52,511 --> 01:51:53,021
that he did.

1958
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:56,440
Like you'll hear him interview in Bon Jovi
and the fucking nineties or something.

1959
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:57,890
I mean if you have an iPhone,

1960
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,710
you have every single TV show and
it's free because you have youtube

1961
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,830
[inaudible], Sam, Sirius,
satellite radio and your price.

1962
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,850
That's what we're talking about it.
Yeah.

1963
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:13,060
I'm just saying that how pointless
it is kind of for that kind of thing.

1964
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:16,820
Now that we all have youtube
or cell phones and that
have Bluetooth because like

1965
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:21,440
we can get Howard stern show right now
that he did today on her phone. Right.

1966
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:23,140
But you can't listen to it live.
Like,

1967
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,200
like this morning I was listening to a
s a serious the opn Jimmy show and uh,

1968
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:31,510
they had some guy on from boardwalk
empire. I'm listening to it live.

1969
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,460
I mean he's talking live,
you're hearing it live.

1970
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:36,550
Like when that there's something about
that that's always going to be appealing.

1971
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,620
People love to,

1972
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:40,930
to hear a show that's going on live and
you love the fact you just get in your

1973
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:44,500
car and you press XM and you find out
what the fuck is on it or serious,

1974
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:46,400
you know,
you press and you find out what's on.

1975
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:49,690
Like you don't have to go search into
your podcasts, you can just hit your,

1976
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,520
your favorites. You've got one on one
and you're tuning into the channel.

1977
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:56,140
There's always going to be a benefit in
that. But they're probably go all good.

1978
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:58,640
A wind up doing both.
That's what it's probably going to be.

1979
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,240
It's probably gonna be like some sort of
a serious show but also having to be a

1980
01:53:02,241 --> 01:53:03,074
podcast too.

1981
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,850
And this the the networks like the idea
that you're going to be able to keep

1982
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:11,810
like a lockdown on TVs,
car radios with satellite,

1983
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:13,880
like that's not happening anymore.
They're starting to,

1984
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:17,180
everybody knows that he doesn't like
the idea that Howard stern doesn't know

1985
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:18,014
that is ridiculous.

1986
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:22,160
He knows about stitcher and cars and
need to do is very savvy so he knows that

1987
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:22,791
they're going to have,

1988
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,790
without a doubt they're going to have
Internet access in 90% of the cars and

1989
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:28,220
just a few years.
Everybody that has a new car,

1990
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,920
like you get a Cadillac now
they have this Escalade.

1991
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:34,670
I rented one when I was in Utah. It's
fucking incredible. First of all,

1992
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:38,770
they're amazing. They're so smooth that
it's not a, it's not a gauge anymore,

1993
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:42,230
not a gauge cluster. It's an LCD
screen with an artificial gaze.

1994
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:45,590
Costs are huge fucking map, like
the navigation systems, giant,

1995
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,990
super comfortable ride.
Magnetic suspension.

1996
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:50,210
It's got a built in internet connection.

1997
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,860
It's a fucking driving
Internet connection. So you
have like builtin Internet.

1998
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:58,250
Like you use it as like a wifi
hub and you can have your laptop,

1999
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:59,750
you could download iTunes,

2000
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:03,230
you could fucking stream different
things on the screens. It's crazy.

2001
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:07,220
That's this is you're going to have
podcasts, apps for all those things,

2002
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,830
and you're going to be able
to say, where's the Church
of what's happening now?

2003
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,130
And you're going to pee. You gotta be
able to press a button, you're stealing,

2004
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:17,030
we'll, uh, go to church of
what's happening now. You
know, and then like, you know,

2005
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:21,780
would you like to play an episode?
Yes. Episode four with, uh, you know,

2006
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:25,070
fill in the blank. You know, whoever
the fuck it is, big John McCarthy, Bam.

2007
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,480
And then that shit starts playing.
Welcome to the Church of what's happening.

2008
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:31,640
And at least science starts talking and
then you drive it down the road. That's,

2009
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:35,960
that's in demand. And that's inevitable.
It's, but right now we're not there yet.

2010
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:40,460
And I think guys like Howard stern are
very, very clever. He's smart as shit.

2011
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:43,580
You know, the idea that he doesn't
know that all this stuff is going on.

2012
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,980
That's preposterous.
He's trolling,

2013
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:50,360
he trolled Ari and he got already talked
shit about him and he talks shit about

2014
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:53,510
all right. And now it's his crazy
thing and that's what he does.

2015
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:54,883
That's what I think.

2016
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:59,850
I also think he, you're right,
cause he's such a computer nerd and,

2017
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:04,800
but I also think that maybe with like
all these TV shows and flying from La to,

2018
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:08,070
you know, or whatever he does or whatever
your schedule is, maybe he doesn't,

2019
01:55:08,071 --> 01:55:10,410
maybe he's completely a different person.
He comes home,

2020
01:55:10,411 --> 01:55:12,330
it takes a little nappy
poo and wakes up and

2021
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:15,860
I doubt it. You know what also think
he's also in negotiations with serious,

2022
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:18,560
like there's some sort of contract things.
So what is it going to do?

2023
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:22,400
He belittles the competition, he mocks
them and then it becomes gospel, you know,

2024
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:24,080
to a lot of people,
what he says is Gospel.

2025
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:27,410
We started talking about podcasts being
for losers, you know, and then you know,

2026
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:30,740
people comparing the podcast to his
show. You know, he's got a point,

2027
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,371
he's got a point,

2028
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:34,580
he's got like how many millions of
fucking cars have serious built into them.

2029
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:38,450
You know, my, my car has it built in.
When I bought it, it's in, it was on,

2030
01:55:38,451 --> 01:55:42,920
I started watch right away. I don't even
have to order any special package I get.

2031
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:43,261
Oh,

2032
01:55:43,261 --> 01:55:46,980
how it used to have to pay for like
Howard one o one Howard 100 like a special

2033
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:50,730
package to get opie and Anthony. It was
a special package. Not Anymore. Nope.

2034
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:54,060
It's all the same price. I'll just
give me your car as soon as you get it.

2035
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:57,030
It's on there. I think everyone has it.
I think everyone has it in their cars,

2036
01:55:57,031 --> 01:55:57,360
but like,

2037
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,620
like I haven't been to cars and they
both expired and I think a lot of people

2038
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:04,860
like myself called and go like, how,
how much is it? And they're like, oh,

2039
01:56:04,861 --> 01:56:07,730
it's 150 for a year. And
you're like, no. Why,

2040
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,700
what $150 to take about how much
booze you buy in a week. That's like

2041
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:22,710
a Florentine classic final studio,
54 classic vinyl.

2042
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:29,300
I get Ivana, Soundgarden hair of
the dog. I get all of that. That's,

2043
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:33,840
that's uh, whatever, uh, this
like 10 fucking things on that.

2044
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:38,820
How would one 100 I don't
live without Sirius radio.
Mccall. I like it. I like it.

2045
01:56:38,821 --> 01:56:43,410
I like to hold on. No, I have
a, I have the phone. Brian,

2046
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,990
you've got to use your phone to get that.
I have a,

2047
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:50,040
how many people have Spotify in their
car but very tiny number if any, right?

2048
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,410
I mean think,

2049
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:53,700
I think everybody either has Bluetooth
or the plug into their phone where they,

2050
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,280
where they, they do because every
single person I know does, oh yeah,

2051
01:56:56,281 --> 01:56:59,280
but think about your crowd. Your, you're
hanging out with a bunch of young comics.

2052
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:03,690
You know, a lot of people don't use
Bluetooth yet with their stereo.

2053
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:06,720
They just don't, they don't use
your phone to, and if you do use it,

2054
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:10,260
you got to fuck with your phone while
you're driving and go look through things

2055
01:57:10,261 --> 01:57:13,530
and try to search for something with Xm.
You just pressed a button.

2056
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,650
It's right there.
You're driving serious where I'm driving.

2057
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:20,380
I'm saying like the things you were
saying, like the seventies radio station,

2058
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:23,610
the eighties radio station, they have this
on Pandora, they have this on Spotify.

2059
01:57:23,611 --> 01:57:26,660
It's free, open several steps and
you're not, you're not listening.

2060
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,300
Several stuck in costs,
so you just leave it there.

2061
01:57:29,301 --> 01:57:33,240
You pay the Vig and you move on with
your fucking life and express the bucket,

2062
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:37,290
but it's programming. It's putting
rotations. I got 10 stations in the,

2063
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:41,430
all of them are throwing fucking eat
at every minute of the day. Yeah,

2064
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:44,640
your preset, I don't mean you have to
Spotify. I don't even know all this shit.

2065
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,541
I got it all in.

2066
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:49,830
Then it comes up the fucking car that
took demand saying it's undeniable that

2067
01:57:49,831 --> 01:57:53,820
it's a good value. If you're someone who
sits in traffic and it's entertainment,

2068
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,480
you need entertainment. It's undeniable.
There's hundreds of radio stations.

2069
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:00,690
There's a bunch of different talks.
They should just BBC stations.

2070
01:58:00,691 --> 01:58:04,050
You tuned into an, anytime they're
talking about diamond mining in Africa,

2071
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,850
you flip to the next one.
They're interviewing.

2072
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:10,110
Someone in Bangladesh says dealing with
some isis attack. It's fucking great.

2073
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:14,610
Again, the wise call. Good. Just because
there's Spotify and just because there's,

2074
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:17,610
there's a lot of extra steps
involved in all those things.

2075
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,280
If you're going to want to like set up,
you're going to do Pandora.

2076
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:22,110
You're not going to listen to the BBC.

2077
01:58:22,111 --> 01:58:23,340
You're not going to
listen to Howard Stern.

2078
01:58:23,341 --> 01:58:25,050
He not going to listen to opiod and Jimmy,

2079
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:27,990
if you want to hear those things
and those things are good,

2080
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:31,500
you got to do it with serious. The idea
that 150 bucks a year was a lot of money.

2081
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:35,070
Come on, man, that's 10 bucks a
month. 10 bucks a month. Ain't shit.

2082
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:38,220
10 bucks a month for every
single day you get something.

2083
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:42,220
It seems to me like it's a value.
It's just not, it's not that bad

2084
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,110
a thing.
It's the everything.

2085
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:48,250
Everybody has this idea that because it
has to be one or the other, you know,

2086
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,070
they,
they can all coexist.

2087
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:53,920
It's nothing wrong with having
a satellite radio in your car.

2088
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:56,680
I get my wife's car and she
listens to all that shit.

2089
01:58:56,681 --> 01:59:01,090
The gentiles was listened to the gets
good rush ball and all that. Fuck Shit.

2090
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:03,880
You know my life. This is why
there's, they fucking come.

2091
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:06,370
I get in the car and I got to give
her a look. What is this shit?

2092
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:10,210
She got three stations program to cause.
Tell white people shit.

2093
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:14,230
Their world's gonna savage.
Yeah. Obama's in Japan.

2094
01:59:14,231 --> 01:59:17,430
Mrs. Oh I got in the car this
morning when he alive in Japan.

2095
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:18,820
Mrs. Obama at the fuck.

2096
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:21,460
I used to listen to a couple
of those guys on serious too.

2097
01:59:21,461 --> 01:59:24,460
There's a few of those guys you can get.
Those guys are awesome.

2098
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,530
They just get an air dry.
I can't,

2099
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:30,130
the only guy I like is the guy that
comes on lunch touch Steve Harvey.

2100
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:32,860
That was my dog for you.

2101
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:35,710
I learned about Steve Harvey in the
mountains of Colorado lunchtime.

2102
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,630
Everything ends in Colorado.
Steve Harvey,

2103
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:40,150
the Alps are empty so
you're going to do so,

2104
01:59:40,151 --> 01:59:43,570
but do you listen to a the Steve Harvey
Radio shows? Is that what it is? Whatever.

2105
01:59:43,571 --> 01:59:46,750
Whenever Tara, I don't listen to it
no more. I went like two years now.

2106
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:49,630
I'm stuck on lithium and classic
fucking vile the way up here.

2107
01:59:49,631 --> 01:59:52,820
They had Elton John from funeral,
from a friend that I'm,

2108
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:56,090
you don't listen tonight. Show was
just telling John Anymore. Hold on.

2109
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:58,690
This is what he was with Bernie Taupin.
We don't like Elton John.

2110
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:03,640
I just want to tell him John is a,
he's got this, a dolce and Gabbana boy,

2111
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:07,090
a band called dolce and
Gabbana. He's on a roll. Yeah,

2112
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:11,470
because they said something about gay
people adopting kids or having kids.

2113
02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:14,390
I forget what the fuck and he's gotten.
Listen, let me tell you some dough.

2114
02:00:14,391 --> 02:00:19,030
Cenk a banner done regimen. Elton John
Speaks. People listen. Fuck. D F Hutton.

2115
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:22,570
That's the gay community. That
deep, deep pocket gay community.

2116
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:25,780
Not these little guys jumping up and
down at that place in Santa Monica.

2117
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:29,530
This is the deep beep money gays.
They don't give a fuck.

2118
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:31,960
Why would anybody do that?
Because shit

2119
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:36,010
fuck ain't people have is this.
You don't fuck with Elton John.

2120
02:00:36,011 --> 02:00:39,130
You don't fuck with Barbara Streisand.
There's a couple people.

2121
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:43,310
You just leave the fuck alone. Let's
find out what it is. Don't change a band.

2122
02:00:43,311 --> 02:00:45,760
A band.
What's up B

2123
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,960
music from Spotify. Ringwood. What else?

2124
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:54,310
My point was just fucking go on with the
phone and crash more options for me to

2125
02:00:54,311 --> 02:00:56,980
take this fucking car off a cliff.
That's what you're giving me. No,

2126
02:00:56,981 --> 02:01:00,670
I'm just saying that the future I think
of that is suspect because I think

2127
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:05,671
phones or cars are now having Spotify
automatically in there and Pandora just

2128
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:09,790
like a satellite radio.
And I just think the future of that is,

2129
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:13,780
is you know, and them now, I don't
know, it just doesn't seem very good.

2130
02:01:14,150 --> 02:01:16,900
The future of what Sirius
satellite radio program,

2131
02:01:16,901 --> 02:01:19,030
the idea that it's everything
is programmed for you.

2132
02:01:19,031 --> 02:01:22,630
The difference between that and something
like Spotify or Pandora is you're

2133
02:01:22,631 --> 02:01:26,170
going to go searching for stuff. They
had the same thing. What do you mean?

2134
02:01:26,171 --> 02:01:26,811
They have the same fight?

2135
02:01:26,811 --> 02:01:30,320
If fight has radio stations and
so does Pandora has radio station.

2136
02:01:30,321 --> 02:01:32,110
So if you want a seventies radio station,

2137
02:01:32,111 --> 02:01:35,920
they have that and it's just random
seventies you know, it's been programmed.

2138
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:37,560
So it will be star based then.

2139
02:01:37,561 --> 02:01:40,190
Then the people that'll be subscribing
and of the people that specifically

2140
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:44,030
want to see or listen to Howard
stern or listen to opium Chimi.

2141
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:48,080
So in that case it makes him even more
important because this is a fucking giant,

2142
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:53,030
multibillion dollar company. This is not
a small endeavor. If Howard stern left,

2143
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:56,420
you want to talk about like the power
of podcast. Here's the power of podcast.

2144
02:01:56,630 --> 02:02:00,860
If Howard Stern said fuck you to Sirius
satellite radio at the end and started

2145
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:04,940
his own podcast, do you have any fucking
people would jump ship and leave?

2146
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:08,120
It would be enormous.
It would crash the company.

2147
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:11,210
He probably wouldn't do it because he
owned stock. I mean I think he does.

2148
02:02:11,211 --> 02:02:13,070
At least that's what I've read.

2149
02:02:13,650 --> 02:02:18,410
Wasn't that part of the thing
that he owned stock in the
company if he wanted to?

2150
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:23,300
Yeah. If he bailed and started his
own like podcast show and stead,

2151
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,590
boy they,

2152
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:28,520
I guarantee you they're fucking numbers
would drop off substantially because as

2153
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:29,390
time goes on,

2154
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:32,540
one thing you do have a point when I told
you about that escalate that I rented,

2155
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:34,100
it has internet built into it.

2156
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:38,030
It's not only like a step or two away
from something awesome being developed for

2157
02:02:38,031 --> 02:02:43,031
Cadillacs and the idea also if
you have full time all the time,

2158
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:44,840
Internet connection like that and a car,

2159
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:49,220
all you have to do is like set up apps
like an apple system or you have just

2160
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:52,350
like you have on your phone. I mean that
could easily be the future of a car.

2161
02:02:52,351 --> 02:02:54,470
It could be just like a phone man.

2162
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:58,040
It's to be nuts because you'll be able
to download apps into your fucking car,

2163
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:01,250
but then people are going to hack your
car. That's going to be an issue too.

2164
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,220
People gonna you're going to have a 24
hour internet connection in your cars.

2165
02:03:04,221 --> 02:03:05,780
People are gonna start
hacking people's cars.

2166
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:07,490
They're going to disabled people's breaks.

2167
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:10,830
Some guy's gonna fucking kill his
wife by disabling or breaks. Right.

2168
02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:13,310
They confuse things too.
That shit.

2169
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:16,670
One day you fucking dragging
your windows open up.

2170
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:20,540
It's 20 below and you can't close
them because that's what I don't like.

2171
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:23,880
It's like when you were a kid and you
bought your first stereo and you went to

2172
02:03:23,881 --> 02:03:26,630
that dude on the corner, you go
to that $200, which stereo when I,

2173
02:03:26,631 --> 02:03:30,440
but you want it to Fisher because it
had the eight track tape cassette,

2174
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:33,650
the record play, and the four speakers.
And he professional would say,

2175
02:03:33,651 --> 02:03:36,980
don't do that by components
because of the eight track works.

2176
02:03:36,981 --> 02:03:41,000
Then the whole thing is
damaged. Do you remember when
that, uh, that controversial?

2177
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,690
Oh, you fucking think you deal with, fuck.

2178
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:46,700
So fucking novice used to buy components.

2179
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,780
So I didn't like the radio
when I was growing up. I
never bought a fucking radio.

2180
02:03:50,781 --> 02:03:52,100
I bought an amplify.

2181
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:56,830
I could like I connect to the cassette
to it and I had a record player with, uh,

2182
02:03:57,220 --> 02:04:00,470
two of those fucking killer speakers.
I always seem to get off the trucks,

2183
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,470
whatever the Bose,
this is way before bows.

2184
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:07,470
This is fucking alone or south is there.

2185
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:12,410
And uh, there was a guy who died
report or what the fuck is his name?

2186
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:17,300
He died on sunset. He
crashed his car. And, uh,

2187
02:04:17,301 --> 02:04:19,010
that's one of the things
that they were saying.

2188
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,770
They were saying that they think
that this guy's car had been hacked.

2189
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:25,760
The fuck is his name.
Mine has that shit that freaks me out.

2190
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:29,810
Like it's connected to the Internet.
Michael Hastings. Yes. Michael Hastings.

2191
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:34,490
Thank you. This guy was like super
critical of, um, of the military.

2192
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,590
Super critical of some,

2193
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:41,370
some generals in particular
and the guy died his car,

2194
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:45,630
like he fucking hit the gas and never let
up and drove right into a tree and his

2195
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:49,130
car exploded. Electrocute him
right from the Balkans. Right.

2196
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:52,740
That's when they send the fucking signal
right from norad and they fuck your

2197
02:04:52,741 --> 02:04:57,010
shit right up. Yeah.
Allegations of foul play,

2198
02:04:57,180 --> 02:05:00,330
getting to government,
you know, in the loop.

2199
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:05,460
Everything was we're against
would just give them to them.

2200
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:11,330
So I don't you want the Gulf that we
know the fucking cars with where we're at

2201
02:05:12,611 --> 02:05:15,120
in the cars.
They already know what our phones,

2202
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,150
didn't they say two when he died
they found Methodist system.

2203
02:05:18,151 --> 02:05:19,260
I'm pretty sure that's what happened.

2204
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:22,010
I always find the Methodist system that's
the way to fucking have this gown on

2205
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:25,740
him. And he said that he was in
a very agitated state in quotes,

2206
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:26,850
the sounds like a hit piece,

2207
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:31,530
saying he was incredibly tense and worried
that his materials being surveilled

2208
02:05:31,531 --> 02:05:32,221
by the government.

2209
02:05:32,221 --> 02:05:35,910
Friends believe that Michael's line
of work led to a paranoid state.

2210
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:38,670
USA Today reported that in
the days before his death,

2211
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:42,030
Hastings believes his car was being
tampered with and that he was scared and

2212
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:46,570
wanted to leave town. You know, it's,

2213
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,360
it's one thing to kill yourself,

2214
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:53,780
but a one thing to hit the gas full
clip and drive straight into a tree.

2215
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:58,530
How many guys have done that?
I think if you're on Meth,

2216
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:01,680
that would probably be where like, I'm
doing it. I'm going to die. I'm gonna die.

2217
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,620
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. That's exactly right.
Think about it. When you are in math,

2218
02:06:07,621 --> 02:06:09,000
you do make some shitty choices,

2219
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,430
especially if you're about
to kill yourself on meth.

2220
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:16,560
I just feel like most people would want
it to be like 100% like hitting a tree

2221
02:06:16,561 --> 02:06:19,060
with a car might just fuck you up.
I don't know how,

2222
02:06:19,061 --> 02:06:21,600
how hard you gotta be going
to hit a tree and live.

2223
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,080
So they're saying it's fucking
foul play, correct? No,

2224
02:06:25,081 --> 02:06:26,460
they're saying they don't
think it's about PLO.

2225
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:28,980
People think he was bananas and
he drove into a fucking tree.

2226
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:31,290
I think it's even his own family.
He said that,

2227
02:06:31,291 --> 02:06:33,570
but they might just be
protecting themselves.

2228
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,380
They might just be saying that publicly
because they don't, they're scared.

2229
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:40,800
I mean this guy was fucking with generals.
Generals are professional killers.

2230
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:43,890
I mean that's what they are. That's
what they do. They kill people overseas.

2231
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:47,070
They killed people that are problems and
in a guy who's trying to take down the

2232
02:06:47,071 --> 02:06:47,521
general,

2233
02:06:47,521 --> 02:06:51,900
the general has done really good work
for the United States as far as like

2234
02:06:51,901 --> 02:06:53,340
military work and you know,

2235
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:56,670
been a part of some important missions
and he's got a lot of clout and they

2236
02:06:56,671 --> 02:06:58,260
think that this guy is
trying to take them down.

2237
02:06:58,470 --> 02:07:00,330
Well that guy might as
well just be the enemy.

2238
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:04,410
You're trying to remove one of the most
important components of the military.

2239
02:07:04,411 --> 02:07:06,060
You're trying to remove a general,

2240
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:08,580
a general that's like been
very successful at war.

2241
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:11,490
You could easily see why some people
would step in and say, you know what,

2242
02:07:11,491 --> 02:07:13,590
we're going to take this fucking
reporter out for the country,

2243
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:16,140
and then that's how they would believe
that they were doing the right thing.

2244
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:18,270
That could have happened,
man. I don't know.

2245
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:20,370
I just don't think that it's a matter of,

2246
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:22,950
I don't think it's a
matter of impossibility.

2247
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:28,080
It's not impossible to control a car. In
fact, there's been some CIA guys to say,

2248
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:32,940
you can do it. It can be done like
Google that Jamie, pull up. Ken,

2249
02:07:32,941 --> 02:07:37,120
you like Michael Hastings death.
Can you remote control a car?

2250
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:39,520
Michael Hastings death.
See if there's a,

2251
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:43,000
like there's a consensus on that
because I think you could do it.

2252
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:45,390
It's a computer.
It's a fucking key.

2253
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:49,150
I don't think there's anything that
shows that you could steer the car unless

2254
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:54,490
it's one of those cars that has automatic
steering like Michael Hastings per

2255
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:57,850
Sadie's. He had a
Mercedes, the new Mercedes,

2256
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:00,940
you could drive those motherfuckers
around town like 30 miles an hour.

2257
02:08:00,941 --> 02:08:04,870
They will drive themselves. Okay.
You said it, they have like a,

2258
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,810
a laser that detects cars in front of you.
They slow down.

2259
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:10,900
There's cameras that detect where
the lanes are. They turned for you.

2260
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:13,840
My, my uh, bug my Volkswagen.

2261
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:18,841
I can unlock my cars through an APP or
my car doors through an app loaded this

2262
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:22,980
what has been revealed as a result of
some research at universities that it's

2263
02:08:22,981 --> 02:08:26,880
relatively easy to hack your way into
the control system of a car and do such

2264
02:08:26,881 --> 02:08:31,080
things as cause acceleration when the
driver doesn't want acceleration or to

2265
02:08:31,081 --> 02:08:34,560
throw on the brakes when the driver
doesn't want the brakes on to launch an

2266
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:35,940
airbag.
Wow.

2267
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:40,950
You can do some really highly destructive
things now through hacking a car and

2268
02:08:40,951 --> 02:08:44,700
it's not that hard. Wow. Wow.

2269
02:08:44,701 --> 02:08:46,480
So if there was a cyber attack on a car,

2270
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:48,150
and I'm not saying there was Clark added,

2271
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:51,600
I think whoever did it would probably
get away with it. Oh, good Lord.

2272
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,230
My sink, my Ford Sync, uh,

2273
02:08:54,270 --> 02:08:59,270
since reports to some office once a
month and it tells you my break breaks,

2274
02:09:00,601 --> 02:09:02,070
like how good my brake pads are.

2275
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:05,370
Like everything about my car so it
knows everything about my car and has

2276
02:09:05,371 --> 02:09:07,000
connections to every part of my car.

2277
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:11,460
It's got new machines and was fucking
with signal most of the whole front and

2278
02:09:11,461 --> 02:09:14,640
there was 60 days they send me reports to.
Would that makes sense though?

2279
02:09:14,641 --> 02:09:17,390
Your sleep apnea? I'm seeing he's not
driving around town into a fucking tree.

2280
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:19,750
Fucking controlling his breathing refill.

2281
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:25,010
You could go on a report
if the end of the month,

2282
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:27,170
I don't know about the car thing.
Well,

2283
02:09:27,171 --> 02:09:30,530
they're going to have computers that can
control like the convergently control

2284
02:09:30,531 --> 02:09:30,870
anything,
right?

2285
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:35,520
One of our sponsors is smart apps or
smart things and smart things. A is an a,

2286
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,740
you can,
you can control your alarm system,

2287
02:09:37,741 --> 02:09:41,360
your electricity shut off your
lights off and on. I mean these, the,

2288
02:09:41,361 --> 02:09:42,194
these things are like,

2289
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:45,830
if you could do it,
that means somebody else can't do it.

2290
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:47,890
So don't open the fucking APP.

2291
02:09:47,891 --> 02:09:52,891
Mind your fucking business is fucking
business because that means somebody else

2292
02:09:53,111 --> 02:09:55,910
could too. So one night you're
at home getting your Dick Sucked.

2293
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:00,680
Some 13 year old doesn't want to swat
you. He wants to fucking tango. Light.

2294
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:04,600
Sound like fucking pump the guys thing.
Your House, you know you need that shit.

2295
02:10:04,601 --> 02:10:07,180
Don't fuck with it. Don't
open a door. If you know,

2296
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:11,170
if you answered the email back that says
you have a relative that left your 5

2297
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:15,390
million, guess what you're done. You
can put just delete that motherfucker.

2298
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:16,210
He don't even open it.

2299
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:21,190
Why don't you go back to a flip phone for
what it was cause he avoid all of this.

2300
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:24,360
You and Ari. I don't know. He's
already gone to flip phone.

2301
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:27,600
I'm going to make a confession today
because a lot of people are, no,

2302
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,530
I don't even know what the
fucking happens. I don't
have it on my fucking phone.

2303
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:33,750
You know the single APP on your phone?
I don't know nothing to

2304
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:38,810
check. Twitter and hotmail. That's all
I wanted to chose their apps. That's it.

2305
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,420
That's it.
Those are the two absent everything else.

2306
02:10:41,421 --> 02:10:43,190
Got another blood pressure thing.

2307
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:47,930
Oh you have an from my heart stress
before the put my fingerprints on there.

2308
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:51,620
It is hard stress because
one of my buddies,

2309
02:10:51,621 --> 02:10:53,620
John Cutler up in San Francisco,
send me it.

2310
02:10:53,621 --> 02:10:55,760
Then you connect to your iPhone
and check your blood pressure.

2311
02:10:56,030 --> 02:11:00,290
I take with me on the road to the gym
when I do sit ups before my head blows up.

2312
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:04,380
That's an APP. Yep. Yeah, but I
don't know nothing about iTunes.

2313
02:11:04,381 --> 02:11:08,000
Like I give it to my wife and go here,
put this on there. I don't know nothing.

2314
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:11,630
I don't know people who fucking, I got
myself a easy man. I got my fitness pal.

2315
02:11:11,631 --> 02:11:15,080
Dot. Come on here to count my
protein, carbs and all that shit.

2316
02:11:15,081 --> 02:11:17,540
But I don't do some incredible
shit with these things.

2317
02:11:17,541 --> 02:11:19,560
I don't do it from my phone.
I do it from the house,

2318
02:11:19,561 --> 02:11:20,900
but there's no misunderstandings.

2319
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:23,750
None of the time I don't have my
glasses out of the fucking phone.

2320
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:27,770
If you email me for something, they don't
get back to your text. Me, you fucked.

2321
02:11:27,771 --> 02:11:31,040
I don't have my glasses. Forget it.
The ice side is completely gone now.

2322
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:34,520
I'm almost done here.
I'm almost fucking done here.

2323
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:38,240
I got to go back to the doctor like in
two weeks. How bad is your eyesight? Uh,

2324
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:42,800
the fucking left. I listen if you see
me in my car, just go on the left side.

2325
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:46,130
A chance on the right cause I'm like,
you're fucking with that thing

2326
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:53,840
and far. Is that everything or is it
the questions? I don't see nothing.

2327
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:57,580
That's what the fucking closer, I don't
even see tweets no more. Really? Yeah.

2328
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:01,790
I can't see tweets on my phone unless
there's a lot of light, you know? No,

2329
02:12:01,791 --> 02:12:06,360
those days are done John Real. It's
over. Yeah. My side is really though.

2330
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:09,590
I could see a coke rock under a
fucking carpet looking at me now.

2331
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:13,430
Look at me fucking now.
Nothing. Nothing guys.

2332
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:17,060
It's a real fucking shame,
but that's what happens.

2333
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:19,430
This is supposed to be some
exercises you can do for your eyes.

2334
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:21,260
Steve Maxwell was telling
me about the other day.

2335
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:24,500
It's like it's a book called
throw away your glasses and see,

2336
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:26,330
and I had this woman on him,

2337
02:12:26,331 --> 02:12:28,990
Katy Bowman and she's one of the
things that she was saying is that you,

2338
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:32,030
when you, your eyes, like
when you're looking at things,

2339
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:33,890
everything in the same distance,

2340
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:37,940
like you'll constantly looking at a
screen and it's like having a cast on like

2341
02:12:37,941 --> 02:12:41,120
it, it makes your, your eyes
atrophy. It's not good for it.

2342
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:43,850
Like you're supposed to be looking
at things all different distances,

2343
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:47,360
looking at things for far away,
looking at things from close up and,

2344
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:49,460
and you look at things
all different distances,

2345
02:12:49,461 --> 02:12:53,300
your eyes stay pretty good but when
you're just constantly staring at a screen

2346
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:56,150
on a regular basis, your eyes
start to get this shit. Definitely.

2347
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:57,200
Definitely with me.

2348
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:01,100
I could tell when I started really sitting
in front of a computer, my eyesight,

2349
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:02,670
it just demolished it.

2350
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,340
The 44 88 eight it up like fuck.

2351
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:10,400
Some people are just constantly looking
at their phone. That does it too.

2352
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:15,020
But if you can just incorporate a lot
of distance looking into your life,

2353
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:17,690
like go outside and look at
things far away like your eyes.

2354
02:13:17,691 --> 02:13:19,430
We'll have like a better medium,

2355
02:13:19,431 --> 02:13:23,150
like let them focus on shit that's really
far away and focus on some things that

2356
02:13:23,151 --> 02:13:26,240
are close when you do it. But you got to
balance it out just like anything else,

2357
02:13:26,241 --> 02:13:29,990
I guess. I'm sure I don't use
my iPhone to the abilities.

2358
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:32,130
I understand what Ari went

2359
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,870
back to the flip phone. It's too
much of your time consumed. Yeah,

2360
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:40,260
that's what he felt. But I
feel now that uh, you know,

2361
02:13:40,261 --> 02:13:43,170
if I can get to get an email, I
like to get my email, you know,

2362
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:47,750
that's very important to me. My main
email, like together, discipline texts.

2363
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,890
I'll look at your fucking phone off.
I don't give a fuck.

2364
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:53,600
I'm not going to go on there and read
with capital on Yahoo. That's never been,

2365
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:55,590
I don't give a fuck around the rousy.

2366
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:58,500
I told them to do with me when I
should have got nothing to do with me.

2367
02:13:58,501 --> 02:14:01,530
I read what's important.
You send me an email or call me.

2368
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:04,320
That's all I fucking know. Right? I don't
know nothing. When I'm out of the house,

2369
02:14:04,321 --> 02:14:08,550
you're dead. I don't take pictures.
Nothing. Not Thing I'm done.

2370
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:11,540
I'm out there living on pip paying
attention though that Instagram,

2371
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:14,640
no life is to finance with them.
I have no idea.

2372
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,960
I have no fucking idea.
There's a,

2373
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:21,390
there's a certain aspect to it
that I think is pretty cool.

2374
02:14:21,790 --> 02:14:24,420
The idea that you can get an alert
on your phone and go check about some

2375
02:14:24,421 --> 02:14:25,141
breaking news.

2376
02:14:25,141 --> 02:14:27,660
It's happening right now and you find
out about something you would never have

2377
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:29,130
found out about.
I got friends who are like,

2378
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:32,550
they sit in front of the TV waiting for
something to get the phone. You're like,

2379
02:14:32,551 --> 02:14:35,370
who the fuck? No, no. I get
it. I got it. I could see that.

2380
02:14:35,371 --> 02:14:37,650
I could see that I'm calling back.
I get the message

2381
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:40,140
gps. Just when you're somewhere
you don't not and you're like,

2382
02:14:40,141 --> 02:14:43,270
where's the closest Starbucks or
where's something like Ari says it's,

2383
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:46,380
he's not on his phone as much now that
he has his phone bullshit cause he's

2384
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:50,250
spending 10 times longer trying
to type a sentence to me.

2385
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:53,640
Like the other day we're going back and
forth. I'm just like, what is, Oh yeah,

2386
02:14:53,641 --> 02:14:56,340
he's on the flip phone and he's like,
yeah,

2387
02:14:57,290 --> 02:15:01,520
got it. Takes longer to make
text message. I just call you.

2388
02:15:01,521 --> 02:15:03,890
Let's just call this, you
know. That's what I'm saying.

2389
02:15:03,891 --> 02:15:05,980
You don't make texts anyway.
I don't want to do it.

2390
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:10,280
I'm going to send nobody pictures.
Don't send me nothing. I'm a simple guy.

2391
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:14,120
Does an infant of infamous video that
Brian made a long time ago of a Senate

2392
02:15:14,121 --> 02:15:18,490
Joey Diaz texts. Oh, I was like at the
old Houston lab stuff. That was fun.

2393
02:15:18,491 --> 02:15:20,210
That was, yeah. What year was that from?

2394
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:25,370
Joey d is ready to die. It was called
and five and it was, yeah, around that.

2395
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:29,300
It was 10 years ago. Not Crazy.
In 2005 Pete still had that club.

2396
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:33,090
Can you believe that shit?
Wow. That's crazy. It's sad.

2397
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:36,000
That club doesn't exist anymore.
That was one of the all time great clubs.

2398
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:36,701
It's clad though.

2399
02:15:36,701 --> 02:15:41,400
Why the club is don't fucking really
not glad that the club was stolen.

2400
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:44,400
Cyst and a lot of new ones have open.

2401
02:15:44,430 --> 02:15:47,910
I've gone to a lot of good clubs the
last three years that I didn't even know

2402
02:15:47,911 --> 02:15:52,590
existed. Cleveland's a good club.
Indianapolis is a rocking little city.

2403
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:55,800
I had never been there.
Buffalo's always rocks.

2404
02:15:55,890 --> 02:16:00,740
How long he in Portland been
around seven years. Seven years.

2405
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:05,320
No Way. Now it's like three or four
maybe. I all I know about Portland.

2406
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:07,020
Portland is Houston.

2407
02:16:07,021 --> 02:16:12,021
Texas in 1990 comedy has become the thing
to do and it feels good when you go up

2408
02:16:12,211 --> 02:16:16,350
there as a comment. Oh yeah. And Houston,
all the bartenders didn't know your name.

2409
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,980
Just some hip guy was down. Let's
go down and have a beer. That's it.

2410
02:16:19,981 --> 02:16:23,400
That's what it's become important.
I feel that I like when I go up there,

2411
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,840
the afterwards, the food in those
trucks, the, the weather for three days.

2412
02:16:27,841 --> 02:16:31,380
That's probably one of the best up
and coming right now. Portland. And,

2413
02:16:31,390 --> 02:16:33,610
but all the helium says
Mike and motherfuckers,

2414
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:36,880
all those helium's ain't fucking hour.
He called me the first time he goes,

2415
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:40,600
you were right about Portland.
The Cuban sandwich just fucking premium.

2416
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:42,450
They ain't fucking around food.

2417
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:45,250
Portland is the other place
where I have the ranch dressing.

2418
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:48,290
The other place where you do have much,

2419
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:52,960
they have the spicy ranch dressing over
potato tots. It makes your asshole.

2420
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:57,930
You actually liked some ranch dressing?
No revelation.

2421
02:16:57,970 --> 02:17:02,770
That's the lady told me after I ate it,
it's was my fucking ordered it. It came.

2422
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:06,540
It's paint. It's red. It's like
for ego. Well it's probably like a,

2423
02:17:07,910 --> 02:17:09,310
it's not really like the ranch.

2424
02:17:09,311 --> 02:17:14,050
You motherfuckers either the home
ranch mixed with red hot, got malaria.

2425
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:14,471
No,

2426
02:17:14,471 --> 02:17:17,760
there's a lot of like crafts restaurants
up there that are making their own food

2427
02:17:17,761 --> 02:17:20,740
that she makes the wrong songs and
there's a fucking place I instagrammed it.

2428
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:24,970
There was a truck that we went to. It
was a tie. Cheeseburger. Holy Shit.

2429
02:17:24,971 --> 02:17:28,900
It was good. What was ana? Oh
my God. That peanut saute sauce.

2430
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:32,800
Hot Peppers for like a grilled Jalapenos.

2431
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:35,560
I don't know what kind of cheese it was.
There's a bunch of other shit on it.

2432
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:38,530
I had two of them. I had to go back.
I couldn't even fit it in my stomach.

2433
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:41,650
Like I crammed that fucker down
my throat because it was so good.

2434
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:43,450
It was so delicious.
I mean,

2435
02:17:43,451 --> 02:17:45,640
it was probably the most delicious
cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.

2436
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:48,680
That's it right there. It's
called the brunch box. Yeah.

2437
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:50,590
You don't even tell by that picture.
That picture.

2438
02:17:50,591 --> 02:17:55,591
It's got bacon on it is a cheeseburger
and see those fucking grilled Jalapenos

2439
02:17:55,811 --> 02:18:00,340
and could God, it was good
fucking a man. I was like,

2440
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:03,790
I can't believe how delicious it says.
Like it was so unique.

2441
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:06,070
It was such a bunch of
different flavors in your mouth,

2442
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:08,050
but they're like into
shit like that down there,

2443
02:18:08,051 --> 02:18:12,310
like little small businesses that do
a great job and make really good food.

2444
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:16,570
It's like it's an art form to a lot
of these people and that's why they,

2445
02:18:16,571 --> 02:18:19,180
I think that's why standups
sorta thrives in that city too.

2446
02:18:19,181 --> 02:18:22,420
It's a very creative city.
Standup is amazing there.

2447
02:18:22,421 --> 02:18:26,460
That fucking helium was
spectacular. Spectacular. So fun.

2448
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:31,150
The fucking staff to the people
Refa took the food to the weather.

2449
02:18:31,151 --> 02:18:34,180
It's kind of, you know, if you're here
for a month and it's fucking sunny,

2450
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:36,670
you go up there and it's got
like that Batman weather,

2451
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:41,740
like Gotham siblings like fucking gloom.
You appreciate that later me come home.

2452
02:18:41,970 --> 02:18:45,920
Yes you do. You know, and when I went to
Cleveland it's like fucking with Batman.

2453
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:51,280
I just told them the real Luzia everybody
the joke of this place where I'm from

2454
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:54,940
the plane, you know like Cleveland,
no fuck around and look at you.

2455
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:59,110
When he got played Cleveland hat, that's
Atlanta. That's Cleveland Indians.

2456
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:02,320
Oh Shit. Look at you. I was told I'm not
claiming that. It's hilarious. The the,

2457
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:06,460
at the Portland it's everything's rainy
and so it's all like the green is like a

2458
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:09,940
different green, like the grass. You
don't seem like dry grass up there.

2459
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:14,890
That kras is glowing and globally.
That shit raw. Fuck the juicer.

2460
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:19,110
Pretty pieces of grass. You test
positive and shit. The fuck mean.

2461
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,760
As long as he take your vitamin D
because you're not going to get a lot of

2462
02:19:21,761 --> 02:19:24,940
sunshine in the winter, but if you
take your vitamin D and deal with that,

2463
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:28,040
is this that it's a relaxed place to,
there's not that many people up

2464
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,100
there. I think Portland only has like
a half a million or something. Right.

2465
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:34,430
How many people Google that
shit? I bet. I'm going to guess.

2466
02:19:34,431 --> 02:19:35,420
How many people do you guess?

2467
02:19:35,421 --> 02:19:39,010
I'm guessing somewhere between five
and 600 times in Portland. Yeah.

2468
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:42,380
At say 1.2 million. No, 2.1 million.

2469
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:48,860
The Wikipedia official population.
609,000 bloons done. Thank you.

2470
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:52,050
Wow. All right, so I've been going to
the mall. I been going to Portland.

2471
02:19:52,051 --> 02:19:55,540
It's just 98 I had a friend, Floyd,
the kid, he used to go to die.

2472
02:19:55,541 --> 02:19:59,000
I was just like the kid. I used to call
him Floyd. The kids loved Jay Phillips.

2473
02:19:59,001 --> 02:20:03,300
He's my brother from different,
my loosening, grand rapids,
Michigan and Floyd's.

2474
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:05,360
Jake Phillips was my friend in Portland,

2475
02:20:05,361 --> 02:20:08,210
so I met him during the Seattle comedy
competition and he said, listen,

2476
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:10,280
if you want to come to
Portland I get you to harvest.

2477
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:14,450
That was the big club for years.
That club for five days day,

2478
02:20:14,451 --> 02:20:17,180
you want to shoot yourself Saturday night,
the grand finale,

2479
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:21,350
the club owner invites his mother to
the club and she sits in the front row.

2480
02:20:21,351 --> 02:20:25,150
Either gives you the thumbs up like
fucking gladiator or the summer's done,

2481
02:20:25,151 --> 02:20:28,430
you know? Yeah, she does
his mother. Oh my God.

2482
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:32,180
So they attract a different type.
They attract like comedians,

2483
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:35,900
magicians and hit someone.
Helium went to Portland.

2484
02:20:35,901 --> 02:20:38,660
You just knocked him out of the fucking
race. It's two different worlds.

2485
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:40,430
Helium is bringing us killers.

2486
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:44,780
They still got guys that play the
trumpet onstage and jump up and down.

2487
02:20:44,781 --> 02:20:46,460
They used to bookstand hope once a year,

2488
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:51,570
the elite club that once a
year they worked at dirty
week and it was either Stan

2489
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:55,070
hope and Ingram or Stan hope and me.
That's it.

2490
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:59,210
One year when we can place in Seattle.

2491
02:20:59,211 --> 02:21:02,560
That was like super squeaky clean
at one point was a giggles giggles.

2492
02:21:02,750 --> 02:21:06,410
Is that still around? No, the owner,
Terri went back to Utah. He's a Mormon.

2493
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:09,500
He had a club in fucking
whatever that was popular.

2494
02:21:09,501 --> 02:21:14,480
So he bought giggles from this dude that
was a fucking pilot in Vietnam and he

2495
02:21:14,481 --> 02:21:19,040
was half full box and he used to drive
a Jaguar and he hated dirty comedy.

2496
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:21,950
But he hired me.
I used to put them together to hire me.

2497
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:25,680
But the beauty is I got in with
the waitress. They did drugs. Cool.

2498
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:30,590
So I made the one way just party and
with fucking the singer from Alice and

2499
02:21:30,591 --> 02:21:34,460
chains though she used to tell him lanes
anytime you want to come and do some

2500
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:38,650
heroin with, can I use to sit that on on
like I didn't know what else in chain.

2501
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:42,770
Well, I'm not going to lie to him.
At the time I had no idea. And uh,

2502
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:47,210
I used to tell the waitress to go in the
room and see what the feature act was

2503
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:50,660
for the following week.
This is how fucked up this guy was.

2504
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:53,240
So they'd say he doesn't have a
feature of the rest of the month.

2505
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:56,180
So after I'd work on Saturday,

2506
02:21:56,750 --> 02:22:00,380
first thing Monday morning nine oh one I
would call him and go whatever his name

2507
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:04,710
was. Hey Joey did and said, can I feature
this week? Let me see if it's open. Yes.

2508
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:07,340
A topic. Hey, let me ask you, when was
the last time you were at the club?

2509
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:11,720
Eight years ago. He was
so old box. He was gone.

2510
02:22:11,721 --> 02:22:15,560
Like his mind was gone. Here's the
better one. Thursday night was Olympia,

2511
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:19,970
so you had to drive to Olympia door one
night and then Friday and Saturday night

2512
02:22:19,971 --> 02:22:21,430
he had four shows at the club.

2513
02:22:21,470 --> 02:22:26,020
Giggles Olympia was one 50 for
the feature and a hundred of show.

2514
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,950
She got a five 50 I would go to,

2515
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:32,850
I would do Olympia and then go there
Friday night and take a door off at two 50

2516
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:37,320
and Saturday night. He's still
paying me the five 50 better than me.

2517
02:22:37,710 --> 02:22:41,340
I got that guy every fucking week
when I was there. So it was too old.

2518
02:22:41,341 --> 02:22:45,300
He just didn't know it was,
no, he wasn't that old. He
was just, he was gone. He did.

2519
02:22:45,310 --> 02:22:47,730
And he would ask me on Monday,
when was the last time you were there?

2520
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:53,160
Six years ago. Okay, I see you
Thursday night. It was fucking crazy.

2521
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:54,540
Let me tell you how crazy he was.

2522
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:59,010
So you were on stage and there
was a a window next to the stage.

2523
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:03,300
So that's how you knew when he pulled up.
So I would work dirty,

2524
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:08,280
go up their dicks. Fuck you Cox. And as
soon as I see his light, I count the five.

2525
02:23:08,281 --> 02:23:10,650
Soon as he hit the door and he
walked me walking into the back,

2526
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:11,940
I do knock knock jokes.

2527
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:16,500
So I let the girl on fire and we walked
through the jungle and that and he'd

2528
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:18,070
leave. Watch it for a minute. I met,

2529
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:21,990
I had to be cleaned for one minute and
then he disappeared and then you went

2530
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:26,430
right back to your routine. But here's
where it gets better. I worked with,

2531
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:28,530
there's a guy up day,
I can't remember his name,

2532
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:30,450
is fucking great guy out of Seattle.

2533
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:34,560
He's a tennis coach at the University
of Washington. This guy is bad ass.

2534
02:23:34,561 --> 02:23:36,870
He's been on the road for years,
did all the TV shows.

2535
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:42,350
He's a gentlemen and the cleanest comic
working and who he was on stage one

2536
02:23:42,511 --> 02:23:47,511
night I was featuring for him and that
own the walked in and confused me for him

2537
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:51,320
when he got off the
stage like what the hell?

2538
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:54,580
The matter with you working dirty and
the guy's like, I don't even say a curse.

2539
02:23:54,581 --> 02:23:58,980
Bob Bob, that was his
name. Bob. And he goes,

2540
02:23:58,981 --> 02:24:01,830
yes you were. I just watch
it being dirty. It was me.

2541
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:05,490
He got shot down and yet
just the mind was gone.

2542
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:09,660
They gave him a check and he hit him up
in Seattle and he bought a comedy club.

2543
02:24:09,661 --> 02:24:12,300
He wouldn't even drink. He just
locked himself in his fucking office.

2544
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:17,010
So he sold it to Terry and Terry wanted
it all clean and then it went on and

2545
02:24:17,011 --> 02:24:19,670
that was in the u district.
That club, isn't it?

2546
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:23,970
What's The u district and say putting
the club and sits on across the street

2547
02:24:23,971 --> 02:24:25,970
from Oakland [inaudible]
you're going to customers.

2548
02:24:25,971 --> 02:24:28,730
You have the u district where the
University of Washington Heights.

2549
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:33,490
It was a couple of treats away from
the main strip where everything crack

2550
02:24:33,491 --> 02:24:35,670
cracker lax. That's a
great, interesting strip.

2551
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:39,990
That's your Bruce Lee opened this first
fucking school. Really right up dad yet,

2552
02:24:39,991 --> 02:24:43,890
bro. Seattle. Bruce Lee walked
around Seattle dog. That's wild,

2553
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,620
and he opened his first school up
there and not what you get man,

2554
02:24:46,621 --> 02:24:48,930
but with those black guys, that's
where it all started. That was,

2555
02:24:48,931 --> 02:24:52,140
there's a large Chinese immigrant because
they went there and he came to Oakland

2556
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,410
up.

2557
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:56,850
It was what all the rumors came that the
mafia went and told them not to teach

2558
02:24:56,851 --> 02:24:59,790
white people and they told
him to suck his dick. Then he,

2559
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:01,770
then they sent the dragon over there,

2560
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:03,890
send the dragon and
kicked him in the spine.

2561
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:07,200
He went to the hospital and that's
when he wrote the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe.

2562
02:25:07,201 --> 02:25:09,450
That's a story that day in the movie.
That's not what happened.

2563
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:12,150
They did send people over and they
were going to fucking kill him.

2564
02:25:12,151 --> 02:25:14,690
Those fucking try ads, but that's not
what you think. They did kill them.

2565
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:18,030
I ultimately, 10 years
later, you know, listen man,

2566
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:21,330
you got to put money in their pocket.
Once you put money in their pocket,

2567
02:25:21,331 --> 02:25:25,660
they keep you alive. Once wanted
to deal with and could a dragon,

2568
02:25:25,661 --> 02:25:30,220
that's all an American deal. That's what
happened. He cut him out of wherever.

2569
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:31,810
Find out the truth about that.
That would be,

2570
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:36,760
that would be unbelievably fascinating.
Document really killed documents.

2571
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:40,960
But then 30 years later they killed
his son and nobody went to jail.

2572
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:44,270
I stuck man. Put a bullet in the
fucking gun with what you were talking.

2573
02:25:44,271 --> 02:25:46,150
It's like a piece of
a bullet or something.

2574
02:25:46,151 --> 02:25:50,050
Whatever the fuck he went to jail for
that there wasn't a trial. Nothing. Linda,

2575
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:52,900
Linda Lee went up there.
I miss my son.

2576
02:25:52,901 --> 02:25:54,790
They must have given
her a fucking check too.

2577
02:25:55,210 --> 02:26:00,200
She's worth gazillions when the late,
yeah. Think about it. Who gets the estate?

2578
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:05,320
His two kids, the daughter and
Linda Lee. That's it. Who's left.

2579
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:10,210
He may give Dan Inosanto a
fucking taste from it. Yeah.

2580
02:26:10,570 --> 02:26:14,260
The uh, the, there's a lot of
theories about this guy's death.

2581
02:26:14,261 --> 02:26:19,210
It's really interesting. I was,
listen guys, I'm 52 years old.

2582
02:26:19,630 --> 02:26:23,440
Not only was I there, I mean I wasn't in
China when he died, but I was dead guys.

2583
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:26,980
I was in the middle of this. This
guy was my everything. Joe Rogan.

2584
02:26:26,981 --> 02:26:28,660
I had been hit in the
head with a lunchbox.

2585
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:32,110
I was a quiet kid and it was like
that girl that fell off the bike.

2586
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:35,320
She got no titties. She wouldn't give me
pussy. But after she got hit in the head,

2587
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:38,560
she grew tits and she sucked everybody's
Dick. I my worry about that girl.

2588
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:41,770
And he would tell him me how they hit
the side of a lump in their head where

2589
02:26:41,771 --> 02:26:46,360
they get to true. When she got very,
uh, what's the word? Sexual, you know,

2590
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:50,740
I got crazy.
So what fuels my craziness was Batman.

2591
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:53,470
But when Batman fought the Green Hornet,

2592
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:57,520
that took me to different levels of
craziness. My father had just died.

2593
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,970
I was beating everything up. I used to
have a French poodle. I used to kick.

2594
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:04,630
My mother told me, you know, you
got, and it fueled me. It killed me.

2595
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:06,700
Once Bruce Lee came along,

2596
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:10,600
he introduced martial arts to this country
in a different way. Like that was it.

2597
02:27:10,601 --> 02:27:14,170
Those karate schools filled up.
My first experience with karate,

2598
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:17,830
which with Rashad's father,
Jedi Bravo's brown belt,

2599
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:19,270
the guy that plays the Brazilians,

2600
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:24,360
your son's father was my first karate
teacher on 90th street and Amsterdam up on

2601
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:27,580
the west side of that and
that was all a black school,

2602
02:27:27,581 --> 02:27:29,440
Joe Rohde and you had to carry a gate.

2603
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:33,670
It was a black guy with a white belt and
you had a walk in and give them a car.

2604
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:36,900
None of the card was a gold you fist.
I'll never forget that.

2605
02:27:36,901 --> 02:27:39,340
And they had Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

2606
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:41,770
And they would mark when they
come in and they give you the car,

2607
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:45,420
you couldn't talk, you couldn't
fucking talk. You had to
go back. There were signs,

2608
02:27:45,430 --> 02:27:49,420
father put your gear on and you had to
go to the front and stand like this and

2609
02:27:49,421 --> 02:27:51,730
they like clap.
You got to do the cat stance from here,

2610
02:27:51,970 --> 02:27:55,480
from right hand Joburg and you got
to do the whole cat stance and going,

2611
02:27:57,490 --> 02:28:00,400
I still remember all that shit.
I still remember my first form.

2612
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:05,530
I stayed with Sean's father. It was
white, yellow, green belt, purple belt.

2613
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:09,180
I stayed with Sean's father,
Rashad Rashad,

2614
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:13,510
but it was fucking famous from the time
I was maybe six and a half to maybe nine.

2615
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:17,020
I went to that karate school religiously
and when they sent me to Catholic

2616
02:28:17,021 --> 02:28:18,460
school during the week,

2617
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:22,070
I would go on Saturday mornings
and would be pissed off.

2618
02:28:22,071 --> 02:28:26,450
I wouldn't fuck you been all we got
Rashad's father used [inaudible] resigns.

2619
02:28:26,510 --> 02:28:31,510
Father used to make you run with your
Guiana in the street with no shoes on.

2620
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:33,890
Whether it was snow or not.
This was,

2621
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:37,280
this was the beauty that was a
different karate in those days. Dog.

2622
02:28:37,281 --> 02:28:40,380
It ain't this shit now that they
didn't just give you about pro.

2623
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:44,240
You had got beat up and then
beat motherfuckers up, but
here's the beauty of it.

2624
02:28:44,241 --> 02:28:46,910
You had a run in front of the
kids that you went to school with.

2625
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,060
They'd be at the playground.
Hey,

2626
02:28:48,061 --> 02:28:51,710
you went with a white fucking geek
running down Amsterdam Avenue and shit.

2627
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:53,840
So the next day you'd go to
school and they're like, look,

2628
02:28:53,841 --> 02:28:58,160
a fucking Johnny Kung Fu in time and
you got to fight fucking 10 fucking kids

2629
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:00,080
and shit because they'd see you.

2630
02:29:00,081 --> 02:29:02,960
This is a different time for folks who
don't know what we were talking about.

2631
02:29:02,970 --> 02:29:07,760
Croissant is a handout.
That's his character,

2632
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:10,400
the priests, all the fucking
people that, hey man,

2633
02:29:10,401 --> 02:29:13,790
what happened with you and that Brazilian
guy, not that guy. He's my friend.

2634
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:16,550
He's not really Brazilian,
dare I said it.

2635
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:22,580
It's like they're trying to keep this
God damn secret. It's not a Brazilian,

2636
02:29:22,581 --> 02:29:26,150
he's an American actor. Slash.
Comedian. A very funny man,

2637
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:29,720
like saw an orange.
So during that Nicky Swanson,

2638
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:35,240
but here's what kills that nick sorts
and that's how he calls it his fucking

2639
02:29:35,241 --> 02:29:39,650
name. But here's what the killer was.
Well, I'm involved in all this Joe Rogan.

2640
02:29:39,651 --> 02:29:43,760
At the time my mom moves to Jersey and
on Saturdays I have to go to the bar in

2641
02:29:43,761 --> 02:29:46,970
Jersey on, have to go to the
Bronx and do the numbers.

2642
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,690
When I went to Catholic school on Sunday,
Saturday is my fault.

2643
02:29:50,691 --> 02:29:54,260
My step father would pick me up
Thursday night. Friday was movie night.

2644
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,200
I needed to go to the root
three fucking driving.

2645
02:29:57,470 --> 02:29:59,180
That's why I saw enter the Dragon.
No,

2646
02:29:59,330 --> 02:30:03,650
I saw Chinese connection and five
fingers of death. I'm a drop line.

2647
02:30:03,651 --> 02:30:04,490
You mother fuckers,

2648
02:30:04,730 --> 02:30:08,300
that's when the guy's hand would turn
purple because he do the eye in palm

2649
02:30:08,301 --> 02:30:10,460
technique.
That was just on El Rey.

2650
02:30:10,461 --> 02:30:12,620
Fucking you gotta give a
shout out to Robert Rodriguez.

2651
02:30:12,621 --> 02:30:17,070
He put it on being all dot Hempel or
heads almost fucking blew up. That's all.

2652
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:20,990
That was the first martial arts movie
that was released in the United States

2653
02:30:20,991 --> 02:30:23,990
when his hand turned red and I have
to get, he puts it through the guy,

2654
02:30:23,991 --> 02:30:28,220
but I saw those too. Here's
another fact. Hit me, hit me.

2655
02:30:28,221 --> 02:30:30,080
Here's the fact that
really kills the America.

2656
02:30:30,470 --> 02:30:34,790
This is what really throws a twist in
it. Uh, what's his young man's name?

2657
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:39,170
And Jamie put on the date of Bruce
Lee's death and put the date up of the

2658
02:30:39,171 --> 02:30:43,980
release event to the Dragon.
Why is, what does it mean?

2659
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:46,670
Go look just telling me what does it mean?
One of the other,

2660
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:49,970
it would happen one week apart.
That's the kinky thing.

2661
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,180
This is the biggest movie in the cut.
Do you under the fucking stand me.

2662
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:55,430
This movie came out on the fucking Friday.

2663
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:59,000
By Saturday you were on the phone
with everybody, uncle, whatever.

2664
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:04,010
You got to go see Bruce Lee. He fucked
everything up. When did Bruce Lee die?

2665
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:08,330
August 19th, 1973 to, yeah,

2666
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:11,900
one of the July 20th, 1973.
When did the movie got released?

2667
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:14,900
That was the weird part of it.

2668
02:31:14,901 --> 02:31:19,220
And this guy was a fucking John era and
all of a sudden, but look at his face.

2669
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:20,213
Look at his face.

2670
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:21,750
Go back to his fucking face.

2671
02:31:22,210 --> 02:31:25,890
Chinese are the best people at
embalming in their fucking face,

2672
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:29,340
in the casket looking at his fucking face.
That guy took a beaten dog,

2673
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:32,390
doesn't even look like him. That's
what they were selling in Chinatown.

2674
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:35,190
A week later, those pictures of
Bruce Lee guided. Click that.

2675
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,580
Click that fucking video. See what he
tells you? The fucking truth story.

2676
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:42,750
Looking at that shit. Shelly,
what are you talking about?

2677
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:47,580
The crazy person that's video.
The true story.

2678
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:01,063
What kind of movies?

2679
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:07,500
Watch Kung Fu and yet man,

2680
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:21,010
deadly weapons ever develop bear.

2681
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:28,800
This is just fucking around, man.
That's all it says is that as well.

2682
02:32:28,801 --> 02:32:29,850
I'm a,

2683
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:36,510
she's still alive. Yeah.
Billions. Billions.

2684
02:32:36,511 --> 02:32:39,720
What he saw Justin in t shirt
weeping. He does a year. Oh yeah,

2685
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:43,560
I got a few of them. The roots of fight
ones. Yeah. This is a bullshit video.

2686
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:46,920
Hold on.
You want to keep watching it?

2687
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,330
[inaudible] challenge champion.

2688
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:56,183
Look at that shirt.

2689
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:02,153
That one.

2690
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:12,370
Now hold on one sec. Picture hand
comes up and then put the drag him.

2691
02:33:12,371 --> 02:33:16,290
Tell me this guy was in bad shape.
Oh, he has some Hema fucking Toba.

2692
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:17,340
We can just look up the,

2693
02:33:17,970 --> 02:33:20,720
we can just look up the death photo
instead of having to watch this horrible

2694
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:23,550
movie they watch.
All of them will be horrible.

2695
02:33:24,490 --> 02:33:27,320
Well, he was there for
original wife beater where?

2696
02:33:27,650 --> 02:33:32,000
Who are a white theater before
Bruce Lee. Nobody did. Right.

2697
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:34,550
Who the fuck more those?
That wasn't common.

2698
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:39,590
He was the first guy with a six pack
revoke the movie, had a six pack.

2699
02:33:41,270 --> 02:33:45,200
Who in a movie we'd show their six pack.
What guy? And a move. Even Chuck Norris,

2700
02:33:45,201 --> 02:33:45,890
when you saw him,

2701
02:33:45,890 --> 02:33:49,460
you just kind of smooth like no
one never looked like this before.

2702
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:52,610
Like where a guy took his shirt off and
sort of flexing and you see a six pack

2703
02:33:52,611 --> 02:33:55,850
and all the sinew and muscles.
Tarzan.

2704
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:01,900
Tarzan was smooth.
Tarzan was like a fit dude,

2705
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:05,690
but he was smooth. No one's
ever done Tarzan. Right?

2706
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:09,980
That's a movie that no one ever
really nailed. Nobody ever really,

2707
02:34:10,490 --> 02:34:13,890
you really believe some dudes out there
living with monkeys can't believe you

2708
02:34:13,891 --> 02:34:18,020
watched that whole thing and that
death foot it. Even in it. Yeah.

2709
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:20,080
Fuck.
It confuses

2710
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:28,600
people today. Don't know how much of an
impact, personally, you have no idea.

2711
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:29,530
When I wasn't getting a job,

2712
02:34:29,531 --> 02:34:33,100
it kills me when I see documentaries
and they're talking for like John Jones.

2713
02:34:33,101 --> 02:34:38,101
I Love Jon Jones be at $20 you didn't see
the impact of the black kids trying to

2714
02:34:38,621 --> 02:34:42,040
town on Saturdays. We'll be back.
No white kids eat and everything.

2715
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:46,060
I used to go to China town, hit the stick.
It was a cat. A lizard. It didn't matter.

2716
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:50,110
I wanted to be like Bruce sleep,
bro. Yeah matter. I had the shoes.

2717
02:34:50,111 --> 02:34:52,670
I had the thing I didn't sense
at the house. Me and mom,

2718
02:34:52,671 --> 02:34:55,860
my mom's a Santa Maria check. She'd come
in like, what the fuck is this incense?

2719
02:34:56,170 --> 02:35:00,220
Get this. Are you fucking crazy?
I beat and rice for a long time.

2720
02:35:00,221 --> 02:35:04,750
I went on a rice diet, was going
fucking nuts. She was like, Oh,

2721
02:35:04,751 --> 02:35:07,000
neat and chatty and eat Chinese
food to be like Bruce Lee.

2722
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:10,630
I everything I did everything.
I had the palm that you rub on your hands.

2723
02:35:10,690 --> 02:35:15,250
I am Paul. I fucking was trying to get a
plane ticket to Hong Kong. I was crazy.

2724
02:35:15,251 --> 02:35:18,820
I was nuts. What's his stuff do
you rubbing your hands to Ramallah?

2725
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:21,310
Cina they have that and then they
have this ointment that you put on.

2726
02:35:21,311 --> 02:35:24,820
It's like a liquid. It's like chin,
chin, Tiger Balm. It's a little,

2727
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:27,670
it's a little thicker and you use
it for the IOM palm technique.

2728
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:32,220
So you rub it on your hands and you hit
a bag before you strike something. Ah.

2729
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:36,190
And it really, yeah, it's that important.
You put it on your elbows, your joints.

2730
02:35:36,310 --> 02:35:39,220
Remember these to have those stores, you
should buy it. You can buy a Ninja stars.

2731
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:42,390
They just haven't been Chinatown.
You could go by throwing stars. Yeah,

2732
02:35:42,410 --> 02:35:44,480
but there will never be sharp you.
I'm really going to war.

2733
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:47,860
I got four stars on my pocket.
I really throw it out a motherfucker.

2734
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:50,860
And then other than that,
not even sticking into would
that have been told you?

2735
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:53,350
You've got to take them home and sharpen
them. That was always the fucking,

2736
02:35:53,351 --> 02:35:55,330
by the way,
the ones that were going in Boston,

2737
02:35:55,331 --> 02:35:57,880
they said they sold ones
that had sharp edges to them.

2738
02:35:57,980 --> 02:36:02,020
I used to get black belt magazine and
granted that was my magazine is a narrower

2739
02:36:02,021 --> 02:36:05,230
sharp though cause I got a few of those
and we'd be like, throw me against walls,

2740
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:08,500
century martial arts catalog.
You'd get that catalog.

2741
02:36:08,501 --> 02:36:11,800
You can order all kinds of
shit. Coco Bolo, noon chucks.

2742
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:15,990
I was not telling him [inaudible] I
used to get my shit from the Honda.

2743
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:19,960
Honda was the random martial arts
and they had a store on Broadway,

2744
02:36:19,961 --> 02:36:24,250
a fifth avenue. When you go in there
as a martial arts kid, you would come,

2745
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:27,910
your head would blow up.
When I was 10 I would save all my money.

2746
02:36:27,911 --> 02:36:30,970
I would work at a bar and I would go
over there and I'm Saturdays was 600

2747
02:36:30,971 --> 02:36:33,460
gorillas.
This was way before weed.

2748
02:36:34,450 --> 02:36:36,160
This is what you lot of
people don't understand.

2749
02:36:36,190 --> 02:36:40,510
I stayed in martial arts and the reason
why I quit was because those kids didn't

2750
02:36:40,511 --> 02:36:44,080
get hot. I couldn't, I couldn't hide it
from them. No one. I liked those guys.

2751
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:47,380
You know, I used to go to class and in
those days I went to my mother's Bar,

2752
02:36:47,381 --> 02:36:50,440
a done and I went to karate and
in those days you were a kid,

2753
02:36:50,441 --> 02:36:53,920
but you went to the kids' class and you
stay for the men's class and the men

2754
02:36:53,930 --> 02:36:56,790
fucked you up. And that's the
guys that helped the board feet.

2755
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:58,600
The upper belts would fuck you up.

2756
02:36:58,810 --> 02:37:03,520
I would leave there at nine nine 30 and
walk home after two hours of that shit.

2757
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:08,170
And sometimes we'd go, I go
to North Bergen, go to my
house and go to Mario Diaz,

2758
02:37:08,171 --> 02:37:11,340
his house. He was a Chinese Cuban
kid and he had a basement and that,

2759
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:14,800
that's where everybody met. Like in those
days, there was no Brazilian Jujitsu,

2760
02:37:14,970 --> 02:37:16,960
contrived in the tournament's.
Did you ever fight? Yeah,

2761
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:19,720
but I thought semi contact I here,

2762
02:37:19,770 --> 02:37:23,060
my leg would always slip and I'd hit
you in the head and I get disqualified,

2763
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:25,700
but I always won first place in the form.

2764
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:30,880
So my goal was February of 1979 I had
a goal on my birthday to 19 I said,

2765
02:37:32,811 --> 02:37:35,450
I'm going to go to this tournament. It
was a regional New Jersey, torn them.

2766
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:39,680
My goal was to take first place and
the form first place and fighting,

2767
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:42,710
and I was going to quit Joe road.
That's it.

2768
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:46,340
I was going to go to that tournament
that Sunday and quit and never go back to

2769
02:37:46,341 --> 02:37:50,030
karate. I was gonna focus on basketball
and I went to the tournament.

2770
02:37:50,031 --> 02:37:54,530
I got disqualified for kicking butt. I
took first in the form and on the way out.

2771
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:59,090
Good forums. Yeah. This was
when I was issued a rule karate.

2772
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:03,410
This was on 22nd. The guy's name was
Nelson Orleans, the Wayne Orlando.

2773
02:38:03,710 --> 02:38:08,540
He was another Vietnam. That boat. He
white dude like Chuck Norris. And uh,

2774
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:11,870
he looked at your report card? He
was, he was a little bit more serious.

2775
02:38:11,871 --> 02:38:15,020
He didn't really, it wasn't a nice
guy, but he had good for him. You know,

2776
02:38:15,021 --> 02:38:18,170
he had good karate taught
and that was the last,

2777
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:22,600
that was the last when I left there
I think I was a green daughter. So,

2778
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:26,240
so that's when you were doing these forms?
Yeah. Do you think you remember those?

2779
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:28,850
Like when you did that Joey karate thing?

2780
02:38:28,851 --> 02:38:31,820
We used to run around throwing kicks
and punches. That was part of it.

2781
02:38:31,821 --> 02:38:32,690
Those little moves.

2782
02:38:32,691 --> 02:38:37,340
I still remember one form that you learned
what you put your hand down the elbow,

2783
02:38:37,341 --> 02:38:41,630
you let them go and then punch. It was
like a really neat for him, you know,

2784
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:45,020
because I used to hang out with food.
Job Pie Kung Fu guys.

2785
02:38:45,410 --> 02:38:47,570
I used to hang out with
how Kido motherfuckers,

2786
02:38:47,571 --> 02:38:49,850
I used to hang out with a couple
of Cubans that were into judo,

2787
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:53,750
you know one time and you city that
had a huge rush and judo school.

2788
02:38:53,900 --> 02:38:58,670
There was also William Bolt.
He was directing. He was
the original Ikea though,

2789
02:38:58,671 --> 02:39:02,750
Dude. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

2790
02:39:06,470 --> 02:39:10,710
I'm telling you. I had my homemade
heads. This video have Nah, Nah, they,

2791
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:14,780
they keep putting in box 6,000
they keep redoing them and shit.

2792
02:39:15,190 --> 02:39:18,080
Who's is this? Do you have a youtube
page? There's not somebody else's shit.

2793
02:39:18,081 --> 02:39:21,530
Oh my God. She didn't have a youtube
page where this shit is all up.

2794
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:24,800
I don't even have, I think Damon has
the originals and shit like that.

2795
02:39:24,801 --> 02:39:28,760
This is probably Daymond's well
you is that his a youtube channel?

2796
02:39:28,761 --> 02:39:32,810
Fuck the Owens Joey karate
for the UFC minute.

2797
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:36,110
A lot of people see me on the
medical mile all the time ago. Huh?

2798
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:37,790
A lot of people see me
in the sports reports,

2799
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:41,060
but nobody really knows how
many trains fucking assassin.

2800
02:39:43,350 --> 02:39:47,500
I lost my rent on the fucking boat ride
over. It knocked me Donald Greenberg.

2801
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:49,770
I'm fighting to get it back.
You understand me?

2802
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:54,480
I take my shit's guide fucking
jungles in China. Hong Kong,

2803
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:58,080
Bolivia.
That's why train with fucking savages.

2804
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:02,100
Fucking guys flying through the air.
But you're lucky you caught me today.

2805
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:06,530
Joined karate is going to give you a
lock for UFC and it's all about fucking

2806
02:40:06,531 --> 02:40:08,990
Brazil this week. He
understand me. My man,

2807
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:12,680
Anderson Silva isn't a fuck people
up this weekend in the Sammy.

2808
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:14,160
He went through Chris Leben,

2809
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:16,930
Chris Leben, forest
Whitaker, forest Griffin.

2810
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:21,030
Let me show you what this
motherfucker though. First off,

2811
02:40:21,031 --> 02:40:23,810
he's going to get them in a clinic.
That's a movie type shit. You know it's

2812
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:29,000
not really a dialing over
the Thai restaurant. I'm
fucking guy with it, Susan.

2813
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:32,220
We got them in the clench. Couple
knees to the fucking head. A kick.

2814
02:40:32,221 --> 02:40:33,054
I'm going a sidekick.

2815
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:38,100
He's a gentleman to some fucking
Samurai or some on bar or some fucking,

2816
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:42,060
and he's in a book and chop them up.
It's that simple.

2817
02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:48,870
Why don't you do your Joey karate
predictions because you got to move on.

2818
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:53,790
You gotta move on. These are amazing
though. I can't do this no more.

2819
02:40:54,030 --> 02:40:56,070
I'm too old to old people would say,

2820
02:40:56,071 --> 02:41:00,080
who's this fucking fat old guy trying
to be shit. Don't listen to them.

2821
02:41:00,081 --> 02:41:02,480
I'm going to hang up.
Wow.

2822
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:05,790
Every once in a while you
gotta hang up the gate dog.

2823
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:09,510
He can't be doing that shit on national
Tyrone ups for. I think you should do it.

2824
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:12,120
I love it. I love all that.
That's my love for it. I,

2825
02:41:12,121 --> 02:41:16,230
I had it so I know how much it affected
me. After that, my life went downhill.

2826
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:19,800
The next six months in my life were
a disaster after her martial arts.

2827
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:21,930
I hit the number. Yeah. When
I quit to it, that was it.

2828
02:41:21,931 --> 02:41:25,020
That was the beginning of that. Six
months later, my mom died. It was all,

2829
02:41:25,470 --> 02:41:27,840
but when I got my life back together,
that's what it was.

2830
02:41:27,841 --> 02:41:32,250
I got back into its great for people.
Now you need to do predictions for fights.

2831
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:36,510
I'm too out of it anymore. But you're
good at it. Even if you're wrong.

2832
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:41,040
It's hilarious. Listen, I, I felt
in my heart those shiny nose,

2833
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:44,040
but I couldn't say it.
People don't think you see the fight.

2834
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:47,610
You got find credible pedes
versus, oh, Sandra's pedis.

2835
02:41:47,670 --> 02:41:51,460
I thought Pedis had an edge in the
standup for showers are great car.

2836
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:55,830
The girl Joanna, she
hits hard. Uh, you know,

2837
02:41:55,831 --> 02:41:58,260
over and everybody's jumping
up and down over road, right?

2838
02:41:58,261 --> 02:41:59,380
Don't get to fucking excited.

2839
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:02,100
It was a pretty good proof point
for this test to come back. Oh

2840
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:06,450
wait for the test to come
back on Thursday. All right.

2841
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:09,860
Before you guys started jumping up
and down, he beat up Roy Nelson,

2842
02:42:09,890 --> 02:42:11,190
poor Roy Nelson.
You know,

2843
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:14,610
a lot of people said that after
the fight dos Anjos they go,

2844
02:42:14,611 --> 02:42:19,230
please don't touch these all
ripped unbelievable performance.

2845
02:42:19,231 --> 02:42:22,110
Like this guy,
he's gotta be like somehow or another,

2846
02:42:22,111 --> 02:42:25,860
this guy's got to get through this.
That was incredible. I thought.

2847
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:29,490
I really did think that pet is going to
have an edge in the standup and dose on

2848
02:42:29,491 --> 02:42:30,510
Joseph was just uh,

2849
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:34,020
just attacking from the very
beginning of the fight in the standup,

2850
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:38,310
like lit him up man.
Straight left hands like super fast.

2851
02:42:38,311 --> 02:42:41,610
Like faster than I've ever seen him
fight before. His last two fights.

2852
02:42:41,611 --> 02:42:46,320
He's looks sensational. He looked
a level above his game. So,

2853
02:42:46,321 --> 02:42:47,460
uh,
I just,

2854
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:52,110
I didn't know it was going to be that
I really did from the beat more of a,

2855
02:42:52,710 --> 02:42:55,350
but he took away. He took them
down and that way bro, that's the,

2856
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:59,000
that's the fucking thing sometimes
just doesn't take down. She has paid.

2857
02:42:59,001 --> 02:43:02,860
That's how you know Chael Sonnen
that take down slows you down man.

2858
02:43:02,861 --> 02:43:05,730
That was some great fights in that car.
You know what else it was though too.

2859
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:07,240
It wasn't just the takedowns,

2860
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:10,920
it was the fucking kick to the body
that left power kick to the body.

2861
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:12,400
He was smashing

2862
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,130
them with that thing. Every time
you get hit with a kick like that,

2863
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:17,350
that should takes a lot
of your movement away.

2864
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:18,910
It takes a lot of your breath away.

2865
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:22,720
It takes a lot of your energy
away till Sandra just smashed on.

2866
02:43:22,721 --> 02:43:25,780
What that kick over and over again
and smashed. And what's trait lefts?

2867
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:29,080
I think pedestals just taken a back.
I just don't think he expected it.

2868
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:34,110
I think he felt like the dose on Joe's
would be probably slower than him and

2869
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:37,510
move a little more hesitant on the
feet. But those aren't just, just, just,

2870
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:38,403
just attack.

2871
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:43,230
I am a big fan of fights. This particular
fights at my dick gets hard. Yeah,

2872
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:46,090
that was a big one for me. That was
a big one for me. But what's coming?

2873
02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:51,170
Cause whatever happens with Serone
and look a walkie, the Russian

2874
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:57,470
beep, that bad motherfucker with the war
had mother for whatever happens there.

2875
02:43:57,471 --> 02:43:58,550
I can't even pick a winner.

2876
02:43:58,551 --> 02:44:01,220
Like it's too much for my fucking
scalped even thinking about.

2877
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:05,120
So whatever happens that fight to
where that gets this fucking savage.

2878
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:09,710
So that's two fights. I get to see that
it gets hard and it spills all over it.

2879
02:44:09,711 --> 02:44:12,890
So I love it. This is tremendous.
I love this type of shit.

2880
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:16,610
My original fight was dropped
array against Yoel Romero.

2881
02:44:16,611 --> 02:44:19,730
That went down to fucking
see you get that name right.

2882
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:22,700
Every time there was Cuban
and the names just flow it.

2883
02:44:22,701 --> 02:44:27,540
I know y'all well remember it was easy
as just today is nobody fucks up jocker

2884
02:44:27,550 --> 02:44:30,800
Ray's name yet. I believe Nijmegen
Madoff. That's too much from him.

2885
02:44:31,670 --> 02:44:34,700
It's crazy because you know what?
You can't say it.

2886
02:44:34,910 --> 02:44:38,760
10 years ago you guys were talking to me
about Jackie, right? Yeah, he's Boston.

2887
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:40,520
Years ago when you had,
he had the tape.

2888
02:44:40,521 --> 02:44:44,330
We'll get those cars that
would do an hour by Jack Rail.

2889
02:44:44,331 --> 02:44:48,020
It's like nobody talks about them in the
UFC and he's more dangerous than ever.

2890
02:44:48,290 --> 02:44:51,200
They just don't fight that motherfucker
know well, he's been injured.

2891
02:44:51,201 --> 02:44:55,180
He's got a good two pretty
significant shoulder injury.
He, I know he had surgery.

2892
02:44:56,090 --> 02:44:59,300
He had showed low injury.
He had did something but know no,

2893
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:02,360
that guy's fireworks at that weight
level and see what he did to,

2894
02:45:02,361 --> 02:45:06,410
you should know Cami. It was fucking
smashing. You shouldn't call me. Yeah,

2895
02:45:06,411 --> 02:45:09,870
you shouldn't. Was done by his,

2896
02:45:10,090 --> 02:45:13,630
his attacks monster. He's
putting together, you know,

2897
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:17,750
it's very nice to see guys like
nobody.

2898
02:45:18,410 --> 02:45:20,660
Nobody, nobody. First of all,

2899
02:45:20,661 --> 02:45:24,470
nobody would have called 10 years ago
that the UFC would be as big as it is

2900
02:45:24,471 --> 02:45:28,850
today, but nobody really thought Robbie
Lawler would put the pieces together.

2901
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:32,690
You know, it happens to comics.
You've seen him 10 years ago,

2902
02:45:32,691 --> 02:45:35,870
they go to Montreal to get a little
success to deal, doesn't fall through,

2903
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:38,780
and instead of putting the tail
between their legs, they become comics.

2904
02:45:38,781 --> 02:45:41,420
They keep working and you'll
see him 10 years later.

2905
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:43,570
Now they're fucking powerhouses.

2906
02:45:43,970 --> 02:45:48,310
Powerhouses was the same thing
happens in fighting. I believe it.

2907
02:45:48,311 --> 02:45:50,930
You know this guy that does this,
he takes a couple of losses.

2908
02:45:50,931 --> 02:45:53,780
He gets better and better and
better and next thing you know,

2909
02:45:53,781 --> 02:45:58,040
his ground game now is part of what is
striking is striking is part of this

2910
02:45:58,050 --> 02:46:01,520
wrestling. You know, it just
all fits and once it all fits,

2911
02:46:01,530 --> 02:46:02,810
you're not going to stop somebody.

2912
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:05,900
You're not going to stop me for a
while till they overthink themselves.

2913
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:09,620
Once they overthink themselves,
that's like commonly give or this off,

2914
02:46:09,621 --> 02:46:09,980
he'd go up to

2915
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:12,890
you don't get the reaction you want.
Keep it fucking simple bitch.

2916
02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:16,210
Fuck are you to overthink things
once we start thinking of this,

2917
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:19,530
when we kill ourselves, but I see
it, I see where Robbie Lawler,

2918
02:46:19,550 --> 02:46:23,630
guys like Robbie Lawler have to really
make you believe in any of the field that

2919
02:46:23,631 --> 02:46:27,200
you may do, whether you're an artist,
the singer, that you know what?

2920
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:32,540
You took your lumps for a few years. You
really did man, but something you did,

2921
02:46:32,570 --> 02:46:34,250
whatever you're doing now,
stick to it.

2922
02:46:34,251 --> 02:46:38,950
You said it was because he
wasn't inspiring anymore. He
just says, yeah, you know,

2923
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:42,770
it's, it's, people put the pieces
together. That's not what he did though.

2924
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:45,310
He got better once you started
sparring again real, but no, no.

2925
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,980
He put the pieces together after 10 years.
He was a good fighter.

2926
02:46:47,981 --> 02:46:52,230
He was a slugger. When it is, is American
top team. That's a big one. It's huge.

2927
02:46:52,850 --> 02:46:55,880
He went to a real big gym and he
got really dedicated and you know,

2928
02:46:55,881 --> 02:46:59,450
he became a more mature man. You
know, he's in his thirties now.

2929
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:02,540
He's a real mature professional
athlete now. It's just,

2930
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:05,570
he was a wild motherfucker when he was
young, but now he's a real champion.

2931
02:47:05,571 --> 02:47:08,480
I mean Robbie trains like a fucking
champion and he always had the ability.

2932
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:10,160
He always had the mindset for sure.

2933
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:13,970
And now you're seeing just the fruits
of his Labor. He's just, he's grown up,

2934
02:47:13,971 --> 02:47:15,590
he's got a wife and a kid now.

2935
02:47:15,591 --> 02:47:19,700
It's a different animal and now he's a
totally different animal and he's, he's,

2936
02:47:19,701 --> 02:47:22,520
you know, he's coming out for blood,
man. He's coming out for blood.

2937
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:26,870
Jonny Andrews look good. Look real good,
good. Danowitz it didn't like that fight,

2938
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:30,560
but that's looked for guy to do that
to Matt Brown holding down like that.

2939
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,420
Beat him up like that.
Like I was impressed.

2940
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:35,540
I was impressed that that's how you're
supposed to fight when you can wrestle

2941
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:36,980
that way.
Why would you stay?

2942
02:47:36,981 --> 02:47:39,950
I mean everybody wants everybody
to fight in a way that's not smart.

2943
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:42,770
Like for a guy like Johnny Hendricks,
that's a smart way to fight. You.

2944
02:47:42,771 --> 02:47:45,980
Throw some punches on your feet, take
that motherfucker down anytime you want.

2945
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:48,640
Beat him up when he can.
And when you got a guy like Matt Brown,

2946
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:51,310
you better do that. She has
peaked. Did a federal judge. Yeah,

2947
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:54,470
but you just did it for years. You got
to do that with a guy like kind of brown.

2948
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,870
You wouldn't even stand up with
them. That's, that's crazy.

2949
02:47:57,370 --> 02:48:01,550
You have a huge advantage. If you
take him to the ground on your feet,

2950
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:05,000
you're pretty much dead. Even if you
just decided to slug it out with them.

2951
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:09,020
I mean Johnny might have more one punch
knockout power because Johnny had some

2952
02:48:09,021 --> 02:48:11,640
pretty crazy one punch knockout.
So when people go flying,

2953
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:14,960
like he's got magic in his hand.
Like that red hand from Kung Fu.

2954
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:20,330
Like he sends guys flying like
doesn't do it as much anymore.

2955
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:22,670
But like if you go back to some
of his highlight reel knockout,

2956
02:48:22,671 --> 02:48:26,390
it's like the John Fitch one or the
Martin Kampmann one. They go flying,

2957
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,390
he says blam he just cracks
him with that left hand.

2958
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:34,730
So you add that and then the boy tie
of Matt Brown, Matte Miles Nasty.

2959
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:38,450
You know Johnny might be able
to hit harder with one shot,

2960
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:42,410
but Matt Brown was knocked
some motherfuckers dead
too and he comes after you,

2961
02:48:42,411 --> 02:48:45,290
man. You know, if you just going to
stand with him and just trade with them.

2962
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:48,050
Robbie Lawler did it,
but Robbie Lawler's the fucking champ.

2963
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:52,060
You know he went five rounds with
Matt Brown and he's going to do Robbie

2964
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:55,260
Lawler's going to fight Rory Macdonald
again. That's going to be fucking crazy.

2965
02:48:55,280 --> 02:49:00,140
Was that? I think that's Hebrew.
Where? When is that? I'm not sure.

2966
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:04,910
I want to say. Hmm. I don't know man.

2967
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:12,270
Uh, 89 July 11th July.
Oh, okay. Jesus Christ.

2968
02:49:12,271 --> 02:49:14,420
That's the big one in Vegas.
Oh,

2969
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:18,690
what's July 11th that's the Big Vegas
coach, which was that? Who's done that?

2970
02:49:19,410 --> 02:49:23,940
Who's on that? Who was on that car? Jamie.

2971
02:49:25,790 --> 02:49:29,600
That's international fight week and
last week. Big One dude. Sub Dog. Wait,

2972
02:49:29,610 --> 02:49:34,160
that's a big one. So you know I
love it. That is a giant card.

2973
02:49:34,161 --> 02:49:38,240
That's the July card. Uconn
McGregor versus Josie Aldo. Who?

2974
02:49:38,241 --> 02:49:42,480
Jesus fucking Christ. That's right.
Oh good Lord. That's a fucking,

2975
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:45,030
I have an answer now. That's all
you have. That's all you need.

2976
02:49:45,070 --> 02:49:47,330
That's all you need this for that.

2977
02:49:47,331 --> 02:49:50,610
What are you going to put this already
sold out? As soon as it gets on sale,

2978
02:49:50,611 --> 02:49:52,440
it sold out the,

2979
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:55,590
they're going to the amount of people
that are going to come over from Ireland.

2980
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:58,050
There's going to be people watching
that shit. I'm close to her kid.

2981
02:49:58,230 --> 02:50:01,020
It's going to be all throughout the
Vegas is going to look like Ireland.

2982
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:04,230
It's going to be madness.
Madness.

2983
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:06,360
Nobody brings motherfuckers like that guy.

2984
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:10,740
That guy brings a lot of
fucking people to the fight.

2985
02:50:10,830 --> 02:50:13,650
Fuck Saint Paddy's Day.
Wow.

2986
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:18,570
Robbie Lawler and Rory Macdonald and
Josie Aldo and Conor McGregor on one car.

2987
02:50:18,750 --> 02:50:23,430
My God. Good Lord God. Keep
together. Please, please,

2988
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:29,310
please. You know, right now
it's march, April, May, June,

2989
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:32,130
three months for some bad shit
to happen to someone's knee.

2990
02:50:32,490 --> 02:50:37,490
Three months for somebody to get
put the kiss of death because

2991
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:45,090
the speech itself, it's interesting
like when this is happening too,

2992
02:50:45,091 --> 02:50:46,740
like what time in their career,
you know,

2993
02:50:46,741 --> 02:50:50,060
Mcgregor on the rise and all those
been a champ for a long time.

2994
02:50:50,090 --> 02:50:52,680
Like it's a good time.
If Mcgregor was gonna fight them,

2995
02:50:52,681 --> 02:50:55,770
now's a good time to fight him.
And he's had so many really tough fights.

2996
02:50:55,770 --> 02:51:00,420
Really wars, you know it's
fucking interesting fight man.

2997
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:01,530
Really interesting fight.

2998
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:06,420
And then Robin and Rory is going to
be interesting to map five rounds.

2999
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:09,510
You know, who knows what the fuck's
going to happen and that fight.

3000
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:12,890
Who knows what like strategy
Roy's gonna Employ Roy.

3001
02:51:12,891 --> 02:51:14,730
He apparently had something
wrong with his ankle.

3002
02:51:14,731 --> 02:51:16,860
He was talking about it when
he came in here for that fight.

3003
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:19,110
Couldn't move around as
much as he would like to.

3004
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:21,790
Stood right in front of Robbie
when wonder when he's going out,

3005
02:51:21,810 --> 02:51:24,450
how he's going to fight him
when they fight in July.

3006
02:51:25,650 --> 02:51:29,670
Cause you know he got a lot better
since then. Rory got a lot better.

3007
02:51:29,671 --> 02:51:31,920
Robbie got better since then.
They both got better.

3008
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:36,570
Ravi being the champ now he's
going to really have like,

3009
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:40,980
he's going to have a pretty significant
advantage as far as like confidence and

3010
02:51:40,981 --> 02:51:43,230
mindset.
Like having already beat him once,

3011
02:51:43,530 --> 02:51:46,710
beat him and hurt him and
then now also being the champ.

3012
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:49,590
But that doesn't mean anything
man. Rory, he's talented as shit.

3013
02:51:49,830 --> 02:51:54,030
He's a really fun guy to watch Roy
because he's such a student of fighting,

3014
02:51:54,390 --> 02:51:58,200
you know, he doesn't have like ridiculous
athleticism, ridiculous knockout power.

3015
02:51:58,201 --> 02:52:02,190
It just does everything great. Everything
he does is great, knows what to do.

3016
02:52:02,250 --> 02:52:06,040
It's foot works. Excellent.
Real smart about it. An

3017
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:09,160
interesting dude on the podcast too and
if you listen to the one that I did with

3018
02:52:09,161 --> 02:52:11,140
him, it's one of my
favorite ones with fighters.

3019
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:14,080
He's a real down to earth dudes
to totally honest about it too.

3020
02:52:14,740 --> 02:52:18,310
Like the way stairs down guys. Like, like
it looks like dead in the eyes and shit.

3021
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:19,031
And he's like,

3022
02:52:19,031 --> 02:52:21,910
well dude was staring at me and I
didn't want to turn away like a bitch.

3023
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:25,510
It's like, instead of sounding
like subset of a psycho, it's like,

3024
02:52:25,511 --> 02:52:26,860
well I guess that makes sense.

3025
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:33,010
What's the next Joey Diaz when he doing,
what do you got going on this weekend?

3026

3041
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:25,060

3042
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:28,000
I'm in town and go to San
Diego in about three weeks.

3043
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,100
I go to fuck and Tempe and I go
to Houston. Beautiful. You know,

3044
02:53:32,270 --> 02:53:34,770
and the month of April,
where are your dates up?

3045
02:53:34,771 --> 02:53:36,460
But they up at Jody has done that.

3046
02:53:36,461 --> 02:53:39,040
I put 'em up today because I
finally got everything together,

3047
02:53:39,041 --> 02:53:42,770
but I'm still got three or four
like I pop in. So just work with me,

3048

You Mad Flavor on Twitter?

3049
02:53:46,961 --> 02:53:49,930
The only person I know that doesn't
have his actual name as is Twitter.

3050
02:53:49,950 --> 02:53:52,400
Very important. Very important.
The reason why I came early,

3051
02:53:52,401 --> 02:53:56,940
it was to promote the last, uh, this is
not happening. What are reached your fear?

3052
02:53:56,941 --> 02:53:59,500
It's me and our, your
fear. I tell a story,

3053
02:53:59,501 --> 02:54:03,350
but my mom's friend who took care of me
after my mom died and I never gave her

3054
02:54:03,351 --> 02:54:08,290
any props and that's it.
Please just that's tomorrow
night DVR. Yeah. 11 o'clock.

3055
02:54:08,790 --> 02:54:11,680
Do what's the favorite? The last one
of the seasons, it's 1230. Right?

3056
02:54:11,681 --> 02:54:15,790
It's a different time.
1230 1230 eastern tomorrow.

3057
02:54:15,930 --> 02:54:18,670
It's the last season Joe did last weekend.

3058
02:54:19,780 --> 02:54:23,490
Please watch it and just kicked out of
the DV. I'll tell your neighbor, you know,

3059
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:26,500
if you have a direct TV,
it'll be on east coast time.

3060
02:54:26,590 --> 02:54:28,180
So if you're on comedy central,
Directv,

3061
02:54:28,210 --> 02:54:32,710
it'd be 9:30 PM if you will have a lot
of different cable companies will have it

3062
02:54:32,711 --> 02:54:34,240
on a regular west coast time,

3063
02:54:34,241 --> 02:54:38,800
which means it'll be 1230 and 1230 on the
east coast, aren't you? Fucks all right.

3064
02:54:38,801 --> 02:54:41,170
That's it. Can I love you?
Let me take it back later.

3065
02:54:45,330 --> 02:54:46,240
Red Bag.
