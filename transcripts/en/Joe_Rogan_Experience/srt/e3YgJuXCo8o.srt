1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,450
Gero going experience

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
[inaudible]

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,100
what?
What bitches we hear?

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,780
Yeah. Brian [inaudible]. Lisa gentlemen,
the one and only here. Good to be here.

5
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,200
Very excited when my favorite favorite
fucking human beings to ever walk the

6
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,520
face of the planet.
Thank you sir.

7
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,020
Can these here to join us at the
fucking birth of the apocalypse as it's

8
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:00,710
happening right before our eyes Steve,
build your canoes.

9
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,600
What the fuck is going on
man? I'm building canoes. I
live in Venice Bro. So I'm,

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm, I'm going to, I got to have a canoe
on, on the top of my roof there. Oh,

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,010
you really thinking about
getting something like
that. I don't know if I can,

12
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:13,040
who's going to save you buddy? Come
out, all that stuff. You should.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm always thinking real worst case
scenarios, but you live by the water.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,660
When you live by Venice,
you,

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,530
you really must take into account that
we just like Japan or on a fault line and

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,900
that should could happen here. That's
a fucking nine dude. A nine a nine.

17
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,010
We can't even wrap our heads
around what that means.

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,730
A nine is so video and I couldn't
believe how long it lasted.

19
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,120
Five minutes. Five minutes. That's
ridiculous. Five minutes at nine.

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,810
What would people, if people don't
know the Richter scale, how it works?

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,400
Every one point is 100% stronger
than the point before it. Right?

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,300
So 7.2 100% stronger than a 7.1.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,820
This was a not so crazy.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,560
This is the only that no human
beings have ever that are alive.

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,710
Have ever experienced that
before in recorded history? No,

26
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,560
not the biggest in recorded history with
the biggest that I think anybody that's

27
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,830
alive as ever experienced.
I believe it's the biggest Japan,

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,130
it guess it's the fifth or sixth biggest
earthquake in history and it's big.

29
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,820
The biggest one. Japan's
ever, I don't trust all that.

30
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,970
What happened were you doing with
divine sweaty. Okay. And when did you,

31
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,620
do you just change the volume side?
Is that better? Yeah. What'd you do?

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,980
I just turned down the is too high.
You know, I turned on the, Hey Joe,

33
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,620
I turned on the headphone volume cause
it's super loud in my headphones and the

34
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,820
only way I can uh, turn
down my headphones, it's
by turned on in your life.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,860
Look at him. He's denying trying
to keep it like, oh, all right.

36
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,220
You got a little tense really quick
quickly to knows how to he got I think I'm

37
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,870
sure. I'm sure. I think
I'm serving right now.

38
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,310
Just keep it together but everything's
fine. Just don't freak out.

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,290
Don't freak out. Brian said that the
most important thing to these things,

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,150
just let it happen to just go with it
buddy. By the way, have you shrimp lately?

41
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,500
It's been a few months.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
I haven't served in like eight years
because the last time I shermed I have

43
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:59,530
violently was shitting and puking at the
same time and tripping in the bathroom

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,010
for like

45
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,521
six hours.

46
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,580
It was a horrible experience so I have
been kind of nervous to do it again.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,180
Eight on the last night, most beautiful
thing in the whole entire road.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Like amazing.

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,180
There was parts I was with my friend
where I was looking at them and like their

50
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,960
faces, you could just feel the energy
coming from their face like visually.

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,823
It was amazing.

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,900
How much did you only ate half of eighth
and made it into a tea and did the ti

53
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,200
process where you,
you boil it and then,

54
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,160
and then you drink it and then he let
let sit for like another whatever,

55
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,100
30 minutes or whatever. And then you
ate those shrooms and it was awesome.

56
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,820
Why should I drink the tea?
And you chose so clean.

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,090
Ever tell you my shrimp
mushrooms experienced with
the last time I did shrooms

58
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,990
cause I was never a seasoned drug addict.
I was with Patty Murray. Patty. Sure.

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,340
So I take mushrooms and I eat a
lot of them cause man, I was like,

60
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,800
let me see what these
are like a cut to me.

61
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:54,390
I took a four hour shower and had,
I wept,

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,430
I laughed,
I reassessed my life and then I saw,

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,270
started seeing myself from the side.

64
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,370
I just started seeing my profile and I
was sitting on a wall looking down at me.

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
You know my profile and I was like,
here's a couple of problems.

66
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,090
My legs way too short for my torso.
Oh by the way,

67
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm a coat hanger. I've always
wanted to be a barrel chested Samoan.

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,470
I'm on a coat hanger
from a long line peasant,

69
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:23,910
an Irish stock who are used to
being persecuted, running, you know,

70
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:28,170
knobby knees. The whole thing
was a disaster. Genetics
are enough. Fair now man.

71
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:31,770
You look at some fucking football players,
some of those giant Goliath.

72
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,840
You could get a guy like check Congo,

73
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,870
like when you're standing next to
check Congo genetics and welfare.

74
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,080
There's dudes that are born like your
friend that we were talking about in the

75
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,170
kitchen. Your friend of your
doughy small, the feminist friend.

76
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,130
That guy just got to roll the dice.
It looks like an overgrown baby.

77
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,980
It's just a roll of the dice. Man.
He could've been checked Congo.

78
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,190
I know what the fuck.
I know I can be built to like any,

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,370
if I could have any jeans in the,
I'd want Samoan. Some Simone,

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,540
just big and they can take a punch to,
she's as Christ Mark Hunt.

81
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,590
He's a k one champion and he's now when
he's fighting in the UFC now he just won

82
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:07,260
his last fight and uh,
he's famous for it.

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,410
Dude's head kicking him and he just
fucking wobbles a little and then

84
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,100
straightens right back up. Loans come in,
they did a thing on, if you are Samoan,

85
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,960
you are 55 times.

86
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:19,680
I believe this was the number and it was
on 60 minutes and I believe they said

87
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:20,850
you're,
if you're Simone,

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,990
you are 55 times more
likely to play in the NFL.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,000
Any white guy on the planet.

90
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,330
There's so there's still fucking
strong Hong Gins that Lowery's and the,

91
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:37,410
and the Samoans. This just on
another giant bones like your wrists,

92
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,220
like elbows and fast,
like a lot of fast twitch muscle,

93
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,080
not this endurance muscle like,
oh yeah, it could have been like,

94
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,770
I knew his trainer dude,
he was so bad ass, but for
whatever reason, never really,

95
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:50,670
totally got it together.

96
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,300
Lennox Lewis beat them and that
took a lot of wind out of his sails.

97
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,450
Cause when it's tagged him a
couple times pretty hard. Well,

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,100
I know the guy that trained, uh, to

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,630
have for that fight for
the Lennox Lewis fight.

100
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,810
I've actually worked out with him and
he said that the first time I'd had ever

101
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,410
done, he never done a squat and I
believe, I don't want to misquote him,

102
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,130
but he didn't. He said he put four 20 on
his shoulders and he did a deep squat.

103
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:14,150
He went all the way down to where his
ass touching his heels and came back up

104
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,950
and the trainer was like, who
is a power lifter? It was like,

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,800
that's the craziest thing I've ever
seen in my life. You've never squatted.

106
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:23,450
He goes, no man. By the end of it, he
was like, they had that has two horses,

107
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,700
two dead horses to a bar. You know, he's,

108
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,970
he's one of the scariest heavyweight
boxers would come along in a long time.

109
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,820
He wasn't able to beat the best guys
that you never beat Lennox Lewis,

110
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,940
but he could,
he could put anybody to sleep.

111
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,480
Do you ever see the fight when he
fought John Ruiz? No. He caught John.

112
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,950
It's on youtube. He caught genre
is a very big man. Tough dude too.

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,110
You know he's a burly guy.

114
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,260
Didn't John Ridley's fight Holyfield
like three fucking times. Yeah,

115
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,890
I think he did. He was, he was rough
David too. We'll put them to sleep.

116
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:56,150
Dude just jumped on him early.
Hit him with those gigantic ham hocks.

117
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:00,530
Fix it. Hit him with like he tagged
them early and then just put them away.

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,090
Put them completely to sleep.
You know,

119
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,230
you wonder as more and more
money ventures in the MMA a lot.

120
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,050
Some of those guys who are playing
some of those Hershel Walker's and and,

121
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,960
and Michael Vick's, they're going
to start coming to MMA. Yeah.

122
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,200
Some of the guys who don't want
to, they don't want to, you know,

123
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,860
be playing for a team. They'd rather
fight footballs. Also ironically,

124
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,390
way more dangerous for you
then is any MMA career.

125
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,520
That's so funny that people dispute that,

126
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,860
but everyone looks at
it in an emotional way.

127
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,350
You don't look at it in a contact way.

128
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,890
Like look at these people are running
at each other and at 50 years old,

129
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,650
take a look at their heads.
I mean, it's not even,

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,160
it's not a little bit more dangerous.
It's way more way more dangers.

131
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,540
US fucking poor guys. Like that
kid was his name, Chris Henry,

132
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,850
the kid that fell off the back
of a pickup truck and died.

133
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,410
You remember he was a chasing after
his girlfriend. Receiver. Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,420
Really talented athlete.
Right. Well young kid I built,

135
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,350
I think he was only like 25, 25
or 20, I think it was 25. Anyway,

136
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,600
it's fucking massive brain
damage. When they went, did
an autopsy on him, you know,

137
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,750
the concussions and he's hands,

138
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,310
he's playing football actually shrinks
and all Kinda, you get dementia.

139
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,500
I mean that's what Lou
Gehrig's disease is all about.

140
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,300
I mean a lot of these guys are getting it.

141
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,200
It's all from head impacts
and just reparable damage.

142
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,840
Yeah. Cause it als or
Lou Gehrig's disease, um,

143
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,050
they used to think was a
function of toxin, a toxin.

144
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,890
They had all different kinds of theories,
but they're, they're starting to link,

145
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,390
they think they're starting to link
some of this stuff to the als syndrome,

146
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,160
whatever, to um, to, uh, um, yeah,

147
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,040
there was a whole Bryant Gumbel special
about it. It's scary stuff, man.

148
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,730
People take that real lightly, you know,
they take head trauma real lightly.

149
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,500
We don't, we're learning more and
more, I guess now and now, you know,

150
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,440
that really raises a huge question,
which is if,

151
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,850
if indeed you can start to prove that
for concussions or three concussions

152
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,220
caused brain damage, if
that's the case or, and, and

153
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,590
the, and if they're able
to actually measure this,

154
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,850
it will put a real onus on the NFL to
figure out a way to either change the

155
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:10,890
rules or make helmet safer, but then you
don't have football. Right. You know,

156
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,030
so it really,
it kind of,

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,570
it doesn't raise rugby's probably
safer because they don't wear helmets.

158
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,450
They tell me don't smash each other.

159
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,810
I went to a rugby match recently
actually in the south of France with a,

160
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,410
I think it was like the bask team with
the aim of trying to do now and even

161
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,400
international traveler.

162
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,660
I done an international sports
events to soccer and phones.

163
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,690
I seller in the south of tribes.
Of course. Yes. And, and uh,

164
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,470
I wish I could speak that way.
How would it be that, that,

165
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,900
that really pretentious man, you
know, compared to a lot of people,

166
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:44,610
what you just said was that,
yeah,

167
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,660
I didn't even me I'm talking about I go
to a soccer game and France like what?

168
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,260
Two things I don't need
plugged in tight shorts.

169
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,590
Thing I noticed was that there that
they're just as, they're a huge men,

170
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,270
a lot of Samoans, just huge dudes.
Shrug the players. Starts by the way,

171
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:07,910
really overseeing that thing that
they do that and know that dance,

172
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,940
they dance at the Haka.
Holy Shit Dude.

173
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,890
That's the New Zealand all blacks.
It's my favorite thing.

174
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,690
Did you see ever see
the black and white one?

175
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,190
There's a black and white one of them.

176
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,100
I've seen every one of them more than
it does to me. It's like an Adidas had,

177
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:24,270
is that what it is? Fuck. It's good.
Have you ever seen that? If go go,

178
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,290
if you're listening to this, go
to do a Haka dance, New Zealand,

179
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,740
all blacks and, and there are so many
of them, and take a look at that day.

180
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,960
It's a war dance and they'd been
doing it since the 18 hundreds, uh,

181
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,370
and it's carried on as a tradition
and they take it seriously. Dope.

182
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,700
It would think it's stupid.
Like, what is this dumb ass shit?

183
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,810
I got a really good one for. You can
see this one too. Freaks. He's just,

184
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,440
he just literally just
freaks they, they've worked
themselves into a frenzy, man.

185
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,020
Yeah, it's a, it's a fascinating thing to
watch. It's fun. It looks like it's real.

186
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,820
You know what I mean?
Like they're going crazy,

187
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,160
but it's not like I don't
feel like you're faking it.

188
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,230
I feel like that's what they're thinking.
That's in their heart.

189
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,670
I believe him and Jimmy,
Jimmy Burke, by the way,

190
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,260
our dear friend Jimmy Burke from New York,

191
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,080
I got in a fight and my friend got in a
fight with a guy cause he told the guy,

192
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:14,430
he looked like a combination of Rudolph
Nureyev and uh, uh, he was this big guy,

193
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,990
walks out and goes, he was drunk. Goes
Dude, you look like Rudolph Nureyev and,

194
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,410
and some other old actor and
something that like, you know,

195
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,600
I don't know like Clark Gable or,
and the guy's like,

196
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,610
why did it goes and then he comes
back and he goes, what'd you say?

197
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,560
I look like it goes Uday up cause
he, cause he has, he walked out,

198
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,070
he goes, he had rid of Nerd, he was a gay
dance or gay dance. I think that means,

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,370
but anyway, and the guy
goes, what looks back?

200
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:39,830
And he comes back and he goes, what would
you say? I look like that's gay woo woo.

201
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,500
Anyway, the guy takes his, Jack
goes, let's go outside right now.

202
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,460
So chimney goes out there and my buddy
juries with them and he and he says to

203
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:51,390
Jerry, whispers to everything I do. It's
like January. He takes his shirt off,

204
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:55,000
he's got no shirt on, it's freezing. He
starts doing the Haka dance at the dude,

205
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,810
but he's not looking at the guy
and the guy starts to flip in.

206
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,130
The bounces are holding them back
and Jimmy never looked at it.

207
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:06,131
We just did the Haka dance but made a
really sexual sexual Haka dance and he was

208
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:13,090
like, Hey, Hey da, and he's not looking
at him and flexing basically posing.

209
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,330
You have to explain this Guy Jimmy
Burke for this story to really work.

210
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,810
You tell us about a normal person
and you're going to be like,

211
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,580
what the fuck are you talking about?
That doesn't even,

212
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,340
I can't even make sense out of that.
Like did someone would judge me.

213
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,160
Burke is 50 years old. He's ease.
We call them the national treasure.

214
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,640
He's got a very long neck.
He's got very red skin.

215
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,710
He's got no eyebrows and very,

216
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,010
very one of my favorite fucking
Jimmy Burke lines ever. He goes,

217
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:40,000
I ran into her accidentally. She
thought I was stalking her. She goes,

218
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,370
he's talking to me. I'm like,
believe me, honey, if I,

219
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,950
if I was stalking you wouldn't be
caught me and I have stalked her

220
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,970
and I have stock. That was a
good fucking funny, that guy.

221
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,870
Funniest, craziest. I got it for
the impression at the beginning,

222
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,900
but then I lost it. I need to be around
him more. I need to see that guy.

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm going to be in New York.
He's battery,

224
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,290
very enthusiastic.

225
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,310
He really moves his mouth and by the way,

226
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,540
by the way, he's a very good shape.
Very good. You know, they hold it,

227
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,210
hold. That map was in very good shape and
weight. If you're reacting, you're like,

228
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,190
oh, he does. He does.

229
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,930
He makes children cry
because he loves kids.

230
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,910
He's like, Woo. And sure enough,

231
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,020
shining babies, like four year
olds are like, he's like, he,

232
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,200
and then he looked at me one time,

233
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,890
he went down to the baby and I was
laying and he's going, oh sure it off.

234
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm like, one, two, three.
It takes three seconds.

235
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,510
He pulled the slide.
I look like skeletor.

236
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,890
It looked like a red scout and he
looks at the mother. He goes, he goes,

237
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm so sorry. And his face looks
like it's plasticine. What?

238
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,050
He says that if you know him, it doesn't
make you uncomfortable. But if God,

239
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,480
if I did know him and there was
a guy like that, I'd be like,

240
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,420
what does this loose cannon?
I can't predict what he might do.

241
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,940
I might do something nutty. He
did this. How about this? He,

242
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:14,290
I'm saying this a podcast. I hope he's
listening. I literally, um, he, he,

243
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,610
first of all, he, he rides
his bike everywhere. He,

244
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,890
he's 50 on a bicycle on a TV and that's
all he said. And that's all he wants.

245
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,660
He's like, how he's always been, he's a
monk. He's a true monk. And uh, and he,

246
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,360
and he's in better shape than anybody
in the world. He says, come downstairs.

247
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,540
I'm on 57th and eighth and ninth,
and my mother's apartment. He goes,

248
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,750
it's literally 12 at night in New York
City on like Christmas Eve or around

249
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,940
Christmas, you know, where everybody's
on the street, you know, it's everyone.

250
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,190
And he goes, come downstairs.
I have to show you something.

251
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,670
Come down in five minutes, click. I
go, all right, this should be good.

252
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,310
Throwing my coat. I got off stage.
I'm standing with the doorman outside.

253
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,620
I hear from a long, long way
away. Ah, um, um, uh, uh,

254
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,480
a tape deck, the halls with
balls up, holiday. [inaudible]

255
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,250
and he's rides by me
and I in a down jacket,

256
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,810
cowboy hat and no pants,
no pants.

257
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,470
And he's writing, he's popping with
his ass in the air. And I see this,

258
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,940
this dead baby bird, this,
this, this, and this. This pad,

259
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,770
what it looked like, a large
boy. Just say, you know, he's
gonna, he's home, but he's,

260
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,210
it's just the no heroin. He's got a little
red hairs on it and it's a disaster.

261
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,050
The whole thing. And this white body,
he sees me on white neon, like Irish,

262
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,250
like though, like lost the picnic. I'm
like Gollum, loss of pigment lottery.

263
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:34,610
He gets into his son, he starts smoking
literally. He was like a vampire,

264
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,420
I swear to God. So he's
got this incredible, and he
just, and this woman goes,

265
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,600
he's coming this way. He's
coming in sweat. He goes,

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,290
Chris Smith's man.

267
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,410
And literally I just see he bikes by
in his ass and I see his two balls,

268
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,490
his 50 year old balls just just swinging
like a pendulum outside. And she,

269
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,760
the woman goes, he's coming this way.
He's coming this way. He, she goes,

270
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,690
she goes and screams at him and he goes,
have a great time.

271
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,800
It turns back around and try us
back a block near to Jesus Christ.

272
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,710
He is a streaker man.
What is he doing for living in these days?

273
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:10,910
He still acts and you know, he
said he does. He does. Funny.

274
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,100
He's got really rich friends too who
all want him around. So please come,

275
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,960
come on the trip. It's a private jet.
We'll take anywhere. He's like, all right.

276
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
That's the thing about Joe.
He heals very few people in the world,

277
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:26,120
especially when they get there. And
I can do this, can be like, dude,

278
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:30,920
you want to go to a Tibet, Tibet,
alright, no plans, nothing,

279
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,740
nothing, nothing. And what does
it do? Just cause clients, hey,

280
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:37,280
I'm not going to train you this week
or not or not. He just goes to Tibet.

281
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,570
It doesn't say anything to that. And
then they show up at their appointments.

282
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,380
What's his dad? So he goes all over the
world for free. He's such an odd duck man.

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,430
This, I've always admired how, how,
what, what a free spirit he is.

284
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,880
But also like how like you always
think like guys like that are going to,

285
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,271
you know,

286
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,380
some point in time at least make an
attempt to appear to have their shit

287
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,540
together. No, he knows.
He's an amazing guy.

288
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,150
And I'm going to tell you
the other thing he is,

289
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:05,420
is he's truly made peace with like with
his true atheists, like a real atheist,

290
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,410
truly made peace with the fact that he
is only here for a short period of time

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,370
and he's, he's dying to him is
not something he's afraid of.

292
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,020
He came down with tuberculosis,

293
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,720
but they didn't know what it was
cause he had been exposed to it by his

294
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,720
grandfather when he was
three years old. Oh, he's,

295
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,580
he starts going to the hospital and they,
I get a call,

296
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,480
my buddy says they're looking at it,

297
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,940
they think as lung cancer or
that disease that those nine one,

298
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,700
one firemen get that where your
lungs disintegrate from breathing,

299
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,280
all that stuff. I have the
one, they're both fail. So,

300
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:34,520
and they're looking for it and they tell
them, look, this is probably what it is.

301
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,690
And I was with him when it was shortly
after he knew all that you would never

302
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,450
have known and it's not
denial. He said to me, he goes,

303
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,300
he told me what the prognosis was. And
I was like, Jesus, my best friends.

304
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,480
I was like, this is the worst thing.
And he said, I said, how do you feel?

305
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,980
You seem so normally. He goes,
Brian, first of all, if I'm

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,940
going to die, I'm going to treat it
like it's a comedy. And Oh, by the way,

307
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,720
my funeral better be a good time and
you better make people laugh. Oh.

308
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,390
And by the way, I've made peace
with my life. I'm not afraid to die.

309
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,850
And I saw that firsthand, which
I thought it was just, you know,

310
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:06,700
he's just an amazing guy. He's got a good
grip on things in a weird way, you know,

311
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,930
he reads everything. He knows
that. I mean, he knows so
much. Very, very bright guy.

312
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,661
That's why it's,

313
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:15,590
it's so strange that guys like that
almost always in somehow or another they

314
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,770
fall into some, at least a semblance of
normalcy. Yeah. You know what I mean?

315
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,640
Like they don't, they're not 50 with an
apartment and a TV and a bike, you know,

316
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:26,310
like you try to get your shit together,
you try it, you run a house somewhere.

317
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:31,140
Yeah. Yeah. We've got a house now looking
to buy, but you know, anywhere which he,

318
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,450
he, he never, he never
was. He's never been.

319
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,030
And it's not like anything is
self conscious about either? No.

320
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,490
Is this guy ticketless? Uh, I don't know.
Let's find out. Brian. I don't know.

321
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,020
Brian got some time this weekend and
just see what Gilbert Godfrey said, uh,

322
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,380
about Japan. Yeah. What do
you, what do you guys think
about that? Have you seen it?

323
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, let's read the quotes,
the quotes Gilbert got, right.

324
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,140
Yeah. To me it was like, all
right, that's, that's not
even trying to be like, ah,

325
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,200
edgy or like, I don't know what he's
thinking. He's pretty funny. Yeah. I mean,

326
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,860
but still, I don't even think that's even
to me. Yeah. Too soon. What did you think?

327
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,910
What did you think of?
I was so,

328
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,150
I just thought definitely does he realize
how many people died and how many kids

329
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,700
died? How many fucking,
you know, seriously,

330
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,490
if there's time where you should just
not do anything and there's definitely,

331
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,230
I think a time period,
you know?

332
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,250
Wow. Yeah. I don't, I don't
try to stay anything like that.

333
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,570
I mean,
that's what it felt.

334
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm not fucking raising
flags and protesting and
anytime that's fair to to be

335
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,900
con, I think we should all be more
conscious of people's feelings.

336
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:34,490
It's 50 cents a 50 censored a look.
This is very serious people.

337
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:38,180
I had to evacuate all my hoes from La,
Hawaii and Japan.

338
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,800
I had to do it. Lol. He gets points
up until the lol. That's right.

339
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,480
First of all, because lol, lol.
Especially when you have the,

340
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,040
just the first letter capitalized
and then the next one,

341
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,490
not that looks really fucking stupid
dog. Alright, that looks dumb.

342
00:19:55,491 --> 00:20:00,320
Either you go with all caps or no caps
with your lol. Okay. Second of all,

343
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,150
are you a girl? No. Then
what's with the lol? Listen,

344
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,320
that's for girls and retards.
That's what lol is for or,

345
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,130
but the, the idea behind it, you know,

346
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:17,660
that you just started immediately making
jokes about all these poor fucking

347
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,770
people they're going to hit
next and that kind of stuff.

348
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,180
I don't have a problem with people making
jokes about it. Why wait? You know,

349
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,650
I don't know. I think what he said was
hilarious. I had evacuated all my hoes.

350
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,230
I mean, come on. That's fucking
funny. Since one was fine
with me. What, what did, uh,

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,260
coffee, sir. Okay. You had a much
more Gilbert Godfrey. Let's see.

352
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,580
Let's see what his tweet said.
Gilbert Godfrey's tweets where uh, oh,

353
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,880
the not even shown them, man.
They covered him up. Well,

354
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,730
it's not in this one. One
way go. Our stories, whether
or not one was kind of like,

355
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,110
hey, my girlfriend broke up with me, don't
worry. Another one will float by soon,

356
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:59,620
or something like that. I
can't find them. Unfortunately.

357
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,980
I think some asking, you're trying to be
funny. Sometimes things can go awry. Yeah,

358
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:09,700
well, I mean he's just a silly guy.
You know, he's a silly guy who,

359
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,830
who's funny and then,
yeah,

360
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,840
but that's something you say to your
friends maybe a couple of times.

361
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,830
I've laughed harder with that guy.

362
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,780
We did an episode of CSI together and we
just had the most off color fund in the

363
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,800
world,
but it was also,

364
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,070
you also got to understand the mentality
of the New York comedian were newer

365
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,000
comics are always trying to over
insult you to the point of being.

366
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,590
He just completely outrageous.

367
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,540
Like Jim Norton told a really funny
story on Opie and Anthony About Louis C K

368
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:44,260
and him hanging out and the in the village
and Lucy Kay just walks up to him and

369
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,080
slaps his pizza onto the ground and says,

370
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,630
your mother's a cunt like out of nowhere.

371
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,860
And Andy and Jim Norton is laughing.
While he's telling us and he's just like,

372
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,260
I was it juicy slice of pizza too.
I was so bad.

373
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,770
But it's like I read you the
text that will us and to me,

374
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:01,780
cause we have a relationship
like that where he just,

375
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,350
we tried to reach southeast
trash and making salt each other.

376
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,300
They'll worst we can.
He started calling me a mule and just,

377
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,840
and he sends me the most outrageous texts.

378
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,980
I can't even describe those relationships
with friends like that are fun.

379
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,180
Like people don't understand.

380
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,080
You try to get like Eddie Bravo and I
do that shit to each other all the time.

381
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,180
Go ahead and get [inaudible]. But anyway,
Gilbert Gottfried is in, you know,

382
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,520
he's a comic and when you're a comic,

383
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,850
you mean sometimes you're right shit and
you're writing shit really for people

384
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,040
like you and for fucking Gilbert,

385
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,570
if he was at home and he was
reading someone's Twitter
and he started saying all

386
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,510
this shit about Japan,
he would be laughing his fucking ass off.

387
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,610
It doesn't mean that
he's not a sensitive guy.

388
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,880
It doesn't mean that he doesn't feel
bad for all these people. It's just,

389
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,700
it's also funny. Well, I called
them one time I was doing,

390
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
but have you ever seen a little
Asian girl cry? It's so adorable.

391
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,240
And now times that by millions and it'll
Gilbert Godfrey, he's going over there.

392
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,840
No, listen man, I actually think
it's right to say those things,

393
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,330
but I think it's funny to
Gilbert. It's funny stuff. I mean,

394
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,910
it's funny to me to look, I feel
terrible about what happened in Japan,

395
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:10,390
but those were still good
jokes and you know, he's,
he's, yeah, they're good jokes,

396
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,380
but not good judge. Maybe depending your
Twitter. No, listen, I wouldn't say them.

397
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,180
I wouldn't say him for a
bunch of reason that says,

398
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,730
I wouldn't want to say anything that
would hurt anybody's feelings like that.

399
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,780
Especially someone who
just randomly got go.

400
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,950
I don't care how funny the joke is
to make, I don't think, but that's,

401
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,100
I don't think Gilbert is a Kinda guy.
Whoever,

402
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,840
he's not gonna no sacred cows
to him. He's one, he's gonna,

403
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,540
he's gonna say the joke and he's
a good guy. He's not a bad guy.

404
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,970
It's just that he's looking for the laugh.

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,810
There's a laugh there and he sees it
and as a comic you just goes for it and

406
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,150
then you know,
people freak out and get upset about it.

407
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:43,960
I'm sure he probably never expected, he's
from the age of no Internet, you know,

408
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:45,980
he's from the age where you
could say anything you wanted.

409
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,710
So you know those guys
they developed that way.

410
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,570
You forget how many people are not
into what you're talking about. Right.

411
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,160
You know, and that's what it
becomes. Yeah, it's, it's okay.

412
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,400
The only problem was that he's
a commercial artist as well.

413
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,820
He does commercials and
that that's what fucked him.

414
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,950
They pulled him off of a
campaign because you know, look,

415
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,490
obviously this is a terrible
tragedy, you know, and no one's,

416
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,380
no one's trying to make light of that,

417
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,250
but can't you can't you both mourn
for the people and laugh too.

418
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,900
Is that possible? And I was going to
say this is what I was going to say is,

419
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:20,030
is that, you know, for the
most part, I think in tragedy,

420
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:23,000
that's exactly what you need it.
The last thing,

421
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,640
somebody who's going through a tragedy
needs is a bunch of other people acting

422
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,810
really somber around that suppressing
happiness and laughter. And it's not,

423
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:32,360
I'm not saying that, you know, you
should be happy that that happened.

424
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,400
Of course not, but shouldn't, you know,

425
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,450
shouldn't we try to be the happiest we can
at all times? Always. Absolutely. And I,

426
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,960
and I think there's
always room for humor and,

427
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:44,360
and it does take some of the sting
out of it if I that's it's very soon.

428
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:47,660
But it rethink about how a lot of
times you do deal with, with things,

429
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:51,070
you start marking when you're
actually over something by how,

430
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,660
how easily you can make fun of it
and how easily you can take those.

431
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,290
So sometimes you're pushing
that too quickly obviously.

432
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:02,240
And I think there is a time to reflect
and be [inaudible] I think. But I agree.

433
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,300
But there's something to people about
making a joke about a situation as to not

434
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:12,290
being able to feel for the people
that, that, that are in that situation.

435
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,020
And it's not, it's just that
it got, it's so far removed,

436
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,040
it's way over there that he doesn't even
think about it. He just says the joke.

437
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,920
Right. I mean, I would never do it
and I know you would never do it,

438
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:26,510
but he's just a comic man. That's
what they do. And a good one.

439
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,570
And he's a comic that's like known for
saying like the most offensive one time I

440
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,850
was doing, I do every year I
do the uh, Doris Roberts, uh,

441
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,720
children with AIDS benefit. So we do
stand up. Kevin James does it sometimes.

442
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:42,370
It's a good time. Sarah Silverman and we
got up, we do, you know, 20 minutes in,

443
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:45,020
in this big thing. And I called
Gilbert to see if you wanted to do it.

444
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,890
And Gilbert Gilbert's a great, you
know, and I know him and he's, and he,

445
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:52,640
but he just kept going, fuck that
children and I go, no, but I said,

446
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:57,110
it's a benefit for it go
that Chels ran and ran.

447
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,220
I think he wouldn't stop saying that
until I finally had to hey, I was like,

448
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:01,870
oh fuck.

449
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,960
So He seems like when he's on Howard
stern that he very rarely has a real

450
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:09,590
conversation. Right. What
if this has to be funny?

451
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,820
What did the same shit happened in
California though? You're right,

452
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,040
and then he did a joke about how much
money we lost half of your friends.

453
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,460
You're right. You're right. You're in a
totally different with no, no, no. Right.

454
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:22,070
You're right.
There are guys in Japan and England.

455
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:23,270
Everyone else that wouldn't be saying,

456
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,720
I mean I agree with
you that it would hurt,

457
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,690
but I don't agree with you that he
shouldn't be able to say it. No,

458
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,580
you should say it,
but you see,

459
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,560
you put it on your Twitter and
openly almost brag like, look,

460
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:37,540
I'm being fucking edgy. I think he may
know you're pushing it in your face.

461
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,500
Like almost like being,

462
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,930
I think Gilbert told me
I had miscalculated and
made an error in judgment.

463
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,070
That's what twice he did
it twice or three times.

464
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,970
He did three different tweets. He
did a bunch of them. Yeah. All right.

465
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,190
He took them down. Unfortunately, I
don't think it's the mother on TMZ.

466
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,050
If anyone's looking for them,
they're on TMZ is website.

467
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,210
I think the second or third
page, I mean, you know,

468
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,110
I like Gilbert and I don't think he means
what he says and I think he was just

469
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:02,210
paying a comic. Yeah, and probably
just push the envelope a little. Oh,

470
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,890
we're apologists. So let me read it.
He's really good on Jay. Like here's,

471
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:08,340
here's what will Sasso wrote to
me. This is literally like, I just,

472
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,850
I'm just doing minding my own business
and I get this text from him and this is

473
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:15,390
our relationship and to speaking of kind
of being able to joke around, he goes,

474
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,100
you're a fucking meat pod. I go,
what? What's a meat? Patty goes,

475
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:23,640
AF, fucking anthropods made a
meat. You're a fucking hero.

476
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,810
You're a fucking all fours walking
meat. Puppet. Hey, meaty, meaty mule.

477
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,820
But it hang your slack face.
True.

478
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,310
Townline I can't even how you Mosey
around on all fours turned the Muli go

479
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:41,250
round. Hey Mule, get over here
and lick these. My town of my ass.

480
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,190
You guys sound like you're queer for
each other. Well, let me read this.

481
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,520
Jay Gilbert. Godfrey depend things. So
you're like a little child over there.

482
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,750
Here's one. Japan is really
advanced. They don't go to the beach.

483
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:55,110
The beach comes to them.
I just split up with my girlfriend.

484
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:58,680
But like the Japanese say there'll be
another one floating by any minute now.

485
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,700
Wow. That one's fucked up.
You know? But whatever, man,

486
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,900
if you're going to want these guys to
say fucked up shit about other things,

487
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:10,530
you're going to accept it
when it's something that you
know that either is close

488
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:13,670
to home or hurt your feelings
or, or you feel, I feel bad.

489
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,690
I absolutely feel bad
for the people that had,

490
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:18,930
if they had to hear those jokes and they
lost someone over there, absolutely.

491
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,980
It's terrible. But you
know, fuck. Is it worse?

492
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,860
The joke is the joke actually
make the idea of, I mean,

493
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,020
how could you hurt anybody
worse than losing a loved one?

494
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,570
There's nothing worse than a
joke is not gonna make it worse.

495
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,330
I was thinking about that just
to have your children, whatever.

496
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:39,150
It just washed away. Washed
dude. I watched some of those
videos. It's so terrible.

497
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:39,931
Some of those videos,

498
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,800
there's the initial video where it breaks
the wall and you see these boats come

499
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:44,910
over the top of this wall,

500
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:49,470
the seawall and start smashing through
houses and it's like, whoa man.

501
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:53,460
Like that is, it's unbelievable.
It's such heavy duty fury.

502
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:57,560
And then he realized how much fucking
water is there out there. It's an ocean,

503
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,860
dammit. Why would you live so
close to the ocean? You know,

504
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:02,850
like I was in Malibu this weekend.
We went to the,

505
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:06,150
there's a place called Malibu seafood
were nice place for, uh, you know,

506
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:10,650
like this is a good little fresh seafood
place in Malibu. And as we were driving,

507
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:13,400
I was looking at all these houses that
are like right on the beach and they're

508
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,280
ridiculously expensive. You know, for a
little tiny ass house it'd be like five,

509
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:21,620
6 million bucks, but they're really
expensive in Malibu and malleable.

510
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,180
And I'm like, wait a minute,
they're on the beach.

511
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,870
Like what kind of trust to you
fuckers have you got trusted?

512
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,000
That shit's going to stay there.
Like,

513
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,720
I remember the first
time I ever was in a car,

514
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:38,721
Hi Eddie Bravo was driving and we were
in Redondo beach and we were going over

515
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:43,390
this edge of this hill and I look off to
the left hand side and I see the ocean

516
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:47,750
and it was the first time it ever occurred
to me how much fucking water that is

517
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,950
just sitting right there. What we saw, the
Japan Japanese thing was just a little,

518
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,920
it was just like it moved
in and sleep like the ocean.

519
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,580
Just how amazing was this videos, by
the way, the houses just start just,

520
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,340
I mean incredible, right? It makes you

521
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,250
really realize what could happen if,
say there was a like a,

522
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,310
an asteroid impact or you know,

523
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,460
the Canary Islands that the east coast
has to worry about the Canary Islands

524
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,640
because apparently there's a volcanic
shelf that if it drops off and it will,

525
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,770
and it has in the past,
drops off into the ocean,

526
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,000
it will cause a fucking tidal
wave that will drown everyone.

527
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,950
A myelin on the east coast.

528
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,130
The whole northeast coast is just going
to get fucking slammed with this insane

529
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,660
amount of water. You know,
it's weird. Is that I, when,

530
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:38,280
when I watched that that wave come
through, I was, I thought, you know,

531
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,430
if the houses could withstand it sort of,
I mean they just go under locked,

532
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,620
you know what I know,
but instead it got all just up.

533
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,130
Even like telephone poles got up the
mass of that water is something I don't

534
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,220
exactly push. Yes. It's like a huge, like,

535
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,670
like the thing like the blob or whatever
that, right, right, right. Yeah.

536
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,300
Absorbs everything. Yeah. It's, it's, I
mean it's got fucking cars and ours. Yeah.

537
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,910
It's like a huge, like, um,

538
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,590
meet Masha stuffed and there's
so much energy behind it. I mean,

539
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:11,950
didn't they say that the tsunami wave
is traveling something like 500 miles an

540
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:12,820
hour?
I think when,

541
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,790
when once they get an earthquake on
the sh on the bottom of the ocean,

542
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,140
the ripple effect can be as fast
as six. They, I guess it's, yeah,

543
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,330
as long as I can start
underwater that, that fast. Like,
fuck, man, it's just energy.

544
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:28,930
I guess they said it created a,
a breach that was,

545
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,090
or I don't know what the
word they use to describe it,

546
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,490
but 50 miles wide and 270 miles long.
That's how,

547
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,330
how much moved on the bottom
of the earth's surface.

548
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,220
That's like those rogue waves when
you're on a cruise, the Horse,

549
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,370
he knows sometimes pluck a cruise
ship. Dude, fuck that fuck that.

550
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:49,550
I hated when I was on a creation
that scares the shit out like that.

551
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,010
Here's what I think about on cruises.

552
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:56,170
What a perfect way for a
maniac to randomly kill
Peter's throwing people off the

553
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:58,020
boat.
Do you think,

554
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,830
I've been on cruises at 12 at night noise
on that deck and at least on the boat

555
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,870
they don't have movies.
What's that shit called?

556
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,090
What's that shit called?

557
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,780
Where they say that people on boats
sometimes like gaze out into the ocean and

558
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:16,410
just jump off for some reason. Like
there's like a term for retard. No,

559
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,840
it they call it like oceans a
dream or something like that.

560
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:23,240
Like they get trapped by all
night. Yeah. And it's probably,

561
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,190
I always thought like it's
probably doesn't exist.

562
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:28,940
That condition is just people
getting murdered in another ocean.

563
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,170
The Odyssey though with the
Odyssey when at this year

564
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,790
hell is not to look at the sirens or
not to heat, listen to the sirens.

565
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,830
Because if you listen to them, you'll
jump in the water and try to, you'll,

566
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,800
you'll try to call them and then you,
you drown.

567
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,010
And a lot of the men didn't
cover up. Cover up their
ears. Yeah, it was the sirens.

568
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:49,850
And isn't there a Celtic myth
about something like that as well?

569
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,350
What was the o brother where art thou?
When the women in the water, they sirens.

570
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,870
What does that what they
were, no, they were like,

571
00:32:56,871 --> 00:33:00,340
they were like temptresses I
love me. Those are great. Stop.

572
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,420
The Coen brothers are the best.
Right?

573
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,280
I forgive them even for movies that end
with no ending because I loved when they

574
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:11,730
just do weird shit. They just
take chances. Barton Fink. Yeah.

575
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,530
Great movie with John.
John Goodman and John Turturro to Fargo.

576
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,160
Man still holds up. Go back
and watch this. Oh yeah.

577
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,000
What the fuck bro? Alphas
good. I was that last night.

578
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,650
That doesn't have anything to do
with what we're talking about.

579
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,080
I've never seen alpha. I
can't, I can't comment on it.

580
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:28,430
I haven't told Pharos hilarious.

581
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,210
You know what I did see I went to see
red riding hood because of a fucking

582
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,270
completely fixated on where it with a,

583
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm friends with the director of
Red Riding Hood. Really? Really?

584
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:41,760
Your friends with the chick who directed
twilight, you wearing a tampon and play.

585
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,220
Now I don't know where their
husband or their boyfriend. Jamie.

586
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,230
Could you guys talk twilight and did we,

587
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,390
did you ask her a series questions and
retained you enjoyed the movie. Okay. Now,

588
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,840
um,

589
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,840
do you think that they really love
each other or for me like I felt that,

590
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,190
but I just, he's a fan. Tell me,

591
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,240
please tell me that you got an insincere
conversation with the woman who was the

592
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,690
director of twilight about
how great the movie was. No,

593
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,960
we actually ended up playing running
charades. Please tell me. I wish I had,

594
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,130
she's cool man.
She's really,

595
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,370
I actually watched the first toilet
and I didn't have a problem with it.

596
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,490
I was like, well, it's not a bad movie,
but there's been way worse movies.

597
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:24,320
It's not for me. It's not my generation.
It's for children. The second one,

598
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,070
the book's amazing,
Kendall,

599
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:34,070
try to lift the boat. I got to the, I
think it was the second one. I was like,

600
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:38,450
all right, this is getting
fucking dumb. Yeah. This, they
dropped off substantially.

601
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,950
Second first one was pretty decent and
good job capturing that teenage anx,

602
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,330
that Achy love.
Yeah.

603
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,450
It's like an Achy love sorta horror
movie was kind of like Achy love,

604
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:51,530
but more exciting than the usual
whiny bullshit. Kristen Stewart.

605
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,540
I don't know what it is about her,
but I just wanted to, you know,

606
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:58,130
she's my friend John's daughter. Really?
Yeah. Jon Stewart was, uh, the, uh, the,

607
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,550
I guess, I don't know his actual
position. Assistant Director,

608
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:05,600
I guess on a fear factor. He was the
guy who organized everything on a sat.

609
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:09,590
He said, great, super pro. He's
one of these guys, talks like this.

610
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,000
We got you over there, buddy. Have a seat.

611
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,720
We'll be get shade and five get to you in
five just always on the ball, you know,

612
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,910
juggles the whole shit
like a fucking champion.

613
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,210
Like we had a bunch of people that did
that job and they will all stumbled and

614
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:24,170
fucked up and people, it's just too much
work. But this guy is like an old pro.

615
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,040
He's been around forever.

616
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,980
And he was telling me about his daughter
doing some movie with Jodie foster.

617
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:31,280
I'm like, Yo, why are you linking your
daughter act? I know. What's that about?

618
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,930
And then meanwhile listen to me,

619
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,200
I mean his daughters now is like one of
the most famous actresses in the fucking

620
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,500
world and you know,

621
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,950
she's probably made enough money to
retire for the rest of our lives making a

622
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,960
lot of money. She's so
pretty. Something about her.

623
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,720
I just find so like she doesn't try,
she's just,

624
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,260
she doesn't really even wear makeup. She
just, she just is. So just so you know,

625
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:52,590
there's so much to be said for people
who can just be present and not,

626
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,780
not try to do anything and
not try to be [inaudible].

627
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,280
Before we start any
conversation about a girl,

628
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:02,970
I have to tell you that you know that
you are always attracted to girls that

629
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,140
look like then me cry.

630
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,630
You're the guy who comes over and the
girl is standing out in the rain and you

631
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,470
and she looks like she's going
to cry and you're like, hey,

632
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:21,471
look what I found [inaudible] you let me
get on my horse and ride over there and

633
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:26,190
saving the Damsel. Loved
that. That's the best.

634
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,500
That's the funniest and best
way to describe, uh, Giovanni,

635
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,670
you and I have talked about this many
times, but you'd never said I've had to,

636
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:35,520
I had to rescue you a few times.
I had to

637
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,170
actively ignored you a couple times,
which almost cost me my house.

638
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,990
There was one time where I ran into Brian
and Brian and I were in Hollywood and

639
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:46,261
he said,
Oh,

640
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm going to bring this girl bothered
them date and I would love to see it.

641
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,500
And she goes, hi, nice to meet you. And
I shake her hand, look at him. I go,

642
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,590
come here for a second. And
I go, well, let's take them
outside. I go, listen to me.

643
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,880
I go, she's crossing crazy. I
have like the most ridiculous,

644
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,100
crazy radar. And when, when someone's,

645
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:06,220
when there's something really wrong with
someone, my body goes on red alert. What?

646
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,990
She was on Meth when she met
you? Yeah. Meanwhile I know,

647
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,580
I didn't know what the hell, I just
thought she had an energy squirly as fuck.

648
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:15,870
As soon as she came over,
dude,

649
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:20,871
she was so off the charts bizarre
and shaky and weird and she just,

650
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:24,150
she's just saying hello to me. I pull
him aside. All she said is, hello,

651
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,570
nice to meet you. And then I go,
Whoa, come here for a second.

652
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,660
And I take him outside and I go,
she's fucking critical.

653
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,630
We let's get Outta here right now. Let's
get out of here right fucking now just,

654
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,610
you don't have to say goodbye to her.
Just call her Toni.

655
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,830
You're never going to hang
out with her again. Anyway,

656
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,880
belonging and the story is chaos.
All sorts of things happen.

657
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:44,400
He breaks up with her and then many,
many years later,

658
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:47,790
how many years later was it that you
saw her walking? Uh, tell the store,

659
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,220
walking down the street, right about a
year. Tell the story. Keep it Kinda, okay.

660
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,710
Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's, we're on the DL
when not name any names. Yeah, I know. No,

661
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:58,420
it's just the date of a hundred methods.
That's true.

662
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,680
I could have been any one
of them. My thing, uh,

663
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,750
nothing really good comes out of
that whole, that whole drug man.

664
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,150
It's nobody ever said, hey, I did
math and, and everything worked out.

665
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,230
I just know the method advocates province
and I did some math and everything.

666
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,620
Just I got a new house and my
body looks great. You know,

667
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,000
it looks kept tricky though.
What's tricky is that Adderall stuff,

668
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,740
which is kind of like a speed,
right? I mean, isn't that
a form of speeds, cocaine,

669
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,510
cocaine? I said that's where the kid
is probably, that's what it felt.

670
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:30,390
It feels like to me when I, when I did
it, it just felt like I was on cocaine.

671
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,470
Well that's probably because most of the
cocaine you got was cut with an Arrow

672
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,070
with speed. Speed. Oh yeah. Yeah. So

673
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,560
I think it's like a speed speeding.
Yeah.

674
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:42,970
Because I'm the late great
Robert Schimmel. God bless him,

675
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,570
rest his soul and all that good
stuff. Great Guy. He, he told me once,

676
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,350
I ran into him just randomly and he told
me about accidentally taking someone's

677
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,150
Adderall.
He thought it was something else.

678
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,920
He thought it was like his blood pills,
you know,

679
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,070
he had a heart attack and he thought
it was a, and he had cancer. You know,

680
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,880
he's had a lot of fucking
serious health problems mixing,

681
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,740
maybe didn't have a heart attack,
maybe just a cancer. Anyway,

682
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,250
he had some serious health
problems and he, um, he, uh,

683
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,520
took this Adderall by mistake and he
called his doctor. He's like, Holy Shit,

684
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,610
I think I took Adderall by mistake. What
do I do? He said, he can't do anything.

685
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,270
Just kick back and enjoy the ride because
it's going to be with you for the next

686
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,000
12 hours, but you're going to
be fine. He goes for 12 hours.

687
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:22,240
I just organize all my notes. He
goes, I just started writing. He goes,

688
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,510
I got so much shit done. Let you take
it for it to be more clear. Yeah.

689
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,290
Some people take it and it like
add people usually take it. Yeah.

690
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,680
Buddy minds on it. He's on it all
day. He's, you know, him to it.

691
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:35,440
We'll talk about it off the air, but he's
on it all day. He's, he takes it all day,

692
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,860
every day. He's prescribed by a
doctor. Really? Yeah. I, I dunno,

693
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,980
you know what specifically they
said he needed it for it, but man,

694
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,480
he's so fucking workaholic now,

695
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,030
but it's like that fucking movie that's
coming out with Bradley Cooper, you know,

696
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,830
limitless where you take a pill and all
of a sudden this pill makes you like

697
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:54,490
super focused and that I'm sure they're
going to come up with. That's Adderall,

698
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,420
Bro. I mean, there's a lot of fucking
people on Adderall. I didn't even,

699
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:02,350
I found out about Adderall when I was
on fear factor because there was a pas,

700
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:06,640
you know, production assistants and the
production assistants. Um, we're all, uh,

701
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,880
like college kids, you know, they were all
like doing it. Like a lot of them were,

702
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,590
you know, they're doing
it for a, you know,

703
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,140
just getting out of school first
Gig and they're doing it, you know,

704
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,210
as a part of the classes. Um, and uh,

705
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,020
they would start talking about how they
would take Adderall and while they're in

706
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:23,170
school. So I was like, you know, kids are
taking Andrew like, what are you doing?

707
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,570
And they're like, oh my God, I can't
even go to school without Adderall.

708
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,880
I was like, what? Like
what are you talking about?

709
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,310
It's what I thought was interesting about
that. You see that documentary bigger,

710
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,490
faster, stronger. Yes. And
you know, people say, well,

711
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:36,580
you're taking steroids and then ended up
be gene doping and all kinds of things

712
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:39,760
and pretty soon I have nano technology
that kind of oxygenates your blood. But,

713
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,980
but, but, but they said, you
know, steroids or illegal,

714
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,620
but yet performance can take
Beta blockers for example,

715
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:47,620
that actually keep them from getting
nervous where the debate really,

716
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,190
and they really, they're allowed, that's
legal. I mean, you know, if apparently,

717
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,090
I mean an orchestra,

718
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,900
one of the guys was an orchestra violinist
and he takes Beta blockers because it

719
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:59,290
helps him. He otherwise he doesn't get
nervous. He's much better at playing.

720
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,830
The issue is that is a performance
enhancing drug. You could,

721
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:05,110
you could make the argument and,
right,

722
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:08,020
but that's like the difference
between violins and steroids.

723
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,900
It's a pretty big into
question but, but, but the,

724
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,640
the debate's still is they're both
performance enhancing drugs. One,

725
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,280
make sure muscular cause that's what was
required in your particular endeavor.

726
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,170
Right? Whereas the other one, make
sure your fingers are more relaxed,

727
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,670
whatever it might be. It's just an
interesting debate. You kind of go,

728
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,640
where do you draw the line? I say personal
freedom is where you draw the line.

729
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:29,230
I think you should be able to
do whatever you want to do.

730
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:31,570
If you want to take Adderall and
write books all day, good for you.

731
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,010
Why would I get into the choice?
It's

732
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,960
like,
it's like when Bloomberg in New York,

733
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:40,650
Mayor Bloomberg made restaurants
where we're not allowed to, um,

734
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,690
uh, provide foods that had trans fats. I
believe. I don't know if that law went to,

735
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:47,180
but that was the, that was
the exactly. Our Trans fats.

736
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,500
I think trans fatty acids with
penises. No, I think twins.

737
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,910
Brian just knocked it out of the park.
There it is. That's why he's here folks.

738
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,890
I think it's like,
I think I'm partially,

739
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,540
I think I partially hydrogenated oils,
whatever it is,

740
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:07,970
it's not good but delicious.
Right. You know what I mean?

741
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,830
I don't want to be able to eat. Not
good but delicious. Sometimes you fuck,

742
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,150
you're going to make a trans
fats illegal. Let's go. Let's,

743
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,490
let's make up two things.
Let's take white flour and sugar.

744
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,990
We charge a real fucking cigarettes man.
Before they even touch you.

745
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:25,220
Draw the line. White flour and
sugar. Make some delicious donuts.

746
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,490
That's where you draw the line. Eat
too many of them. You'll get diabetes,

747
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:32,360
so give me a break. You're
going to make it. You can't.

748
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:35,090
You got to figure out where to draw the
line and you start with water. Yeah.

749
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,650
People should be able to make their own
choices based on the information that

750
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,100
they can.

751
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,890
And nowadays everybody can get information
and I'm always amazed as somebody,

752
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,250
people don't spend more time taking a
look at what they put in their bodies.

753
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:50,450
But some people worry about what access
to children. This is like the big word.

754
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah, yeah, I hear that about
adults. But what about my kids?

755
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,770
I don't want my kids who worry.
It's never been,

756
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,480
it's never not been a worry that the
answer to that is not to take away adult's

757
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,220
ability to choose things for themselves.
It doesn't make the world a safer place.

758
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,500
You want to try and make the world
a safer place. You let's, let's,

759
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,590
let's take one example.
Lower the speed limit is 36 miles an hour.

760
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,380
It'll save lives. I can measure
that for you. Mathematically.

761
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,320
You want to lower the speed
limit? No. B We're going to,

762
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:17,960
we're going to have it at 55
65 because that's the way life.

763
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,510
That's the s the pace life moves at.
And by the way,

764
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:23,510
people die at that pace but
nobody's going to slow down.

765
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:26,600
Cause the slow down is ready,
not worth it.

766
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,670
So you're putting a price on human life,

767
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:31,850
which we do every single day
as a society and we have to,

768
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,090
that's an interesting way to put it.
You could spend more money on airlines.

769
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,950
You could spend actually
more money to really,

770
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:40,970
really triple safe guard planes.
You could actually do,

771
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:45,610
it wouldn't be worth it because price for
everybody would go up and you wouldn't

772
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,240
able to fly that way.
It's it's we do.

773
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,150
We make these decisions subconsciously
and consciously every single day.

774
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,860
My friend Johnny used to said,

775
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:54,230
why don't they put a big
parachute at the top of the plane?

776
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,540
It's like such a smart thing that great.
I thought about that.

777
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,940
I'm like God dammit.
That's like some gene shit,

778
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,120
don't they let even talks about it.
I like when they find that when they,

779
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,130
when they find that black box as like why
don't they just make the whole plane I

780
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:14,780
made out of the same shit. Those
hack in 87 it sure was. Well,

781
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:17,100
what are they at least give
you parachutes her, you know,

782
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,240
like underneath your seat just
in case if you fucking way, Bro,

783
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,400
500 miles an hour, you're fucked.
Fall out of the sky. We usually,

784
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:28,280
most plane crash has happened on
takeoff and landing, so that's,

785
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:30,400
that's so they're, your peer at
parachutes can not going to do shit.

786
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,100
It's not like you're in the
air and the light you need

787
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,150
is some sort of a adamant Tanium to shit
that wolverines bones is made out of

788
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,170
like a shield that you put around
you on impact because impact they,

789
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:43,410
the percussion. Your brain would
be you, maybe you or just the,

790
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,250
my brain would be fine, bro.
Or just a huge shot of heroin
with bubbles and stuff.

791
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,880
I got padding. Maybe you brought
her, Joe's getting competitive. You,

792
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,070
he's going to competitively.
Oh, can take more impact.

793
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:56,460
This is a stupid conversation.
I hate this podcast.

794
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,620
What?

795
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,950
Last night when I was a showrooming and
went outside and looking at the stars

796
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:05,580
when you're showrooming is the most
fucking amazing thing in the whole entire

797
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,350
world.
They were just pulsating.

798
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,710
You're riding a dolphin right now to put
according blowing him talking pin over

799
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,770
right now, writing and Unicorns
licking his ass. He's got,

800
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,140
hey around his asshole on the
Unicorn slick here as I frolic.

801
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,130
I want to share him every day. Don't
think that's good for you, for him.

802
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,580
I think that's what happened to
the Mayans. That's my latest.

803
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,700
I have this bit about the
Mayans, about the mines. Uh,

804
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,920
you know the reason why they came
up with this end of the world, shit,

805
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,040
there were fucking doing mushrooms
and like staring at space all day.

806
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,310
Like there's a certain amount of mushrooms
you should stop at and whatever the

807
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:41,070
fuck the Mayans did cause they
disappeared. You know, the people,

808
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,350
the Mayan people are still there.
That's what's weird.

809
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,950
When I went to cheat you an Eatsa,
I went and uh,

810
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,330
one of them went on the tour of
the ruins and everything like that.

811
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,410
There's people there that look
like those Mayan sculptures.

812
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,130
There's like pick people there that have
those Mayan features and they're really

813
00:45:56,131 --> 00:46:00,900
tiny people. It's really bizarre. So the
Mayans, it's not like they all died off,

814
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,891
but whatever.

815
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:06,210
The fuck they were doing was so crazy
that it got to a point with human

816
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,810
sacrifices just fell apart
doing human sacrifice.

817
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:13,890
I call that pretty crazy and raiding
other villages in a might've been a lot of

818
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:17,130
it might've been that they
were just getting fucked up
on mushrooms all the time

819
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:22,020
and just go to war on mushrooms and we
knew the Vikings went to Warren Mushrooms.

820
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,620
They will become very Scotts. The Scotts
they call them deserves. Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,770
I don't know what mushroom they took.
I'm sure someone on Twitter will tell us,

822
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:30,870
but I think it was the Amanita Mascara,

823
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,800
which is the one that's linked to Siberia
and Santa Claus and cause they would

824
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,970
get naked rain, make it and they say
they'd cry a lot. Yeah. Well you know,

825
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,150
listen man, if you've fucking put
yourself on the right mixture,

826
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,950
you know and you've got to go to war,

827
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,180
you put yourself on some crazy
next dimension. Mixture. No,

828
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,330
you have to go to war. We think of
war. It's like something to be avoided.

829
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,650
But when you're in your living in
one a d it's, there's no avoiding it.

830
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,520
Is this dude's with swords and they're
coming on horses and we got to get a

831
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:03,480
spear. When the weird thing is, the
way they went, they would fight.

832
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:04,980
I always think about this,
the fine line.

833
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:06,730
Do you want me to charge into all of that?
That,

834
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,680
that all those blades to just fight
like that? It's high. I'd be waiting.

835
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:13,740
I want to be the sniper I want to be.
There was no avoiding that.

836
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,400
That shit happened. I've learned the bone
Arrow quick. Yeah, but even that man,

837
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,860
eventually someone's gonna run
up on you and hack your leg off.

838
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,100
It's a bad way to God, a crazy way to go
to all those fucking Braveheart movies.

839
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,220
Two armies, they meet across a field
and they just run at each other now,

840
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,720
but they really walk it like that.

841
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,910
At least they had the anesthesia
in antibiotics by the time. Right.

842
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,880
I didn't stop to bend over to tie
my shoe in my metal shoe laces.

843
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,590
Do you how sucky it was lived back then.
Oh, you died a things like tetanus,

844
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,970
diphtheria, whooping cough, small pop up,

845
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:51,730
starvation and animal attacks,
starvation animal attacks.

846
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,490
Other other like countries
coming in and going, hey,

847
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:58,090
we're going to kill you and enslave
your kids and rape you are wise.

848
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,150
No. What people have forgotten about
man wolves is all this talk level.

849
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,610
We're going to save the wolf. The wolf
are amazing. Majestic creatures. Yeah.

850
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:09,190
Wolf's used to eat fucking kids,
man.

851
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,610
There's a reason why all these little Red
Riding Hood with that movie that I saw,

852
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,430
all of these things would though the
three little pigs you use the reason why

853
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:18,700
there's wolves and all these children's
stories cause wolves would fucking eat

854
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:22,810
your kids there. They're out there man.
And they're getting stronger and bigger.

855
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,680
Do you hear about the wolf
pack in Siberia or in uh,

856
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,620
it was somewhere in the Soviet Union
but we're forming. So wherever Russia,

857
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,513
whatever it's called now

858
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,170
400 a found meet. Uh, they had
found bear DNA and they're at feces.

859
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,430
They were killing bears,
right?

860
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,840
Well no,
that's the one I'm talking about.

861
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm talking about this a pack of Super
Wolves who was 400 wolves in this Russian

862
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:46,820
town and they were killing horses that
were ganged up cause it got so cold

863
00:48:46,821 --> 00:48:49,730
apparently that all the
animals that they prey on died.

864
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,440
So they started breaking into places and
killing horses and there's 400 of them

865
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:56,150
acting as a superpac first of all,

866
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,400
living in Siberia in the wintertime.
And they, and they're like, hmm.

867
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,350
Well I'm not sure if
it's Iberia at somewhere.

868
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,990
Obviously incredibly cold in
Alaska because everything died.

869
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:09,230
Everything froze to death. Now isn't
that a lot of freezing to death lately,

870
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:13,550
man in Japan or in Vietnam?
7,000 fucking uh,

871
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:17,640
I think it was oxen, oxen or what
are some wild cow or something?

872
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,220
Whatever the fuck it was, but 7,000 large
animals died. Wow. You know, I mean with,

873
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:25,940
while these, these massive die offs, you
know, that that's happening this year.

874
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:29,990
I mean all of them together. I don't
remember. I don't remember any die offs.

875
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,630
Just a few employees happen, I think. And
I think in nature you always have dives.

876
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:38,830
And by the way, you also always have
viruses that come in and wipe out,

877
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:43,060
for example, wild dog of Africa and
that that dog, you know a lot of,

878
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:45,910
from what I've read and seen,
I believe they get,

879
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,490
one of them gets this temper and
then the whole pack dies. You know,

880
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,950
they just spread it back and forth.
I have a dog that had to stamp her.

881
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,260
It was scary as fuck.
It's scary.

882
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,091
A rescue dog.

883
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:56,840
He was a doberman and he was real sweet
and then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

884
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:00,470
man, he just started snapping at me and
growled at me and I was a little kid.

885
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:01,304
I was like 11

886
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:07,170
one of the great things we've done as
human beings and the 20th century is

887
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,350
really checked. Most pathogens,
most diseases like that we have,

888
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,160
we have come up with a bill,

889
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,100
an ability to really make them slim to
vanishing in our everyday lives. Who,

890
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,600
when was the last time you knew
anybody who died of a disease?

891
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,140
And if you read any kind of literature,
any literature, pick up any book from,

892
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,520
from even 1948,
even though even if you place there,

893
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:32,690
there was always, everybody had
dealt with different kinds of play,

894
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,310
whether it was influenza in this,

895
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,430
in the worldwide influenza that
hit this country in a very,

896
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:41,570
very hard in the 20s or, um, or polio,

897
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,100
which put the countless
children, thousands of
children in, in on iron lungs.

898
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,790
They died. And then they lost their,
their ability to walk. And the,

899
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:51,170
our own president,
I mean,

900
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:54,410
our own president of the United States
got polio and was in a wheelchair.

901
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,070
Now think about that. You know, um,
when he was governor of New York, uh,

902
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,560
Theodore Roosevelt, I'm
sorry, it was, um, uh,

903
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,930
Franklin Roosevelt was, uh, was, you know,

904
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,440
uh, I think he was coming to
New York. Yeah, it was, and,

905
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,640
but he was basically walking and standing
and then he got polio when he was at

906
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,340
the height of his power and yeah,

907
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,310
at the height of his powers when
he caught it. Yeah, yeah. Written.

908
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:19,310
Then he became president.
I said,

909
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,540
there's no doubt that it's
the safest time to live ever.

910
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,390
There's never been a time like this, you
know, with all the violence that we have,

911
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:28,630
think of the population,
the population has dramatically increased.

912
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,690
When people say, well, things aren't
like they were in the Sevis motherfucker.

913
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:34,900
Do you know how many more people there
are than the were in the 70s in the 70s

914
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:37,630
there was probably only 3 billion
people in the world or something.

915
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,620
The other thing is amazing is we've
figured out ways to harness food like you

916
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:46,060
know, India wide swaths of India and
Southeast Asia and especially in China,

917
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,260
went through terrible famines and never
had enough to eat and a lot of that,

918
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,670
a lot of that stuff is a memory.

919
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,510
Thank it seems to me though that these
things are happening much more frequently.

920
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,420
I would like to think that it's just
because of our access to information that

921
00:51:58,421 --> 00:52:00,130
we have with the Internet and
Twitter and all these things.

922
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:04,060
So what we find out about
disasters, whether it's in
Chile, whether it's in China,

923
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:07,140
whether it's a New Zealand, find about
him, find out about them in real time.

924
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,480
But I don't buy that. And Man, I
feel like there's more. I mean,

925
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:13,360
I guess someone should do the research
or maybe somebody already has and I just

926
00:52:13,361 --> 00:52:15,130
need to find the site.
But there's,

927
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:19,000
I think more things are happening
now than I can ever. I think.

928
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,440
I think I'm trying to be objective,

929
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,810
but I think we all have a tendency as
human beings also number one to first of

930
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:23,961
all,

931
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:28,670
I don't think there's ever been a time
in history when people weren't predicting

932
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,720
the end of our race shore. And now,
and I'm talking about first century,

933
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,010
the first centuries, pharisees, I mean,
you know, are the scenes. I mean that the,

934
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,880
in the Bible, that's what they talk about.
They were apocryphal, you know, and, and,

935
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,290
uh, that is, that is so much
a part of our nature, I think,

936
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,340
not only to always imagine
disaster and prepare for disaster,

937
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,970
but to predict disaster.
And, and I think that, um,

938
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,360
the one thing that's for sure is
that you will always deal with these,

939
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:57,650
what they call black swans,

940
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:01,640
these sorts of aberrations that come
out of nowhere and take the whole chess

941
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,950
board and throw it in the air.

942
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,420
And that is as much about the
human experience as anything else.

943
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,370
And I think that if you always keep in
mind that all this can be taken away from

944
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:18,150
you or can change you or can
throw your what, what your,

945
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:22,520
your whole contract that you came to
this table with in the rip it to shreds.

946
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,430
Is that a problem?
No one's that contract.

947
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,440
This is the real problem
with human beings.

948
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:32,640
We all just exist and we don't really
think about what the fuck is truly going

949
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:35,760
on until something nutty happens.
That's right. And by the way,

950
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:37,920
remember a lot of psychiatrists
to tell you that all,

951
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:40,680
all of us come to the table with
a contract. Like we, we, we,

952
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,170
we all make deals with ourselves.
We say, if I work really hard,

953
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,470
I'm going to get this job. If I work
really hard, I'm going to get famous.

954
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:47,580
If I remember the how to get,
I'll,

955
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:52,260
I'll make a lot of money and a lot of
times life doesn't work that way for a

956
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,900
whole myriad of reasons. A
lot of times, by the way,

957
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,660
it's because people aren't honest with
themselves and don't realize what they're

958
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:59,720
actually good at versus what
they want to be good at.

959
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,010
We see that a lot with
acting and all these things,

960
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:06,540
but I think you see it everywhere and but,
but at the end of the day, most of us,

961
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,240
it's really interesting the social
scientist because they'll say,

962
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,250
well a lot of times we have a
contract come to the table and we say,

963
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,380
this is what happens. We get
older, it doesn't happen.

964
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,270
But human beings are also really,

965
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:18,840
really good at creating what they call
synthetic happiness. They can, they can,

966
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:23,100
they can assess what they got now versus
what they did want and they realized it

967
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,400
didn't work out and then they'll just
start to really love what they like.

968
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,190
There's social sciences did a really
interesting study between people who won

969
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,120
the lottery and then people who became um,
uh,

970
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,660
paraplegics and he and he measured their
sort of happiness on a broad sort of

971
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:37,480
scale,
uh,

972
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,460
a year later and found that there were
both in the same place because the people

973
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:45,720
in a wheelchair, I had done such a good
job of embracing their new reality.

974
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,500
And that just means a lottery winners
or retards. That's all I'm saying.

975
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,530
It's crazy. But he was, you got
know if you won the lottery, dude,

976
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:54,810
you'd be way happier than you'd
be if you were in a wheelchair,

977
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,290
unless you're an idiot. Well, but I'm
just saying it's human beings human.

978
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,870
It's more a comment on the people in the
wheelchair who are able to kind of what

979
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:01,651
I was saying,
man,

980
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:06,120
when I was saying that the people
aren't exactly aware of what's going on.

981
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:06,811
Here's the deal.

982
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:11,811
We live in a society that was collected
over the course of hundreds of years of

983
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,410
innovation.

984
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,300
It's created all of the work of millions
of people that you've never met, right.

985
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,770
And all of their combined efforts and
discoveries have allowed you to live this

986
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:26,850
really simple and easy life and that's
what we're all doing and we are all

987
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:30,720
raising children with the same ignorance
that we have about what this is all

988
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:33,420
about in this country, in this
country, in all countries.

989
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:37,140
No one knows what the next stage of
this existence. I think for example,

990
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:39,930
if you look at India and then you
look at China and especially India,

991
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,970
India is becoming a real hot bed
of innovation and those kids work.

992
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,520
They, I mean there's a their
slaves. No, they weren't.

993
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,500
I call them when my Dell
computer doesn't work,

994
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,710
but they're smart and a lot of that
innovation is coming out of India.

995
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,650
I'm sure there is man and what all
I'm sure it is what I'm saying.

996
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:59,550
What I'm getting at is no one has
earned this life that we live right now.

997
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:03,690
No one that's alive has, it's a
collective effort, but as individuals,

998
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,870
very few of us are even putting into
perspective normal things like our own

999
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:14,340
mortality, the mortality of a
very climate, the mortality of,

1000
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:18,060
of the structure and the shape of the
continents. I think because it a lot of,

1001
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:21,060
and a lot of ways we're more comfortable
today than we ever have been.

1002
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,230
Plenty to eat. You can go away biology,
you don't worry about these disease.

1003
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:27,300
Do you even really have to worry
about war? For the most part,

1004
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,300
that's new in our country.

1005
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,420
Remember in 2011 if you take even 1985
half the world was under communist

1006
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:34,990
dictatorships who were,

1007
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:38,530
who had their missiles pointed
directly at our major cities.

1008
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,410
That doesn't exist anymore. There
really is for all intensive purposes.

1009
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:42,220
One superpower,

1010
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,580
one military superpower in the world
and Russia is no longer a threat.

1011
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:47,620
Think about that.
We now have NATO.

1012
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:51,280
Most of the eastern European countries
that were our enemies are actually part

1013
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:54,880
of NATO. Now, who do you talk
about? North Korea and Iran?

1014
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,920
Maybe significant to an extent,

1015
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:59,350
but certainly nothing like the
threat that the Soviet Union was.

1016
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,400
So I think people,
you're right.

1017
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,150
I think people for the most part
are a lot more relaxed and, and,

1018
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:08,890
and feeling a lot more secure. Anything
is better now. People are smarter now.

1019
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,740
People are nicer now.
People are more aware and informed.

1020
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,710
Now they're more aware of their own
mental and psychological problems.

1021
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:17,500
We're fatter now. Bigger asses. Now

1022
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,560
the question becomes
what's the balance like?

1023
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,340
How much discomfort do you have to
experience, to beat, to be great?

1024
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,430
Because I think greatness does
come out for it to a large extent.

1025
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,420
Out of doesn't come out of comfort
and luxury. I think it does,

1026
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:34,600
but sometimes it can just come out of
discipline. Well, they're struggling.

1027
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,280
That discipline. If you can be the
type of person that really, you know,

1028
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,270
you don't have to be living a terrible
life. That's right. You're right.

1029
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:41,110
Good stuff.
You know,

1030
00:57:41,111 --> 00:57:45,100
you can be living a great life as long
as you're disciplined and you really tune

1031
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:47,570
yourself into it as you're right.
Yeah. You know, but you were talking,

1032
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,740
I thought I had a thought. You
were talking about how, you know,

1033
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:52,210
genetic suck and pretty soon,
you know,

1034
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:55,410
we're going to be able to kind of choose
our genetics. But the question becomes,

1035
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,320
you know, I think of myself well, but
the problem with that is that so much.

1036
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,880
I'm worried that we'd lose our color
cause so much of what I do and what drives

1037
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,150
me worried really is the white color
white people. No, no, no color.

1038
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:11,860
Like color flavor, flavor.
Oh, nice. Recovery.

1039
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,690
Not Color. I mean like our flavor
hour, hour. Because, because,

1040
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,900
because so much of what we do,
so much of what I do,

1041
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:23,560
what drives me is that I'm compensating
for my inadequacies or my perceived

1042
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:26,830
inadequacies that that's why I worked out.
That's why I did martial arts.

1043
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:28,750
That's why I wrestled.
I felt like I was sort of,

1044
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:33,040
but it's always from the childhood, the
place that a performer comes from. Yeah.

1045
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,940
And me too. And everyone, we
know, everyone we know that's
a comic. There's always,

1046
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:42,110
but what I'm saying is in some ways, God
bless a dysfunctional childhood. Yeah.

1047
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,270
And no, because you're one of a
hundred that didn't, you know,

1048
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:49,960
there's a hundred like you that smashed
on the rocks and the way up to the top

1049
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:50,680
of the cliff.

1050
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,370
You managed to bite through vines with
your teeth and get to the top and you

1051
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:57,610
took a deep breath and now you're okay.
But you didn't have to be okay.

1052
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:59,800
I needed to die.
Anyone with a fucked up childhood,

1053
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:03,430
like the idea of encouraging a fucked up
childhood to create an innocent child.

1054
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,410
What did you really mean?
That's really what you're saying,

1055
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,840
but the trick of light truly isn't.

1056
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:11,290
The trick of life isn't the trick of life
to turn to turn that which is bad into

1057
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,700
something good. Yes, it is the trick,

1058
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,550
but some people fail at that trip and
then we have criminals wandering through

1059
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:17,780
the streets that are dangerous
and emotionally get matched.

1060
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,780
It's very easy to destroy the human being.
It's not hard at all.

1061
00:59:20,781 --> 00:59:23,400
And they'll just raise him terrible.
Yup. You know what I mean? When you,

1062
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,830
it's always like some feral child and
Russia. You hear about raised by dogs,

1063
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:30,530
you know like, oh wait, fuck
right. You just stop and
think about it. Like with the,

1064
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:34,500
for the kid's been eating
dead birds and shit for dogs,

1065
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,460
dogs but like poodles
or something like that.

1066
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:41,720
Like what's so weird about
contemplating like disaster,

1067
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:46,410
like the one in Japan, any disaster or
any, anything has a ripple effect. And,

1068
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:51,140
and the crazy thing is that that
sometimes to one person's loss is another

1069
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:52,220
person's opportunity.

1070
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:56,150
It's just that dance that constantly
goes back and forth and there's one side,

1071
00:59:56,151 --> 01:00:00,290
something terrible happens and it opens
up a whole new world and opportunity for

1072
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,370
a whole nother group of people. You
know, whether it's up, somebody opens a,

1073
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,210
I dunno,

1074
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,920
a company that provides quick relief
and now he's employed 60 people who can

1075
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:13,270
feed their kids, whatever the case.
It's just this constant dance man.

1076
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:18,290
And whenever you try to pinpoint or
treat life like it's a noun, you're,

1077
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,140
you're in trouble. And by the way,
your relationships are a verb.

1078
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:24,530
Everything is a verb. Everything is
always moving. Everything is in flux.

1079
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,850
You are too. Absolutely. That's the
whole thing is there's nothing static,

1080
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:32,000
but that's what everybody looks at is
the problem with the contract with coming

1081
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:33,560
to the table with the contractors.

1082
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,890
They look for that moment where
they can stop now, man. I think,

1083
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,160
I think if you keep growing
and you keep yourself,

1084
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,880
you keep surprising and shocking
yourself and maybe even scaring yourself,

1085
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:46,300
which is hard to do. But if you
sound like an actress right now,

1086
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,040
have to sing a song, dude,
got away on my song, you know,

1087
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:54,210
selling some new chick the
next blockbuster terracing
about why the fuck I am

1088
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,810
beautiful. The worst earthquake, you know,

1089
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:59,600
everyone's talking about what
Gilbert Gottfried said. No one is,

1090
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,390
no one said dumber shit than
what's Sharon Stone said? Well,

1091
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:06,350
half the Chinese earthquake, or do you
remember that? She said, maybe you know,

1092
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,420
I'm friends with the Dalai Lama.
You know,

1093
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:12,290
maybe this earthquake in China is Karma
because they're of the terrible things

1094
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:14,980
they've done for Tibet.
Wow. I remember that.

1095
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,780
You think innocent people thought
squashed by rocks,

1096
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,560
all that you know,
and she's a name drop and little Twat.

1097
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,460
I'm fencing Itali Lama sure asked you
a hooker thinks about you all the time.

1098
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,120
Concert when he's doing his mantra. He
was like, Sharon Stone, Sharon Stone,

1099
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,650
you know Sharon, you know the girl
basic instinct actresses? No, excuse me.

1100
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,300
You mean the girl from above the law,

1101
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,290
the Steven Seagal debut
movie actors including me.

1102
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,220
Look at the fact that we worship actors.
The funniest thing in the way,

1103
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:46,970
if an alien came down, they'd
be like, wait a minute.

1104
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,520
You're worshiping these people who are
basically good at being emotionally

1105
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:54,320
available and pretending is, is that
really something that I, it's a skill.

1106
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,250
It tells a good story there. Part
more impressive that. Or Golf. Golf.

1107
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,130
Golf takes unlikely though.

1108
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,520
But I like movies and Tiger Woods
probably can't act fuck golf. I love,

1109
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,354
I don't know man.

1110
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,860
I think both are equally ridiculous and
I've always said that it's one of the

1111
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:13,550
funniest things in the world that people
think that's a guy's a hero because he

1112
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:16,790
hits a ball into a hole in the ground.
But you know what I mean? So silly.

1113
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,220
We don't really like about any comp comp,
competition,

1114
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,190
golf or any game is that it requires
when you want to win at that game,

1115
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:26,510
it requires you to do basically
do all that self examination,

1116
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,040
that a face up to all your your obstacles.

1117
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,870
You got to deal with
your performance anxiety.

1118
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:33,240
You know how it is to try to get better.
You see the signers to choke.

1119
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,790
That's the point of competition.
I probably would love golf.

1120
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,040
That's what I'm terrified
but I played pool.

1121
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,780
That's the only ever don't ever pick
up a golf. Don't ever take Guilford.

1122
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:46,700
Going to I know how to only
chess either for the same reps.

1123
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:49,710
For those of you guys who don't,
who don't know this about Joe Rogan I,

1124
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:52,350
well I always said most of the public
actually doesn't knows very little about

1125
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,050
Joe. For example. He can,
he can draw really well.

1126
01:02:55,051 --> 01:03:00,050
He's at a notch below probe to
clarify. He is. He is. He but he's,

1127
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:03,330
he knows more about pool and he's,
he's actually a really good draftsman.

1128
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:05,370
You can draw like really,
really well.

1129
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,510
I've been wanting to do when I was in high
school before I got into martial arts.

1130
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:13,500
But I mean, but and so, so the comic book
on you're a great lunch, you're real,

1131
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:17,100
you're a real martial artist. You'd
be a nightmare to fight you. You can,

1132
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,810
you can draw a really well
and you, um, short, balding,

1133
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,940
Short, balding donkey assholes. Never
as clean. Are you not wearing pants?

1134
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,000
CELEXA layered underneath.
But wait, I was,

1135
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,930
there was a point I was making and I'm
too high to remember it. Dammit. Um,

1136
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,350
pool playing games.

1137
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:38,730
But the problem is that you're so
intense that once you pick something up,

1138
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,020
it's like that game quake when you played
for 15 passed out as you were leaving

1139
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:47,030
your eye. He drags me to the store and
he's getting these handles and did,

1140
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,390
he's like 30,
he's getting,

1141
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,240
he's getting his handles and all these
like weird things. It's, and I was like,

1142
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:52,500
what are you doing? What's
all these? What are these,

1143
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:53,880
what are these grips and stuff?
He goes,

1144
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,590
it's for quake a playing somebody
in Sweden tomorrow I will crush him.

1145
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,200
And I was like, whatever. What
the thousand yard stare, dude,

1146
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,080
that'd be play connect to you.

1147
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,600
You have no idea how we've talked about
this in the podcast way too many times,

1148
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,950
but a quick is too fun.
Quake is even more involving than pool.

1149
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:15,180
I won't allow my son's to those
games because they're too good. Now,

1150
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:19,510
like gears of war, like we cliffy be
put up an epic games put up the, uh,

1151
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,190
unreal three engine, the new
engine, they put up a demo.

1152
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,230
Fucking hey man, it just doesn't, it
looks real. It looks like a fucking movie,

1153
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:32,040
man. It's so, I do this
joke now about, about, um,

1154
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,710
how we're fighting wars now like that,
you know, like with songs and stuff,

1155
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:37,560
the guys in Nevada and Florida,
think about that.

1156
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,090
You're killing somebody 5,000 miles away,

1157
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:41,280
but it's a video game and
you're actually taking life.

1158
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:44,280
You wonder what that does
to you psychologically when
you come home and you're

1159
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,730
eating dinner. But, but I was at,
my joke was like, in 20 years,

1160
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:50,160
the word hero is not going to be the
grizzled guy with the shaved head and the

1161
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:53,940
scars. Can it be the Chubby dude with huge
thumb muscles who smells like Doritos.

1162
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,470
We'd,
well that's true.

1163
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:00,030
You Starfighter remember the movie where
the kid had to get really good at a

1164
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:01,620
video game and when he got good at it,

1165
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:04,920
they came down and took him to fight
in the galaxy. It's going to be,

1166
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,850
well these Pakistan drone things are
fucking frightening because it's such a

1167
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:11,580
gray area too.
It's like we're not really in Pakistan,

1168
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:15,510
but we are in the sky above pag and,
but there's no one in the plane and,

1169
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:18,250
and you hear it. This,
when I was in Afghanistan,

1170
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:21,360
I wash those things taken
off all the time. I was like,
look at that thing. It's,

1171
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,260
it's not even, it's not even manned. It
just takes off dude. Hell fire missiles.

1172
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:31,150
That's all you need to know. What are you
doing buddy? This cliff VBS, epic games,

1173
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,970
Infinity Blade video game.
They go through,

1174
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,130
they go through like that
Hellfire missile, I think.

1175
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:40,530
I believe somebody told me you can go
like a foot of steel or something like off

1176
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:41,440
of steal.

1177
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,640
The idea behind it is so crazy that you
can just pilot something from halfway

1178
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:49,960
across the world in real time and
trust it to just eat your pro.

1179
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:53,590
You pull the trigger and only the
beginning. How much of a delay is the lag?

1180
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,990
There has to be some lag.
Well I don't know.

1181
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:57,760
You can actually watch it on
the interview cause that was a,

1182
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,380
that's a big thing about playing online.

1183
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,070
When you play on line it's all about your
pain and if you have like one ping or

1184
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:04,780
two paying,
like you're in the server,

1185
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:08,190
you're local to the matter
anymore though so fast.

1186
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,590
That doesn't mean what you need makes
a big difference would ping is in

1187
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:13,060
milliseconds.
It absolutely matters.

1188
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,750
It's the guy with a higher paying
than you can still beat you.

1189
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,600
But you definitely have an
advantage when you're local.

1190
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,600
Like say if this is like say if
we set up a server in my house,

1191
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:26,020
right and I set up a server and
I'm here connected to the machine,

1192
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,020
but other people have to connect and get
the information through the Internet.

1193
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:29,921
So they're paying,

1194
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:33,520
say if they're down the block at the
lowest they're going to get is maybe a 10

1195
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,480
this is back in the day. I don't know
if it's changed, but yeah, 10 pin.

1196
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,310
If you're lucky,
but that's cause you're here,

1197
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,760
but if you're in Sweden or somewhere
like that, no doubt about it,

1198
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:45,940
you're going to have a slight delay.
It might be 150 milliseconds.

1199
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:49,330
It might be 200 milliseconds. It won't
be a full second. That's unbearable.

1200
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:52,210
You can't do that. 250 milliseconds
is where it gets squirrely.

1201
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:57,340
Like you can't really weird that does
the human human reaction can get to the

1202
01:06:57,341 --> 01:06:59,710
point where you can't make
like you can barely measure it.

1203
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,620
Like when they do sprinting, you know, how
would the Olympics, you know when they,

1204
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:05,620
you know why they shoot the gun? They
shoot a comment. That's for a sound.

1205
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,590
That's for a fact. They
actually, if you're a,

1206
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:11,840
if you're running a hundred like Usain
bolt and you're, you're in a rice, they,

1207
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:16,090
they have that. They shoot
that sound off behind you. Why?

1208
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,860
Because it's got to reach all the guys at
the same time. You shouldn't like this.

1209
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:23,980
The guy at the end is the last to hear
about it and they're so fast off the

1210
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:27,460
blocks that they, the other guy's
already already going to win the race.

1211
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,010
You didn't hear it in
time. So they, they, they,

1212
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,950
they found that when they shot back in
the day, they'd be shooting it here.

1213
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:37,390
The guy closest to gun all would
always have this advantage. And so now,

1214
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:41,560
and even when they, they send that
sound off now behind these guys,

1215
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:45,610
the problem is the sound dissipates
to here. So it starts, you know,

1216
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,550
you gotta have it, you gotta
have, it originates somewhere.

1217
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,300
How do you get it to all of them at the
exact same second cause they're so fast

1218
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,050
off the blocks,

1219
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,700
you're actually giving the guy who hears
it first and advantage and they win.

1220
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,880
It's like, it's like the guy
and check this out. You know,

1221
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:04,780
the difference between fourth place and
first place in the downhill ski event

1222
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:08,020
was in a, in a, you know, whatever it was.

1223
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:13,000
It was two planks of an I can't
gain it says what? Ready Gold, gold,

1224
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:17,990
gold, nothing. Gold. Nothing. Whoa.

1225
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,430
Nothing. That's fucking not, that's
why swimmers trimmed their fingernails.

1226
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,200
That's what he's and
he's don't don't trim.

1227
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,690
They try to get their finger nails long.
Why?

1228
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:30,260
To Act as like a little paddles notes so
that you can touch because it's you're

1229
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:34,280
dealing with a hundredth of a second.
Watson can grow pimp nails. You tried it,

1230
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,050
you tried it.
It's all computerized.

1231
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,110
The minute you touch that and say if
you were touching like who some are Paul

1232
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:41,480
horror as you'd be a terrible
swimmer because he wasn't real.

1233
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:46,460
Have that big reach guys or albatrosses.
That's fucking fast.

1234
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,490
That's how fast human being
how, okay. Let me ask you this.

1235
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:52,640
How many of those guys
do you think are doping?

1236
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,530
How many of those guys
in Olympic competition?

1237
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,830
I don't think it's possible to compete
in in a lot of Olympic sports without

1238
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:02,030
doping and without doing drugs.
Yeah, like cycling. There's no way.

1239
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,740
Why do you think all of them,
why do you think all of them get caught?

1240
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:08,110
All of them. The biggest. It's the
biggest joke. I mean, you know, but, but,

1241
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:11,720
but you're going after Lance Armstrong
Bro. I'm sure they're going after him.

1242
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:14,780
This is, which is weird. It's
like they get them on lying,

1243
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,140
which is a very strange thing.
It's like women,

1244
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,710
if you're going to put
people in jail for lying,

1245
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:23,120
how about most of the government?
You know, fuck can't in a lie.

1246
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,130
Nobody ever got went to
jail for taking steroids.

1247
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,320
But people who have gone to jail
for lying to the government about,

1248
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,670
and if they take him his money away or if
they take, you know, say that you know,

1249
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:33,950
you did some stuff that was
against the rules and you know,

1250
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:36,650
you should be fine and we can
prove that that's one thing.

1251
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,870
But they're going after
him to lock him up, man.

1252
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,410
They're going after him till to set an
example and lock him up for something

1253
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,910
that everyone's doing it. Everyone
is doing, especially in cycling,

1254
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:48,100
I remember he wouldn't be
arrested for doing steroids.

1255
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,630
They wouldn't lock them up for that.
They would lock him up for committing.

1256
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,750
Perjury is a big diff weird, right?
That's how they got al Capone.

1257
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:55,160
That's how they get
it, right? The word no,

1258
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:59,270
the got him on tax evasion case against
Barry Bonds is that the case is you

1259
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:01,990
perjured yourself on the stand,
right. Where does that like what?

1260
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,570
You have to tell us the truth and if
you don't it's a crawl. You don't know.

1261
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:07,760
You have to, you know you have
the right to take the fifth right.

1262
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:11,780
But as you can say nothing, which is
what one of the great things about our,

1263
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,490
you know our system,
you can actually not,

1264
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:16,970
you can choose to not
incriminate yourself. I have,

1265
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,820
I refused to speak cause I don't want
to incriminate myself and that's right,

1266
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:21,590
but don't they lock people
up when they do that?

1267
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,080
You can be locked up if you are given,
I believe now I'm not legal scholarship.

1268
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:27,970
It's a scholarship that they're
doing that all the time.

1269
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,420
I believe you can be locked up is if
you have evidence and the government

1270
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:36,830
subpoenas that evidence and you
refuse to speak. If you say,

1271
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:39,740
I'm not telling them my friend,
you can go to jail for that.

1272
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:42,260
They can put you in jail for that.
And they have,

1273
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:45,740
they put a journalist in jail because
she wouldn't divulge her sources.

1274
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,120
And I believe that was in the Valerie
Plame case. That's creepy shit. She said,

1275
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:54,230
I'm not going to divulge who told me
these con that this person was a CIA

1276
01:10:54,231 --> 01:10:58,980
operative or whatever and she went to
jail. And then scooter Libby, I, I'm,

1277
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,460
I'm not sure if I'm getting all my facts
right, but scooter Libby, they'd find it.

1278
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:05,480
Turns out was pardoned by the president
later on, but convicted of, um,

1279
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,750
telling, uh, divulging a, an agent,

1280
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:14,770
a u s agents identity to
a non authorized person,

1281
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,800
uh,
which is a crime in this country.

1282
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,660
It's so bizarre how many different people
we have all over the world that are in

1283
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:24,240
military bases and you know,
that are, that are, uh,

1284
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,880
government operatives
in the United States.

1285
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,010
And we have them positioned all over the
world to kind of keep an eye on every,

1286
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:32,160
always have, you know, and it comes from
the Cold War and it's a dangerous place,

1287
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:36,180
but the real issue becomes what is, what
is the u s is strength has always been,

1288
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,300
not that it's power comes from the barrel
of a gun in the u s has its influence

1289
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:42,331
innovation,

1290
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:47,040
but mostly it's a beacon of hope where
you can come here and if you got the

1291
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,710
stuff and you got the metal,
you might just be a millionaire.

1292
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,100
That is something that
resonates throughout the
entire world and always has.

1293
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,520
I wanted to ask you this because you've
got some experience in the Middle East.

1294
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:00,480
What do you think is happening with all
these different places with I saw your

1295
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,800
radio with Egypt.

1296
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,190
I think it's a thing and it's a human
thing and I'll tell you what I think

1297
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:06,210
mostly most of all,

1298
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,680
I think that you heard a lot of analysts
and professionals and people who follow

1299
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:12,750
this stuff and people who are
so called experts and the,

1300
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:16,010
I used to always hear something that
they used to always say this democracy's

1301
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,870
not synonymous with Islam.
You'd hear that all the time.

1302
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,780
And I think what this proves
is that democracy, and let me,

1303
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,980
let me define democracy,

1304
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,810
that the desire for representative
government, let's just take that,

1305
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:31,500
the, the life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.

1306
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,570
I just let me pursue whatever it is.

1307
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,790
Those constantly being
able to speak my mind,

1308
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,140
being able to petition my government,

1309
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:39,990
being able to say something against
my government, being able to,

1310
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:44,070
to all the things we take for granted.
Those are human rights and,

1311
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:47,460
and they are not, they are not American
rights. They are human rights. And,

1312
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:50,970
and this proves that you can say whatever
you want about Islam or anything else

1313
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:54,960
or any other religion. Human beings
want a better life for their children.

1314
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:59,760
Human beings would choose
to have representative
government over a dictatorship

1315
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:02,910
like Hosni Mubarak or,
or a dictatorship like the,

1316
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,820
the royal family essentially
is in Saudi Arabia.

1317
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,610
Don't tell me any human
being wants to live that way.

1318
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:13,230
I find it very inspiring that one
man and Tunisia lit himself on fire.

1319
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:16,380
You want to talk about a ripple effect
lit himself on fire because they took

1320
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:19,830
away his license. I believe he was selling
fruit and he said, enough is enough.

1321
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:24,120
He was so desperate and he said, I'm going
to make an example. This is my protest.

1322
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:27,240
You want it, you want to take everything
from me, I'll light myself on fire.

1323
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,900
And I don't think that's a good move. But
that was a spark that caused that, that,

1324
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:33,180
that, that said, that said, we
don't have to be afraid anymore.

1325
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:34,680
We don't have to beat,
we don't have to cringe.

1326
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:36,630
And and saying that
these governments like,

1327
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:40,020
like Egypt in both places where they have
with a military and secret police come

1328
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:43,260
in and do some pretty awful things
to you that takes real guts.

1329
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:45,510
So I think it's a real,
I think this is a, um,

1330
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:48,690
an incredible time in the sense
that the Middle East is changing.

1331
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,260
It really is changing and it's
the really is the Internet nation.

1332
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,380
Of course it is, but you can't
keep information away from people.

1333
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,930
You can fool the people sometimes
you can fool all the people.

1334
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:00,330
Sometimes it can be some of
the people all of the time.

1335
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:03,680
You can't fool all the people all the
time. Except North Korea who said that?

1336
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,800
I believe that was Abe
Lincoln, right? Yeah.

1337
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,720
Who knows what the fuck ain't really said.
You know, Abraham Lincoln was a racist.

1338
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,590
I'm just trying to encourage black people
to move to South America because they

1339
01:14:12,591 --> 01:14:14,680
wouldn't get along with white page.
It's actually more complicated than that,

1340
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:19,210
but I think it's more complicated
than that. Of course he is sweet.

1341
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,720
He's slept with dudes. Do. Why is he slept
with dudes? They slept in bed together.

1342
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:25,780
Stay warm. Wow. This is no big deal.
You got to do what you gotta do, man.

1343
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:30,400
You live in fucking prairie pioneer days
out of speedos and you're gonna call me

1344
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:34,090
gay. What's an Abe Lincoln? A wrestler.
He was very strong. He was about six,

1345
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,530
four and he was very,
very strong.

1346
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:38,620
They said he used to be able to hold an
acts like one of those big butch having

1347
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:41,470
acts out for like longer than anybody
else with his arms straight like that.

1348
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:43,360
He was a real wirey strong dude.

1349
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,170
Straight with his on what a weird
competition that it's back of the day.

1350
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:50,710
They'd get all this is hopscotch
hard things, right? Like you know,

1351
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,920
let's see a whole hind quarter
of a mule up above your head.

1352
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:57,550
Now you know how to be a first guy
back then to try to wrestle a bear too.

1353
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,280
I always think about that stuff. Who
wrote a bull who said, hey, you know what?

1354
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,860
Throw a testicle essential on that bull.

1355
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:06,010
I'm going to get up on him and see how
long is that originated and is that an

1356
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:09,220
American tradition? Well, I
probably started in smelled Spain.

1357
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:11,680
They were like knocking like a ride and
I'm just going to kill it with a sword.

1358
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:15,210
It's pretty bad ass. Yeah. You know
what bothers me about that though, man,

1359
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,920
is a bunch of other dudes helping
out. Oh well, because there's,

1360
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,280
because you know the Madeira Bull,
I think it's called the Madeira evil.

1361
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,610
Hemingway wrote a book called death in
the afternoon and he kind of takes each,

1362
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:27,100
brings you through what a
what a fighting bulls about.

1363
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,880
You're not allowed in Spain, you're not
in. And some of you guys listening to his,

1364
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:32,170
I just check this out.

1365
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,100
You're not allowed in Spain to
approach a fighting bull on foot.

1366
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,820
You must approach it on a bicycle,
motorcycle or car. You know why?

1367
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,930
Because Bulls figure out the way you move.
And if you,

1368
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,490
if they watch you walking around
all the time and running around,

1369
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,420
when you put them in a, in a, in, in
the, in the ring with the Matador,

1370
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,120
that manager doesn't have a chance
because they figured you out.

1371
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,220
The first time [inaudible] ever sees a
human being on two feet by law in Spain

1372
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,050
is when he's put out there in front
of that matador. And by the way,

1373
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:03,340
they got rubbed out there,

1374
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,790
got to rub his eyes with pepper to keep
them a little bit blind. They gotta,

1375
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,300
they gotta pick a deal is coming there
and stab him in the back so he can't lift

1376
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:13,780
his head. So he's got these
spears in is, it's pretty brutal.

1377
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:17,770
They've got to disable that bull
before on the human being has any shot,

1378
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,920
any shot at fighting,
it didn't shut and they still die.

1379
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,190
They still die when they say,
when you're a matador in Spain,

1380
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:27,350
that's where you are. Forget
girls, forget music for a house.

1381
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:30,610
Your life is about the bowl fog.

1382
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,400
Is there a lot of money and being
an amount of door, um, there's a,

1383
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:37,060
there's huge glory and money and you're,
you're a national hero if you're good.

1384
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,300
And by the way, it's probably like
the UFC start with like, you know,

1385
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:44,950
guys were fighting with blunt horns and
then all the way up to the big show, but,

1386
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,930
but um,
but you know,

1387
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:51,640
when they used to pit bulls with bears
gives you used to always win. Oh,

1388
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,320
I would say to the bowl. I would say
every time there is so strong there are,

1389
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:00,100
there's utilizers touched one. You ever
been on one? If you've written a book. No,

1390
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:04,960
but I've touched, I've been to
settle rich. Same thing sorta.

1391
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,950
So Lisa, when we were doing fear factory,
we made people ride bulls one day.

1392
01:17:08,951 --> 01:17:12,200
It was the scariest it's ever
been. Uh, any, any day of filming.

1393
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,810
This was one day where I felt like we
crossed the line. I was like, what?

1394
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:18,920
Are you doing? Dangerous. They are not.
They're like, they're bold. They were,

1395
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,680
this was the, their argument. These are
training bowls. They're not as aggressive.

1396
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,600
What does that bowl, no,
he's a fucking training.

1397
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:27,920
But I didn't know you were a poet by
meter where the bull whispers he around.

1398
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,170
I love when people think
they know what an animal is.

1399
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,920
I love when they have Christ strand.
It's tiger won't bite you.

1400
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,970
You were talking about
it to me in the kitchen.

1401
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:38,160
We're talking about that grizzly
trained bear, that tour the, uh,

1402
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,520
I think it was his trainer, his
brother or cousin, her cousin.

1403
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,980
And it killed him in a couple of seconds.
It was horrible.

1404
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,920
So weird because that's a 1500 pound bear,

1405
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:50,720
grabbed a hold of an [inaudible]
in a lazy way. And the poor guy,

1406
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,010
I guess he's pretty aggressive.

1407
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:56,300
I mean obviously the guy must've so
scary what it represented to the bear.

1408
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:59,930
But he was represented some sort of a
threat. Well apparently though he's,

1409
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:02,540
he was doing what he's supposed to do
and I guess the guy didn't have his arms

1410
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:05,390
up or something and they bear ended up
grabbing onto his neck and his instinct

1411
01:18:05,391 --> 01:18:07,340
took over and he said, oh, I'm
going to shake you to death,

1412
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,280
which is Tara's supposed to
have your arms up. I don't know.

1413
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:14,570
I don't got to stick them up, pose my bear
wrestling. And I'm a white belt still.

1414
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:18,860
I'm still so what do you think the fuck
is going on with all these mass deaths?

1415
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:23,420
There's a million fish die
in the Redondo Beach Harbor.

1416
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,690
All these animals that have died and
birds that are falling from the sky,

1417
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,030
I think, cause you don't see, I
don't know. But I would imagine,

1418
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,690
I would imagine we have a very polluted
at a environment and probably is a

1419
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:37,220
combination of all those chemicals in
the environment and chemicals are being

1420
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:37,881
made.
You know,

1421
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:41,210
we're very good at coming
up with synthetic material
and synthetic chemicals.

1422
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:45,440
And what we're probably not as good
at and what the FDA could never do is

1423
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:49,910
figuring out how all these chemicals
when put together interact or how they,

1424
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:54,560
what they do to, to, to Mitoplasma and if
that's even that, like using big words,

1425
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:58,540
but like what they do to our bodies,
uh, on prolonged, uh, you know,

1426
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,310
when we drink them, when we're around
them all the time. Look at your house.

1427
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,970
All these new products that come out
that have huge advertising campaigns,

1428
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:07,580
they're probably very
safe in on their own.

1429
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:11,270
What happens when you mix six of
them in the perfect combination?

1430
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:16,520
What is that doing to your genetic?
What's Wifi to, who knows what the fuck?

1431
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,870
We're always a,

1432
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:21,890
we know that sonar gets in the way of
Whales Migrate Migratory Flux Whales Up,

1433
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:25,040
right? Yeah. So, so, um, uh, it's,

1434
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,100
it's always this constant dance of how,
you know, in China now what they're doing.

1435
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:28,821
I think it's really interesting.

1436
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:30,920
There's a lot of the architects
when they plan these cities,

1437
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:36,280
they're building gardens on the roofs
so you can plant food and grow your own

1438
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:40,100
food on the roof of your building.
You know, China, so self sustainable,

1439
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,800
there's a billion people there.
They don't, they don't import food.

1440
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,770
They make their own food,
which is, which is again, very,

1441
01:19:45,771 --> 01:19:48,730
which is a very recent development
for China. It's pretty amazing. Yeah.

1442
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:51,980
Do that with a billion people. But when
you do that, you've got to eat bugs. Well,

1443
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:52,850
we're getting better,

1444
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,510
but we're getting better and better
at figuring out ways to grow plants,

1445
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:59,000
for example,
that don't need pesticides that are,

1446
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,910
that are much higher in protein
and different nutrients. Sure.

1447
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:05,120
But then you're getting weird because
things are genetically monitored than

1448
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:09,420
Monsanto owns the dark side. You know,
Monsanto, scariest. Fuck, what's that?

1449
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:12,500
It's a thing when you say it's fine if
you want to cross pollinate to wheat, uh,

1450
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,320
the strains. But when you take
the, the gene from a jellyfish,

1451
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:19,710
put it in a strawberry so
that my strawberry doesn't
freeze when I'm shipping it

1452
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:24,180
across the country. That's a little weird
man. When you're, when you're, you know,

1453
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,230
when all of a sudden my oranges are
square cause it's easier to pack them.

1454
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,980
Well have you seen all the
wikileaks documents leading
to a genetically modified

1455
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:32,221
foods?

1456
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:35,010
So they're trying to push it all across
the world are trying to push into the

1457
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:38,300
and the countries and there
they're putting imposing
sanctions on countries that

1458
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,790
they do. Also what you can, you can,
if you plant one field over here,

1459
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:44,980
it's genetically modified and cross
pollinates flies in there. Yeah.

1460
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:45,751
And then they sue the,

1461
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:48,720
those people and those people have
to either close up their farm or,

1462
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,610
well it becomes a fucking disaster
I think. I think, you know,

1463
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:54,960
I'm a capitalist and all that,
but I think that we are paying,

1464
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:58,230
we have to be very careful with how
everything is becoming these conglomerates

1465
01:20:58,231 --> 01:21:01,440
and how things are becoming so corporate.
Look at radio.

1466
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,780
Every time I travel this country,
you and I both traveled the country.

1467
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:07,530
Everything is so homogenous. We've,
we've, we've, we've paid a price.

1468
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:11,700
You people want efficiency. But why
in the world when I go to most cities,

1469
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,250
can I only eat at a,
at a corporate chain?

1470
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,390
Is there a rabbi I'm surrounded by?
I was going to say clear channel.

1471
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:23,160
I'm surrounded by, by, by, um, by
beige walls. Whether it's Kmart,

1472
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:27,240
there's no continuum. There's
no like, history. Nobody
feels connected to anything.

1473
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:30,270
Everything around me is, everybody's
trying to sell me something I don't need.

1474
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,840
And, and it's, it robs
every city of its character.

1475
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,610
It's like the death of the American city.

1476
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:39,940
What happened at main street with the
mom and pop shops. I want that boiler,

1477
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,460
but it's,
but,

1478
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,620
but these cities used to all have
it and I understand that progress.

1479
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,000
Small places to get that.
I was dealing with large volume of people,

1480
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:49,630
small places like that become impact.

1481
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:53,100
It's an offshoot of globalism
and it was priced. We had to pay,

1482
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:56,010
we'll probably swing back,
but we pay a price.

1483
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,330
When you think you can see in speed,

1484
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,020
what do you think about all these people
that believe that you know and if you

1485
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:05,290
read almost every ancient religion has
some story of a great apocalypse or a

1486
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:09,480
great catastrophe and almost every
religion has some story about a previous

1487
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:12,930
existing society that was advanced and
that was almost wiped off the face of the

1488
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:17,370
earth. You know when you hear shit about
all these animals dying and fish dying,

1489
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:19,950
this sounds like religious scripture.

1490
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:24,750
How fucking crazy would it be if we
all really have been all through this

1491
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:25,440
before,

1492
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,880
if human beings have literally gotten
to the point of where we are now,

1493
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:33,660
like this sophisticated,
if we died off today,

1494
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,110
how much of this shit would be
around in 10,000 years or so,

1495
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:41,460
how much would we be able to find and
recognize anything that that isn't steel?

1496
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,980
I think that is great.
I think it's a great direction.

1497
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:48,240
I do think that that was the answer
may lie in somewhere in the area.

1498
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:50,400
If I were to answer that question
and what I don't know, but,

1499
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:53,480
but I think that there is, there is a, um,

1500
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:59,040
human beings are the, are still faced
with the same problems as human beings.

1501
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:02,490
So whether or not I was
living 3000 years ago, the,

1502
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,920
the big questions that
one has to rest with

1503
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:09,790
that answer the question of what
am I doing here? Who am I really?

1504
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,790
What am I supposed to do?
What does this all mean?

1505
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:16,600
Those are questions you can never
run from. And so within that context,

1506
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:19,060
I think we'd be still, we'd still
be trying to answer those questions.

1507
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:21,230
We'd still be trying to go
beyond our biology shore.

1508
01:23:21,231 --> 01:23:24,790
So be trying to get more pleasure than
pain would still be out trying to figure

1509
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:29,350
out how to keep our children alive
with better food. So I think end,

1510
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,260
but we'd be competing with
resources and we'd still have wars.

1511
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:35,290
So I think in a way it makes sense
that we'd keep repeating ourselves.

1512
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,390
This is the human experience.
What I'm saying is,

1513
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,790
do you think that it's ever
gotten to this point before?

1514
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:43,630
When you look at some of the structures
that exist that are unexplained there

1515
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:47,250
many, many thousands of years old,
especially with the pyramids go.

1516
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:50,680
I mean unexplained in the fact that
they're not exactly sure how they put that

1517
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:51,131
all together.

1518
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:55,090
There's a lot of theories and there's
also old dynasty in new dynasty and

1519
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:56,800
there's old kingdom,
a new kingdom.

1520
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:58,840
There's a lot of structures
that they believe are far,

1521
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:03,520
far older than the traditional. We
thought it like the, the pyramid of Giza,

1522
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,800
the Great Pyramid of any, well, I think,

1523
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:09,040
I think what separates human beings
from animals as far as I know,

1524
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:13,210
is that we have imagination and that
we seem to be always moving toward the

1525
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:14,320
limits of our imagination.

1526
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:18,790
But what freaks me out is there's a bunch
of shit that they can't figure out how

1527
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:21,910
it all got done.
And one of them is dogs.

1528
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,450
Do you know dogs are a great
mystery. You know, when you,

1529
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,640
when you look into the DNA of dogs,

1530
01:24:27,641 --> 01:24:30,730
it turns out that all of
them descend from wolves.

1531
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,970
They thought it was going to be a bunch
of different wild canids and different,

1532
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:37,690
they're all from all from fucking
actually domesticated wolf. So, and they,

1533
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:42,130
we don't know how the fuck that was done
thousands and thousands of years ago.

1534
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,230
We do know that people have
always bread their animals,

1535
01:24:44,231 --> 01:24:47,080
whether they're horses or whatever.
Sure. Even farm animals to eat.

1536
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:49,450
They've read them so long ago to be,

1537
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:52,930
goes back so far that it
literally predate society.

1538
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:56,230
And that's why it's squirrely.
Cause you're talking about 10,000,

1539
01:24:56,231 --> 01:25:00,940
15,000 maybe even deeper and deeper
into the history of breeding dogs.

1540
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,570
Yeah. And I think at the answer maybe
also is the fact that they're, this,

1541
01:25:03,571 --> 01:25:07,990
this world is way more, uh,
what much older than ours.
We are probably much older.

1542
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:10,240
Human beings are probably much,
history is one thing,

1543
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:13,630
but real human history is another.
And, and you also want to evolution.

1544
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:17,320
I always think about that.
It's what's interesting to
me is like, is it, if indeed,

1545
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,020
you know, there's a lot of sense. I
said, well we, we've all from apes,

1546
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:24,360
chimps or whatever it might
be. Um, it, it, it's, you
know, people say, well, we're,

1547
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:27,340
we kind of seem to stop the evolving
physically then if that's the case,

1548
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:30,130
didn't we? No. We moved in
a different direction. Look,

1549
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:32,440
the doubling of the human brain sizes,
the giant,

1550
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,570
the biggest mystery and
entire fossil record.

1551
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:37,480
And that's what changed us from
this, this, this, you know,

1552
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:42,240
beetle eating fucking freak monkey to
human beings and whatever the fuck caused

1553
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,560
it. I wonder why he believes
it was mushrooms. You know,

1554
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,230
some people believe it
was the throwing arm.

1555
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:49,690
Some people believe it was fish
that we started eating food.

1556
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:52,030
But that doesn't make sense to me
because bears are stupid. It's fuck,

1557
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:54,730
and they eat a lot. But it goes
beyond that. I'm saying why, you know,

1558
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:59,670
chimps have always been chimps. Human
beings have continued to evolve, uh,

1559
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:04,190
just, uh, at least an hour.
Well, you know, we'll see in
that in we are, we do really

1560
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:08,030
amazing things. Know I joke around about
people being from monkeys and chimps,

1561
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:11,990
but the real lineage is there's a bunch
of different primates that evolved next

1562
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:12,411
to each other.

1563
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:16,940
For some reason we evolved in a far more
sophisticated way than all the rest of

1564
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:20,120
them. And in the sense that we're
always trying to go beyond that,

1565
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:23,330
which we can measure and we're always
contemplating what that would be.

1566
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,150
How do you, how would you
ever measure, for example,

1567
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:31,360
the fact that a great go out an old Mozart
or Bach Sonata make some people feel

1568
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:36,630
profoundly sad and overjoyed
the same time? Why do we
even have that stuff? Yeah,

1569
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:37,850
it sounds good to our ears,

1570
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:41,430
but think about the genius of Great
Jazz like Louis Armstrong, Chaz.

1571
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:44,360
Like why in the world would
that guy, well, I'm just saying,

1572
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:46,310
I'm just saying I'm using it.
I'm using it as an art form.

1573
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:50,750
Like why in the world would we come up
with these brass horns and playing all

1574
01:26:50,751 --> 01:26:54,080
those things that are sort of what
we stay alive for. It's interesting.

1575
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:56,540
It's like what are we supposed
to be doing with that?

1576
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:59,240
What are we supposed to be doing
with the fact that most religions,

1577
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:02,420
all religions talk about well, love each
other. That's the most important thing.

1578
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,370
Love each other. And
then, and then by the way,

1579
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,960
what do you do with that relationship?

1580
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,100
What are you trying to
make the world better?

1581
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:11,000
What do you do when you come
together? Uh, as, as social animals.

1582
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:14,030
Why and and what, what is,
what is the point of that?

1583
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:16,750
That's the big question that we're
always dealing with it. I think it seems,

1584
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,660
if there's no point,

1585
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,380
it seems that the point is to
enjoy it and to be nice to people.

1586
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:24,710
That seems to be the point.
The idea, if you're temporary,

1587
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:27,470
you're a temporary being and all your
descendants are temporary beings.

1588
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:31,310
We just keep evolving in a tide
of everchanging temporary beings.

1589
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:33,680
Then the only point is just be nice,
but then why?

1590
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:37,730
But then we'd just be then I guess
be nice. How Fun. Write it out.

1591
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,970
Let's see what's next. Is there a creative
group of people that were affected by,

1592
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:43,030
you know, thousands of what do you think?
There's anything to be said though?

1593
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,520
The going beyond that in the sense that
are we supposed to evolve and continue

1594
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:51,110
to understand more and more until we,
until her [inaudible] so short.

1595
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,130
It's like, it's the same thing when we
talked about before the human experience.

1596
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:57,530
What I'm saying is we keep jumping on each
other's shoulders. Right? Yeah. So, so,

1597
01:27:57,531 --> 01:27:59,730
so, you know, even Newton
said that, he said, I've,

1598
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:01,730
I've stood on the ice to it
on the shoulder of giants.

1599
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:06,170
You guys all talk about me being, I
invented calculus, not bad Isaac who said,

1600
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:09,410
by the way, as big as accomplishment,
it was lifelong celibacy. Not, not,

1601
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,390
not calculus.
He was like my biggest compliment.

1602
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,780
It wasn't that I invented the concept
of gravity and spatial relationships.

1603
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:19,310
It's a, that I was celibate my whole
life. That's what cool. Yeah. I was like,

1604
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:22,280
really? You have one chick sucked his
dick would have ruined everything,

1605
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:27,060
but did didn't have to be the father
of modern physics, modern science. But,

1606
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:29,750
but he said, but, but that's what
I'm saying is that we've all,

1607
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,100
we all stand on each other's shoulders.

1608
01:28:31,101 --> 01:28:35,870
It seems that we are evolving in our
understanding of more and more of how even

1609
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:38,240
animals think. And of course, you know,

1610
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,970
we're certainly evolving
everything point to this evolution.

1611
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,860
I hope I always have said that.

1612
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:46,340
I think that we're probably becoming
something through technology and the human

1613
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:49,340
beings are probably just
like a caterpillar that
becomes a butterfly but just

1614
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:50,840
doesn't know what it's doing.
While it's doing it.

1615
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,670
All our natural instincts
towards materialism and
greed and selfishness and and

1616
01:28:54,671 --> 01:28:55,070
you know,

1617
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:59,090
all these monkey instincts that we have
leftover perhaps working in a natural

1618
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:02,010
order to move us towards
this ultimate goal, like

1619
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,980
some sort of technological
we're making for example.

1620
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,260
I mean that's where Kurt's well
believes. He believes that, you know,

1621
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:10,110
it's going to be some sort of an
artificial technology and artificial

1622
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:14,040
intelligence that we can download our
consciousness into and that you will exist

1623
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:18,870
forever in perpetrate in this, you know,
artificial environment. How does, yeah,

1624
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:21,180
there you go. That's a class. Does
that mean it means the matrix?

1625
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:22,350
I mean you're talking craziness.

1626
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:24,810
Not only now you're talking about if
you can duplicate your consciousness,

1627
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:27,840
you could duplicate it in an infinite
amount of times and it will exist.

1628
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:29,760
Not here in this physical space,

1629
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:34,080
but it will exist in some sort of cyber
world where you will constantly be in

1630
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:37,950
like a a replaying life now
that in an infinite number of,

1631
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:39,870
and not only that we will ultimately end,

1632
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:44,760
truly be connected and our experience
will be, we are, but we are now.

1633
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,150
It's just,

1634
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:48,570
it's in a weird way and I think the reason
why it's set up in a weird way as to

1635
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:52,320
encourage competition, you know,
the thing that bugs people the most,

1636
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:56,100
the things that is losing, you know, the
thing, losing anything, losing a person,

1637
01:29:56,101 --> 01:30:00,660
losing, you know, losing your job, losing,
losing, losing a fight, losing in a game.

1638
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,080
It's frustrating for us.
We're designed for competition.

1639
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:07,230
Some people so much so that you beat
them at pool and they get mad at you.

1640
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:10,770
You never ever been around that
guy. Beat him at pool. But, but see,

1641
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:12,330
I like to ask the next question though.

1642
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:15,720
Like losing the defining that really
actually I think in some ways not isn't

1643
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:17,550
just losing your power in a way.

1644
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:22,320
Losing his to be left alone in a way to
be sure you're not special and another

1645
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:23,610
form of what we believe you.

1646
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,090
And so I think that's ultimately
why people hate losing so much.

1647
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:29,250
It's that memory of feeling alone.
It's that.

1648
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:33,150
But there's also a strong desire for
competition among, amongst most people.

1649
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:36,390
How many comics do you know that when
they see someone else get something,

1650
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:40,960
something big, they actually get upset
that it's not happening to them. I do.

1651
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:45,830
You're the only successful comic I've
ever heard comics not talk bad about you.

1652
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,850
I think that's ridiculous.
People have talked bad about me.

1653
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:51,590
Lots of people are not really not
comics. Go talk to mark Marin. Nah,

1654
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,880
you don't hear comics say bad
things about you. I've never,

1655
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,300
and I know what the point I'm
making is that you're right. I mean,

1656
01:30:57,301 --> 01:31:00,120
for the most part I'm, I'm, I'm
saying that you're right. People when,

1657
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,990
when somebody actually does well,
if it's a comic they get,

1658
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,220
they get a lot of times. Yeah, a lot
of times different deserve sometimes.

1659
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,000
Especially when you're young and scrappy
and you're all coming up in the same

1660
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,950
order. You know, like you're all like 22,

1661
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:16,890
23 and one of these 22 year old guys gets,
uh,

1662
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,760
some radio show where he's the morning
Dj guy and like, all fuck, you know,

1663
01:31:20,761 --> 01:31:24,020
he's the morning Dj guy had Katie la now
or whatever. You know what I mean? Like,

1664
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:27,060
and then all of a sudden you like,
dudes feel like that could have been them.

1665
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,670
Sure. You know? And then what they
have to understand also, by the way,

1666
01:31:29,671 --> 01:31:33,310
is that this is not a linear process.
This,

1667
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:37,530
this world is made of a whole bunch
of nonlinear luck and mathematics.

1668
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:40,530
And all you say is that because you're
a very experienced guy and you've gone

1669
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:43,560
through so many things in so many
different projects and so, I mean you've,

1670
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:46,740
you've, you've gone through the
Tour de force of, of television.

1671
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,890
He did a sketch show and mad TV.
You've done family shows on, on,

1672
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:52,830
on those Warner brothers networks,
right?

1673
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,040
You've done fucking for everything you
did sex in the city. You know, you've done

1674
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,680
so many different things.

1675
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:04,830
You've really had a broad like view
of the whole entertainment scene done.

1676
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:10,300
A lot of people just don't get, they
don't get that. So when you're young,

1677
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:14,110
especially like all you know is, I want
to fucking make it. I got to make it.

1678
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:18,010
I gotta pay my bills. I got
to your fucking freaking
night shit. He got it. Fuck.

1679
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:20,530
Why didn't he remember that? By the
way? I remember being terrified.

1680
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:23,350
I wasn't gonna make it. I remember
thinking, that's not an option for me.

1681
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:26,530
Like it wasn't an option for us
to be working well, all of us,

1682
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:29,590
I think anybody who actually became a
comic, you had to deal with the fact that,

1683
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:32,860
man, if I put my eggs in this basket,
this shit my turn turn out terrible.

1684
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:36,700
How might just live in rotten eggs
in the air. Nothing. It's terrifying.

1685
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:40,000
It's completely terrifying. But
my point is that like, you know,

1686
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:41,290
like in show business like that,

1687
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:46,291
the whole idea of like pursuing it and
like go and after it is absolutely of

1688
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:49,210
course uncertain,
but it has to be uncertain.

1689
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,230
It's uncertain because that's the only
way we're like real queer adventure.

1690
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,530
Creativity comes from something.
It blossoms out of that uncertain.

1691
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:58,750
If you knew it was going to happen
and you had it all plotted out,

1692
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,920
it'd be boring as fuck.

1693
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,530
When you got that for you and it's pouring
for that and you'd have to do drugs,

1694
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:03,460
you'd have to start doing coke.

1695
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:07,210
I think that's why people like when they
take a Gig for the money, for example,

1696
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:11,950
like they go, well, you're going to be $7
million to do a talk show, a game show.

1697
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:16,770
They really do pay a price for that. Yes,
you, you, you got to keep the uncertainty.

1698
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:19,150
Dude.
I paid a price for fear factor for sure.

1699
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:22,300
I love doing that show and it was a lot
of fun and I loved making all that money

1700
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:23,560
and I'm happy I did it,
but man,

1701
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:26,980
there was a lot of days that I didn't
want to do that and I thought this is

1702
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:31,000
hokey or this is silly or this is
like God, this is, it became a job,

1703
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:34,480
which is nothing wrong with revolve
respectable. We don't make fun of horse.

1704
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,990
We all, we were all horse in some ways.
We all hoard before is what I'm saying.

1705
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:41,550
Sure. And but what am I, my whole point
about the whole competition thing about,

1706
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,200
I think that all of that,

1707
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:47,170
it's all set up that way on purpose and
then like show Biz competition and in

1708
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,680
the standup comedy competition, even
martial arts competition, like these guys,

1709
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:52,510
when they started trash talking
each other on the Internet,

1710
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:55,360
you know how I look at it when I look
at like two fighters are about to trash

1711
01:33:55,361 --> 01:33:58,240
talk each other. I look at it like
birds that are squawking at each other.

1712
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:02,770
Like one birds is on the fence and then
the other bird like fucking flaps its

1713
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:06,280
wings. It gets close to it. It's like
this natural thing that they're doing,

1714
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:10,060
like they have to do this to in
order to motivate them to be great,

1715
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:13,920
in order to push them all to the next
level, you have to feel the jealousy.

1716
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,280
Madison who said, you know, I
always wondered who I leave,
was talking, talking to,

1717
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,160
and he said I'm the greatest.

1718
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:21,280
And then I realized one day he was
talking to himself. Oh yeah. He said,

1719
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,430
he said to train, cause you know, I'm,

1720
01:34:22,431 --> 01:34:24,810
I'm scared to death every time
I step in that ring. But I,

1721
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,700
but I get myself worked up
and by the time I'm in there,

1722
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:28,760
I believe what I'm saying am I,

1723
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,570
that's the saddest thing in the world
at Muhammad Ali is the way he is now.

1724
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,680
That's a great note. And that, you know,

1725
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,290
it's Parkinson's and he has
trauma related Parkinson.

1726
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:38,410
What's amazing also is that he doesn't
hide it from the world. They'd get,

1727
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,540
the guy holds the torch, the
Olympics. He just gets up in front of,

1728
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:44,350
everybody hears me. You know, it's weird
listening to Mike Tyson talk these days.

1729
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:47,740
If you heard Mike Tyson talk,
I haven't just got a reality show now.

1730
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,400
He got an interview with this
reality show on, on pigeons.

1731
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:56,370
But he got interviewed at this, uh, there
was a showtime boxing match recently. No.

1732
01:34:56,410 --> 01:35:00,620
Yeah. Well the paper view match
between Miguel Cotto and um, uh,

1733
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,240
we're caught in Majorca
and it was a good fight.

1734
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:06,300
And they interviewed the Tyson Kodo. Did.
He stopped him in the last round. Um,

1735
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,980
and they, they talked to Tyson
about it and Tyson like, you know,

1736
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:13,400
it was like he was laboring to talk,
you know, and I was listening to him.

1737
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,800
I was like, wow, maybe he's just
tired and maybe they caught, yeah,

1738
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:18,850
you might have been high as fuck.
That's true because catch me,

1739
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,730
I might look like a braid down. Nice.
Mostly if ever met a fight. You know what?

1740
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:24,180
I don't have to do commentary.
God,

1741
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,170
I love going to fights when I don't have
to do commentary because these guys,

1742
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,170
when we, whenever we go to the
UFC, Brian and Orient Joey,

1743
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:34,780
if these guys take pot cookies and get
blue grieved. So they're sitting up.

1744
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:38,030
Last time was acid.
So they're sitting up in the stands.

1745
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:41,990
I kind of have in the fucking time. Joey
Diaz has does the commentary, right?

1746
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,880
Joey Diaz,
just like in the middle of fights,

1747
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:48,940
he'll start just rants and raves about
this happened and that happened. So Ben,

1748
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:52,130
especially if somebody gets knocked out
or somebody gets submitted, I don't,

1749
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:54,560
what the fuck did I tell you?
A dog, he'll get up and go cry.

1750
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:59,240
But I don't get to see that anymore.
I do, you know? Do you know what,

1751
01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:03,830
did you really truly feel comfortable
calling a fight in the UFC?

1752
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:07,180
When did it really start to Gel? Because
it just comes out of you now. Um,

1753
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:09,860
you know, the first couple of times I
was self conscious about it. You know,

1754
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:13,010
it's weird you're trying to do a good job,
but you don't want to be,

1755
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:17,390
there's a lot of ego involved in
commentary that's very unpleasant.

1756
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,700
Like you hear people talking too much
about themselves or what take yourself

1757
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,830
what they would do. Well, I have to,
first of all, I'm completely illegitimate.

1758
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,281
I mean,

1759
01:36:25,281 --> 01:36:29,120
I'm a brown belt in Jujitsu and I fought
and some taekwondo and some kickboxing,

1760
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:33,290
but I've never found any MMA fights at
all. So I, I, what am I going to say? Oh,

1761
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,920
I could do better than this. You
know what I mean? It's silly. I'm,

1762
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:38,580
I'm completely objective about it.
But I,

1763
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:43,630
it took a while for me to be
comfortable with like how I should,

1764
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:44,271
you know,

1765
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:47,180
what I should talk about and what I
shouldn't talk about and when to talk,

1766
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:50,510
when not to talk. And you know,
it had a, how to like get,

1767
01:36:50,511 --> 01:36:55,511
be as respectful as possible but yet be
as objective and analytical as possible

1768
01:36:56,121 --> 01:36:57,590
about what's happening,
you know,

1769
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:02,570
so you have to walk a fine line between
critiquing fighters and criticizing them

1770
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:07,690
or a obsessing patterns that you see
in movement and critiquing behavior and

1771
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:11,660
training regiments and shit like that.
So it's, it's, it's tricky. It's tricky,

1772
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:16,661
but I always do it from a place of
respect and I always do it from a place of

1773
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:20,480
as, as objective as I'm capable. You're
very good at doing, it's fun to do.

1774
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,170
I didn't Goldie's is,
is a poet that, yeah,

1775
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:26,450
it's just amazing what a lot of people
don't know. It's like they'll say, Goldie,

1776
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:28,280
Phil, you've got to fill
here. Got to fill here.

1777
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,980
They'll say they'd say that
to our headsets. So Goldie,

1778
01:37:30,981 --> 01:37:34,460
we'll start just going off about
this fucking arena that we're in.

1779
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:38,710
That was built in 18 fucking 12 and he's
off the top of his head and band aids

1780
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,030
and he just does it make perfectly,
you know,

1781
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:46,850
1912 he might've stumbled once in the
thousand fights that we wrote those lines

1782
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:48,650
out and they're just perfect.

1783
01:37:48,651 --> 01:37:52,730
Sometimes he doesn't say the correct
thing when it comes to like the technique

1784
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:53,421
or something like that,

1785
01:37:53,421 --> 01:37:56,010
but that's okay because I can
correct him and he just trying

1786
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,020
to get things going.
Like he's just trying to,

1787
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,780
you know who's you know who he is by the
way. I don't know if you've ever seen,

1788
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:01,201
you know,

1789
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:04,500
it was the best improviser I've ever
seen in my life and a guy who can take a

1790
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:08,640
topic and do 30 minutes of stand up
on it and do whatever is Adam Carolla.

1791
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:13,800
Oh yeah. Evil rambled pro. That's why
he's so good as a Pocho a podcast host,

1792
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:18,000
that guy, you give them a
subject, here's the thing. Okay.

1793
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:23,810
All for you having your coffee and he'll
just like have some goes off 20 minute

1794
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:26,540
rant about what's wrong with like,
you know,

1795
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:30,560
he did something about twist ties
about twist ties. Like, well,

1796
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:33,060
what was it like twist ties.
Like how strong are these things?

1797
01:38:33,061 --> 01:38:34,010
And they should be you.
Like,

1798
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,470
she'd cover up those soldiers in Iraq
with twist ties. I mean, he just,

1799
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:38,340
he's amazing.

1800
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:41,680
It's coming up with just like free
form and like entire jokes I said,

1801
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:42,870
and we got off. I go, I got,

1802
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:46,500
we did a movie together and I go and
we were on set and I go, you know what?

1803
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,860
I said, I've decided you're, you're,

1804
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:54,570
you might be the best in the
world at what you do. And he goes,

1805
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:58,420
what do you mean? I said, I think
you're the best improviser and a good,

1806
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:02,460
best guy I've ever seen at Improv.
The way you do your Improv. I'm never,

1807
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:04,770
I think you're the best in the world.
He goes, oh, I don't know. I go,

1808
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:07,020
somebody has got to be
the best. So, um, you're,

1809
01:39:07,021 --> 01:39:10,200
you're getting the trophy I'm good
at. So he goes like this. He goes,

1810
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:12,410
so apparently this is the podcast,
next thing, cause you know, you know,

1811
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,150
I know I like that guy,
Brian cow guy.

1812
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,910
And he told me I might be the best
improviser in the world and I thought,

1813
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:20,910
you know why not? So I got home and I
looked at my wife and I was like, hey,

1814
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:22,880
how come? No, I don't
smell any pot. Roast wise,

1815
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:26,520
my dick in your mouth for crying saying
I'm the best guy in the world and Improv.

1816
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:31,690
And he's like, recognize any Brian
counts. Said it. So it's true. He's a guy,

1817
01:39:31,691 --> 01:39:35,460
he's really found success with this whole
podcast format. He's also a great guy.

1818
01:39:35,461 --> 01:39:38,760
He's a great guy. Good guy.
He's an interesting dude.
He's really into cars, man.

1819
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:42,750
He's got the dope. Who's on
Raj? Man, is he very good.
Did you ever box with him? No,

1820
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:45,870
but I've heard guys who fight like guys,
he's actually a ringer.

1821
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:48,660
You'll get in a ring. And it
really, it was a real, I believe it.

1822
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,290
He's good at everything.
He's a great carpenter.

1823
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:54,870
He like fucking remodels his house and
shit builds additions on his own real

1824
01:39:54,871 --> 01:39:59,600
American. He has a real Alec Baldwin
read far before he went crazy. And, and,

1825
01:39:59,601 --> 01:40:02,900
and this guy might be my Adam Carolla
has the dopest garage mountain.

1826
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:06,930
He's got like one of those garages. Yeah.
But I'm, mine was built for a TV show.

1827
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:10,030
You got to pee pee.
But I'm Carolla's garage is like a,

1828
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:14,820
he's got like a fucking Ferrari there.
A like a classic BMW m three.

1829
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:18,130
He's got a Mustang back there.
He's got a Lamborghini back there.

1830
01:40:18,131 --> 01:40:21,000
I think he's kind of like
a classic Lamborghini.

1831
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:25,140
It was just like really fucking into
like machines and cars and shit. What's,

1832
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,870
what's going on with Kevin Smith?
What's this talk on top of? He was,

1833
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,320
he said he wanted to get together and do
a podcast and he said, uh, we should uh,

1834
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,920
smoke pot. Talk about news radio. I'm
like, fuck yeah, I would love to a man.

1835
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,630
So I messaged him, but when you get,
and here's the thing, when people say,

1836
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:42,990
how come nobody moves Mitch Book with
me, Buck, I'm not on Twitter all day.

1837
01:40:42,991 --> 01:40:46,850
I tried to go on and post
things when I have time. And,

1838
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:49,500
but a lot of times I'm fucking busy.
And when you have like,

1839
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:54,501
I think now I'm up to 283,000

1840
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:59,020
bitch, what am I looking? Just because
you don't have that many, excuse me.

1841
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:04,021
283,982 so almost 284,000 there's no
way I can keep up with the replies.

1842
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:09,340
There's the, if you don't look at it
for an hour, there's 1700 replies.

1843
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:12,580
And so what do you do? Do you do read
them all? I can't. I don't have the time.

1844
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:14,530
It's impossible.
Some of those people listen,

1845
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:19,210
bitch got to earn them shit.
My Dad says he's not.

1846
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,750
He doesn't have a podcast.
How's that going to get so famous?

1847
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,110
Going to be cool though.
If you could give them like,

1848
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,610
I'll give you 50,000 people on Twitter.
Yeah.

1849
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:30,190
And then all of sudden they'd be
getting your goofy ass. I hate cats.

1850
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:34,540
What's wrong with this guy? This new
IPAD by the way? Fucking awesome.

1851
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:38,170
I think you'll use it more.
Why they using the market as a camera?

1852
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:42,310
The camera's shit is so bad ass fucking
sitting there doing facetimes and shit

1853
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:45,580
like that were 13 year old girl,

1854
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,910
little girl looking at my face.
You could,

1855
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:53,890
we could transplant your brain into a
13 year old lesbian so easily. It's hot.

1856
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:57,530
The camera's bad ass. You
are loving it. I'm loving it.

1857
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:02,380
It's at the other one was good but then
the no camera thing just really made me

1858
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:05,950
never want to use it that much. Really?
Yeah cause that was a big part at all man.

1859
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,850
I only use it for watching things like
when I was getting tattooed I use it to

1860
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:14,650
watch TV shows and I use it to for reading
books. Yeah know he's a friend. What?

1861
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:17,810
What's that iPad? Yeah. I don't have one.

1862
01:42:17,811 --> 01:42:21,160
I'm just going to get the air book cause
I traveled but do I need an iPad? Yeah,

1863
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:24,200
that's an Arabic. You don't need one. This
is a little Mac book. Little tiny arrow.

1864
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:26,990
It's a light light pussy bro.

1865
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,870
I get a 17 inch and I carry
that shit over my shoulder.

1866
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,080
I don't even bother putting the
backpack on. Dude. I do squats.

1867
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:37,400
I do kettle bells on a regular sun step.

1868
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,830
One time you said to a
bus full of fighters?

1869
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:42,110
I remember it was like
the four back in the UFC.

1870
01:42:42,111 --> 01:42:44,600
Literally when Randy called to
our foot view to our Belfour,

1871
01:42:44,601 --> 01:42:46,690
it's like back in those
days like 20 gunner,

1872
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:48,830
we were in Tennessee or
baton rouge or something.

1873
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,080
And I remember walking into the venue,
remember that like how,

1874
01:42:52,081 --> 01:42:55,220
how ghetto it was back in
the day like just and Randy,

1875
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:59,570
we were actually that
anyway, but um, you go, uh,

1876
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,550
they were talking about training
techniques and you were like,

1877
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:04,130
I like to get into horse dance and uh,

1878
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:06,350
put my boss inside my
body and read Nietzsche.

1879
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:09,650
I think Emmanuel steward
was that like be like,

1880
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:11,300
everybody's like all these fighters,
no sense here.

1881
01:43:11,301 --> 01:43:13,010
But they all look through like this.
They're like,

1882
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,980
oh is he saying what he's saying?
Cause you weren't really that famous yet.

1883
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,540
Really?
Like I like to get in the horse stance,

1884
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:20,930
pushed my balls and my body and read,
read Nietzsche.

1885
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:24,200
Everyone's like see fucking serious.

1886
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:27,440
Cause you were kind of squat and they
didn't look, didn't laugh at me at all,

1887
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:30,500
but I got into a squat position too.
I've gone to that horse dance.

1888
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:35,060
I was fucking done. There was no room
for humor in those early UFC. Nah Man,

1889
01:43:35,061 --> 01:43:35,894
that was just,
I was,

1890
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:39,170
I was also the post fight interview
or it wasn't a commentator,

1891
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:42,980
so no one got to see my sense of,
you know, when we were with tank and,

1892
01:43:42,981 --> 01:43:45,350
and we're all those guys. And you
were just like, be be careful.

1893
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:46,610
Don't be a jackass around tank.

1894
01:43:46,611 --> 01:43:49,860
I don't know what he might tank
will implode your skull speech.

1895
01:43:49,861 --> 01:43:51,980
Well just beat your ass. You know,
like, you know Brian don't be it.

1896
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,520
Don't be like, Hey, thank
hang, hang Handley. I'm going
to tweak your nose tank.

1897
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:00,690
We'll put you to sleep. He
puts me to sleep, go to jail,
ignore normal, kill you,

1898
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:01,430
kill you.

1899
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:04,970
He might definitely changed the way you
look at the world or shaking his hand

1900
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,870
and, and, and it felt, I've never
felt the hand that strongest is,

1901
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,830
he was just a burger.
How about thinking about dude's like,

1902
01:44:09,831 --> 01:44:14,150
we were talking about how bad ass mayhem
as you were fucking around with mayhem.

1903
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,240
And uh, I said, well, I want to watch the,

1904
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,680
show you a video of who some are
Paul Horace submitting. Ma'Am.

1905
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,430
Just think that someone can do that to
a guy as good as Ma'am as good and as

1906
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:27,140
strong as mammals. There's just
levels, level levels upon levels.

1907
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:31,820
I'm a bad balloon. That guy's a silver
back. That's how it is. You know,

1908
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,490
I'm a Saluki engine.

1909
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,740
The first dude that fucking stumble
across gorillas because that did happen by

1910
01:44:36,741 --> 01:44:40,190
the way, as far as western humans
that, you know, as far as white people,

1911
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,800
that's right. That, that like they were,

1912
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:45,470
the gorillas were a myth until like
the 18 hundreds, right. In Indonesia,

1913
01:44:45,471 --> 01:44:50,180
a guy had a woke up, uh,
uh, male, uh, orangutan up,

1914
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:54,720
woke them up and think fleet flipped
out and grabbed him by the hair.

1915
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,930
It got kind of long hair thicken and
he's grabbing my hair and just, yeah,

1916
01:44:57,940 --> 01:45:00,290
Yang and,
and scalped him,

1917
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:05,270
they took all his just rip and
Scout. I'm like, he freaked out.

1918
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:10,190
I pulled this a hair off and,
and, and, and then ran off
into the trees. Oh my God.

1919
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:12,710
So he had no scalp. That's
right. So what they do,

1920
01:45:12,711 --> 01:45:16,880
they have to like skin graft was
head are fucked in Indonesia.

1921
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:21,410
You know, I would just die
of staph infection today. I
am surprised like, you know,

1922
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:23,540
I think in the crazy thing
is gorilla to the biggest,

1923
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:27,230
but they don't even eat meat.
They're all vegetarian. That's right.

1924
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:32,050
It's called genetics. My friend. I
knew. Watch them and watch those grills.

1925
01:45:32,051 --> 01:45:35,900
You can stand right next to him because
there's it's plex. Watch them wrestle.

1926
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,150
All they do when they're
little is wrestle.

1927
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:42,650
All they do is roll around and they have
arm drags. Duck unders. I'm not kidding.

1928
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:47,510
Real. It locks guillotines I swear to
God they put you in their guard. I swear.

1929
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:50,270
So I'm telling you that,
that the man who invented you too.

1930
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:52,670
It's just hitting and Gracie
Helio. Well, sort of. I mean,

1931
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:56,600
there was Japanese Raf scores first
of course, but he, he, you know,

1932
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:59,300
after he could find a helio and Carlos,
I would,

1933
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:02,420
I wouldn't be surprised if one day
they were watching gorillas row,

1934
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,770
watch them play. It is there. So
they're, they're the perfect wrestlers.

1935
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,470
They're so efficient for wrestling.
They're so efficient.

1936
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,770
It's just so weird that they're
so big and that the plants, why?

1937
01:46:12,771 --> 01:46:15,680
Because a silverback is not six feet tall,

1938
01:46:15,681 --> 01:46:20,570
maybe six feet tall and weighs 600
pounds. Fat Free, ladies and gentlemen,

1939
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:24,980
no fed on this giant fucking monstrous
arms and hope. What does all that for?

1940
01:46:24,981 --> 01:46:28,160
Is it all just to keep things from fucking
with it? It must be, I don't know, man.

1941
01:46:28,161 --> 01:46:31,910
It's just, cause they don't kill any,
they don't really swing through trees.

1942
01:46:31,911 --> 01:46:35,390
They're just, and they're not really
aggressive. They have little dicks. Yep.

1943
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,790
And they have little dicks. I have a
bigger dick than a 600 pound gorilla.

1944
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:42,410
She's a Samson. So, uh, let's think
about that though. 600 pounds,

1945
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:47,330
that's a, that's a lot of
weight. And then, and then
there's the polar bear. Yeah.

1946
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,980
Which would eat a gorilla.
Yeah. What the fuck do you

1947
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,520
think a polar bear could
eat a gorilla? Yeah. Really?
Yeah. Oh, what do I think so?

1948
01:46:53,521 --> 01:46:57,570
I don't know. I would have ever done
that. They 15 to 16 to 1700 pounds.

1949
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:59,600
Is that what a polar bears? Some of
the little girls because he got down,

1950
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:01,580
but they stand. They stand
10 feet or higher. They're,

1951
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:05,160
they're bigger than a basketball. Go to
a basketball hoop, try to touch the rim.

1952
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:09,270
And they're bigger than that. When they
stand in their court on their hind legs.

1953
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:14,160
Um, yeah. They take down,
they take down things like elk
with their mouths. Uh, yeah.

1954
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:17,430
You will kill the whales. You ever seen
them eat pilot whales through the ice?

1955
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:21,900
I have no doubt. The polar bears have big
penises. I Dunno, it's a good question,

1956
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,170
but they'll kick the shit out
of aggression. Rock solid.
Question, question Brian.

1957
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:27,390
Thank you. Hold that question for a
second. We'll put that on the wall.

1958
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:31,410
Polar bears are scary as fuck. If you're
in Alaska, if you see one, you better run.

1959
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:36,210
Big Carnival. Biggest biggest land
carnivore actively targets human beings,

1960
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,090
human beings,

1961
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:42,240
they will make a beeline for you is a
terrifying story that I read once about

1962
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:46,710
these guys that were in a boat and the
boat hit an iceberg and the boat starts

1963
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:47,340
to sink.

1964
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:51,000
So they sent out a distress signal and
they climbed off the boat onto an ice

1965
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:55,470
shelf. You heard a story? Yeah, I know.
All of us. There's a few researchers,

1966
01:47:55,471 --> 01:47:58,850
I forget the number, but there was
more than three terrible story and uh,

1967
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:03,870
this polar bear saw them and kept diving
off one ice sculpture to the next,

1968
01:48:03,871 --> 01:48:08,140
getting closer and closer sizing them
up until finally he was on the one ice

1969
01:48:08,141 --> 01:48:11,250
sculpture, jumping around. There was
screaming the yelling, the polar bear.

1970
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,870
I didn't give a fuck. He's like, hmm,

1971
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:15,840
make yourself hard to swap
them to eat some you bridges.

1972
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:20,960
And he came over and he was on the ice
ice sculpture of the Ice Island right

1973
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:24,030
next to them, jumped in the
water, got on their side,

1974
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:27,060
walked calmly up to the first guy
he'd get ahold of. They scrambled.

1975
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:29,850
Everybody stumbled over each other trying
to get out of the way. Grabs a guy,

1976
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:33,540
kills him right there.
Instantly grabs his limp body,

1977
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:37,560
jumps off the ice,
ice island into the water,

1978
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:40,260
swims over to the other one, just starts
eating. I'm right in front of them.

1979
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:43,110
And so he ate that one guy
and then help came and help.

1980
01:48:43,111 --> 01:48:45,950
Came in the next boat came when
the, the, you know, this distressed.

1981
01:48:45,951 --> 01:48:47,610
It was answered by the
time they got there.

1982
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:51,270
This guy was just rib cage popping
out of his fucking his jacket.

1983
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,840
I don't want to, I'm not really
interested in die that way. Thank you.

1984
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,770
Cause you're not doing anything. That's
a bear. Good luck. And a polar bear.

1985
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:03,360
Polar bears and fucking ocean. Do
they grab you by the neck? And I did.

1986
01:49:03,361 --> 01:49:05,280
They just shake a couple of times,
I guess sometimes.

1987
01:49:05,281 --> 01:49:07,770
Sometimes they just start eating.
You start eating you from the bikes up.

1988
01:49:07,771 --> 01:49:08,880
Like the guy from grizzly bear,

1989
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:14,130
seven minute audio tape time didn't go on
and go some eggs. Oh, those are my feet.

1990
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:17,540
My feet least that shit doesn't
my calves. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

1991
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:22,700
My Thei just taking
chunks out of your thigh.

1992
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,660
Ruthless. That youtube video of the woman
got too close to the polar bear's cave.

1993
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:32,400
Oh yeah. And it breaks her
leg. Yep. Brought her in Hana
soccer. Yeah. They're mean.

1994
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:37,200
They're also fast. Well they have to be
there live in fucking the frozen north.

1995
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:40,950
What a crazy place to live. They like
to clean up agents of the frozen north.

1996
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,100
You can't put a baby polar bear
or even a smaller polar bear,

1997
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:48,220
like an adolescent polar bear into
a cage with a big bear is what?

1998
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,900
It'll eat it. Oh yeah. Jack females
will keep those there. Their cubs,

1999
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,910
they'll dealt Dell run away from a male.

2000
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:58,360
A male will chase a female in her cubs
for two days trying to eat those cubs.

2001
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,180
She's fucking so I'll follow up.

2002
01:50:01,181 --> 01:50:06,181
Female running and keeping her cubs going
to get away from a male who sees them

2003
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:10,180
and says, I want to eat your babies
babe. Fuck. Cause she goes, guys,

2004
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:14,080
we've got to run. Let's run now. But why
is he still chasing us? I'm tired. Mommy.

2005
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,730
Shut up. This is, that's the school
of hard knocks by the way. Yeah.

2006
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:21,340
You think and you know Anelli both
fucking cubs to, they won't just eat one,

2007
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:22,600
let the other one free.
No,

2008
01:50:22,601 --> 01:50:25,330
he's going to kill that one and went out
after the next one or the other one is,

2009
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:27,570
you know, yeah, they have to
store up. They have the store.

2010
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:30,310
I'm just not doing a thing.
She's got to just go, ah,

2011
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,470
Randy Kaltura asked me
to go hunting with them.

2012
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:35,080
I'm going to go hunting with Randy
coture arts and we were going to go bear

2013
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:39,830
hunting, but I'm like, I want
to eat a bear man. I don't
want to eat a bare end. Um,

2014
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:42,820
it's, I couldn't do it anyway.
I would cancel substand updates.

2015
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:44,770
We're trying to figure out another
day to do it, but I'm like,

2016
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:48,460
let's kill something that I can eat. Black
bear or grizzly bear has a blackberry.

2017
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:52,000
You can, you can eat oily. Mean
taste like shit though, right?

2018
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:55,050
You say it's really good. It's oil.
Really. What does that mean? Oily mean?

2019
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:56,170
They say it's a very thick,

2020
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,260
that's what I call Mike and
I could imagine going gay
bear meeting with rate ray

2021
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,480
is gay bear hunting. Thank
you. Let's find some barriers.

2022
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:08,200
You find matching jacket.
You got your hunting gear.

2023
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:10,390
You're going to have been like the city.
You're like, what are we doing, dude,

2024
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:14,310
this guy's dressed like Bob Seger.
Let's take them down. Why do you smell?

2025
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,910
What do you smell like? Colona why
are you wearing eyeliner and why am I,

2026
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:23,290
why am I second your Dick Randy couture's,
the manliest man ever,

2027
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:26,860
and she's all in the hunting with
bows and running through the woods.

2028
01:51:26,861 --> 01:51:29,810
Who's doing the Eco Challenge? When he
stopped fighting for awhile, you know,

2029
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:33,670
which is running through the
fucking forest, the Pacific coast.

2030
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,010
He doesn't need it. He doesn't need
a bow and Arrow or anything else.

2031
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,710
He just does it and he just runs
a bad motherfucker, but he's a,

2032
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:41,050
he's a big hunter. He loved hunting,
so he's going to take me somewhere.

2033
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:44,770
We're going to go a, there's a hunting TV
show to do it with whenever I'm around.

2034
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:48,100
I've been around Randy couture
couple times and um, and I,

2035
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,330
whenever I'm around a guy like that,

2036
01:51:49,331 --> 01:51:52,290
I always feel a combination
of just awe and just,

2037
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:56,710
I feel a little bad about myself. Well
I always feel like Jesus, you know,

2038
01:51:56,711 --> 01:51:57,544
I always say when people say,

2039
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:59,530
why don't you [inaudible] movement
first of all because I don't want to.

2040
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:02,650
And two cause I'm old and then
in black and brown eco tours,

2041
01:52:02,651 --> 01:52:05,770
five years older than me, five
years. Yeah. It don't be a pussy.

2042
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:10,540
Joe has been it never been combat athletes
into their late forties before ever.

2043
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:13,380
Never. You never saw, he
never saw a 48 year old guy.

2044
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:14,630
Combination of a lot of things.

2045
01:52:14,670 --> 01:52:18,520
A lot of it's genetics too cause the guys
never injured, which is crazy. You know,

2046
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:21,580
you, you think about all of these
different types of cancer, the camps,

2047
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:25,060
sports science did a thing where he's
able to take the video like is vo Max as

2048
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,511
much higher?

2049
01:52:25,511 --> 01:52:28,420
Like he's able to assimilate oxygen
and it was mussels much better than,

2050
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:30,280
than most people.
Well makes sense.

2051
01:52:30,281 --> 01:52:34,090
He's a lifelong athlete and he was
always known. Even in the early,

2052
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:34,571
early days of competing.

2053
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:37,620
I've just breaking guys wills and that's
what he did to Vito Belfort as it's

2054
01:52:37,621 --> 01:52:39,520
imposed his will on Vitorin torn,
broken.

2055
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:43,270
Well that's fucking veto for a long
time. He's relentless. He keeps you.

2056
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:46,130
I'll go for the double leg on a
single lake then I, you know, then the

2057
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:50,110
beat you up against the case to this was
this Machita fight in Toronto's could.

2058
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,340
Very interesting because uh,
he,

2059
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:56,210
he really firmly believes that
Machida is fights on the outside,

2060
01:52:56,211 --> 01:52:58,040
but you can grab a hold of them
and when you grab a hold of them,

2061
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:00,500
Randy thinks he's just going to pin it
up against the cage and beat the shit out

2062
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:02,990
of. Randy couture is fighting,
fighting the Cheetah Brown.

2063
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:06,050
Meanwhile he's doing like the
expendables too. He's doing movies.

2064
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,270
He's a crazy fuck dude.

2065
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:12,990
And he's trying to get hunting trips and
Carl's called caliber like, Whoa, dude,

2066
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,700
I'm such a girl.
It's good to be around those guys.

2067
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:20,600
It's good to know that there's levels of,
of manliness out there.

2068
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,501
It's good to know.

2069
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:26,030
That's why sports petition young man are
very important because it teaches you

2070
01:53:26,031 --> 01:53:28,370
how tough you are not I've
talked to knock off you are,

2071
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:31,250
but also how the top of you're not and
you need to know both and you've got to

2072
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:32,900
know what other people
are willing to go through.

2073
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:34,820
The kind of pain that some
people willing to go through.

2074
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,090
You got to watch a strength thing, a real
live strength and conditioning program.

2075
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:41,600
You tell him you want to
be an MMA fighter. Okay, go
to the gym with Sean Sherk.

2076
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,570
Just watch him do that one starts. If
I watch him fucking, I don't need to,

2077
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:47,200
cause I was 17 and I went to Dan Gables
and tense of wrestling camp with the

2078
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:50,090
Hawkeyes and I,
and I remember limping for two weeks.

2079
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:53,450
I limped wake you up at
five in the morning and you
run sprints for an hour and

2080
01:53:53,451 --> 01:53:55,190
then you do live wrestling.
And I, that's what,

2081
01:53:55,191 --> 01:53:58,190
that's why I didn't want to
wrestle in college cause I went,

2082
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:00,560
if this is college athletics,
I don't want to do it.

2083
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,980
And what happened was I'd smell a mat
and I'd get my back would start to hurt.

2084
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:08,480
I got a psychosomatic injury. All right.
I bought, it was like, don't do that.

2085
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:12,230
I limped I the only time in my life I
kept looking at my plane ticket and I was

2086
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:14,030
going to fake an injury
so I could go home.

2087
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,400
High school wrestling and
making a fucking man out of you.

2088
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:19,730
I'll tell you though is that can't down
[inaudible] because you had to graduate

2089
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:23,660
and like a third of the camp of dropout
and his intense and and literally they

2090
01:54:23,661 --> 01:54:25,800
closed down I believe the next
year or the year after that. Well,

2091
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:29,150
they also were really encouraging people
to lose a tremendous amount of weight,

2092
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:33,530
which was terrifying and really
fucking terrible. You're young body,

2093
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:36,610
you know when you're 1415 years old,
you're in high school and your coaching,

2094
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:40,310
you're already lean and they're telling
you to lose 10 pounds of water and

2095
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:43,520
dehydration. You had to wrestle that day
too. It's not like the UFC. I did it too.

2096
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:46,100
It was awesome. I did it for talking
about no tournaments too. It's terrible.

2097
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:48,860
My friend did it his whole
high school career and he,

2098
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:52,790
he's like really short where everyone
else's family is tall. He's five,

2099
01:54:52,791 --> 01:54:55,100
six and everyone else in his family sucks.
Six foot,

2100
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:56,450
six foot two starving herself.

2101
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:58,790
He starved himself all
through high school through,

2102
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:02,660
through every fucking season
cause worse man. And he went to,

2103
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:05,900
in the off season he went to camps and
like he was like really trying to make it

2104
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:07,510
as a wrestler.
Boxers don't lose as much weight.

2105
01:55:07,511 --> 01:55:10,280
I do that cause they got to go 12 rounds.
You also have to take head blows.

2106
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,770
It's much more dangerous when
you take the highest blows. Yeah.

2107
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,530
That's when people get really
real serious brain damage.

2108
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:18,980
Like Gerald McClellan is a perfect
example of that. He's a guy used to be,

2109
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:22,610
you lose a lot of weight to
make his division. I think
he was light heavyweight.

2110
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:23,773
He used to,
he was,

2111
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,440
was a big guy and he would dehydrate
himself really bad and he didn't go about

2112
01:55:27,441 --> 01:55:28,131
it the right way.

2113
01:55:28,131 --> 01:55:31,700
And I don't know if they used Ivs back
in those days to rehydrate and now

2114
01:55:31,701 --> 01:55:35,000
they're pretty sophisticated about it.
They always give guys bags of Ivy,

2115
01:55:35,001 --> 01:55:37,490
like some guys will take six
seven eight bags. Oh really? Yeah.

2116
01:55:37,491 --> 01:55:41,390
They have to rehydrate and they pissed
like crazy and, but they feel much better,

2117
01:55:41,391 --> 01:55:45,150
much quicker as you gain a tremendous
amount of weight and like 24 hour period.

2118
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:47,700
Like there's a guy glaze
and t bow fights in the UFC.

2119
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:49,410
I don't know how he loses the weight.
I don't know what he does,

2120
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:53,700
but this mother fucker fights at one 55
and he looks like he's like one 90 he's

2121
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:58,320
fucking, you watch like a, it's
like, uh, what's the guy's name? Um,

2122
01:55:58,950 --> 01:56:03,180
uh, Anthony Johnson.
He walks, he's she 50.

2123
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:07,750
I did wonder. He was, he was fine
with one 70 again when I was,

2124
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,050
I was doing a movie with them in
Pittsburgh and he walked around with these

2125
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:12,900
shoulders. I was like, this dude. And
he's too, I said, how much do you weigh?

2126
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:15,660
It goes to 50 and I go, how are we going
to get out of the one 70? He's like,

2127
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:18,300
I'll make no problem. He's got
it down to a science. I was like,

2128
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:23,010
I don't know how the fuck, he's
enormous bones. He's a super athlete.

2129
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:26,610
That guy is, that's powerful. Standing
around you feel like just such a wimp.

2130
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,340
And he's an interesting guy
too because he's a wrestler,

2131
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:33,120
but he's really been working
primarily on his striking, you know,

2132
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:34,440
and he's knocking a lot of guys out.

2133
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,230
That was a big victory for cost
check and crosscheck beat him.

2134
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,510
I think a lot of that guy's
problem is that he, he has, uh,

2135
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:42,930
he gets really depleted
making that one 70.

2136
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:45,850
I think he'd be better served and one
85 I think a lot of guys would call.

2137
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:49,380
I think a lot of guys lose too much weight
and I think over the long course of a

2138
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:52,140
career, it's very dangerous.
Can I ask you that? Healthy,

2139
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,010
I don't know if you're allowed to say,

2140
01:56:53,011 --> 01:56:56,790
but is there going to be a GSP Anderson
Silva fight? They want to do that,

2141
01:56:56,791 --> 01:57:00,450
but what GSP has to get through Jake
shields, which has no fucking cakewalk.

2142
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:05,040
Jake shields is dangerous as fuck and he's
a winner and his Jujitsu is top notch.

2143
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:07,080
Jake, Jake shields can
submit anybody. Sure,

2144
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:11,750
but did GSP has proved that he is still
far and away these a bad motherfucker.

2145
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,571
No doubt about it.

2146
01:57:12,571 --> 01:57:16,080
But you can't discount Jake shields
who GSPs never fought Jake shields.

2147
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:19,560
I'm telling you, Jen shields,
look, he might be at GSP,

2148
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:21,480
might be able to keep the fun
in his feet and if he does,

2149
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:25,980
GSP is more than likely gonna
be far better on his feet.

2150
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:29,370
He's got way better striking. We put
her hands were better kicks and Jake,

2151
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:31,170
Jake is just all about
closing the distance,

2152
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:34,290
getting a hold of you and drag you to the
ground. And if he can't do that, yeah,

2153
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:37,830
he's in some trouble. He's going to
get boxed up. But if he can do that,

2154
01:57:37,831 --> 01:57:39,360
it becomes very interesting.

2155
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:43,290
It becomes very interesting because
Jake shields has competed at the very

2156
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:47,370
highest levels of the game in
grappling and submitted guys. In fact,

2157
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:52,110
in Abu Dhabi that submitted GSP, his
level of Jujitsu is quite a bit higher.

2158
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:56,940
But, but George is so
smart and he so defensively
intelligent and he's never been

2159
01:57:56,941 --> 01:57:58,170
submitted in them and they had before.

2160
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:02,010
So at least not as also
sells a punching in the face.

2161
01:58:02,011 --> 01:58:03,720
Yeah and elbow and you any strong as fuck.

2162
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:05,640
Fucking his wrestling is
outstanding to yeah, they say,

2163
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:08,490
I've talked to guys who trained with
them and they say that he's just,

2164
01:58:08,491 --> 01:58:10,980
he's really, really
strong, got super humble,

2165
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:14,760
he's got great strength and he's also
like really smart and he does things

2166
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:17,220
correctly and he's like super driven.
Like I told you,

2167
01:58:17,221 --> 01:58:18,630
we worked on that turning side kick thing.

2168
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:23,760
He talked to me afterwards like Joe at
practice did that thousand time I was on

2169
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:27,270
this set. They were like, this
guy's crazy and kicking the bag.

2170
01:58:27,271 --> 01:58:30,300
I'm telling you man, I'm going to get
it. Like he was like obsessed with it.

2171
01:58:30,301 --> 01:58:32,070
Like ever. You show
him a technique, he'll,

2172
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:33,990
he'll go over and go over
and next thing you do it,

2173
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:36,260
he'll probably be doing it
better than you who taught him.

2174
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,051
You know it's funny about that.

2175
01:58:37,051 --> 01:58:39,660
It's like that you see these people who
are great and they do these things and

2176
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:43,810
you think it's magic. They just work than
repetitions, obsession and repetition.

2177
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:44,441
And you know,

2178
01:58:44,441 --> 01:58:48,910
the same desire that gets you far in life
with that can also fuck you up if you

2179
01:58:48,911 --> 01:58:52,320
get addicted to everquest. You know,
it's the same sort of obsession. Could,

2180
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,130
can wind you up in a ditch if it becomes
something that's not productive for me.

2181
01:58:57,131 --> 01:59:00,310
I have done, I know you're probably the
same way. I have to manage my addictions.

2182
01:59:00,311 --> 01:59:02,230
I have to like,
be real careful to keep an eye on.

2183
01:59:02,231 --> 01:59:06,040
Is that intense as you are that way?
You've always been really,

2184
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:09,320
really obsessive. Well, it's a
problem. It's like, it's, it's,

2185
01:59:09,321 --> 01:59:13,360
it's not even a discipline. It's more
of a obsession. I'm disciplined, Kinda,

2186
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,260
I mean, I get things done, I'm
disciplined, but I really am as driven.

2187
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:19,180
There's a big difference
if I find something out,

2188
01:59:19,181 --> 01:59:21,870
like I'm not good at doing things
I don't want to do, you know,

2189
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:23,380
like I'm not good at
taking out the garbage.

2190
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:26,140
I'm not good at remembering to do
errands things and I'm supposed to do,

2191
01:59:26,141 --> 01:59:28,740
I'm not good at. But if there's
something I'm excited about it.

2192
01:59:28,741 --> 01:59:31,240
There's something that's uh,
that's uh, motivated about.

2193
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:34,120
Then I become obsessed with it
and then I'll become driven to,

2194
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:36,010
to get good at whatever
the fuck this thing is.

2195
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,890
So it's not even like a discipline thing.
It's almost like fun.

2196
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:42,910
I just know how to turn on the
crazy switch. Yeah, you're really,

2197
01:59:42,911 --> 01:59:45,580
really good at that,
but you got to manage that shit man.

2198
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:47,890
There's a lot of people that don't and
they get into gambling and then they

2199
01:59:47,891 --> 01:59:50,440
become fucking crazy with
blackjack or poker or

2200
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:53,670
I've always been really grateful that I
didn't have the kind of wiring that was

2201
01:59:53,671 --> 01:59:58,080
predisposed to the kind of negative
obsessions like that. Well,

2202
01:59:58,081 --> 02:00:01,230
you're self deprecating enough to the
point where you don't have to constantly

2203
02:00:01,231 --> 02:00:03,540
be the best guy in the
room. You know, you don't,

2204
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:08,190
you can have a good time no matter what.
Some guys enjoyed my friends' successes.

2205
02:00:08,191 --> 02:00:10,890
I've always thought, I've always found
it more inspiring than threatening.

2206
02:00:10,891 --> 02:00:13,470
I never,
I just think it's like intelligence.

2207
02:00:13,471 --> 02:00:15,760
It's like trying to
compartmentalize anything, you know?

2208
02:00:15,770 --> 02:00:18,100
Well that's why you're a healthy do to,
that's where you got funded.

2209
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:20,280
But it's like when I bought it, but it's
like courage. You know? Some people say,

2210
02:00:20,281 --> 02:00:21,990
well, I'm a coward. Well you're a coward.

2211
02:00:21,991 --> 02:00:23,730
Maybe you wouldn't get up
on stage and do stand up,

2212
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:27,330
but you'd fight six guys in a
bar and intelligence or talent.

2213
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:29,220
It's all the same stuff.
You're good at. You know?

2214
02:00:29,221 --> 02:00:31,460
Some people you just have to find
what you're good at. This shit.

2215
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,140
What's your role?
It might be to support talented people.

2216
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,940
It might be to be the one on stage.

2217
02:00:35,941 --> 02:00:39,050
It might be the one who comes up with
a microphone that you, that you use it.

2218
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:42,570
There's club, ours, there's an managers,
there's agents, there's comics.

2219
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:43,670
If you have children or stick.

2220
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,800
Your job is to try to nudge that child
in the direction of what he's supposed to

2221
02:00:46,801 --> 02:00:50,810
do anyway, whatever his primal impulses
are, you know, and you contemplate,

2222
02:00:50,811 --> 02:00:54,040
I mean you, you have kids now. Are you
actively thinking about that? Are Your,

2223
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:54,883
your daughters?

2224
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:58,200
My daughter and when I tried to do
with my daughter is provide two things.

2225
02:00:58,201 --> 02:01:01,260
One is love, unconditional
love, so she's not messed up.

2226
02:01:01,261 --> 02:01:06,261
But I also believe that a large part
of my job is to stand out of the way,

2227
02:01:07,201 --> 02:01:10,320
not to be a suppressive,
overwhelming personality for her.

2228
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:12,300
I don't want to be too
much of an influence.

2229
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,180
And the reason I don't want
is I want her to ultimately,

2230
02:01:15,181 --> 02:01:20,181
I think a great deal comes from having
to be independent and also feeling free

2231
02:01:21,121 --> 02:01:25,770
enough and not ashamed of
whatever it is you are.

2232
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:29,310
And so much of my childhood
and is now nobody's fault.

2233
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:33,180
But so much of my childhood
is when I think back on it,

2234
02:01:33,181 --> 02:01:37,020
even my young adult eight
years is fill full of kind of.

2235
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:40,940
But what I would describe as shame, I mean
certainly as confusion, but also shame,

2236
02:01:40,941 --> 02:01:43,730
just also this God,
I feel so different than most people.

2237
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,270
I'm a fuck up and I've got to get my
shit together. Well, no, I didn't.

2238
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:51,620
I actually had to just go deeper into
that. And so you know, to be a performer,

2239
02:01:51,621 --> 02:01:55,700
yes. But if you are a car salesman, yeah,
you would have had a problem. Sure. But,

2240
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:58,190
but I'm saying, yeah. You know
what I mean? It's like we were,

2241
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,250
we're lucky that this avenue exists.
Absolutely.

2242
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:03,260
I'm just saying you've got to find
whatever you're having new ones.

2243
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:05,960
And I think that, you know, people
say, well everybody has a path.

2244
02:02:05,961 --> 02:02:10,390
I don't know about that. But your job
as a young adult as a child is to tiny.

2245
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:14,300
Everybody could have a path. It's not
that everybody does that. Everybody.

2246
02:02:14,301 --> 02:02:16,700
Could you also,
you said something really profound,

2247
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:19,220
I've been thinking about a lot lately.
I thought it was really cool.

2248
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:22,040
You said it's one thing to
be really accomplished and
you've accomplished things.

2249
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:23,890
You be can go through all this stuff but,

2250
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:27,170
but the one thing you said that you're
the most proud of is accomplishing your

2251
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:32,150
peace of mind. And that is a very
separate, separate endeavor from,

2252
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,970
from trying to make money and
trying to make a name for yourself.

2253
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:37,390
Trying to be significant,
trying to be original, but that,

2254
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:42,520
but actually getting to a point where
you have peace of mind I think is equally

2255
02:02:43,551 --> 02:02:46,950
as important as any more
important than anything it is. Um,

2256
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,540
I'm happier now than I've ever
been at any point in my life.

2257
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:54,950
And I'm also nicer to people now than
at any point ever in my own life.

2258
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:58,490
And more conscious about
like biological maintenance,

2259
02:02:58,670 --> 02:03:01,550
making sure our workout on a regular
basis, making sure I'm healthy,

2260
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:04,780
all those things together with my luck,
figure it out anyway.

2261
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:08,450
Changed in some ways your personality in
a way. I mean you, you've changed, you've,

2262
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:13,510
you've actually made fundamental
changes in how you relate to other human

2263
02:03:13,941 --> 02:03:18,470
beings. I've seen that in you. A
lot of that is psychedelics and uh,

2264
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:22,340
and the tank Lieutenant Authority. It's
a combination of the tank recently. Yeah,

2265
02:03:22,341 --> 02:03:23,780
it was awesome.
Tell me about this.

2266
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:27,530
I end with this because we've been
talking for a long time, but tell me,

2267
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:31,040
tell me what your experience
was like. I uh, I got into the,

2268
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:36,160
to the salt water and it was really dark
and I just found people don't know this

2269
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:40,240
is a sensory deprivation tank.
We're talking about it. Yeah.

2270
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:41,120
And I thought two things.

2271
02:03:41,121 --> 02:03:44,080
I thought I was going to go restless and
I thought the other thing I was going

2272
02:03:44,081 --> 02:03:49,081
to get cold and then I thought I was
going to sink and art and in fact,

2273
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:53,150
um, I started to just focus
on my breath and sort of,

2274
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:57,550
it was very easy for me to kind
of disappear for real. And um,

2275
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:59,450
I think I stayed in there for two hours,

2276
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:03,410
but I could have stayed in there way
longer, way longer. People say, you know,

2277
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:07,250
you know, you, he said, I think the guy
said, you know, 15 minutes in or you know,

2278
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:11,420
or you might be in there for an hour,
but it might be hard for me. I could've,

2279
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:14,510
I could've just stayed in there.
It's amazing environment, isn't it?

2280
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:19,130
You need to get one of those. I think we
all need that. When you live in the area,

2281
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:22,370
she can go, yeah, and you can go to
that place all the time. But man,

2282
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:24,830
having one of your houses, this shit,
how often you change that water,

2283
02:04:24,831 --> 02:04:25,880
you don't have to,
you don't have to.

2284
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,180
It's only me that goes in it and there's
800 pounds of salt and nothing can live

2285
02:04:29,181 --> 02:04:32,190
in there. That's amazing. Yeah.
It's like it's, it's so dense. Yeah,

2286
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:33,650
it is is just like that.

2287
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:38,070
It's the most valuable program
ever or the valuable tool ever for

2288
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,300
reprogramming your mind,

2289
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:43,590
for looking at yourself and then in a
truly objective way and to be tethered,

2290
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:47,250
untethered rather from your life,
untethered from your,

2291
02:04:47,251 --> 02:04:49,290
your personal experiences
and able to look at them.

2292
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,470
Literally when you're inside that tank,
it feels like you're not there.

2293
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:57,090
It feels like you time has essentially
stopped. You're not getting any input.

2294
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:00,930
It might be going on without you
all rambling free in the world,

2295
02:05:00,931 --> 02:05:02,610
but in your life,
your,

2296
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:06,270
your life is all about how you relate
to everything that you see in your

2297
02:05:06,271 --> 02:05:09,720
environment, so having a chance
to be out of your environment,

2298
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,540
the only opportunity that
you have in the world,

2299
02:05:12,541 --> 02:05:14,850
that's the only environment
on the planet like that.

2300
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,600
When you can go and separate yourself
literally from your life and watch

2301
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:20,490
yourself if you don't know
what we're talking about.

2302
02:05:20,491 --> 02:05:22,110
We're talking about a
sensory deprivation tank,

2303
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:25,620
which was created by a psychedelic
pioneer from the fifties named John Lilly,

2304
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:28,710
who's this brilliant scientist
who was incredibly eccentric.

2305
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:32,790
And one of the things he wanted to figure
out was how to detach himself from his

2306
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:33,930
physical inputs,

2307
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:38,550
inputs of sound and feeling and seeing
things and how to figure out how to get

2308
02:05:38,551 --> 02:05:41,460
the mind literally away
from any input to the body.

2309
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:45,270
He realized that life is very distracting
and that you know conversations that

2310
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:47,370
you're having. If there's a bus
driving by right next to you,

2311
02:05:47,371 --> 02:05:50,340
it's hard to have that conversation.
The buses distracting things,

2312
02:05:50,341 --> 02:05:52,890
input is distracting and
when you were in the tank,

2313
02:05:52,891 --> 02:05:54,810
you are literally dealing with no input.

2314
02:05:54,990 --> 02:05:59,700
You have no hearing because your ears
are under water and it's a big heavy door

2315
02:05:59,701 --> 02:06:01,350
that's shut and it's pretty soundproof.

2316
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:05,580
You have no seen cause you're in total
blackness. You total complete darkness,

2317
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:05,891
you know,

2318
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:08,940
feel anything because the water's the
same temperature as your skin and the

2319
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:10,770
water has 800 pounds of salt in it.

2320
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:14,790
So you completely buoyant and it's
the most amazing environment, man.

2321
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:18,580
It goes into that. Really that was that,
that I think therefore I am right. Um,

2322
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,520
they carts so,
but,

2323
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:24,060
but that's always been disputed in the
sense that because you can imagine it

2324
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:28,260
doesn't mean indeed that it's
e that it's actually there.

2325
02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:31,710
Well then the question is
what is the imagination?

2326
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:35,640
This is the real question is what is
the imagination and our thoughts really

2327
02:06:35,641 --> 02:06:37,530
nonlocal when all you really,

2328
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:42,590
are you really just a biological antenna
that like picks up entropy in the air

2329
02:06:42,781 --> 02:06:46,260
that picks up creativity and
ideas and things. And these are,

2330
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:50,130
these are literally like woven into
the fabric of time all around us.

2331
02:06:50,131 --> 02:06:52,530
You know what that great mathematician
and won the fields medal said, right?

2332
02:06:52,531 --> 02:06:55,200
And he refuses to fields metal, which
is $1 million prize, I believe in.

2333
02:06:55,201 --> 02:06:57,030
It's like the Nobel prize for mathematics.

2334
02:06:57,030 --> 02:07:00,030
They couldn't find them Fadiman
Siberia year later. And he goes,

2335
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:02,890
why are you giving me the price that
you should be given the equation for us?

2336
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:04,290
I just,
I just have antenna.

2337
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:08,130
I'm wired a certain way and I
was able to channel the answer.

2338
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:11,920
I think it was a 350 page answer they've
been looking at. They, they, even the,

2339
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:16,080
even the problem had been conjectured
in like 1806 and they were trying to,

2340
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:19,450
the actual problem. Then he came up with
the answer and all these mathematician,

2341
02:07:19,451 --> 02:07:23,810
like this guy actually figured it out
after 300 years and he's just incredible

2342
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:26,370
really? And he goes, yeah,
yeah, but what, what are you,

2343
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:29,130
you're giving the prize to the,
to the radio.

2344
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:32,550
You should be giving it to the music.
They all say that. Every artist says that.

2345
02:07:32,551 --> 02:07:37,300
Every great writer says that they tune
into the, you know, it's, it's a tough,

2346
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:40,240
it makes me believe in any kind of God
or whatever you want to call it. A,

2347
02:07:40,241 --> 02:07:44,440
you know, a higher benevolent force of
some kind or at least something of beauty.

2348
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:49,330
I don't know. What was my point
that that, that, that we, we,

2349
02:07:49,331 --> 02:07:51,550
what is imagination? Well, thank you.

2350
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:55,990
This is my point was the
idea of imagination is very
strange because you have

2351
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:59,440
this idea, you have this, this thing
that comes in your mind. Wait a minute,

2352
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:03,070
if I do this and combine it with
that, Holy Shit. I just reinvent.

2353
02:08:03,071 --> 02:08:04,810
I just made a new invention
is going to be quick.

2354
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:09,070
This is going to revolutionize what you've
done is with this thing in the ether.

2355
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:14,160
You have pulled it out of that and now
it manifests itself in a physical form

2356
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:17,560
and alters human life.
It's good. It changes life.

2357
02:08:17,561 --> 02:08:19,570
Like all the things that
people have invented,

2358
02:08:19,571 --> 02:08:22,810
they had to initially think
up whether it's the car,

2359
02:08:22,811 --> 02:08:26,050
whether it's computers or this had
to be a thought in someone's mind,

2360
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:30,790
a creative idea or a conglomeration of
other ideas that have existed before.

2361
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:34,270
That's a common story thing
and they combine it and make
some new creative thing,

2362
02:08:34,271 --> 02:08:36,340
but whatever the imagination is,

2363
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:39,460
it eventually manifests
itself as an actual thing.

2364
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,510
So we don't look at that for
some of those other ones.

2365
02:08:42,511 --> 02:08:46,600
Frivolous imagination is also way
more important than what you consider

2366
02:08:46,601 --> 02:08:50,500
intelligence are amassing information.
Imagination is what moves history forward.

2367
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:55,250
It Gutenberg, Innovation, Gutenberg, when
he came up with a printing press, uh,

2368
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:58,180
even Freud when he came up with a
concept that you could figure out how the

2369
02:08:58,181 --> 02:09:02,860
human mind works. Einstein's
theory of relativity, Newton's
a, you know, calculus,

2370
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:06,130
these guys who were these seminal
thinkers who came up with,

2371
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,710
with even Karl Marx for that matter,
I'm not a communist,

2372
02:09:08,711 --> 02:09:12,160
but these guys who came up with these
sort of seminal concepts of, you know,

2373
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:14,800
how to restructure our society,
how to restructure our biology,

2374
02:09:14,801 --> 02:09:16,930
how to restructure our minds,
how to look at our minds,

2375
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:21,120
all those things from the man's
imagination and it and it and it,

2376
02:09:21,190 --> 02:09:24,520
and we leaped forward in some ways.
Not In a good way. In some ways.

2377
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:27,130
We came up with the atomic bomb.
Well, yeah, I mean, but the atom,

2378
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:30,280
but it's all the same thing, right?
It's all people and you know,

2379
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:35,260
whatever branch of study that they choose
to pursue, you know, they, they, they,

2380
02:09:35,290 --> 02:09:36,580
they create things.
That's right.

2381
02:09:36,581 --> 02:09:38,920
You know and it becomes
an actual physical thing,

2382
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:41,170
but what is the imagination
that's making that happen?

2383
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:43,680
Is it like a life form and was the point?
Yeah,

2384
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:45,730
and also what's the
point that the diagram,

2385
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:48,190
the the map of the universe
and we're supposed to follow,

2386
02:09:48,191 --> 02:09:51,760
he brought this podcast full
circle because we started
with that question and we

2387
02:09:51,761 --> 02:09:55,180
end with that question. Who knows?
Have imagination kids. This is,

2388
02:09:55,181 --> 02:09:58,900
this is our message folks. Just be fucking
nice to people. If we all were cool,

2389
02:09:58,901 --> 02:10:01,870
if everybody was like the
people in this room right now,

2390
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:05,950
if the whole world was made up of us
and we just ran into us everywhere,

2391
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,770
I mean I'm not, that's so
egocentric and ridiculous to say,

2392
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:13,270
but the mindset of what I'm talking about,
just be cool to people. Just be nice.

2393
02:10:13,271 --> 02:10:16,300
You know what the problem is? Sometimes
competition is the problem. Not only that,

2394
02:10:16,301 --> 02:10:19,630
sometimes she always has an idea that
they think is better for you. So example,

2395
02:10:19,631 --> 02:10:21,910
the board, the boat was that
certain people in Kansas say,

2396
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:25,450
let's start teaching intelligent design
and not evolution and we're going to

2397
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:28,300
teach your child that because it's better
for his soul and all of a sudden you

2398
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:29,860
go, wait a minute, you're
trying to be nice to me,

2399
02:10:29,861 --> 02:10:33,010
but I don't want that kind of Nice.
Yeah, that's the wrong kind of Nice.

2400
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,160
That's not what I'm talking about.

2401
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:36,410
Talking about people not
fucking with other people.

2402
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:40,220
Don't watch all of the people worry about
yourself. There's just so many of us.

2403
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:42,560
There's so many of us.
It's hard to get this all across,

2404
02:10:42,561 --> 02:10:47,390
but I firmly believe that we right
now are more advanced, more in tune,

2405
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:51,500
more tuned in than any other generation
has ever been before and a lot of is

2406
02:10:51,501 --> 02:10:54,620
because of stuff like this.
A lot of it is because of the podcast,

2407
02:10:54,770 --> 02:10:58,850
Internet things. You can read the, the
access to information, all these things.

2408
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:02,360
We were communicating in a
way with Twitter and with
Facebook and that no one's

2409
02:11:02,361 --> 02:11:03,050
ever done before.

2410
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:06,740
I think we're connected the
way we've never been before
in real time. Yeah. This,

2411
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:10,070
these things that we are, we're
all pushing together. It's a,

2412
02:11:10,071 --> 02:11:13,930
it's a fascinating time and I think human
beings culturally are evolving at a,

2413
02:11:13,931 --> 02:11:14,320
at a,

2414
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:19,130
an incredible race at an incredible pace
rather exponential technology certainly

2415
02:11:19,131 --> 02:11:22,960
to say. Yeah, that's still the nuttiest
thing about all this 2012 nonsense.

2416
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:26,090
It says fuck everything's
pointing towards that being real.

2417
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:29,180
Everything's pointing towards all these
fucking events happening in people

2418
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:31,940
changing and technology
accelerated an incredible pace.

2419
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:34,970
When we talked about earlier about the
center of every galaxy being a black hole

2420
02:11:34,971 --> 02:11:35,810
that we were talking about that,

2421
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:38,150
well that's what they're trying to do
with the large hadron collider there

2422
02:11:38,151 --> 02:11:39,260
making black holes.

2423
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:42,530
So the center of every galaxy is a black
hole and inside that black hole is a

2424
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:47,531
universe and then they're making universes
like what does the breaks out Matt,

2425
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:53,020
we are butterflies and we are on our way
to being the next thing you know there

2426
02:11:53,391 --> 02:11:56,300
was a caterpillar that became a butterfly
and that is the human. Did you want to,

2427
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:58,010
if you want an actually
great lecture on that,

2428
02:11:58,011 --> 02:12:02,210
it's called Homo ever lewdness and it's
by one Enrique is it could have ted.com

2429
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:03,141
and won and rake us.

2430
02:12:03,141 --> 02:12:05,690
We'll take you through a lecture called
Homo have alluded to and he talks about

2431
02:12:05,691 --> 02:12:07,220
how we're coming out with,
for example,

2432
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:10,070
eyes well that that right
now can see shadow and light,

2433
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:13,140
but they're going to pretty much pursuing
to be able to see underwater and in

2434
02:12:13,141 --> 02:12:16,250
the dark for a mile away and eventually
or is that can see a mile away.

2435
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:18,560
All that stuff and we're going to become,

2436
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:22,190
we're going to start to become machine
part machine as we come up with bio

2437
02:12:22,191 --> 02:12:22,910
compatible components,

2438
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:26,120
wave facet and we're going to ever evolve
into the whatever else we're supposed

2439
02:12:26,121 --> 02:12:28,520
to buy a lot. I know people
already that have artificial hips.

2440
02:12:28,730 --> 02:12:30,130
I know a couple of people and dude,

2441
