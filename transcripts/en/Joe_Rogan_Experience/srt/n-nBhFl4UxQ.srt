1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,540
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,440
I'll tell you what the problem is,

3
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:03,880
Graham Hancock is the children.

4
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:04,211
Where you're,

5
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:07,480
you're ignoring is you're
endorsing drug use to children.

6
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,700
And I think that's
incredibly irresponsible.

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,950
That's exactly what Ted said

8
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,930
when they banned my tool.

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,630
What did they,

10
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,341
what did that statements,

11
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,080
they said,

12
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,800
we can't allow this talk to be on the air
because some young man might go off to

13
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,390
South America and drink IOWASCA.

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,470
That's so hilarious.

15
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,870
Ted cannot be seen to be
endorsing the drinking of Iowa.

16
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,660
Is that the w there was
a huge issue with you.

17
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:31,201
And by the way,

18
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:36,201
your issue was after Eddie Wong came in
here and told his gross story that makes

19
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,680
you just go eat who?

20
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,490
Ted.

21
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,770
Apparently John Anthony
West has a 10 story as well.

22
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,610
Um,

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,190
and I think that there's,

24
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,063
uh,

25
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,180
a lot of beautiful things
that come out of tet.

26
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,710
A lot of incredible tools.

27
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,650
But it seems like any organization,

28
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:57,651
once people get into power and once people
have the ability to tell other people

29
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,220
what's cool and what's not cool,

30
00:00:59,390 --> 00:00:59,681
it's not.

31
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:02,490
It's getting weird and you start telling
Eddie Wong he has to attend all these

32
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,360
different things and meet all these
donors and like some kind of freaky cult.

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,800
Well that's what he felt like.

34
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,180
You felt like it was really strange.

35
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,230
Now your,

36
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:15,150
your thing got pulled and what was this
scientific explanation for why they got

37
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,950
pulled?

38
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,260
It was there was you,

39
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,880
you had an exchange with
one of the guys on Ted.

40
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,840
I read the comments and you presented
all the things that he had said and said,

41
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,060
please show your example
of when I said this,

42
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,811
I never said this.

43
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:28,230
Yeah.

44
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,063
What were the very,

45
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,680
what was the thing that he accused you
of and what was the response were two of

46
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,840
us who got our talks
deleted Rupert Sheldrake.

47
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,910
Rupert Sheldrake is the other,

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,251
his toe.

49
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,420
It was called the science delusion.

50
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:36,711
My Toe.

51
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,250
It was called the war on consciousness.

52
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,100
He can't be shitting on science
like the science to illusion.

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,700
Rupert,

54
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,500
how dare you poked it was as though

55
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,560
if it was as though Ted felt that these
talks must automatically be wrong and

56
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,050
that they had some kind of
preconception about what we were saying.

57
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,710
So they didn't even bother to sit down
and listen to the actual 18 minute talks,

58
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,730
not that much to listen to,

59
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:56,270
you know,

60
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,370
before deleting it from
their youtube channel.

61
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,500
They just said this is pseudoscience.

62
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:00,951
Uh,

63
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:01,521
it's full of,

64
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,580
and they listed a series of false
statements that would supposedly made,

65
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,990
but the problem was neither.

66
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,610
I know Rupert had made those statements

67
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,170
so they never even bothered to look at
it and they just read complaints and then

68
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,800
responding plotted

69
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,643
on the basis of those.

70
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,760
So when we challenged them,

71
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:15,001
okay,

72
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:15,990
please go through,

73
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,681
in my case,

74
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,770
go through my talk and,

75
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,960
and find where I say that Iowasca allows
you to communicate with an ancient

76
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,470
mother culture.

77
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,400
Where do I say that?

78
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,810
I never said that in my talk.

79
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,850
I never said any such thing in my talk.

80
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,500
They actually couldn't do it.

81
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,290
And,

82
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,720
and something you've said before,

83
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,200
no,

84
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,033
I've never seen,

85
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,330
I've never seen it right now.

86
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,164
I heard you.

87
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,541
What,

88
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,374
you know,

89
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,260
what I talked about
was the mother goddess,

90
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,680
right?

91
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,240
The experience of an
encounter with a mother,

92
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,641
God is by,

93
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,940
it never said it allows you to communicate
with an ancient mother culture,

94
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
like a lost civilization.

95
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,510
They knew I'd written books
about lost civilizations,

96
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,280
so they thought I must be bringing the,

97
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,590
my lust civilization beef into the,

98
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,000
into my ted talk,

99
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:57,430
which I did.

100
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,760
And it didn't have
anything to do with lost.

101
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
It was a talk about,

102
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,440
talk about consciousness anyway.

103
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,081
And the real,

104
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,030
the original version was giving up the
green bitch where you were talking to

105
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,411
recently.

106
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,630
I originally called the talk,

107
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,251
giving up the green.

108
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:10,810
That's when I watch us because I
was giving my personal story of,

109
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,171
of,

110
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:11,950
of uh,

111
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,191
you know,

112
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,700
why I,

113
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,600
why I gave up cannabis.

114
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,670
Um,

115
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,580
I changed that title because a lot of
people pointed out to me that that's

116
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,980
deeply disrespectful of cannabis
and that for many people,

117
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,520
cannabis is a green goddess and
cannabis was a green goddess for me.

118
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,354
And I accepted that.

119
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,530
So those people,

120
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,120
I'd say fucking relax.

121
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:28,870
Okay.

122
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,060
Cause I love cannabis too.

123
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,030
But it didn't bother me.

124
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,280
Some people got really upset.

125
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,560
I realized that to be upset,

126
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:37,510
I realized that there is in fact
a cannabis orthodoxy as well,

127
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,270
which I wish my wish by talking about my,

128
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:40,780
my,

129
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,800
my quitting of cannabis,

130
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,240
I had upset this orthodoxy.

131
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,770
But when I looked at my talk,

132
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:48,160
my talk was much more about the war on
consciousness than it was about fat.

133
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,300
And that's what it was really about.

134
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,140
So for example,

135
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,820
I made the point that,

136
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:52,420
um,

137
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,020
our society doesn't object in
principle to altering consciousness.

138
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,561
I mean,

139
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,570
what happens when you
put a kid on Ritalin?

140
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,111
You know,

141
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,240
that's a powerful pharmacological drug,

142
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,340
which is altering
consciousness when you win,

143
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:08,341
you over prescribed Prozac or Ciroc sat
for conditions of depression that those

144
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,720
drugs are altering consciousness.

145
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,920
We value alcohol,

146
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,010
we invest multibillion
dollar alcohol industry.

147
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,860
People don't primarily raped,

148
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,130
drink alcohol because of the taste.

149
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,010
They drink it because it alters their
consciousness in a way that they like.

150
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,641
And,

151
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,610
and so we don't object to altering
consciousness in principle,

152
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,160
but we object to altering
consciousness in certain kinds of ways,

153
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,170
which threaten the status quo.

154
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,210
And that's what psychedelics do.

155
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,620
They alter consciousness in ways that
lead people to ask profound questions

156
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,990
about the nature of the
society they live in.

157
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,060
And that appears to be
the line that I crossed.

158
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,810
So Ted tied to try to dress
it up as pseudoscience.

159
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,680
And when I called them on that in the
end because they realized I think that

160
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,070
they were,

161
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,400
they'd got themselves into some kind
of danger and it's still there on the,

162
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,620
on the webpage that w
Rupert and I call it,

163
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,580
they're naughty corner,

164
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,910
they created a naughty corner of the
Ted website where I talked to him quick

165
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,150
back on line and that with all their
reasons why they'd taken them off.

166
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,150
So first thing they did was they
crossed out all their reasons.

167
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,810
So you can find that everything they
said has actually been crossed out.

168
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,210
And then they published our rebuttal.

169
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,180
So that completely,

170
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,073
we know,

171
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,440
we insisted that they,

172
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:14,710
they accepted that nothing
they'd said was true,

173
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,770
but we insisted they leave it
there on the public record,

174
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,450
but put a line through it.

175
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,170
Oh Wow.

176
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,510
So that,

177
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,350
so that they did that.

178
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,150
They did that.

179
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,200
They did that.

180
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,860
Oh my God,

181
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,371
it did that.

182
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,660
And then they kind of a cool victory.

183
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,380
I know,

184
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,891
I know.

185
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,570
And they've published
our rebuttals in full,

186
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,940
but it wasn't a complete victory
because what they didn't do,

187
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:34,600
which is all we wanted was for our talks
to burry reinstated on the TEDX youtube

188
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:34,970
channel.

189
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,270
No,

190
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,501
no,

191
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,020
no.

192
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,000
You can't put your tea,

193
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,830
your talk online yourself.

194
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,431
Well,

195
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:39,791
no,

196
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,061
I've,

197
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,070
I have put my talk online myself and,

198
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,560
and,

199
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,050
and,

200
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,520
and so have about a hundred
other youtube channels.

201
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,510
And,

202
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,280
and I think Ted took such a
massive beating over this for big,

203
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,140
because it clearly was
an act of censorship.

204
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,861
However,

205
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:57,440
they tried to dress it up that
they've decided not to go and pull,

206
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,170
uh,

207
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,330
the talks from,

208
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,081
from Youtube,

209
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,640
which probably probably they could do.

210
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,180
So,

211
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,511
I mean,

212
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,800
my talk had 132,000 views on youtube
on their channel when they pulled it.

213
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,070
But since then it's had hundreds of
thousands of more views all over the

214
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:10,521
internet.

215
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:10,881
So,

216
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,211
you know,

217
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:11,661
they the,

218
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,790
rather than actually suppressed the talk,

219
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,860
I think it's called the Streisand effect.

220
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,071
You know,

221
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,300
rather than suppress the talks,

222
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,260
they ended up multiplying.

223
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:18,501
Same,

224
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,800
but same with root cause effect.

225
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,840
Apparently.

226
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,673
Apparently that,

227
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,970
I think it was Barbara Streisand tried
to stop some public statement that had

228
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,550
been made about her and it ended
up multiplying the statement.

229
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:29,384
Do you know when you try it?

230
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,770
This is the great thing
about the Internet.

231
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,480
When you try to suppress something,

232
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,613
it grows.

233
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,000
It doesn't get suppressed.

234
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,631
The Internet,

235
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:39,230
including Dick Pictures and
got one of those out there.

236
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,420
Come back around Graham Hancock.

237
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,473
I'm going to find you.

238
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,020
I've never had my dick photograph.

239
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,100
Congratulations.

240
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,963
How about you?

241
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,340
I plead the fifth

242
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,270
[inaudible]

243
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,920
freaks and geeks level.
