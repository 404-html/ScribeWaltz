1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh,
you creeps that are controlling money

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:12,501
all throughout the world.
Your time is slowly closing in.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,810
Am I right?
Yup.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,530
Andrea is Antonopoulos author a
published author of the Internet of

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,050
money.
Uh,

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,640
you've been on the show many times
before,

7
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,940
but you've never been on the show two
days after a book,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,150
fresh off the presses.
Tell a story about how this book got

9
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,040
delivered to you today because it's kind
of hilarious.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
Yeah.
So nobody knew about this.

11
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,550
This is my announcement.
This is my second book.

12
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,850
First book was mastering Bitcoin was for
techies.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,080
Uh,
the internet of money is for everybody

14
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:49,081
else and it's a collection of my talks.
And I was having the first copy

15
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,960
delivered to my hotel this morning in
order to bring it to the show and give

16
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,520
it to you.
And,

17
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,161
uh,
it,

18
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,130
it was a day late.
It was supposed to be delivered

19
00:00:57,131 --> 00:01:01,840
yesterday and I'm waiting and I'm,
I'm refreshing the tracking number site.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,960
And then you said,
do you know we can push it back by half

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,280
hour because you're running a bit late.
And,

22
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,100
and in that half hour,
the book got delivered.

23
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:14,101
It literally was printed September 5th
this is the first copy I've touched and

24
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,170
it's yours.

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,930
Oh boy.
I've got it folks.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,523
Okay,

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,860
issue zero zero zero one now why did
they do that?

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,900
Not just one.
Why don't they just make it one?

29
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,490
Why does everybody have to do a one?

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,030
Well,
I'm not printing 10,000 issues so,

31
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,620
well,
they never go.

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,140
It's never like zero,
zero,

33
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,670
zero,
zero,

34
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:41,671
zero zero one did they ever do that pair
of shoes once recently with that?

35
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,180
It was like one,
not a Twi.

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,180
You in one of my ears only.
What the hell is going on there?

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,850
Fucked up on.
I can't have you in my left ear.

38
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,790
It's like you're like the voice of God
or the voice of bad.

39
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,010
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

40
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,540
I got it too.
So please stick around.

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,770
Yeah,
that's too weird.

42
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,590
We can't have that.
Try it again.

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,480
Check,
check.

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,010
Nope,
you fucking Weirdo.

45
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:06,880
You're coming in my left ear.
Only probably the rest of America too,

46
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,714
right?
Yeah.

47
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,150
Yeah.
They can't have that.

48
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,590
People are at the gym gone and I'll tell
him,

49
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,980
fuck Jamie's in my left ear.
So this is a collection of all your

50
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:18,040
talks.
What has changed in the world of bitcoin

51
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,590
since the last time we spoke?
We spoke and we hung out in Vegas,

52
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,090
which was great.
I had a great time with you.

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,490
And um,
but what,

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,760
what has changed in the world of bitcoin
since the last time?

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,040
Well,
it's been about a year and a half almost

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,270
and so much so much happening in the
meantime.

57
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,340
But we had a pretty slow 2015 and 2016
pick top again.

58
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,990
Um,
2015 still coming off a slow and gradual

59
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:48,230
drop in the price.
People were very reluctant and

60
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,110
skeptical.
The media was constantly bashing

61
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,700
bitcoin.
And then,

62
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,610
um,
at the same time we saw this really

63
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,490
interesting phenomenon where the banks
started getting interested in this

64
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,190
thing,
but

65
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,180
not bitcoin itself.
No,

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,280
the blockchain,
the technology behind Bitcoin,

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,470
which is rather amusing.
I,

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,320
I look at that a bit as if,
you know,

69
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,810
the Horse Buggy Association of America
is going,

70
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,180
oh,
we like this automobile thing you've

71
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,240
designed,
but we have a very big investment in Hay

72
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,730
and horses and stables and veterinarian.
So,

73
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,100
um,
we're gonna use the technology behind

74
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,050
the automobile,
the pneumatic tire,

75
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,690
and we're going to revolutionize horse
buggies.

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,160
But in all fairness,
I think what you're saying,

77
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,720
it's hilarious,
but in all fairness,

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,200
it is a weird thing to invest in,
like to go all in on bitcoin.

79
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,710
I mean,
I know you do it,

80
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,410
but you also make all of your money this
way.

81
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,580
And this is,
you know,

82
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,530
you're,
you're a proselytizing person when it

83
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,364
comes to Bitcoin,
right?

84
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,500
Um,
for good reason.

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,920
But for the average person saves,
saved up actual cash money their whole

86
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:59,550
life and is involved in this established
system of money to throw all their money

87
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,620
into Bitcoin,
that would be insane.

88
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,860
You watched the money fluctuate,
it goes up and it goes down when I'm

89
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:05,840
thinking,
I'm glad you said that,

90
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:06,990
that it would be insane.
No,

91
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,460
that's,
that would be a terrible idea.

92
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Right?
But don't you think that that's probably

93
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:15,441
why the media bashes it and why banks
are just looking at it going like people

94
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:18,720
see that there's a growing number of
people that are using it for

95
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,530
transactions.

96
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,610
There's Bitcoin ATM is now and people
are using it to,

97
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,920
to purchase things.
There's several companies that accept

98
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:29,070
bitcoin for products for actual real
physical products.

99
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,760
But yeah,
but I mean it's not an investment and it

100
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:35,130
shouldn't be treated as an investment.
Um,

101
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,170
I mean I don't even mean like as an
investment.

102
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:41,530
I mean as like a primary source of money
of,

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,430
of,
of if you decided to take all of your

104
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,100
money,
not as an investment,

105
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,090
but just say,
I'm going,

106
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,530
going to live off a bit coin,
I'm going to spend bitcoin.

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,540
Like your money is going to go up and
down.

108
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,170
Yeah.
That's going to be really hard.

109
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,770
Especially if you're,
um,

110
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,360
if you're accustomed to privileged
banking,

111
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,150
like if you have the kind of banking
that we have in this country,

112
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,100
if you actually have access to that and
you have a,

113
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:10,101
a nice visa debit card and you don't
pain account fees and your money doesn't

114
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:15,230
get confiscated by a dictator too often
and you know,

115
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,660
you can earn your money and interact
with other people,

116
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,460
then why,
why would you use bitcoin?

117
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,550
The simple answer is that's not really
the use case,

118
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,480
but there are lots of people around the
world who simply don't have access to

119
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,400
that.
And for them,

120
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,260
you know,
in many cases,

121
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,250
big coin is the stable currency.
You know,

122
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,000
Asca,
an Argentinian,

123
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,670
Venezuelan,
a Brazilian,

124
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,513
uh,
uh,

125
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,910
Supriya to Greek and the list goes on
and on and on.

126
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,670
Uh,
whether they're worried about volatility

127
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,850
in bitcoin and in many cases if they've
heard of it,

128
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,390
if they've used it,
that's the stable currency.

129
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,090
Their national currency is far,
far worse.

130
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,530
Right.
Did you say Brazil?

131
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,230
Yeah,
Brazil has had to massive devaluation

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,060
the last year.
How much devaluation?

133
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,780
Cause I know that they have experienced
some sort of a really radical economic

134
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,840
downturn,
which is really interesting because a

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,730
few years ago when we first started
going into Brazil,

136
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,340
their economy was booming,
right?

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
W We,
I'm saying the UFC,

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,100
yeah.
They're in a currency crisis right now.

139
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,560
Massive currency crisis that's going on.
Well,

140
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,900
a apart from the political crisis that's
going on,

141
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,270
and I won't speak for that because I'm
not a Brazilian,

142
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,010
but you know,
they've had impeachment proceedings.

143
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,330
They just impeached their president.
Um,

144
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,000
there's been a lot of economic
difficulty with the country and I think

145
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,310
they,
their currency has devalued almost 30%

146
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,250
in the last year of 20 or 30%.
Some staggering amount.

147
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,490
Currencies don't move like that.
Mainstream national currencies that have

148
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,680
very large economies behind them simply
don't move like that.

149
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,010
We've seen it happen on the,
a couple of times we've seen it happen

150
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,761
in,
in Greece,

151
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,470
in Cyprus,
during the economic crisis.

152
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,960
We saw it happen in Britain,
uh,

153
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,660
during brexit.
And if we've seen it in places like

154
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,740
Brazil,
Venezuela,

155
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,810
Argentina,
and places like that,

156
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,890
how much currency did,
how much of a percentage of Britain you

157
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,160
lose during brexit?
Almost 20% in a day.

158
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,090
Wow.
And three things responded to that's in

159
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,980
the opposite direction.
Gold,

160
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,530
the Japanese yen and bitcoin heading in
the exact opposite direction,

161
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,650
a bit coin climb,
20% that they almost really,

162
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,920
so did Britain rebound.
Um,

163
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,250
it did a bit,
but it's still in historic close.

164
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm multi decade lows.
So they took a really big hit.

165
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,360
And what we've seen again and again is
at times of crisis,

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,240
um,
we see this pattern repeating where

167
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:40,100
people use bitcoin as a safe haven
investment to get money out of a

168
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,910
national currencies,
especially where there are very strict

169
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,740
currency capital controls.

170
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,500
So one of the reasons we've seen a big
coin,

171
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,910
probably one of the reasons we've seen a
lot of activity with bitcoin in China is

172
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,520
because of currency controls.
Every time the yuan,

173
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,840
the Chinese currency devalues against
the dollar and it's done.

174
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:04,841
So I think four times in the last here,
every time there's a massive uptick in

175
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,710
bitcoin buying in China.
So people are parking the money in

176
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:13,190
bitcoin or using it to convert it to
other currencies and get money out of

177
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,760
the country.
So what is the biggest fluctuation that

178
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:18,860
bitcoin is had?
Um,

179
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,690
well it depends whether you look at it
on a monetary basis or on a percentage

180
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,610
basis.
If you look at the movements now,

181
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,360
it can go up 30 40 even a hundred bucks
in a day.

182
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,810
Um,
which seems like a lot,

183
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,100
but as a percentage,
the biggest fluctuations that had were

184
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:42,101
in 2010 and 2011 when it rose from under
a dollar or two over $30 and then back

185
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,930
down to under a dollar in a period of a
couple of months.

186
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,160
For people who don't understand what
this means when you're saying it,

187
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,920
a hundred bucks or a dollar $30 like
what?

188
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:58,921
What does that in relationship to one
bitcoin one bitcoin equals $30 in 2011.

189
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,180
And what does it equal right now?
617 $617 Jesus,

190
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,320
it was about $230 at the beginning of
this gear.

191
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:14,400
So it's seen a massive ramp pop and a
renewal of interest that,

192
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
okay,
so massive ramp up,

193
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:20,280
but like what's the fluctuation?
So if it's at 616 is that what you said?

194
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,830
Yup.
It's tripled since the beginning of the

195
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
year almost.
Is it possible that it could drop to

196
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,370
like 200 tomorrow?
Yes.

197
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,130
See that scares the shit out of people.
Yes.

198
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,490
And,
and which is why you know at,

199
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,730
but here's,
here's the,

200
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,390
here's the truth.
Over the seven years that it's existed,

201
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,190
the fall utility as a percentage has
been going down every single here.

202
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,690
So as the economy gets bigger,
the bigger it is,

203
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,800
the more stable it is.

204
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,380
Eight doesn't get buffeted around,
right.

205
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,730
It's just like a very large boats
doesn't get pushed around by the waves.

206
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,200
And bitcoin is like a Zodiac next to the
U S dollars titanic.

207
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,790
And the Little Zodiac is bouncing up and
down on the waves a lot terrain.

208
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
And it might be uncomfortable at times.
Of course,

209
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,810
if you're heading to an iceberg,
you want to be in the thing that can

210
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:13,400
actually turn on a dime.
That's a good way to look at it.

211
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:14,071
But,
uh,

212
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,070
I don't know if it's a fair analogy,
but it's a good way of looking at it.

213
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,540
It's fall a and,
and that's part of,

214
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,610
it's part of the fact that a 10 to $12
billion economy stretched across the

215
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:26,370
entire globe is a small economy as a
currency.

216
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,560
Now in the interest of making this a
standalone podcast.

217
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,040
So people are not going to go back and
listen to all the other podcasts that

218
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,874
we've done.

219
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,230
Explain very briefly if you could,
what is bitcoin and how does it work?

220
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm glad I have this opportunity to do
it again because every time we have a

221
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,830
new audience,
so bitcoin is Internet money.

222
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,860
It's a system of money that exists on
the Internet,

223
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,060
was created on the Internet,
and it allows you to send and receive

224
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:55,860
value the the same way you can send and
receive an email anywhere in the world

225
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,220
instantaneously without intermediaries.
Um,

226
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,360
and that's kind of what you see at first
glance behind that.

227
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,100
It's a whole platform.
It is.

228
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,250
As the title of the book says,
the Internet of money.

229
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,760
It is,
it is a set of protocols that allow you

230
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,910
to basically exchange value with other
people.

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,670
But you can do a lot more with it than
just that.

232
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,990
Most people will use it as a currency.
It's basically money that you can

233
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,130
transmit from your smartphone to
somebody else's smartphone directly,

234
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,120
just like cash.

235
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,400
Um,
but electronic,

236
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,940
and the thing about it that's unique is
that it's not owned by any corporation,

237
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,700
any bank or any government.
Just like the web isn't told by anyone

238
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,060
or email isn't told by anyone.
And there's lots of companies that can

239
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:47,190
send and receive email.
There's lots of companies that can set

240
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:50,610
up websites.
There's a lot of companies that can set

241
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:55,611
up applications that use bitcoin.
And I should say that when you set it up

242
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,100
for me,
the first time he did it,

243
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,140
a bunch of people donated bitcoin.
So what I did was I'd said whatever

244
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,210
people donated,
I would match.

245
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,300
I would double it.
And then we would donate it to fight for

246
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,720
the forgotten.
They've build wells in the Congo and we

247
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,990
built,
I don't remember how many Justin Wren

248
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,270
said,
but it was a,

249
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't even remember how much money,
but it was many thousands of dollars

250
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,100
people donated and then I doubled it and
then we sent it over to the Congo.

251
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,650
So the bitcoin community is very
generous,

252
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:31,651
is my point that that is true and part
of that generosity comes from the fact

253
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:36,160
that a lot of the people in this
community are very excited about this

254
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,050
technology and want to share it without
this.

255
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,210
They want to tell other people about
this technology.

256
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,080
It's really quite interesting what
happens when you create a form of money

257
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:51,130
that is truly global and we really don't
have forms of money that a truly global,

258
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,860
if you,
even even with your very advanced

259
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,950
banking system and your access to all of
the technology that you have in the

260
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:00,190
American banking system,
if you try to send money to some

261
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,650
countries,
it's almost impossible to do.

262
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,080
And I experienced this every time I get
paid in Bitcoin,

263
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,930
I'll go into a conference in Europe,
um,

264
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,080
and I'll do one conference with the
banking industry and one conference with

265
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,660
the bitcoin community and the little
bitcoin conference.

266
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,370
It's going to be free to attend.
And I,

267
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,350
I don't make any money,
but they sometimes cover some of my

268
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:25,351
expenses and I'll send an invoice and
the banking industry conference will

269
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:31,120
send me a wire transfer.
It takes on average four weeks for me to

270
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,810
get it with several calls to find out
where it went,

271
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,940
what's going on,
why did it get lost?

272
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,850
And it takes me on average 15 minutes to
get paid in bit coin,

273
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,430
no matter which country and being paid
is he,

274
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,200
this is the cynic in me is this because
when they take the money and they're

275
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,440
transferring it and they're moving it
around and now it's sitting in banks.

276
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,870
When banks have money,
if they have your money,

277
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:56,140
even if it's just for a few weeks,
they have the opportunity to use that

278
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,630
money to make more money.
Are they doing that?

279
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,870
Um,
it,

280
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,680
it certainly doesn't,
uh,

281
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,830
it doesn't hurt to keep it a bit longer.

282
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,530
They're doing it primarily because,
uh,

283
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,770
because the system has a series of
intermediaries and each of those

284
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,890
intermediaries represent a risk.
If one of those intermediary says,

285
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I have the money for Mr Antonopoulos
wire and you give that money to

286
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,360
Antonopoulos,
but the intermediary doesn't give it to

287
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,130
you,
you're out of money.

288
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,870
Right?
So there's those risks with every

289
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,940
intermediate you put in,
there's risk.

290
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,910
And that's called counterparty risk.
The,

291
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,420
because of the way the banking system is
with perhaps five,

292
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,460
six,
seven intermediaries in a single

293
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:40,180
transfer,
that creates a lot of cumulative risk.

294
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,420
And they protect without risk,
by slowing things down.

295
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,550
And that risk doesn't exist in bitcoin
because it's from one party directly to

296
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,020
another.
No counter parties.

297
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,800
That's one of the core principles.

298
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,190
The funny thing,
I had this conversation with my bank and

299
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,750
said I had done this um,
conference in Germany,

300
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,810
Frankfurt at the headquarters of the
Bundesbank.

301
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,500
Now for those of your viewers or
listeners who don't know,

302
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,501
the Bundesbank is the Federal Bank of
Germany and they probably consider the

303
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,160
United States Federal Reserve to be a
mediocre creditor compared to the

304
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,080
Bundesbank.
This is like the best credit rating on

305
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,670
the planet,
right?

306
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,990
And I'm going to speak at a conference
there and they're paying me for my

307
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:34,820
expenses and they send a wire transfer
and I call my bank and after four weeks

308
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,640
they finally find it and tell me,
we've received your bank,

309
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,250
your bank wire transfer.
We're going to hold it

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,690
because of the risk profile.
I don't understand.

311
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,930
Well you haven't been paid by this
particular payer before,

312
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,600
so we're going to put a hold on.
It said,

313
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,630
you do know this is the Bundesbank
you are holding.

314
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,620
And they held it for two weeks.
You are holding for two weeks because of

315
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:04,040
the credit risk of the Federal Bank of
Germany,

316
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,340
the most credit worthy institution.
I'm not trying to receive money from

317
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,050
Somalia,
you know,

318
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,920
this isn't even something weird.
And if,

319
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,580
if even they campaign me in the age of
the Internet instantaneously,

320
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,790
there is something wrong with this
banking system.

321
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,290
And there is because I got paid for the
bitcoin conference who was doing in the

322
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,300
same town instantaneously.

323
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,650
But there's also concern on their,
their end about fraud,

324
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,950
right?
I mean isn't it,

325
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,040
but there's fraud with bitcoin as well.
I mean,

326
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,120
wasn't there,
um,

327
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,390
that issue with a,
those guys that were investigating the

328
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,400
dark web,
it turned out that the agents were

329
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:47,000
stealing bitcoin to the tune of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

330
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,740
Wasn't that the case with,
um,

331
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
yes,
absolutely.

332
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,290
So the,
the difference,

333
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,460
the difference is a difference between
systemic fraud,

334
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,470
an individual case of fraud.
Um,

335
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,600
so,
um,

336
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,300
in Bitcoin as in the traditional banking
system,

337
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:06,300
if,
if a bank or an organization

338
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:09,450
concentrates a lot of money,
then you can go in and steal it.

339
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,370
You basically robbed the Bitcoin Bank,
just like people rob the normal bank.

340
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,980
And how would they do that?
Just hack into it.

341
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,410
So they hack in and they do it.
And this has happened many,

342
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:24,390
many times and this is a problem with
bitcoin banks as opposed to person to

343
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,040
person exchanges.
Correct.

344
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,280
Because the whole point of pick coin is
that you don't need to put your money in

345
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:34,281
the custody of someone else.
And if instead you use bitcoin as it is

346
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,880
intended,
where everybody keeps control of their

347
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,460
own money,
then in order to hack all of those

348
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:46,200
people either have to hack the bitcoin
protocol itself has not happened in

349
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,540
seven years.
And the way it's structured is

350
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,040
impossible.
Do or you

351
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,970
have to hack each individual account
holder and you can hack individual

352
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,900
account holders depending on their level
of security and sophistication.

353
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,120
But um,
you know,

354
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,750
to get very large amounts you have to
wait for them to give their money to

355
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,930
someone else.
What was that exchange?

356
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,860
The bitcoin bank that started off as
like a fantasy website and some,

357
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,560
what was that again?
Uh,

358
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,130
this was a Mt.
Gox in Japan,

359
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,050
the magic,
the gathering online,

360
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,570
which they see in the early days of
Bitcoin,

361
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:25,050
there were no exchanges.
So you've got to think back like,

362
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,850
do you remember on the web,
uh,

363
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:28,770
in the early days when even the,
the,

364
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,260
the largest,
most sophisticated corporations had a

365
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,410
page with a single logon,
a gray background,

366
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,620
and some flashing lights that said under
construction,

367
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,820
like in 1994,
that's where we are in bitcoin's still.

368
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,430
So there's,
there were no,

369
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,640
um,
well-run exchanges at the time.

370
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,740
It was very difficult to buy and sell
bitcoin.

371
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,250
And so this guy in Japan had a site that
could trade these magic,

372
00:18:55,621 --> 00:19:00,621
the gathering online cards,
and he converted the sites to trade

373
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,140
currencies instead to create trade.
Cryptocurrencies.

374
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,310
Turns out it's a lot easier to hack in
and steal cryptocurrencies than it is to

375
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:12,180
steal the cards.
Whatever happened with that,

376
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,710
because the story was like hundreds of
thousands of dollars in bitcoins,

377
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:19,120
just hundreds of millions of dollars,
millions.

378
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,050
They didn't vanish that inventors,
someone stole it.

379
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,130
They got stolen,
they got cycled through the economy and

380
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,030
they're back in the economy now.
But just not with the same owners.

381
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,430
No one knows who.
No one knows who.

382
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,700
That seems bizarre.
Like if you rob a bank,

383
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,540
like they can put a trace on the bills
and they can figure it out eventually.

384
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,980
And most people get caught.
Right?

385
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,210
Yeah.
Not really.

386
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,044
I mean,
no,

387
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,730
no,
they if you,

388
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:48,480
if you do wire fraud perhaps,
but in many cases with cash,

389
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,240
bitcoin is like cash.

390
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,050
Uh,
it is equally untraceable it's very

391
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:55,200
difficult to actually catch like I think
recently,

392
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,620
um,
I was reading about the FBI closing the

393
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,010
DB cooper case.
It's the Guy who robbed the bank,

394
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,550
got into seven,
one seven aircraft,

395
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,750
opened the rear state case and jumped
out to the parachute over the midwest

396
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,640
and was never seen again.
Um,

397
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,230
I think that guy died though.
Hmm.

398
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,570
Well that,
that that would be a convenient,

399
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:20,460
a explanation for the failure of the FBI
to catch him.

400
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,500
Yeah.
It would be convenient,

401
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,930
but also didn't he like drop into the
woods?

402
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,750
I,
I don't know the details.

403
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,260
They never found him body or money ever
again.

404
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
But that can happen pretty easy.
I would be more likely or more,

405
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,790
uh,
apt to believe that if someone dropped

406
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,280
in the woods,
out of parachute with some fucking

407
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,270
haphazard gear and leapt out of the back
of a plane,

408
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,170
they probably died.

409
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,070
Probably got eaten by bears or
something.

410
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,221
Yes.
Or,

411
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:52,760
or found by a,
a local woods.

412
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:56,770
Men in the cabin who's like some,
some dude fell out of the sky with a

413
00:20:56,771 --> 00:21:00,340
Satchel full of money.
Some my money.

414
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,390
I need a new chainsaw.
Yeah,

415
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,433
yeah.
Um,

416
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,760
but when you're stealing money from a
bank,

417
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,390
can't they trace the serial numbers?
Like if you steal cash,

418
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,560
like if you,
you go,

419
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,820
you know,
this is a robbery,

420
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,180
stick them up and you pointed a gun at
the teller and they fill up the bag with

421
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:20,380
currency and you run out the door.
Don't they have like a trace on that

422
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,370
money?
Like where they can,

423
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,410
if you spend the really ash,
no,

424
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,281
no,
not really.

425
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,250
And they can't because they have all
kinds of,

426
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,300
I mean,
yes,

427
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:32,110
if they had a batch of sequentially
numbered clean money,

428
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,900
but that's not how most banks work.

429
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,850
What the money they have on hand is this
stuff that came,

430
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:38,960
deposited it in the last week,
um,

431
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,150
by various people,
cash businesses like Delis and grocery

432
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,590
stores and things like that.
And they have no idea what the numbers

433
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,250
on those bills are and they don't trace
it.

434
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,100
It's simply considered part of the risk
of business.

435
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,930
And what does this avoid?
Cooper's money before.

436
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,250
Oh Shit.
Some of it get this out of the left side

437
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:03,300
of my ear.
It's a bad cable after Resa.

438
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,960
Okay.
No sign of DB.

439
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,720
Cooper ever emerge.
Investigators doubt he survived and

440
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,490
never been able to determine his true
identity.

441
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:14,260
But a boy digging on the Columbia River
beach in 1980 found three bundles of

442
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:16,900
weathered $20 bills.
Cooper's cash.

443
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,960
According to the serial numbers,
that guy's dead as fuck.

444
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,160
They found his money.
Some of his money.

445
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,620
What did he like?
Left song of cause being sneaky.

446
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,110
I'm going to pretend I'm dead.
I'm just leave some of this here.

447
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,740
No,
they don't.

448
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,890
They only found like a very small,
I don't think they recovered more than a

449
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:34,690
tiny fraction of it.
Oh yeah.

450
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,590
Okay.
But I don't know.

451
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,340
I mean,
I don't remember the details when she's

452
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,130
dealing with 200 grand though.
I think it was only like $200,000 in

453
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,970
those days.
You could pay the national debt with

454
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:44,440
that kind of money.
What year was it?

455
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:48,520
Like sixties 71 there's a lot of money
in those days.

456
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,680
That db cooper stores and interesting
story.

457
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,410
It's a,
people love a story like that where

458
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,350
people don't get caught.
Yeah.

459
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:59,620
The mystery of the unknown.
All the Mt.

460
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,840
Gox thing.
The exchange is kind of a mystery to,

461
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:06,841
it's $100 million or many hundreds of
millions of dollar mystery inside story

462
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,350
of Mt.
Gox bitcoins,

463
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,370
$460 million disaster for 60 look at
that guy.

464
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,290
They're leading them around.
That's marlene embark palace.

465
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,540
Who's a,
yes.

466
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,720
That's the guy who is now out on parole,
I believe,

467
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:24,670
or on or pending trial.
So that guy's out $460 million and he's

468
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,630
out.
Yeah,

469
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:26,800
of course.
Well,

470
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,980
is he responsible?
Just cause he's retarded.

471
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,410
You know that.
That's one of the things we,

472
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:37,540
we don't know.
And maybe we'll never know how much of

473
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,250
that response,
whether it was deliberate,

474
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,380
whether it was an inside job,
whether it was a complaint,

475
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,170
competence.
Well,

476
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,980
he was certainly,
that was enormous,

477
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,090
of incompetent.
Enormous.

478
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,700
That's clear.

479
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,600
And when you listen to him talk,
I've heard him in speeches when he's

480
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,250
discussing the issue,
you're like,

481
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,810
wait a minute,
that guy,

482
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,470
uh,
yes,

483
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,530
exactly.
It's one of the,

484
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,500
have you heard Bernie madoff talk?
Yes.

485
00:23:58,501 --> 00:23:59,070
True.
Yeah.

486
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,000
Right.
I mean,

487
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,200
the thing is the,
even,

488
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,570
even the most,
and the interesting thing is that just

489
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,480
up to the day before Bernie madoff was
indicted,

490
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,380
indicted,
he was the top trusted name on Wall

491
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:12,840
Street.
He had the most stellar credit rating.

492
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:16,500
He was the head of the credit rating
agency for,

493
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,110
uh,
those types of funds that he was rated

494
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:20,730
under.
Um,

495
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,760
and the next day he's a CROC.
So

496
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,390
you can see these things happen
throughout human history.

497
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,840
Changing the form of money used doesn't
change that.

498
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,580
But if he changed the architecture of
money and you make it less necessary,

499
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,770
uh,
and um,

500
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,020
less useful to concentrate the money in
the hands of third parties that has an

501
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,300
impact.
And so that

502
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,460
one of the issues with this something
like Mt Gox or with any banking system

503
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,200
yes.
Other than the bitcoin system with,

504
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,951
yes.
I mean,

505
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:55,310
the problem is the counterparty risk if
you give your money to other people.

506
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:59,990
The entire reason we have oversight in
banking is because of the simple truth

507
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,640
that if you give your money to other
people,

508
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,080
eventually they'll try to steal it.
Uh,

509
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,180
that's it.
And the only reason they,

510
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,000
they don't cause someone in the bank is
going to have a tremendous need.

511
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,250
The tremendous gambling problem,
uh,

512
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,000
an addiction,
um,

513
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,100
something,
right?

514
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Or just have a lack of empathy and
social socialization and just be,

515
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,160
you know,
correct.

516
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,110
Crooked.
But they don't even have to be crooked.

517
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:30,170
They can make a mistake and trading and
tried to cover it up with customer

518
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,960
money.
They can have a debt there.

519
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,040
Their parents may require an expensive
surgery that they can't afford.

520
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,690
There's lots of reasons why people
commit financial fraud and not all of it

521
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:44,740
is because they're just greedy,
evil assholes,

522
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,560
but,
right.

523
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,370
But the bottom line is that all of the
oversight system we have in banking,

524
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:54,350
which by the way fails again and again
and again and again to protect and

525
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,460
regular people from these thefts.
All of these systems we have exists for

526
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,150
that one reason.
So the answer is not build better

527
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,990
systems to watch the people who hold
your money is,

528
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,320
the answer is that bitcoin gives us,
don't let others hold your money,

529
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,410
hold your own money and then you don't
have this problem.

530
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,290
There was

531
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,960
recent investigative report about,
um,

532
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,760
a firm in Georgia,
I want to say it's Atlanta that has a

533
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:25,560
ridiculously high rate of success with
investments.

534
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,040
And they interviewed the Guy who runs it
and you know his reasons for why they're

535
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,850
so wildly successful and they make so
much more money than anybody else.

536
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:38,850
We're very suspect.
And they're closing in on this guy,

537
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:42,480
like what's going on over here?
And they think that not only is the

538
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:46,050
Bernie model,
not just Bernie Madoff,

539
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,140
but they,
they think that it's common and that

540
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,610
there's a lot of people that that might
be supplementing legitimate investments

541
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:58,611
with a pyramid scheme and that it's been
a standard operational model for a lot

542
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,810
of these firms because they've been able
to pull it off.

543
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,230
What we've seen again and again
throughout history in the area of

544
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:10,430
finance,
is that when there's a recession,

545
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,490
when there is a drop in income and
profitability for everyone,

546
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,350
uh,
that event is actually really good for

547
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:20,660
capitalism.
What it does is it washes out the

548
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,060
frauds.
It's washes out the failures,

549
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,340
it washes out the unprofitable
businesses.

550
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
It's a great cleansing event,
right?

551
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,200
Because the tide recedes and suddenly
you see who's not wearing swimming

552
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,420
trunks.
So

553
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,630
we knew there was something fishy going
on under the water,

554
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:40,470
but,
um,

555
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,430
that's a good way of looking at it.
When that happens in,

556
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:47,970
in Wall Street's all of those companies
that were simply reinvesting the,

557
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:52,160
the recent gains to pay the people who
are withdrawing their money or the

558
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:54,240
retirees that are supporting in their
pension fund,

559
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,760
et Cetera,
suddenly they don't,

560
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,110
they can't do that to any more.

561
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,370
They're washed out of the business.
A badly performing businesses

562
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,490
unprofitable.
As all of these things get washed out.

563
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,860
We haven't been doing this in this
country for the last three decades.

564
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,380
Instead,
what happens is every time there's a

565
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:16,130
recession,
the Fed steps in a or the government

566
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:20,480
steps in and basically they pump water
to raise the tide again,

567
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,340
right?
As much as possible.

568
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,750
And that means that a lot of the crux
float from recession to recession

569
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:31,751
without getting revealed worse,
it encourages that kind of behavior.

570
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,420
And so you get all of these businesses
whose only ability to make profits is

571
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:41,570
when the interest rates to zero and
there's $20 billion a month being

572
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:46,571
injected by the Fed and their business
model is take that and lend it to

573
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,960
consumers for 29 99 Apr.
Right?

574
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,110
Or do payday loans or sub prime loans or
sub prime auto student loans,

575
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:57,380
mortgages,
et Cetera,

576
00:28:57,381 --> 00:28:58,214
et cetera.

577
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,020
You need a cleansing events to wash out
the fraud.

578
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,590
Um,
I like the example of a forest fire.

579
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,620
If you suppress all of the small fires
will happens,

580
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:12,770
is eventually you build up a lot of
undergrowth in the forest.

581
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,390
A small fire doesn't kill the trees.
It just cleans out the undergrowth.

582
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,530
You keep putting out the fires,
which we've seen since the 70s here in

583
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:24,350
the states.
You let all of the undergrowth grow up.

584
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:28,160
Then when a fire comes through,
it's not just a little forest fire,

585
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:32,480
it's a raging inferno now.
You can't put it out and it burns the

586
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,860
trees and destroys the soil.
Sterilizes the top foot of soil.

587
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,150
We've seen this happen,
right?

588
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,970
And so this is now happening in terms of
our economy,

589
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,690
which is that all of this,
um,

590
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,650
bubble creation doesn't get washed out
in a recession.

591
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,080
More stimulus,
more funding.

592
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,420
The Federal Reserve pumps more money
into the economy.

593
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,740
Trillions of dollars since 2008 and all
of this stimulus,

594
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:03,370
where does it go?
It goes into inflating not one bubble.

595
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,430
We had real estates,
but now we have real estates and

596
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:11,310
subprime auto and student loans and,
and,

597
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:15,940
and,
and bonds and stocks and currencies all

598
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,620
inflating at the same time.
The,

599
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,520
is it possible to do a controlled burn
for the economy?

600
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,550
That's what they're doing.
And some places where they want to,

601
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,220
uh,
deal with the issue that,

602
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,870
you know,
you're talking about how there's stop

603
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,450
forest fires.
That's theoretically part of the mandate

604
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,940
of the Federal Reserve,
which most people don't realize is a

605
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:37,030
private corporation owned by the banks
and not a government agency.

606
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,440
Yeah,
that's a tricky name.

607
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,290
Yes.
Federal Reserve has nothing to do with

608
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,220
that.
Yeah.

609
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,690
Yeah.
It's kind of gross.

610
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,733
Yeah.
In fact,

611
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,630
I can't name say my publishing company
for the book,

612
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,181
the,
the,

613
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,180
the federal publisher,
um,

614
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,190
they won't allow me to put the word
federal in the name of my company as

615
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,420
they shouldn't.
Right.

616
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,970
But in order to create an organization
like that,

617
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,370
you need an act of Congress.
Uh,

618
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,180
in fact,
actually what you need is an act of

619
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:07,090
Congress passed in the middle of the
night on a recess,

620
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:10,180
which is exactly how they pass the
Federal Reserve Act in 1913.

621
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,720
It has a long ass time ago.
Yup.

622
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,860
It's so ridiculous.
They keep that name.

623
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,350
But there is federal ammunition.
I should just say that you could buy

624
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,900
bullets company called federal
ammunition,

625
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:22,900
has nothing to do with the federal
government interest is to good good

626
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,220
company to buy bullets from.
[inaudible].

627
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,970
It just seems like the,
the controlled burn idea,

628
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,480
how would you apply that to the economy?
I mean,

629
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,030
if what we're talking about raise the
interest rates,

630
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,010
you raised them.
Yup.

631
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,750
It was,
drains the waste.

632
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:43,660
Drains the swamp,
raise the interest rates.

633
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,360
Basically the infrastructure controls
the cost of money.

634
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:51,361
If you make money more expensive than
those who borrowed have to have a pretty

635
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:55,630
good rate of investment in return on
their investment to invest that.

636
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,180
Right.
Otherwise they don't borrow money.

637
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,050
And it's an extremely unpopular idea
though.

638
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,580
Right?
So how do you get that across?

639
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,601
Well,
it's an,

640
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,100
it's an unpopular idea because,
um,

641
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:10,170
it benefits savers instead of debtors,
right?

642
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,280
So if you,
if you have savings,

643
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,440
it's a great idea.
I remember a time when I could get a

644
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:19,150
certificate of deposit for my savings in
the bank and I could get 3% here,

645
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,800
3%,
uh,

646
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:21,730
here,
right?

647
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,650
I can't get 0.3% now.
So savers get wiped out.

648
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,980
If you're a retiree who's got all of
their money in savings right now,

649
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,000
the return you're getting on those
savings isn't enough to cover your cost

650
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:36,610
of living.
So your money basically is shrinking.

651
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,960
And that's a tax on savers that,
um,

652
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,580
benefits debtors,
especially for a large debtors like the

653
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,290
federal government.
Yeah.

654
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,830
It's such a complicated system that for
the average person that's working all

655
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,750
day and you know,
you get home,

656
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:54,320
you have hobbies and family and things
that you want to do,

657
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:59,150
it's very difficult to get a grip on
exactly how money works.

658
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,901
Yes,
it is.

659
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:00,620
And it's one of them.

660
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,900
Thanks.
I found through my experiences doing

661
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:05,210
these talks that I do.
Um,

662
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,990
and I talk about that in the book too,
that the whole point of this particular

663
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,870
book,
the Internet of money is why bitcoin and

664
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:13,910
I talk about the philosophy behind
money,

665
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,700
the,
the topics of money that most people

666
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:21,320
don't understand.
And what's really astonishing is that

667
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,370
here I am and I'm,
I'm talking about is the greatest

668
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,340
experiment in money.
Um,

669
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,460
started in 2008,
2009 and this great experiment is

670
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,660
completely unprecedented in the history
of money.

671
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,370
And I'm not talking about Bitcoin,
I'm talking about 22 central banks,

672
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:44,600
similar caneously taking their interest
rate to zero and pumpings the largest

673
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,840
amount of money ever created into the
world economy trying to stop it from

674
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:51,080
collapsing.
And that has created the largest bubble

675
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:54,920
in history.
And the weird thing is that most people

676
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:59,120
are not even aware that they're living
in a time what we are doing this

677
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,640
completely unprecedented,
untested,

678
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,560
no one knows where it goes.
Huge monetary experiments in which 2

679
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,660
billion people are hostage as part of
it,

680
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,040
at least.
Right?

681
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,070
And nobody knows where this is going to
go.

682
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:16,820
But most economists,
mainstream economists say this doesn't

683
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,000
tend well
said mean though.

684
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,550
And then we have the other level of
monetary experiment,

685
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,413
which is,
Hey,

686
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,900
uh,
money on the Internet with a controlled

687
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:29,660
issuance.
Only a certain amount of the money is

688
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:32,060
created.
It's controlled by a mathematical

689
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,680
formula.
You can't make more.

690
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,320
And as a result,
it's got a stable

691
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,390
ply.
It sound money and it cannot be

692
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,700
manipulated by governments or banks.
Well,

693
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:47,680
it's so confusing for anyone as it is
when you get into the issue of what is

694
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:51,760
money and where's money coming from and
how does the Federal Reserve,

695
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:54,610
how does the government,
how does anybody create more money?

696
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:57,460
How do you print more money?
And if you are printing more money,

697
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:59,800
where's it coming from?
And what is it debt.

698
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,080
Right?
But what is it like,

699
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,470
what is,
he used to be gold and it used to be the

700
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,570
gold standard.
It used to be if you had a dollar as a

701
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:10,480
dollar's worth of gold,
it was a note that was worth a dollar's

702
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,770
worth of gold.
Yes,

703
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,670
that made sense.
And that stopped what

704
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,510
first stopped in 1936,
I believe,

705
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:21,260
Bretton Woods agreement.
And then it stopped completely in 1971

706
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,260
when Nixon closed the gold window,
he basically said,

707
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,670
if anyone comes to your bank and gives
you one silver dollar or one gold dollar

708
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:30,410
and says,
I want my silver,

709
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,390
you say no.
Um,

710
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,600
and basically defaulted on the backing
of US dollars,

711
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:36,190
buy gold.

712
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,160
I met this wacky guy

713
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,710
a long time ago that was,
um,

714
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,190
he was coming on the comedy store's this
really odd guy for a bunch of reasons,

715
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,960
but one of the things is he carried a
gun everywhere he went and he believed

716
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,990
in,
he believed in precious gold coins that

717
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:02,151
were minted outside of the federal
government and using those as currency.

718
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,980
Yes.
And so he would have these coins that he

719
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:05,701
carried with him,
everything.

720
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,500
And he would try to pay for things in
these,

721
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,950
Colin's like gold and silver coins,
mostly silver.

722
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,490
It's silver coins.
And he was trying to explain to me that

723
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:16,560
this is legal and that,
you know,

724
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:20,490
they're supposed to accept these.
And it was a very weird stuff.

725
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,810
It was a very,
very odd,

726
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,460
he was very annoying too,
as well as guys.

727
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,190
They like talk to you.
He kept touching you,

728
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,480
would talk to you and hold you and like,
like grab your arm and hold you and

729
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,730
touch you and all right fucker.

730
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,280
What a year here.
A control freak.

731
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,350
And he said it's like a weird control
freak.

732
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,080
You know,
if someone's saying something to you and

733
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,950
they are holding onto you whether saying
that to you,

734
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,970
unless you're in love with them,
you know like you creates a very strange

735
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:45,840
moment.
Yeah.

736
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,360
Why are you holding me?
Can I get loose here?

737
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,880
What if I have to run away real quick so
have to break this grip.

738
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,300
But this guy used to carry these coins
around with them.

739
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,880
I can't fucking sack.
He likes to touch his money.

740
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,920
Elvis off commercials and shit like
that.

741
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,710
No Man,
they were like some weird fucking coin

742
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:05,540
with like an American Eagle on them and
yeah,

743
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,410
they're not weird.
They're minted in the u s full silver

744
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:11,010
coins right now.
They're weird.

745
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,160
Weirdest fuck.
They're weird if you tried to use them

746
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:17,240
to buy a coffee.
Although a lot of people buy these and

747
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,360
gold coins and small gold bars as
investments,

748
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,860
they keep him in a safe,
right?

749
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,390
And the idea is if there is a
significant crash in the car and seat,

750
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,710
then these have holding value,
right?

751
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,390
Um,
and it's not,

752
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,370
it's I think,
perfectly sane to say,

753
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:37,940
if you have some money put aside in
savings,

754
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:40,090
don't put it all in stocks.
Maybe diversify,

755
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,220
put a bit in precious metals,
maybe put a bit in digital currencies,

756
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:45,920
maybe put a bit in commodities and other
things.

757
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,040
Um,
that's kind of reasonable and fasting.

758
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,370
And here's the thing.
A lot of the people who have these kinds

759
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:57,371
of attitudes come from families and from
cultures where there has been a time in

760
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:02,240
the past two generations where you leave
in the middle of the night with all of

761
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:07,241
your belongings in a pillowcase and with
people with guns and dogs after you

762
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:11,810
trying to murder you.
And this happens today in Syria,

763
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,490
right?
Um,

764
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,020
it happens,
uh,

765
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,350
one generation to go to my parents'
generation in,

766
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,000
in Greece with the Nazis.

767
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,551
Um,
Eh,

768
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:26,551
it happens to the Russian people.
It happens to people all over the world.

769
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,360
And when that happens,
and it's,

770
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,970
it's really cool.
So when it happens generation before,

771
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,860
right?
Your parents tell you the stories,

772
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,860
it's a,
it's a different feeling.

773
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,270
It hasn't happened to most Americans,
uh,

774
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,360
in at least two or three generations.
But when that happens,

775
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,940
what do you put in the pillowcase?
And I'll tell you something,

776
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,590
the pieces of paper are worthless when
that happens.

777
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,620
And that's why some people do want to
have physical coin.

778
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,160
Now,
one of the things we've noticed now is

779
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:01,630
that digital currencies may start to
serve a role.

780
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,400
The fact is that you can memorize 12
English words and carry your entire

781
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:11,050
bitcoin wallets in your head.
And if you do that well,

782
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:14,140
you 12 English words,
what are those words?

783
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,600
Level celsion party on.
Yeah.

784
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:17,790
So,
um,

785
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,320
you can generate a bitcoin wallet,
right?

786
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,960
And then make a backup of it.
And for convenience,

787
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,560
some of the inventors in the space
developed a system where you can back up

788
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:30,280
any bitcoin wallet,
even if it has millions and billions of

789
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:35,281
transactions and assets in it,
you can back it up to between 12 and 24

790
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:39,190
English words that are generated
automatically by the program.

791
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,360
Be like that speech and pulp fiction
where Samuel Jackson pulls a gun on that

792
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:46,510
kid.
That could be your password.

793
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,570
Yes.
Um,

794
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,820
you don't pick the words though.
Oh,

795
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,580
you don't pick the words.
You're going to get a series so forwards

796
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,990
and they're going to be,
um,

797
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:58,020
you know,
asparagus forest,

798
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,740
uh,
attorney and would've whatever all I

799
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,090
liked dix please.
Shit on my head.

800
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,390
Yeah,
no sentences and snow where it's like

801
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:10,470
that.
But think about the power of being able

802
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:14,460
to transport an unlimited amount of
money simply by memorizing 12 words that

803
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:16,530
can't be confiscated from you when
you're a refugee.

804
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,640
Kate's amazing.
I mean,

805
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:18,840
you look the whole,
uh,

806
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:23,820
the whole idea behind it is incredibly
fascinating to me and I've been a fan of

807
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,750
it since the time I met you.
And before that I was reasonably

808
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:29,100
interested in it.
But of course,

809
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,220
having you a aluminate it in such a
great way really made it much more,

810
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,660
um,
much more enticing and much more

811
00:40:36,661 --> 00:40:38,760
interesting.
And I've always been,

812
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,020
I'm curious from that point on as to
where it's gonna go.

813
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,063
And,
uh,

814
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,070
I just don't,
I don't know,

815
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,900
when I look at the landscape of money,
when I look at the landscape of,

816
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:53,460
uh,
people that are willing to make this

817
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:56,220
leap,
I don't know what it would take to get

818
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:01,221
people fully onboard with Bitcoin,
but I believe like you do that the

819
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,980
system that we have now,
the banking system is incredibly corrupt

820
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:06,270
and just bizarre

821
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,580
and fragile and frail.
And I think that's the thing that most

822
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:12,670
people are missing.
It looks giant imposing.

823
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,700
It's been there for a century that is
not a sign of strength.

824
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,310
You find that the company in Atlanta
that has this,

825
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:28,381
a massive,
a return on your investment that's being

826
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:31,390
investigated.
I'm not sure if I found the right guy

827
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,550
and I don't want to call them.
Okay,

828
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,980
look again,
but

829
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,100
it's gotta be a bunch of those people
out there that are doing that,

830
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,420
right?
Yeah,

831
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,980
absolutely.
There's,

832
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,600
there's a lot of,
um,

833
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,850
Eh,
a system like that which is,

834
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,090
which is very opaque,
which most people don't understand,

835
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,180
is the kind of system you want to
corrupt because that's where you can

836
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,130
make the most money without anybody
noticing.

837
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,993
And of course,
you know,

838
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,230
financial crime is not really prosecuted
in this country.

839
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,590
Um,
in 2008 giants crisis,

840
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,960
millions of homeowners kicked out of
their homes,

841
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,240
illegal foreclosures,
Robo signing mills,

842
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:05,681
blah,
blah,

843
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:06,081
blah,
blah.

844
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:08,840
The only person who went to jail,
Bernie Madoff,

845
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:12,530
who stole from the rich,
pretty much everybody else.

846
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,060
Scottfree it is pretty interesting.
It's almost like he was just a scape

847
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,080
goat.
Well,

848
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:20,560
he was obviously a crook.
He was obviously a car.

849
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,300
He was obviously a crook,
but in a sociopath or something,

850
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:28,301
surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of quirks in the same scale and

851
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,370
giant investment banks that are just as
corrupt.

852
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,400
And we don't see that right.
You,

853
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:38,690
you can get,
you can get pulled over for a busted

854
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:43,691
tail lights and thrown in jail in plenty
of the states in this country for six

855
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:49,151
months for having an herb in your car.
And at the same time,

856
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:53,570
you can put a million people out of
their homes through straight up fraud

857
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,450
with mountains of evidence and emails
and things like that.

858
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,270
And they're untouchable.
That system,

859
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,230
the problem isn't the fact that there's
fraud.

860
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,370
The problem is that the,
the system itself is fragile because of

861
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:10,430
that.
And if it was just them going out of

862
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:13,880
business,
when the fragile system has problems,

863
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,480
when it has hiccups as it did in 2008,
that's fine.

864
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,420
But it's not just them going out of
business.

865
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:24,950
It's a generation of kids who leave
college with nothing waiting for them,

866
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,270
but a,
a job.

867
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,910
Um,
and you know,

868
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,660
coming into a generation where their
parents could get by with one income and

869
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:40,871
a household and now three jobs each in a
household of two.

870
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,610
And you can't afford to buy a car,
let alone a house.

871
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:45,890
Right?
So we're part of the new sharing

872
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,630
economy.
And what does the sharing economy,

873
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,610
it's the,
I can tone anything cause I can't afford

874
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,611
anything economy.
So that whole generation is now

875
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:59,750
suffering because of that fragility of
the system and the fragility hasn't gone

876
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,740
away,
but I don't want to dwell too much on

877
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,820
the negative.
Right.

878
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,821
Because the thing that I find positive
and interesting about bitcoin is that it

879
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,890
serves a global society.
It is truly global,

880
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,170
transnational money.
There's plenty of places in the world

881
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:21,080
that have it worse than the u s there's
some places that have it better

882
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,700
financially.
Um,

883
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,140
but it really is quite an incredible
concept to be able to have this money

884
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:31,500
that can operate on a global basis.
And with that,

885
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,530
the opportunities to a buy and sell and
trade and invest and borrow

886
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,620
internationally.

887
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,540
The fact that what we did with the
fundraising here to fundraise for those

888
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,560
wells,
right?

889
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,250
I,
we don't know if that was just people in

890
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:52,320
the u s donating.
It wasn't,

891
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,890
I can guarantee you there were people
from all over the world donating.

892
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,030
That's almost impossible to do with
traditional payment systems.

893
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,270
You could have then sent that money
directly to where the wells were being

894
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:08,271
built again anywhere in the world.
And that's really exciting to me.

895
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,430
People are uncomfortable with bitcoin
because it's represents changing one of

896
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,670
the fundamental ancient technologies of
civilization money.

897
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,590
And we've only changed that technology
four or five times in the history of

898
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:30,420
human civilization.
We've gone from bare bones,

899
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:32,340
barter systems.
Here's a goat,

900
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:37,341
give me three chickens,
right to systems of precious metals

901
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,870
and other nice objects,
feathers,

902
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:43,830
shells,
et Cetera,

903
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:45,960
to exclusively precious metals,
too.

904
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:48,390
Precious metal stamps with the faces of
kings.

905
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,150
And then at some point around the 15th
century,

906
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,200
you start seeing certificates of deposit
for,

907
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:02,010
for precious metal being exchanged.
Paper notes that I have a deposit of

908
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,840
gold there.
I'm not going to move the gold from my

909
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:06,300
deposit to your deposit.
They'll just give you the piece of paper

910
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:11,301
that says you're now the owner and paper
money is introduced and and then plastic

911
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,790
in the 1950s a diner's club,
traveler's checks and the first credit

912
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:20,310
cards.
And if you think any of these

913
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,430
transitions were smooth,
none of them were smooth.

914
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:26,910
You go to someone who's been using
precious metals for 10 generations and

915
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:27,744
you say,
hey,

916
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,150
this piece of paper is money.
They're like,

917
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,810
give me something shiny that I can bite.
That's money.

918
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,060
This paper,
I don't know who you are.

919
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,330
Go Away.
How long has that transition?

920
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,570
400 years.
Right?

921
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,890
Until broad acceptance of paper money,
400 years with huge resistance.

922
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,830
It took almost 40 years for credit cards
to go mainstream with bitcoin.

923
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,900
We're going to do it probably in less
than 20 you think so?

924
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,630
But in think cause almost 10.
It's seven.

925
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,490
Seven,
yeah.

926
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,700
And it's accelerating very much.
I think in some countries you're going

927
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:10,701
to see either bitcoin or cryptocurrency
very similar or based on bitcoin be used

928
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,150
as commonly as a national currency.
We're not looking to displace national

929
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,620
currencies.
We're looking to supplement them.

930
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,480
I think the idea of being that people
will get comfortable using multiple

931
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,360
currencies just like many places they
are.

932
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,230
If you're operating,
um,

933
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,130
you know,
between the border of Kenya and Tanzania

934
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,040
for example,
you're probably going to use four

935
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,080
different currencies,
Kenyan money,

936
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:41,740
Tanzania and US dollars in euros easily.
Possibly.

937
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,250
Also South African rand,
so you've got four or five currencies.

938
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,540
You can stop at a four year old in the
streets and ask them what the exchange

939
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,430
rate is and they'll tell you right?

940
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,440
Because they trade for their parents and
merchant stalls along the border and

941
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:58,870
they have people coming with all kinds
of different currencies.

942
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,320
It's not that difficult to assume that
there's digital currencies in that

943
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:06,940
future,
either there or in a major modern

944
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:11,080
metropolis where people are using
bitcoin to transact online,

945
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,690
to buy things,
virtual things,

946
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,340
music,
video,

947
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,950
things like that.
What you want to make very,

948
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:22,540
very small payments were credit cards
and not suitable and use bitcoin as well

949
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,260
as their normal currencies.
What is the progress that makes you so

950
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,940
optimistic?
Like what is the,

951
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,180
maybe if you could point to any one
thing or several things that make you

952
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:34,540
optimistic about Bitcoin's future?
Well,

953
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,930
I think watching it as,
as a computer scientist,

954
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:42,040
as a technologist,
I look at this and I see innovation that

955
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:46,240
is accelerating.
And I see much of the early vision

956
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:51,270
opening up the possibility of doing
things that are so far outside what we

957
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,010
could do with traditional money.

958
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,930
Um,
that it,

959
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,980
it often blows my mind.
Uh,

960
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,830
for example,
um,

961
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,780
uh,
technology that's being introduced into

962
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:04,190
bitcoin now is called payment channels.
Um,

963
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,060
and what it allows you to do is,
uh,

964
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,260
to do a very high volume of very small
transactions at a very rapid rate.

965
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,310
Let's say you're,
you want to watch a video and you want

966
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:21,490
to pay the owner of that video to send
it to you.

967
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,800
Um,
how about paying by the second?

968
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,760
And so you say you set up basically an
account and you pay by every second of

969
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,470
video,
maybe every fifth of a second,

970
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,110
200 milliseconds,
a video at a time,

971
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,920
and you're paying a fraction that is a
thousandth of a penny.

972
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,500
And You keep watching video and paying a
thousandth of a penny for every fifth of

973
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:47,920
a second on this drip metered basis.
Well,

974
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,510
you're not doing it.
You're a computer.

975
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,750
Software is doing it,
communicating with our computer software

976
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:56,260
and now you can do this really
incredible thing.

977
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,960
You can pay for content what it's
actually worth.

978
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,870
Um,
whereas the thresholds for payments on a

979
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:05,050
credit card is two to $3.
Unless you're apple and you're doing

980
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:07,450
billions,
in which case you can take it down to 99

981
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,100
cents.
That's about the lowest you can go.

982
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:14,100
So meaning watching something on youtube
or some similar videos,

983
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:17,560
streaming device,
you would have to pay service rather,

984
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:20,110
you'd have to pay,
but you would pay a very minuscule

985
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:20,944
amount.
Yes.

986
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,490
Like what are you talking about?
A couple of cents like to watch a,

987
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:25,090
no,
I'm,

988
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:30,050
I literally mean a thousandth of 500th
of a cent to watch a video.

989
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,550
Well,
it depends how long the video is,

990
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,150
right?
You could,

991
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,110
you could,
yeah,

992
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:34,520
it could be a scale.
You could be a penny.

993
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,800
Yeah.
You could be a penny or half a penny or

994
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,980
a 10th of a penny to watch a video.
But what,

995
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,670
how would that work for the people that
are providing content?

996
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:44,510
Like,
well,

997
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:46,850
you see,
the thing is they operate at a scale.

998
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,110
I have,
um,

999
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,890
30,000 views on one of my videos,
right?

1000
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:57,050
So Youtube pays me 30 bucks for that.
If I put ads in front,

1001
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,310
if I was getting a penny from each of my
customers,

1002
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:03,440
or because these are like hour long
videos,

1003
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,470
maybe I'm going to charge more baby,
I'm going to charge 25 cents,

1004
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,590
you know,
30,000 views,

1005
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,900
25 cents.
Somebody do the math please.

1006
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,200
Uh,
I'm not good at selling himself,

1007
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:15,034
Matt Graham.

1008
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,290
No,
it's like 70 bucks.

1009
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:23,470
$70.
25 cents is a quarter of a dollar.

1010
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,640
No,
it's 7,000.

1011
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,474
You're right.
Yeah,

1012
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,343
yeah,
yeah.

1013
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,160
So it's a rare time where I'm writing a
math fucking quick question like that.

1014
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,690
So maybe I'm going to charge less maybe.
But in any case,

1015
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:40,750
I can beat what youtube gives me in
terms of ad revenue with each customer

1016
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,800
paying a fraction
of a penny.

1017
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,000
And here's the real question,
but I get this content for free right

1018
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:52,490
now on trust.
Why would I pay a fraction of a penny?

1019
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,760
You don't get it for free.
You're paying.

1020
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,200
No,
you're paying him.

1021
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,880
Yes.
And micro violations of your privacy.

1022
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:04,460
What's your,
if the product costs less than two or $3

1023
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:06,720
making the stank face.
Now,

1024
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,510
if agree with you,
but that was a weird way to word it.

1025
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,490
Yeah.
If it's at another cord,

1026
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,070
if,
if the payment is worth less than two or

1027
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,520
$3,
right.

1028
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,230
Which means they can't collect it with a
credit card.

1029
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:21,020
What they're doing is they're selling
your data to advertisers.

1030
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,440
There are selling your identity,
your demographics,

1031
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,990
your data to advertise a series here
you're getting,

1032
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,280
you're having to give up things.
You don't give them up at that moment.

1033
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:36,140
You've given them a previously when you
registered for the thing and verified

1034
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:41,141
your email and then verified your age
and your gender and provided all of this

1035
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:45,740
demographic information,
which they then parcel up and give to

1036
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:49,100
the advertisers,
but you're still paying for the content.

1037
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:51,800
What you're,
you're paying by the fact that you can

1038
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,801
no longer engage with the web without it
being filtered to what they think you

1039
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:01,280
want and who they think you are.
Right.

1040
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:06,370
So you're getting this highly filtered,
pigeonholed view of content and they do

1041
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:11,750
that using your information to present
what they think you would like to watch

1042
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,790
based on what they've sold to the
advertisers.

1043
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,130
You're no longer a customer,
you're the product.

1044
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:22,280
The customer is the advertising agency.
Whereas if you sell content directly,

1045
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,010
you reestablish the relationship of who
is the creator

1046
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,610
and who is the customer,
the consumer of this content,

1047
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,250
and you cut out the two middlemen.
Yeah,

1048
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,650
you're cutting out advertising,
good luck.

1049
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,710
And also the other thing is like people
don't want to pay,

1050
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,070
even if it's a fraction of a penny,
they just don't want to pay.

1051
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,840
I disagree.
Do you think of people,

1052
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,820
there's a lot of dopes at watch youtube
all day.

1053
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,290
Like they sit in front of their
computer,

1054
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,370
they slack jaw from morning to night and
they just watch youtube videos.

1055
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,530
If they just calculated those fractions
of a penny all day,

1056
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:55,260
that would be dollars and dollars every
day,

1057
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,710
which would mean the hundreds of dollars
every few months.

1058
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,990
Well,
you've got to think about this as a

1059
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:05,991
broader economy because a lot of these
people could also earn a bet by making

1060
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:07,380
a,
a good comment,

1061
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,160
uh,
which actually ends up covering some of

1062
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,290
their costs of viewing so that you've
got to think about it.

1063
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,330
You can earn from comments.
Yeah.

1064
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:17,200
That's where it gets really interesting.
Blockchain,

1065
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,870
all this that you're talking about.
No,

1066
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,180
you could do this with bit coin.
You could do this with blockchain.

1067
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:22,560
You,
what is the difference in blockchain and

1068
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:24,330
Bitcoin?
Sorry to hijack that.

1069
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,173
No,
no problem.

1070
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,470
Um,
so blockchain is one of the technologies

1071
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:31,650
used in bitcoin.
It's a distributed database where,

1072
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,690
um,
all of the transactions are linked

1073
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,450
together using cryptographic proofs.
Um,

1074
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,240
bitcoin is one implementation of a
blockchain.

1075
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,970
And blockchain has now been used as a
marketing term.

1076
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,060
That means very little.
It's kind of like web two.

1077
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:45,600
Dot.
Oh,

1078
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,460
we don't really know what it is.
Right.

1079
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,310
It's a lot of hurry datto yet.
Yeah.

1080
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,660
Uh,
which is blockchain.

1081
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,010
Oh,
okay.

1082
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,100
That's ironic,
isn't it?

1083
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,760
Hit?
It is.

1084
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,320
Yeah.
And it's nebulous.

1085
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,590
Um,
but the point is that you can do more

1086
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,380
than just currency.
Um,

1087
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,790
earlier we were talking a bit about
trolling on twitter and other platforms

1088
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,950
like that before we started the live
broadcast.

1089
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,620
Well,
think about what a troll is doing.

1090
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,660
What they're doing is they're stealing
attention.

1091
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,540
They're taking attention without
contributing anything back to the

1092
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,790
community.
Uh,

1093
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,780
there's an interesting and fairly,
um,

1094
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,570
effective market solution to this,
which is instead of assigning someone to

1095
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:30,870
do oversight and decide who is and who
isn't a troll and censor them,

1096
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:35,770
you basically allow people to contribute
again,

1097
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,820
a minuscule fraction for the comments
they like,

1098
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,140
they [inaudible] power like thumbs up.
But with each one of those likes and

1099
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:46,320
thumbs up,
you attach a 10000th of a penny with it,

1100
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,600
you know,
irrelevant,

1101
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:49,650
small,
tiny money.

1102
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,520
Um,
and then the people who write comments

1103
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,780
that are broadly appreciated,
that add value to the community or in a

1104
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:59,730
tiny bit of money,
not really anything serious,

1105
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,360
but if they tried to comment,
they have to spend a bit of that credit

1106
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,790
that they've earned that reputation that
they've earned.

1107
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,210
And if they're not a troll,
it doesn't,

1108
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,960
it all comes out equal in the wash.
They don't end up spending anything.

1109
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,570
They don't end up burning anything.
It's just participation in the

1110
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,950
community.
But if they're a troll is suddenly

1111
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:20,490
starts getting interesting because now
it gets expensive to steal the attention

1112
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,950
to the community because the,
you have

1113
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,740
positive feedback,
the more expensive it gets for you to po

1114
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,880
post until eventually you're priced out.
But does that also,

1115
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,250
that also can kind of enforce or,
or encourage confirmation bias because

1116
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:41,200
if you go to a website that's just
completely ridiculous and it's a message

1117
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:44,080
board filled with morons and you argue
with them,

1118
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,250
it could cost you to argue with morons
cause you're going to downvote you.

1119
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

1120
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,710
It could.
Um,

1121
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,300
and just choose to not comment,
but you could,

1122
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,440
you've got to think about this again
across a broader economy with a broader

1123
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:01,180
set of forums in which in some you are
valued experts and other,

1124
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:05,180
you're the idiot who's arguing against
the conventional wisdom and,

1125
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,290
and you know,
you can actually balance these things

1126
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,510
out.
But if you go to a flat earth forum and

1127
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,030
argue with those people and it costs you
money.

1128
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,010
Yes.
I had an argument with someone about

1129
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,230
chem trails.
How did that go?

1130
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,690
It went really,
it went very,

1131
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:22,720
very interestingly.
I wasn't expecting them to change their

1132
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:24,610
mind.
Um,

1133
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,110
and they really wanted to hear my
opinion and it was really interesting

1134
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:30,850
because we started the conversation.
I said,

1135
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,300
okay,
first I'm a pilot,

1136
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,110
I have a pilot's license,
I fly small planes.

1137
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,210
That puts you at an extreme advantage.
Yes.

1138
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:45,850
This conversation.
Well you think you would think that

1139
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:46,731
it's,
I mean,

1140
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:47,710
and it's,
it's not,

1141
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,510
it's not appeal to authority.
It's saying those nozzles that you're

1142
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,210
pointing at,
I know what those are.

1143
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,170
I have to,
I have to walk around the plane before I

1144
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:02,950
take off and make sure all of them have
correctly attached in the place they

1145
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:04,810
should be doing the things they should
be doing.

1146
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Otherwise I don't survive the flight.
So you are a part of the chem trail

1147
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:12,070
sprayers,
association of America,

1148
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:12,940
you're saying?

1149
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,070
Yes.
That was pretty much the conclusion we

1150
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,270
reached.
What are those nozzles?

1151
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,390
I'm actually in the,
in the,

1152
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,180
in the,
the ones pointing forward are called

1153
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:26,380
peto tubes and they're used to measure
the velocity of the aircraft through the

1154
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,790
air by a pressure differential.
And the ones pointing backwards are

1155
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:35,230
usually to break up of fortresses.
These are little swirly currents of

1156
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:38,710
arrows that come off the wing,
the cause turbulence and you want to

1157
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:41,190
break those up so they don't swirl.
Um,

1158
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,600
by the weight of the trails are clouds.
How long have you been a shell with a

1159
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,400
water vapors government?
Indeed,

1160
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,390
of course.
I'm Michelle.

1161
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,670
I'm Michelle for,
can't believe one of the things I'm

1162
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,200
interested in.
Shut it off Jamie.

1163
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,650
Yeah,
I've had these conversations with so

1164
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,230
frustrating.
You can present mountains of evidence if

1165
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:01,570
someone really,
really doesn't want to believe they,

1166
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,740
they really will not believe.
There's also,

1167
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,580
um,
I mean it's been going on forever.

1168
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,610
I mean if you go back to the 1940s,
there's pictures,

1169
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:16,150
black and white photos from world war
one or World War II rather,

1170
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,820
where you can see planes leaving behind
these enormous controls.

1171
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,010
So it's a argument.
I mean,

1172
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,280
it really is.
I mean we've known for a long time that

1173
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,680
depending upon how much moisture is in
the atmosphere,

1174
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,560
when planes pass through it,
they will create clouds.

1175
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,580
And it's just real simple changes the
temperature of the air and it creates

1176
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,340
clouds and it's usually on hazy days.
Not only that,

1177
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:42,341
but NASA has a website where you can go
to it and it will accurately predict.

1178
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,060
Contrary.
I was looking through that.

1179
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,690
That is,
those are from propeller engines in the

1180
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:52,190
1940s and what's happening is the
propeller is compressing the air and

1181
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,150
when it compresses the air of the change
in pressure changes the dewpoint and the

1182
00:59:56,151 --> 01:00:01,151
dewpoint is what determines whether the
air moisture condenses into a visible

1183
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:05,870
vapor,
into droplets that are clouds.

1184
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,010
And so by pushing a thing through the
air,

1185
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,080
uh,
you're pressing on the air and when you

1186
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:14,930
press on the air,
that causes condensation to form.

1187
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:19,280
And that conversation follows you in a
circular cloud behind the plane.

1188
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,860
And this happens at any plane propeller
plane.

1189
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,830
I've done it in a,
in a four seater Cessna,

1190
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,300
that's,
that's smaller than a,

1191
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,430
than a Fiat sedan.
Right.

1192
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,290
And on a,
on a,

1193
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,750
on a wet day,
you can see little trails coming off the

1194
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:39,530
tips of the wings.
And I pretty short and put any spray

1195
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,660
nozzles they or flipped this way.
I didn't,

1196
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,990
I saw this,
which it said chem trail them and I

1197
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:46,450
didn't flip it.
I didn't,

1198
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,560
you don't how much liquid you would have
to have in your plane in order to spray

1199
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,470
these enormous jets across the sky.
I mean,

1200
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:56,900
it would be insane.
It would be insane.

1201
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:59,660
I mean,
if the entire plane was filled up,

1202
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,980
I mean filled and you would have so much
liquid that it would be visible from the

1203
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:05,540
ground floating in space.

1204
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,950
And then he talked to people,
you know,

1205
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:10,190
I did that television show on Scifi,
I called Joe Rogan questions,

1206
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,950
everything.
And one of the things that I questioned

1207
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,960
was chem trail.
So I talked to a bunch of chem trail,

1208
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:20,650
air quote experts.
And one of these guys had this study

1209
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:25,310
that he had done on water.
And this standing water study was

1210
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,290
proving that the spraying in the air was
making aluminum.

1211
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,590
Uh,
it was putting aluminum in the water.

1212
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,760
And the water supply.
And so he had this water tested.

1213
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,650
And so I,
he showed me the test,

1214
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:40,610
I'm going over the test.
I go,

1215
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,810
well,
it's a sludge.

1216
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:43,310
And he goes,
well,

1217
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,140
it was water.
I gave them water.

1218
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:45,950
I go,
okay,

1219
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,970
but it says sludge,
like the laboratory that you sent this

1220
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,740
stuff too,
says sludge.

1221
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,450
And He,
and he was like,

1222
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:54,980
well,
what is exactly sludge?

1223
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,090
What's the definition?
I'm like,

1224
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,020
well,
let's Google it.

1225
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,040
So we googled sludge and what sludges is
water mixed with dirt?

1226
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,061
So I said,
okay,

1227
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:06,290
so your water mixed with dirt contains
aluminum.

1228
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,040
Do you know how much aluminum there is
in dirt?

1229
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:15,610
Because it's the exact amount that they
tested when they tested the world.

1230
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:20,710
The water that you had with dirt.
So what happened is your dirt tested

1231
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:25,911
positive for being dirt and you're using
that as proof that the government is

1232
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:29,910
spraying the skies above everybody's
head.

1233
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,240
And you want to talk about like a Piss
poor cost ineffective shitbag program

1234
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:40,170
that does absolutely nothing.
Chem Charles would be it because it's

1235
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:42,300
not doing anything.
Like no one's getting sick.

1236
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,220
There's no lake rise in illnesses.
There's no like mind control going on.

1237
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,470
There's nothing,
there's things happening or is no mind

1238
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:52,980
control going on.
There is no mind control going on.

1239
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,080
There is no mind control.
I mean,

1240
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,110
it's the dumbest fucking thing.
It be easier to just put it in your

1241
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,630
municipal water supply.
Yeah.

1242
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:00,190
Well,
I mean,

1243
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,280
as arguments that are doing that too.
Well,

1244
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:03,330
of course,
of course.

1245
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:08,310
They move it with a planes to the
appliances are spraying.

1246
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,680
It drops,
it falls in the water supply and then

1247
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:11,820
you drink it.
Something like that.

1248
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,461
Anyway.
Yeah.

1249
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:13,800
Spreading themselves too,
by the way.

1250
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,630
But they're immune to it because they're
lizards.

1251
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:17,430
You know,
they're down here too.

1252
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,720
So you spray the sky indiscriminately.
I mean,

1253
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,260
I guarantee you some Illuminati is,
or getting sprayed.

1254
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,880
I'm going to get some hate mail for
this.

1255
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:24,780
I know it well.
Yeah,

1256
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:25,920
for sure.
We're getting it right now.

1257
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:30,450
People were wiping the cheetos off their
greasy little fat fucking fingers right

1258
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:33,750
now and hammering at the keyboards ready
to call a shills.

1259
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,820
It's the dumbest.
It's what?

1260
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,720
Um,
there,

1261
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,240
there's a,
a guy who runs,

1262
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,610
um,
what is the website?

1263
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,810
Metal.
Bunk metal,

1264
01:03:42,811 --> 01:03:45,870
bunk.com what is his name,
Mick.

1265
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,640
Anyway,
he,

1266
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:50,400
uh,
he calls it the training wheels for

1267
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:53,760
conspiracy theorist because it's above
your head and you seeing it all the

1268
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:54,370
time.
You're like,

1269
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:57,470
what is going on up there?
Why is l a very cloud like,

1270
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,010
what is that?
And he started thinking,

1271
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:00,330
man,
the government's doing something

1272
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:02,610
secretly.
Yes.

1273
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,720
Mapquest.
Thank you.

1274
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,370
Oh,
metal bunk debunked.

1275
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,990
Look,
midwest is a shill.

1276
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,760
He's a shill.
Debunk,

1277
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,690
debunk,
debunk,

1278
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,733
debunk,
debunk.

1279
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,480
He got death threats and hate mail when
he came on that TV show with me.

1280
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,500
Woo.
Yeah,

1281
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,120
no,
this is the guy.

1282
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,320
Yeah.
This is,

1283
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:21,600
how does this hedge fund manager makes
so much money?

1284
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:23,460
Look at them.
Just look at him sweating.

1285
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,070
Oh,
we'll get is.

1286
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Look at this annual returns of 13% 24%
or even 91% since 2013 how it's done

1287
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:36,510
either it's just a computer program.

1288
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,880
They have to pay for a decade up front
and if you leave,

1289
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:41,760
he gets half the principal.
Oh Gee.

1290
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:46,110
I wonder how it works.
Jesus fucking Christ you crook clients.

1291
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,730
Hold on a second.
Co leaves it.

1292
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:50,340
Clients aren't sure how it's done.
And Joseph A.

1293
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,740
Meyer Junior,
the man behind the obscure Hedge Fund,

1294
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,790
Al Our June lp is keeping his cards
close.

1295
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,890
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1296
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,000
Invest most of his client's money in
safe treasury bonds.

1297
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,380
Yeah,
it's safe as fuck.

1298
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:06,090
If you can't take your money out for 10
years,

1299
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:07,650
you know,
everybody in there can't take their

1300
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:09,810
money out for 10 years.
That's insanity.

1301
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,510
That's insane that that's that kind of
like,

1302
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,400
I mean,
you don't know this guy,

1303
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,780
but look at that.
What's that?

1304
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,010
What does that all right?
I don't

1305
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,690
know.
I mean if you had a gas,

1306
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,170
uh,
if I had to,

1307
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:23,740
I had to guess.
I'm going to give you two options.

1308
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,260
Yeah.
Legit or scam.

1309
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,000
Yes.
Um,

1310
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,650
I don't know.
I would say it is most likely a Ponzi

1311
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:36,040
scheme,
which is outrageous.

1312
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:41,100
Something people throw around a lot.
But here's the interesting thing is why

1313
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:42,790
do these schemes happen?

1314
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,020
Right?
What do you look as though it,

1315
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,830
his offer,
he offers an extraordinary guarantee

1316
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,040
with our June.
You never lose my walk first as well.

1317
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:50,660
What kind of names?

1318
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,840
I think that's actually part of the
definition of an investment.

1319
01:05:53,841 --> 01:05:58,700
Fraud is guaranteed returns.
So if you make a guarantee like that,

1320
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,950
um,
it's usually one of the triggers that

1321
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:04,430
gets people investigated.
W he doesn't,

1322
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,480
but you never lose money.

1323
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,790
Yeah.
He's a great investment.

1324
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,620
That's fantastic.
Investors should get involved.

1325
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,160
Yeah.
Maybe put some bitcoin in that and to

1326
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,013
solidify it.

1327
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,350
Yeah.
Okay.

1328
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:17,890
I'm going to do the opposite.
If you invest your money in Bitcoin,

1329
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,660
you will lose money.
Whoa.

1330
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,030
He will.
He will gain money.

1331
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,800
You will lose money.
You will gain money.

1332
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:25,210
He will lose.
We don't know.

1333
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,140
That's the no one is an,
and I want to be really careful about

1334
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:34,141
this because many people go out and they
push the east things as investments and

1335
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,760
you can have a lot of volatility and
sometimes when you have a lot of

1336
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:41,830
policies,
some people get lucky and they make a

1337
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,970
lot of money and some people are great
at picking their moment and they make

1338
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:46,560
some money

1339
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,020
bailout.
They make a ton of money.

1340
01:06:48,021 --> 01:06:51,230
Like right now we're at 600 bucks.
If you bought it back when it was like,

1341
01:06:51,231 --> 01:06:52,520
what was it,
the lowest point?

1342
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:55,510
Uh,
the lowest lowest points,

1343
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:56,760
no slowest,
uh,

1344
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,610
about a thousandths of a dollar,

1345
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,540
uh,
thousands of a dollar to two to 600.

1346
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:03,530
You said it's,
yeah,

1347
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:04,140
you could,

1348
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,190
yeah.
So I mean if you put in like a fucking

1349
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,830
big pile of money,
yes.

1350
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,500
Five grand and dip,
he took it out the wrong moment,

1351
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,470
you would lose all of it.
And this is why this isn't,

1352
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,880
this isn't,
um,

1353
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,340
a speculative instruments.
People can speculate in it.

1354
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,020
All right,
isn't it,

1355
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,750
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but isn't the well kind of poisoned the

1356
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:29,260
financial well,
with speculative investing,

1357
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,850
like what,
what people are doing?

1358
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,260
It seems like it shouldn't be legal.
And what's really fucked up about it is

1359
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,790
that they're doing it with algorithms
and they're their gambling and they're

1360
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:42,640
there.
They're buying and selling within the

1361
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,400
like a fraction of a second and they're
doing it.

1362
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,430
The point where there was a radio lab,
um,

1363
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:50,830
podcasts where they talked about how
investment firms,

1364
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:52,320
did you see that one or listen to them?
Why?

1365
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,200
I have heard that one.
Yeah,

1366
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:58,260
we're investment firms moved their
servers closer to the exchange so that

1367
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:04,240
he'd get in there their orders and their
exchange is quicker.

1368
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:07,480
There is small on New Jersey.
Where are the data centers of the,

1369
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,810
none of the stock trading happens in
Manhattan.

1370
01:08:09,811 --> 01:08:14,070
It happens across the water in New
Jersey as a data center,

1371
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:19,071
there were probably largest amount of
money moves ever and they have measured

1372
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,610
runs of fiber,
meaning that in order to be fair,

1373
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:26,420
the fiber optic cable between the
service that do the trading and every

1374
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:30,770
one of the rocks that are in the room
are measured to be the equal length so

1375
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:35,771
that the speed of light limitation
across a room of a hundred feet does not

1376
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,980
advantage one customer over another.
Is that incredible?

1377
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,890
We're talking microseconds,
right?

1378
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,080
Yeah.

1379
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,501
Yeah.
Well,

1380
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:46,260
if people have been forced because of
this,

1381
01:08:46,261 --> 01:08:51,261
to move their offices from the middle of
the country where they were two right

1382
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:55,320
there or rent space where their servers
are right there.

1383
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,470
It's really,
it's so bizarre because a lot of this

1384
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:01,710
stuff is actually done with computers,
so these computers are operating on an

1385
01:09:01,711 --> 01:09:03,990
algorithm.
The algorithms recognize patterns.

1386
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:08,010
They start these exchanges and they buy
and sell and buy and sell and buy and

1387
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:10,980
sell and do all of this within fractions
of a second.

1388
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,170
Yeah.
Over the last decade,

1389
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,320
most trading floors have seen 90% of
their traders disappear.

1390
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,960
So there are empty rooms.
You can see photos,

1391
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:21,860
all that's online where it shows before
and after photos of very big banks like

1392
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,370
ubs and jp Morgan,
Goldman Sachs,

1393
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,980
companies like that.
Then you see their trading floor and it

1394
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:32,981
is empty because a lot of that has now
moved to algorithmic trading.

1395
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,750
So strange.
What a weird,

1396
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,300
weird way to invest in bias.
Oh thank you.

1397
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,130
Look at that.
Oh my God.

1398
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:42,830
That's the before and after and it's not
because they're making less money,

1399
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:45,680
right?
This is not a downturn.

1400
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,780
This during this time they've actually
made more money.

1401
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,970
But there's something about those stock
exchange videos that were in movies,

1402
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,890
you know by,
by Sal,

1403
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,300
Sal,
and they've got their hands up and

1404
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:58,070
there.
I want two of these and five of these

1405
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:01,250
and they're holding up pieces of paper
that is so daunting.

1406
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:06,020
All that stuff is so confusing to a
person on the outside looking at that

1407
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:08,180
and trying to figure out what the fuck
those people are doing.

1408
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,660
Like it seems exciting and chaotic and
vibrant but so confusing.

1409
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,350
Right.
But that is,

1410
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,890
that is the American economy right now.
Essentially.

1411
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,020
It's based on confidence all that's
happening.

1412
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,090
Yeah.
So should we talk about a slightly

1413
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:28,440
different topic?
Sure.

1414
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:31,440
Whatever you want.
I want to tell you about some of the new

1415
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:33,120
developments that are happening in
Bitcoin,

1416
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,390
which I find interesting and I'm not
going to show,

1417
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,840
cause this is not really about a company
or a specific product,

1418
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:43,110
but I want to talk about one of the
things that has me excited,

1419
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,930
which is a,
um,

1420
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:50,550
what happens when you combine a
technology that looks very much like

1421
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:55,551
pure to pure napster or bittorrent with
a merchant service like he bay and you

1422
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:02,520
create this hybrid technology,
which is a completely peer to peer,

1423
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,440
um,
store service called open bazaar.

1424
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,500
And,
and this is basically a system where you

1425
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:12,960
run on your computer,
some software,

1426
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:18,620
and you can open a store to delivery the
physical goods or virtual goods,

1427
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,550
have them listed,
have them found by others,

1428
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,580
and then all of the payments are done in
bitcoin.

1429
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,820
So by decentralizing the payment system,
we can also decentralize the the store

1430
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:38,781
system completely.
And it is a completely borderless

1431
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,520
multinational,
uh,

1432
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:46,610
open and peer to peer opensource
software merchant system running on top

1433
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:52,440
of Bitcoin,
which I just find fascinating.

1434
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,830
The ability for anyone to open a store,
especially in countries where you don't

1435
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:56,940
have Ebay,
right.

1436
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,490
And be able to sell goods and services
anywhere in the world and receive

1437
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:05,970
payments in Bitcoin and does this
operational right now?

1438
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,400
Yup.
And I'm selling that book,

1439
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:10,380
uh,
on Openbazaar.

1440
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,280
So how does one access openbazaar to
the,

1441
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,190
to the Luddite?
They,

1442
01:12:16,191 --> 01:12:19,200
they run software,
no fees,

1443
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:22,260
no restriction.
And they downloads the software,

1444
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:26,070
run it on their computer,
funded the bitcoin wallets and which

1445
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:28,170
sits on their computer.
They don't have to give their money.

1446
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:30,780
21,
there's no intermediaries and you buy

1447
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:35,130
directly from the store and the person
running the store is running the same

1448
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:35,700
software.

1449
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,050
Well,
let's see what some of the things that

1450
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:39,660
they have available.
We went to openbazaar.org.

1451
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,030
I have to download the programs and I
find another way to look at it.

1452
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:47,040
Oh yeah.
If you go to do duo search is a search

1453
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:51,780
engine on top a d u o s e a r.
Dot.

1454
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,614
C.
H.

1455
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,130
So duo search.
Yes.

1456
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,520
So because this is an open protocol and
because all of the listings are in a

1457
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:02,220
peer to peer network,
you can just go online.

1458
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:05,730
I run a search engine and create a
search engine that searches the store.

1459
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,710
Wow.
This is a third party that just has a s

1460
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,840
a search engine for searching the store.
So you can um,

1461
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:17,280
you can search online there and uh,
tell her what you're looking for and

1462
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:20,400
find something from tee shirts to gary
gets,

1463
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:21,570
you can find my bank.
Okay.

1464
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,150
But that's not what I wanted to show.

1465
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,690
Look,
you can buy a flip phone,

1466
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,600
go back there.
You can get a phone for Ari.

1467
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,140
What's going on there?
A lot of these darks are going to flip

1468
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:35,310
phones now.
20 Bucks for a Cryo Sarah,

1469
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,880
or that's an LG LG 44.
It's kind.

1470
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,480
Damn bargain.
Have you ever thought about going flip

1471
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,130
phone?
Me?

1472
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,083
Yeah.
No,

1473
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,670
I'm in the opposite category.
I haven't actually received a phone call

1474
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:53,520
on my phone probably in three years.
And really it's not,

1475
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:57,090
I don't have a phone I had out of here.
I have a portable computer,

1476
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:00,750
which also has a phone function on it
that I keep switched off.

1477
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,490
You keep it off pretty much.
Yeah.

1478
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,280
It doesn't bring ever.
It doesn't rain boot on my ring attached

1479
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,500
to.
But people text you?

1480
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,330
Um,
yes,

1481
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,100
but that actually gets redirected to my
email.

1482
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,340
So I don't do texts.

1483
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,470
I,
I do it through either hangouts or

1484
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:16,090
email.
So when I send you a text,

1485
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:17,830
it doesn't really go to you as a text.
No,

1486
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:21,570
it comes through to Google hangouts.
You are one of the weirdest guys have

1487
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,100
room.
I know.

1488
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,240
I use it as a portable computer.
It's my communicator device.

1489
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:28,450
The phone function is irrelevant to me.
Well,

1490
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,220
don't you ever want to talk to people?
Don't you go,

1491
01:14:30,221 --> 01:14:31,510
hey man,
how you doing?

1492
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:34,870
Um,
I do video talks most of the time I know

1493
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:35,950
I'm weird.
Okay.

1494
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,150
Uh,
when I talk to people,

1495
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:37,890
it's on,
well,

1496
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,930
they're selling cbd oil,
CBD oil,

1497
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:41,800
organic,
pure,

1498
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:43,310
raw,
natural CBDC.

1499
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:47,500
That is where the damn government's
gonna come in and close this whole thing

1500
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:49,020
down.
What do you guys doing?

1501
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,130
Mitigating pain?
You pieces of shit.

1502
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,710
We're going to come in with dogs and
bite you.

1503
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,370
Yeah.
They're probably actually only selling

1504
01:14:57,371 --> 01:15:01,930
that's within Oregon within a
jurisdiction where it's legal,

1505
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,400
right?
Because they can sell it within that

1506
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:06,430
jurisdiction from that jurisdiction.
And it's perfectly legal to sell

1507
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,940
Colorado to clarify.
It's growing and getting in.

1508
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,770
It's funny,
we're talking about how weird you are.

1509
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,000
He showed up.
Uh,

1510
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,610
Andrea has,
has a apple laptop and I was like,

1511
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,310
how dare you walk in here with an apple
product?

1512
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:22,690
I expect you to have some Linux box.
And of course he's running linux on his

1513
01:15:22,691 --> 01:15:23,650
apple computer.

1514
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:26,091
Well,
I'm,

1515
01:15:26,091 --> 01:15:28,570
I'm also running Linux.
I'm running a bunch of things,

1516
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,370
but yeah,
it's a beautiful piece of hardware.

1517
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:33,070
I like it.
That doesn't mean that like everything

1518
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:36,130
else the company does or you just don't
like the restrictive aspects of it,

1519
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:36,964
right?
Yeah.

1520
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,140
Yeah.
You're all android,

1521
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:39,400
right?
Yes,

1522
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,680
I am on,
what are you using now?

1523
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:45,010
Which I have a nexus five.
Oh,

1524
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:45,611
that's so,
okay,

1525
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:49,090
so this is the newest and the latest
greatest of the Google phones.

1526
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:51,760
So it runs the,
the pure google or did you,

1527
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,531
yeah,
it's a,

1528
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:53,980
it's no carrier branding.
It's,

1529
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:55,750
I bought,
I own the phone.

1530
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,680
It's not a lease.
Well,

1531
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,910
those,
the newest,

1532
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,930
latest and greatest android phones or at
the very least commensurate with the

1533
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:09,220
newest and latest and greatest iphones.
I think the,

1534
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:12,000
it's the average person that slight
differences in,

1535
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,560
in hardware,
uh,

1536
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,280
really are irrelevant at this point.

1537
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,170
It's wall to wall.
Does matter.

1538
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:19,780
However,
his watch you can and can't do with the

1539
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:23,830
software and how much of your life at
controls and how much privacy you have

1540
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,280
with the software that you run on these
devices.

1541
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:30,730
As you may have noticed,
I'm all about control and privacy.

1542
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:34,690
Being able to control my money,
control my devices,

1543
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:36,850
control my privacy.
Um,

1544
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,270
and I think that's,
that should be a principle that we

1545
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:44,590
should all celebrate.
It's a fundamental freedom and we're

1546
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:46,480
gradually losing it.
Well,

1547
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:51,250
I'm a big fan of options as well,
so I'm happy that a android's come along

1548
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,840
and created options.
Right.

1549
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,520
Because it was for a long time it was
like,

1550
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:55,690
yeah,
it's an option,

1551
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:57,010
but it sucks.
Right.

1552
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,680
And now it's not just,
I mean,

1553
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:03,220
the Galaxy s seven,
have you ever messed with that Samsung

1554
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,210
Galaxy s seven and I've seen it.
Yeah.

1555
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,760
It's a phenomenal phone.
Yeah.

1556
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:08,740
I mean it is easily as good as an
iphone.

1557
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:09,760
It's an phone

1558
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:14,990
and throw it into a gear vr headsets and
you get fully immersive vr.

1559
01:17:15,241 --> 01:17:16,900
That is mind blowing.
Yeah.

1560
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,910
I actually have a little headset that I
can put this phone into and to Vr,

1561
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,350
that stuff's good,
but it's not as good as the htc vive.

1562
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:27,560
Um,
my friend Duncan Duncan trussell as the

1563
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:28,160
vibe.

1564
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,840
I also paid $30 for my headset.
Well,

1565
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,820
I just,
you said the five is what,

1566
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:33,903
1200?

1567
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,840
It's probably something like that.
Yeah.

1568
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,360
It's a slight difference in price.
Yes.

1569
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,740
There's definitely a difference in
price.

1570
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:40,810
Um,
but it is,

1571
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,350
it's very encouraging that not only is
there a competitor to apple,

1572
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,320
but it is actually an equal now,
you know,

1573
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,790
and I just think the more options people
have like that,

1574
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,930
the better there are for everybody.
And it would be nice if there was a

1575
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:56,930
commensurate operating system because
there's not really,

1576
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,420
well,
no,

1577
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,770
not really.
Um,

1578
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,810
for,
for Geek heads like me,

1579
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:04,420
it's letting x.
But essentially what happened is because

1580
01:18:04,421 --> 01:18:07,180
Lennox was so successful,
it became android.

1581
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,270
Android was built on top of Linux.
Essentially.

1582
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:11,980
It is,
it at its very core,

1583
01:18:11,981 --> 01:18:13,210
it is Linux.
Right?

1584
01:18:13,211 --> 01:18:14,500
But why don't they make,
um,

1585
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:17,140
that kind of an operating system for a
computer,

1586
01:18:17,141 --> 01:18:18,370
for a laptop?
Um,

1587
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,380
because from what I can tell,
really,

1588
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:25,300
laptops are gradually disappearing.
The laptop market is disappearing

1589
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,500
really,
really fast.

1590
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,840
Um,
today there were some announcements from

1591
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:32,260
apple.
They're changing some of their operating

1592
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:35,230
system commitments,
but they're making the m seven.

1593
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,330
Yeah.
They're making the operating system more

1594
01:18:37,331 --> 01:18:39,920
and more like Ios,
um,

1595
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,840
and gradually diminishing the importance
of,

1596
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:47,950
of laptops because most people do pretty
much everything they need to do on their

1597
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:48,970
smartphones nowadays.

1598
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:53,550
It is,
it makes a difference that it's nice

1599
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:56,120
that I can take my phone with me.
I have a,

1600
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,200
the larger iphone that I use most of the
time,

1601
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,370
and I also have a Samsung phone,
but they'll,

1602
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:03,060
the larger iphone that I use,
most of the time I can take with me and

1603
01:19:03,061 --> 01:19:07,810
I don't feel like I'm missing a laptop,
but if I need to work on it,

1604
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,870
get some stuff done,
I want a laptop.

1605
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,240
Yeah.
I want to,

1606
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:14,580
if I'm writing,
especially I want to be able to work.

1607
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,600
Yeah.
You know,

1608
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:19,050
I want to be able to also plug in
headsets and listen to music while I'm

1609
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:21,180
working and also have power at the same
time.

1610
01:19:21,181 --> 01:19:23,280
And it says a lot of,
I'm not,

1611
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,210
I'm a big fan of actual computers.
I like an actual computer at home with a

1612
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,510
detached keyboard and a real monitor.
I mean,

1613
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:34,400
I just think those things,
there's some benefits of those things to

1614
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:36,240
someone who writes in particular.
Yeah.

1615
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,500
Dog.
Do you think the great American novel is

1616
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,840
being written by thumbs right now?

1617
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,140
Well,
Steven Wright was writing a whole book

1618
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:44,460
and tweets.
Yeah.

1619
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,750
Yeah.
He was writing a novel in tweets that

1620
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:50,830
got typed on a real keyboard for the
most part.

1621
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,100
I ended up money where for people who
are listening.

1622
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:57,330
Um,
so what else is exciting for you right

1623
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:58,290
now about

1624
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,360
bitcoin?
So I think one of the things we've seen

1625
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:06,361
that that has been quite interesting is
that it has become easier and easier and

1626
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,730
easier to use and easier to get into
bitcoin and easier to use bitcoin in

1627
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:15,300
your everyday life.
I remember a time when it was very,

1628
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:17,280
very difficult to do all of those
things.

1629
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:22,310
Now there are probably six or 700
exchanges around the world.

1630
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,140
Uh,
you talked about Mt.

1631
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,270
Gox in Japan,
the first bitcoin exchange,

1632
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:30,630
the really the first major bitcoin
exchange.

1633
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,230
At the time it was the exchange.
There were no others,

1634
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,850
and
that was both a single point of failure

1635
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:40,950
and a weakness for bit coin as it
proved.

1636
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,710
Um,
but it also made it very difficult.

1637
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:49,280
Now there are at least four or five
major exchanges operating in the US,

1638
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,510
very easy to access,
um,

1639
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,420
access the system to connect it to maybe
to a bank account or a debit card.

1640
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:01,260
And two,
if you want to convert dollars to

1641
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:03,520
bitcoin or Bitcoin to dollars,
uh,

1642
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:07,110
I'm mostly on the other side.
I earn bitcoin and then I converted into

1643
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,290
dollars to pay for things that I can't
pay in bitcoin.

1644
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:14,820
Very easy to do that.
That's a major advancement that makes it

1645
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,960
much easier for people to get involved
as much as they want.

1646
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,200
They don't have to earn everything they
don't have to do.

1647
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:27,620
There's a company called bit wage,
which allows you to take a percentage of

1648
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:32,220
your paycheck and have it sent to you in
Bitcoin.

1649
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,770
Um,
and it's very easy for an employer to

1650
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:37,920
set it up with any of the traditional
payroll systems where they say,

1651
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:38,970
you can say,
just like,

1652
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,300
I'm going to put 2% of my account into a
savings account in 98% into my checking

1653
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:47,250
accounts.
A lot of companies offer that.

1654
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,270
Well now you can say,
and I also want to put 2% of my paycheck

1655
01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:54,960
every month into this,
and to the employer,

1656
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,350
it looks like a routing number and
account number,

1657
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,980
but on the other end it gets converted
into bitcoin and send to your bitcoin

1658
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,890
wallet.
So you can very easily incorporate this

1659
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:08,850
as part of your everyday life.
Now here's another thing.

1660
01:22:08,851 --> 01:22:12,030
I'm going to try and show this in a way
that doesn't cause me a big problem with

1661
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:16,140
my finances,
but how it had caused you a big problem

1662
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,210
if someone sees something to show the
credit card number.

1663
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:18,840
Oh,
I see.

1664
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,080
So this is a,
this isn't Super Crypto

1665
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,950
bitcoin credit card.
It's a bitcoin debit card and basically

1666
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:32,700
it operates,
one of the exchanges in the u s offers

1667
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:37,701
this and there's actually two or three
in the u s that now offer this kind of

1668
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:38,700
service.

1669
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,460
Now what's behind this is a bit coin
wallet.

1670
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:45,270
So I don't have dollars in this.
I have bitcoin in this,

1671
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:49,920
but when I went to the coffee shop or I
got this coffee earlier today,

1672
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,610
I swiped this.
And um,

1673
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,410
do they look at you sideways?
No,

1674
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,230
I mean they can't tell.
They they see a visa card.

1675
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,600
It says visa on the front says debit
visa.

1676
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,670
It doesn't say bitcoin anywhere.
Um,

1677
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,270
and so I make a payment and I get a
little message on my phone that says

1678
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,540
we've debited 0.0002 bitcoin from your
account for your purchase at the coffee

1679
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:16,400
shop.
So you could even tip them in bitcoin.

1680
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,150
Yes.
Uh,

1681
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,850
here's where it gets interesting.
You know,

1682
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:21,880
I travel all around the world,
do these talks and these conferences.

1683
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:25,000
So I'm constantly on the road and I've
tried again and again with my bank

1684
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:26,200
account to tell them,
listen,

1685
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,453
I travel.

1686
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,810
When are you traveling,
sir?

1687
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,540
All the time.
Where are you traveling next?

1688
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,320
Oh 16 different countries in the next
seven months.

1689
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,310
Can you just put a note somewhere on my
account that says do not block his visa

1690
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:43,000
if it shows up somewhere we don't expect
because this person travels.

1691
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,000
American Express can do it.
My Bank cat,

1692
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:50,560
they simply can't.
They want me 24 hours before I leave to

1693
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:55,030
call them and give them specific lists
of places that I'm going to be and when

1694
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,460
I don't do that,
when I tried to use my card,

1695
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:02,610
it gets blocked until I come back to the
u s and talk to them on the phone and

1696
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,040
try a whole bunch of questions about
whether it was really me who bought,

1697
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:09,040
you know,
a pastry in Prague or something like

1698
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:13,540
that and then that all block it.
And what's happened to repeatedly in the

1699
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,000
last few months is I'll go somewhere,
my card will get blocked because I

1700
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:19,570
forgot to tell them and then I'll pull
out of the bitcoin card and it works

1701
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,600
everywhere without fail because it's a
prepaid because it's a debit everywhere

1702
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:25,690
without fail.

1703
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:28,030
If I need to move more money into it,
if I need to take money,

1704
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:32,230
cash out of an ATM when I'm traveling,
I can use this and it's so much easier.

1705
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,800
I can simply transfer bitcoin into that
account and 10 minutes later I can

1706
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:40,780
withdrawal.
That's in cash in any currency in any

1707
01:24:40,781 --> 01:24:43,150
country.
You say that with such glee,

1708
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,220
it's convenience,
so excited about it.

1709
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:49,300
You can't hide it.
Yeah,

1710
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:52,150
I get it.
I get excited about these things because

1711
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:54,130
it makes it easy for me to use Bitcoin,
right?

1712
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,410
And yes,
it's visa,

1713
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:58,840
the evil empire,
the banking system,

1714
01:24:58,841 --> 01:24:59,501
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1715
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:03,730
But for many people who are going to
experience bitcoin as an additional

1716
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,370
currency in their life when they use for
online purchases,

1717
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:11,550
having the flexibility to use both and
making it easier and more transparent is

1718
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:14,800
how you get to mainstream adoption,
especially in the developed world.

1719
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,300
Now,
how would someone get ahold of one of

1720
01:25:16,301 --> 01:25:18,400
those cards?
How do they just opened an account with

1721
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:21,910
an exchange?
They have to do all of the Patriot Act,

1722
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,580
Bank Secrecy Act,
show me ID,

1723
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,600
proof of residence,
et Cetera,

1724
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,600
et cetera.
But in the end they get a visa card.

1725
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:33,610
And what exchanges are available for
getting visa debit cards like that.

1726
01:25:33,611 --> 01:25:36,090
Like can you name some?
Sure.

1727
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,500
Uh,
in the U s coinbase,

1728
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:43,980
coinbase.com and Bitpay bitpay.com both
offer a visa debit cards in many

1729
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:50,701
countries around the world.
Zappo x a p o offer a debit card and

1730
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:53,200
there's a,
there's a bunch of others.

1731
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,970
There's a bunch of others.
Interesting.

1732
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,610
That's interesting.
That's actually very promising because

1733
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,290
that makes it practical.
Yes.

1734
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,900
So that's one side.
Then a few other things that have

1735
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:04,790
happened in this space.
Certainly we have seen,

1736
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,900
um,
a lot of the banking industry realized

1737
01:26:07,901 --> 01:26:10,550
that they could actually use this
technology,

1738
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:12,260
uh,
and not just fear it.

1739
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:17,320
And you know,
we have this and I certainly bring this

1740
01:26:17,901 --> 01:26:20,820
view of banks as giants,
Cara couture,

1741
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,300
dinosaur evil things,
but within them,

1742
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,760
there's just normal people,
right?

1743
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:27,770
Swept up in the institutional inertia of
this beast.

1744
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:30,020
But there's people who,
um,

1745
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:32,430
some of them get it,
they get the,

1746
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:35,060
this is exciting and interesting and
disruptive.

1747
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:38,660
They want to use it within the banking
system and they're trying to work from

1748
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:43,661
within to get people interested in this.
And we're seeing more and more of these

1749
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:50,141
organizations gradually try to find ways
to adopt this technology to streamline

1750
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:56,111
and to improve banking itself.
This is very similar to what we saw in

1751
01:26:57,591 --> 01:27:02,270
the early nineties when the Internet
started happening much more mainstream.

1752
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,000
The phone companies at first fought it
tooth and nail,

1753
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:07,880
right?
They fought the service providers tried

1754
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:12,650
not to give them access to their lines,
try not to kick them off the DSL

1755
01:27:12,651 --> 01:27:13,730
networks at the time.

1756
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,400
Um,
they fall to the FCC,

1757
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:21,401
they tried to control it,
and eventually they all became ISB,

1758
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,940
right?
So eventually jumped on the bandwagon

1759
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,370
and use it to improve their own
infrastructure.

1760
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:32,180
Now if you make a phone call on a
regular traditional old phone,

1761
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,460
your phone call is going over the
Internet,

1762
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,700
almost 90% sure that it is.
So they wouldn't let the Internet beyond

1763
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,671
the phone network.
Now,

1764
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:42,590
the entire phone network is on the
Internet.

1765
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,710
If flipped,
that's called infrastructure in version.

1766
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,680
Um,
in the early days of the automobile,

1767
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:53,681
they wouldn't let automobiles in towns
too because they would disrupt the horse

1768
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:55,520
traffic.
Right.

1769
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,120
And they had all kinds of weird laws,
including in the UK.

1770
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,340
They passed the law,
which required someone to run ahead of

1771
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:04,370
the car with a red flag I call the Red
Flag Act.

1772
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,520
That did wonders for the British
Automobile Industry,

1773
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:10,220
which was 20 years ahead at the time and
then wasn't,

1774
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,080
um,
wow.

1775
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,370
That kind of reactionary behavior is
very common in new technologies.

1776
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:20,420
And then infrastructure inversion
happens eventually.

1777
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,580
The thing that was considered
impossible,

1778
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:27,380
the roads would be paved to make
automobile travel practical everywhere

1779
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:31,490
happened and horses were quite happy to
ride on paved roads.

1780
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:33,710
Right.
Whereas for automobiles,

1781
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:38,711
it was almost impossible to use in a
rutted muddy road when you have a four

1782
01:28:40,921 --> 01:28:45,470
wheel drive vehicle trying to compete
against a four [inaudible] drive

1783
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,530
animals.
Yeah.

1784
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:50,960
And in those early days they pointed
that said,

1785
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,670
look,
this thing is never going to work.

1786
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,040
Automobiles and never going to happen
because you don't have the

1787
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:58,310
infrastructure.
But if you have the need infrastructure

1788
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:00,920
happens,
and we've seen that with the automobile,

1789
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:03,210
we that with electricity,
we've seen that with the Internet.

1790
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:06,570
We've seen that with all of these
technologies and now we're going to see

1791
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:10,320
it again with money because if you have
this technology,

1792
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:14,220
building the banking institutions on top
of this is easy,

1793
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,320
but making bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies,

1794
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,830
making the Internet of money play by the
rules of the old banking system is

1795
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:23,664
almost impossible.

1796
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,760
Now,
I like that expression,

1797
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:31,790
crypto currency and crypto currencies.
What is the stop banks from creating

1798
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:38,271
their own crypto currency and what mean
what is so wonderful about bitcoin in

1799
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,630
comparison to other cryptocurrencies?
Now,

1800
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:45,120
that's a great question.
There's nothing to stop them.

1801
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,660
In fact,
they're already doing it are.

1802
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,020
Yes.
First of all,

1803
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:52,440
you've got to realize there's more than
a thousand cryptocurrencies already.

1804
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,700
1,000.
Yes.

1805
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:56,150
More than a thousand cups.
The worst one was the one.

1806
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:59,340
We should avoid that.
That list is almost 900 long.

1807
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,910
Oh
yeah.

1808
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,510
I mean the,
it's a long tail.

1809
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:04,850
Right?
Um,

1810
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,190
there's a couple that are interesting
that offer different perspectives.

1811
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,330
Um,
but we're,

1812
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:13,650
we're seeing a lot of private
institutions interested in creating

1813
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,930
their own.
Um,

1814
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,510
and there's nothing stopping them from
doing that,

1815
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,790
but they have to make a fundamental
choice.

1816
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:23,700
They can either create some things that
is controlled,

1817
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,090
contained with specific outlines and
borders,

1818
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:30,180
with controlled access,
permissioned access,

1819
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:31,050
as they would call it.

1820
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:35,130
Um,
and that by definition is not global.

1821
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,770
It can't be global.
It has to be contained within a specific

1822
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,500
jurisdiction because that's how they're,
they operate.

1823
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,270
Both corporations and banks operate
within specific jurisdictions,

1824
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,420
so they can do that.
Um,

1825
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:52,170
but then it has to be close to two
innovation,

1826
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:55,770
close to permission and not global and
transnational.

1827
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,740
And so what bitcoin has,
and not just bitcoin,

1828
01:30:58,741 --> 01:31:03,741
but any public open currency of a global
nature like Bitcoin,

1829
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,590
is that you don't need to ask permission
to join.

1830
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,690
You don't need to ask permission to
innovate.

1831
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:13,680
You don't need to ask permission to
create a new application and any

1832
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:14,760
application,
you're right,

1833
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,960
we'll instantaneously work anywhere in
the world to anyone without permission.

1834
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:23,340
That's the magic of bitcoin.
And if you think about it,

1835
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:27,180
that's also the magic of the Internet.
That's why the Internet has been

1836
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,510
successful because it allows anyone to
join without permission,

1837
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,400
connect to any application or service.

1838
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,090
They won't write an application and
launch it globally without tasking the

1839
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,770
phone company if they're allowed to do
that,

1840
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,800
there's no one to ask permission from.
And to extend that analogy,

1841
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:49,670
they also tried to build private
intranets and they're still trying

1842
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,100
compuserve,
aol,

1843
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,730
prodigy,
and the early closed networks that had

1844
01:31:56,731 --> 01:32:00,100
their own content that you could connect
to that weren't part of the Internet.

1845
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:05,200
And then after that corporate intranets,
have you heard of the intranet term?

1846
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:05,890
Right?
Yeah.

1847
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:10,480
So when you have an internal network
within a company that has stale content,

1848
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:13,060
crappy applications and doesn't talk to
the rest of the world,

1849
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,490
and it's behind firewalls,
that's an intranet,

1850
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:20,820
intra and trial.
And they've built those and they'd

1851
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:25,830
sometimes serve very useful purposes,
but they're not the internet and you

1852
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:29,410
can't scale them and make them secure
and make them useful enough.

1853
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,530
So essentially that would be

1854
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:35,660
exactly be what would happen with money
if local banks or national banks.

1855
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,160
Yes.
So to follow from the title,

1856
01:32:39,161 --> 01:32:41,800
the,
the Internet of money is a very powerful

1857
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,550
expression because it really explains
what this is.

1858
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:48,700
This is the internet of money,
which means it's open,

1859
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:51,790
borderless global and requires no
permission to participate.

1860
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:55,600
And people will try to create the
intranet of money.

1861
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:59,950
Um,
and it will have all of the limitations

1862
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,470
that it's a traditional banking system
has.

1863
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:04,090
Hmm.
So yes,

1864
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:06,700
they can come along and do that um,
end.

1865
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:11,020
The nice thing is that people don't have
to make a choice to use one or the

1866
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:16,021
other.
The only system of monopoly we have is

1867
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,190
that you have to use the national
currency of the country you were born in

1868
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:23,860
and you live in,
in order to pay the government of that

1869
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,720
country.
Other than that,

1870
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:28,090
you're free to use any currency you want
anywhere.

1871
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,460
Some of us are free,
many of us are not.

1872
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,990
And bitcoin fits into that model.
It's the if you want to use it for this

1873
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:36,670
particular use,
use it

1874
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,220
well if,
if you extrapolate where all this stuff

1875
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:40,620
was going,
if you,

1876
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,840
you look at,
I mean if you're correct and if a over

1877
01:33:43,841 --> 01:33:48,790
the next 20 years bitcoin really does
emerge as not just an acceptable

1878
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:53,791
currency worldwide but it's right up
there with everything else and and maybe

1879
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:58,750
even preferred by a lot of people that
are in the know or tech savvy or what

1880
01:33:58,751 --> 01:34:00,940
have you.
If that really does take place,

1881
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:06,570
it's going to slowly but surely erode a
lot of the major problems that we have

1882
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:12,421
with society today as far as this
government having massive amounts of

1883
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:17,881
control over the economy and the banks
being the ones who sort of in force the

1884
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:25,960
kind of laws that have allowed the
mortgage crisis's and allowed these

1885
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:30,961
bubbles to occur and also to fund and
help fund the politicians that enable

1886
01:34:33,031 --> 01:34:37,570
them to keep these laws in place.
I mean all of that sort of is a lot of

1887
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:42,520
that is because of power and a lot of
that power is going to go away if

1888
01:34:42,521 --> 01:34:47,521
something like cryptocurrencies emerge
as being the predominant way that we use

1889
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:50,050
and exchange money.

1890
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,010
That's the optimistic way to look at it.
Yeah.

1891
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:58,400
The less optimistic way to look at it is
that over the next decade we are going

1892
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:03,500
to gradually move into a cashless
digital money society.

1893
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,350
We're kind of doing that now with work
apple.

1894
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:09,800
We are doing that already and there are
some countries that are completely

1895
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:14,360
cashless really where that are very
close to completely cashless.

1896
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:19,160
Ironically one of the,
one of the countries that has a very

1897
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:24,161
high degree of um,
digital money is Kenya because of

1898
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:27,500
Empaysah,
which is the mobile money they have,

1899
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:30,410
which has now taken over a significant
percentage of the GDP.

1900
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:34,550
We're also seeing in Scandinavian
countries now cash is less than I think

1901
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:39,551
is less than 8% of um,
of the productive use of money using

1902
01:35:41,421 --> 01:35:46,350
credit cards is what you're saying.
I credit debit mobile pay APP.

1903
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:49,580
What is Kenyon's MPA?
What does that and pay has a text

1904
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:50,414
message,
money,

1905
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,240
text message money.

1906
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,260
Yeah.
It's money you can send through sms.

1907
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:58,190
It started off as basically people
exchanging minutes,

1908
01:35:58,191 --> 01:36:02,210
mobile minutes that were transferable by
SMS and they started using it as

1909
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:06,830
currency and then eventually it became
officially a corresponding currency to

1910
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:09,770
the Kenyan Pesa.
And now as the predominant currency

1911
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,600
it's,
yeah,

1912
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,000
and in most places from what I
understand,

1913
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,740
uh,
I haven't been to Kenya but I've talked

1914
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:17,270
to a lot of Kenyans who tell me,
yeah,

1915
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,570
we all use that and only that we don't
use cash.

1916
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:22,220
We don't use credit cards.
Wow.

1917
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,310
It is kind of shocking.
But here's the problem.

1918
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:30,440
The problem is we are going to a digital
current society where cash will be

1919
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,800
gradually eradicated either through non
use or a lot of countries and a lot of

1920
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:39,470
governments are trying to actively ban
it.

1921
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,350
So they're putting limits on how much
you can use cash.

1922
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,670
Say you know,
$1,000 and if it's more than a thousand

1923
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,930
dollars using cash as illegal.

1924
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,490
When we go to the society,
we have to really think about the

1925
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:55,280
implications.
Do we want a society in which our

1926
01:36:55,281 --> 01:37:00,110
digital money is under a complete
surveillance and complete control where

1927
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:05,140
if you go to the wrong protest or if you
support the wrong political campaign or

1928
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:09,680
if you make a payment to the wrong
person or receive money from the wrong

1929
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:12,140
person,
suddenly your money disappears.

1930
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:14,180
It's no longer yours anymore.
It's frozen,

1931
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:16,310
it's seized,
it's gone.

1932
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:20,000
Um,
and someone has control of that.

1933
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,710
Corporations,
banks,

1934
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,410
governments.
And in most cases there is no difference

1935
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:26,340
between corporation,
bank and governments.

1936
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:27,870
Right?
Um,

1937
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:32,990
and so that's one scenario.
And the other scenario is one in which

1938
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:35,420
individuals control their money.
It is digital money,

1939
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:39,680
but it's digital cash like bitcoin where
you can pay an individual from one

1940
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:44,000
person to another just like I can with
cash today without any other party

1941
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:44,834
getting involved.

1942
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:50,300
What really strikes me as amazing is
that we've gotten used to this idea so

1943
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:54,650
quickly,
which is that we no longer pay people,

1944
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:01,410
we no longer pay people directly.
The last we use cash is the more we pay

1945
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:04,560
people through a corporation.
Right?

1946
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:10,130
So from tipping your Valet to tipping
your taxi driver to tipping wherever

1947
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,980
tipping is pretty much the last
remaining part of our society where cash

1948
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:21,651
is used to pay from one person who is
not an incorporated entity to another

1949
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:24,420
person who is not an incorporated
entity.

1950
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,940
Everything else you have to pay for a
corporation,

1951
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,130
whether it's a bank,
right,

1952
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,830
whether it's Venmo,
whether it's paypal,

1953
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,330
where they're at,
any of those things.

1954
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:37,680
And we've gradually gotten used to this
environment where we can't pay another

1955
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:39,570
person unless there's a corporation
involved.

1956
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:44,330
And that's astonishing to me.
And as cash disappears,

1957
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:49,340
that then becomes a final fact that
every single payment in your life will

1958
01:38:49,951 --> 01:38:53,310
be from Utah Corporation.
And the corporation takes a piece of

1959
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:55,620
that every single thing.
And not just that,

1960
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,760
it doesn't just take a piece,
it also controls and surveils and

1961
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:02,370
monitors your juice.
And if you violate the terms and

1962
01:39:02,371 --> 01:39:03,990
conditions,
you are destitute.

1963
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,630
Wow.
So are,

1964
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:11,990
so the issue is not what we have today.
First is the digital currency of the

1965
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:17,421
future or bitcoin or whatever.
It's both futures are a digital currency

1966
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:21,270
and in both futures,
cash will no longer exist.

1967
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,320
That is inevitable.
We are going down that road and now we

1968
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:29,700
have to choose.
Do we go to the digital cashless society

1969
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,760
of corporate control over money with the
complete and total merging of corporates

1970
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:36,690
and state's money

1971
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:41,010
where instead of having separation of
state and money,

1972
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:44,880
you have the merging of state and money
and corporation and money where your

1973
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:49,881
money is branded money,
you have chase dollars,

1974
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,990
you have Goldman Sachs dollars,
you have coca cola dollars,

1975
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:57,360
right?
You have money that is controlled by a

1976
01:39:57,361 --> 01:39:59,970
corporation or do we go down the other
future?

1977
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,500
What we have money that is basically an
internet protocol that is completely

1978
01:40:04,501 --> 01:40:06,810
global,
that any person can pay any person they

1979
01:40:06,811 --> 01:40:09,420
meet in the streets without any
corporations getting involved.

1980
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:14,070
Just for me to you digital cash.
And that's really the,

1981
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:18,750
it's a less optimistic view because I'm
fully aware of what the other future is

1982
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,750
and it's already playing out and it is a
very,

1983
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:23,760
in my opinion,
a very dangerous future.

1984
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:28,500
This is so fascinating to me because
it's so speculative and I love when you

1985
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:31,890
don't know what's going to happen and
someone presents a bunch of different

1986
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:36,891
scenarios and you get the mind starts to
wonder and then you also sort of plan

1987
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:40,170
for the future.
Like it becomes like something to,

1988
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,340
it almost becomes something to look
forward to our bed on.

1989
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,383
You know,
like,

1990
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,630
oh I bet it's going to work like this or
I bet you because we really don't know.

1991
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,200
Right.
I mean,

1992
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:52,020
and what,
what is the resistance that bitcoin is

1993
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:57,021
facing from financial institutions that
are in control right now?

1994
01:40:57,731 --> 01:41:01,180
Because there must be some form of,
of resistance.

1995
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:06,181
And is there any fuckery involved?
Like is there any sabotaging of bitcoin

1996
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,290
that has been suspected or proven?

1997
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:13,040
I think I,
I don't really know if there's any

1998
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:14,750
sabotaging going on.
So that's,

1999
01:41:14,751 --> 01:41:16,760
that's a,
that's a claim expected.

2000
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:18,920
I'm not going to make any,
any claims,

2001
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:21,380
just wink at me.
Tell him what to say.

2002
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,950
Well,
what I'm going to talk about is the,

2003
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:28,400
the progression of what happens when a
giant,

2004
01:41:28,401 --> 01:41:31,910
well-established financial,
istation that's been around for 50 years

2005
01:41:31,911 --> 01:41:36,860
or 100 years is faced with a disruptor
that they cannot tamp down,

2006
01:41:36,861 --> 01:41:41,861
that they cannot shut down,
sue by coopt eradicate band,

2007
01:41:42,621 --> 01:41:44,060
legislate against.
Right?

2008
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,760
And,
and what happens then is what I call the

2009
01:41:46,761 --> 01:41:50,050
five stages of grief.
Um,

2010
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:53,660
first we start with denial.
So,

2011
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:56,090
and,
and we saw this play out exactly like

2012
01:41:56,091 --> 01:41:59,000
this with a banking industry.
The first reaction was denial.

2013
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:02,390
Bitcoin can't possibly work.
It's not real money.

2014
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,540
It doesn't really exist.
It has no value.

2015
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:06,710
It will never survive.

2016
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:11,840
Fast forward five hears you keep making
that argument becomes less and less

2017
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:15,260
credible because it's not real money.
Yet.

2018
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:20,210
The big metal bird that brought me to
Los Angeles today was paid,

2019
01:42:20,211 --> 01:42:21,590
was not money.
So

2020
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,020
you can claim it's not money all day
long.

2021
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:29,060
And I've been living on it for three
years,

2022
01:42:29,061 --> 01:42:32,240
which kind of undermines the argument,
right?

2023
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,850
Um,
if I earn it and I spend it and people

2024
01:42:34,851 --> 01:42:38,000
give me rides and big metal birds,
it's money.

2025
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:41,180
Um,
so that isn't working.

2026
01:42:41,181 --> 01:42:43,190
It's going to go away on its own.
It's going to die.

2027
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:46,880
It's going to lose all its value.
Every time it dumps in value,

2028
01:42:46,881 --> 01:42:49,010
they cheer.
It's like finally bitcoin is dead.

2029
01:42:49,011 --> 01:42:52,070
They write another obituary.
We publish them on Bitcoin,

2030
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:57,071
obituaries.com to make fun of them later
and now has 110 obituaries I think

2031
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:59,090
published every time they say,
well,

2032
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:00,350
die,
which is every two months.

2033
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,020
Again,
denial only works for a while.

2034
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,560
Then they go into anger.
It's the money of terrorists,

2035
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,950
criminals,
paedophiles pornographers and the

2036
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:12,560
unsavory elements of this world.
Pedophiles.

2037
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,590
That's always the one they pull out.

2038
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:15,971
Right?
Oh,

2039
01:43:15,971 --> 01:43:17,310
they love to use that one.
Yup.

2040
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:20,170
Yeah.
If they find one by one pedophile,

2041
01:43:20,171 --> 01:43:22,580
he uses bitcoin.
Pedophile current.

2042
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,380
Yeah,
exactly.

2043
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,550
Um,
dirty trick.

2044
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:28,450
It is a bit of a,
it is a bit,

2045
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:32,570
a bit of a dirty term trick and they've
tried to do this again and again and

2046
01:43:32,571 --> 01:43:33,404
again.
Um,

2047
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:35,490
they did it with the intranet,
the intranet.

2048
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:38,060
When it first came out they,
you,

2049
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,200
you heard this media narrative,
the,

2050
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:42,290
it's,
it sells papers.

2051
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,810
It sell,
it didn't sell clicks at the time cause

2052
01:43:44,811 --> 01:43:46,610
that we're doing,
it's about the Internet but it sells

2053
01:43:46,611 --> 01:43:49,250
papers,
which is the idea that the internet is a

2054
01:43:49,251 --> 01:43:52,730
haven of crux and fraudsters,
terrorists and pdf files and

2055
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:53,720
pornographers.
Great.

2056
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:55,760
Um,
yes,

2057
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:57,510
criminal use,
advanced technology,

2058
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:59,870
criminal use,
the most advanced technology they can

2059
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:03,890
get their hands on because they're in a
very highly competitive high margin,

2060
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:07,820
high risk business.
And of course they're going to tell you

2061
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:12,290
they criminals wear shoes to run away
from bank heist criminals drive cars to

2062
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:14,120
get away from bank robberies.

2063
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,130
They use cell phones to coordinate with
each other.

2064
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,130
They drink water.
So it is not to die of dehydration.

2065
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,380
We're not going to ban all of those
things.

2066
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:26,030
Right.
And so you have that anger.

2067
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:29,310
Um,
and they tried that for a while.

2068
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,990
Every time they try that you just turn
around and say,

2069
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:33,740
Oh,
well,

2070
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:36,350
you know,
actually the biggest money launderers of

2071
01:44:36,351 --> 01:44:39,800
drugs in the world are HSBC,
the Hong Kong,

2072
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,170
Hong Kong,
Shanghai banking consortium.

2073
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:47,940
Inconvenient fact.
This is in the world.

2074
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,190
Yes,
they would call it the model in your

2075
01:44:49,191 --> 01:44:54,191
laundering $700 billion for the Sinaloa
cartel over a period of 10 years during

2076
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:59,540
which 19,000 people died in Mexico as a
direct result of that.

2077
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:04,160
And they got a fine and no one went to
jail.

2078
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,950
So there are inconvenient facts like
that.

2079
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:09,500
Every time they say bitcoin funds
terrorism,

2080
01:45:09,501 --> 01:45:10,490
you say,
ah,

2081
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:13,430
I see them driving Toyota's in Humvees.

2082
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,030
Um,
that doesn't,

2083
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:19,180
that's a bit in Congress.
Like they're,

2084
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:24,190
they're driving around in the vehicles.
We left behind and there they got a lot

2085
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:29,300
of their funding from pallets of money
that we left behind and they're getting

2086
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:34,301
paid for dollar in dollars for oil that
they're selling to our closest allies.

2087
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,830
We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi
Arabia.

2088
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,710
Um,
so these are the inconvenient truths,

2089
01:45:39,711 --> 01:45:42,500
right?
So you don't talk about these in polite

2090
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:44,720
company or at least you do.
Like,

2091
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:49,520
that's what I said when I was invited to
speak in front of the Senate and Canada

2092
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:52,070
and they started asking me about
terrorism and I said that actually

2093
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:55,760
mostly funded by our allies.
And what did these say that was the end

2094
01:45:55,761 --> 01:45:57,570
of that train of thought.
They stopped too.

2095
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,153
No,
no.

2096
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:04,210
It was live public TV.
Like what went down when we moved on to

2097
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:07,010
talk about more realistic and
interesting things in a much more

2098
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:08,780
positive view of what this thing is.

2099
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:12,280
They tried to discredit bitcoin by
attaching it to terrorism and you

2100
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:16,520
informed them of the facts of where
terrorists are actually funded from.

2101
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:19,160
Yes.
In a very public forum on live TV,

2102
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:22,490
which was very difficult to continue
that line of conversation.

2103
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:28,250
So that's anger.
Is there resistance in Canada isn't the

2104
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:28,980
United States?
No,

2105
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,000
actually they've been very,
very positive.

2106
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:37,030
Very positive too towards um,
towards cryptocurrencies in general.

2107
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:38,583
Yeah.
Interesting.

2108
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,190
And there's a lot of development going
on.

2109
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:43,640
There isn't that much resistance in the
United States really.

2110
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,880
The banks were shutting down bank
accounts in some cases.

2111
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:50,010
We've seen that in the United Kingdom to
what is the,

2112
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,010
right right now,
like what's the percentage of people

2113
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:55,260
that are using bitcoin on a regular
basis?

2114
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,400
It's very difficult to say.
Um,

2115
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,520
primarily because there is no clear
association between one person and one

2116
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:08,040
bitcoin address or account.
There is no account,

2117
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:10,010
right to use bitcoin.

2118
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,330
All you have to do is download the
application on your phone.

2119
01:47:12,331 --> 01:47:14,580
Nobody,
you don't have to register anything and

2120
01:47:14,581 --> 01:47:18,150
so as a result it's just like how many
Ip addresses are in use.

2121
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:20,910
Does that tell you anything about how
many people are using the internet?

2122
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,400
You can't really tell.
That's a good thing.

2123
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:25,860
It's,
it's because of its nature.

2124
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:31,460
I would say we're probably looking at
about two to 4 million users based on

2125
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:33,150
this.
Very interesting.

2126
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:37,260
Based on activity levels,
based on logins to websites that some of

2127
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:40,830
them publish results.
It's very hard to say for sure.

2128
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:43,710
Exactly.
How many mostly concentrated in the u s

2129
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:48,150
of the moment.
So it's a plus 1% somewhere in the range

2130
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:51,480
of 1% of of the United States
population.

2131
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,620
Oh No,
this is globally.

2132
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:53,503
Oh,
globally.

2133
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:54,900
Globally,
globally.

2134
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:57,330
Maybe two to 4 million people.
And you said most of them are in the

2135
01:47:57,331 --> 01:47:57,900
United States?

2136
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,250
Most of the main,
the United States,

2137
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,950
many of them are also in China.
About a 4 million.

2138
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:04,290
It is possible.
That's 1% of America,

2139
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,530
maybe.
Yes,

2140
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,500
yes.
Maybe half a percent.

2141
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:08,760
Yeah.
Something like that.

2142
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:10,260
That's interesting.
That's a lot.

2143
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,890
But what is happening is it's doubling
every here in terms of transaction

2144
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:15,390
volume,
transaction amounts,

2145
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:18,390
number of everything is doubling every
year.

2146
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:21,150
And that's,
that's the kind of characteristic curve

2147
01:48:21,151 --> 01:48:24,270
you see in disruptive technologies being
adopted.

2148
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:27,300
And that's a very promising curve.
What is the tipping point?

2149
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:30,570
Like what needs to happen?
Is there anything that needs to happen

2150
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:32,490
for,
for widespread adoption?

2151
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:34,560
You've got a need.
It,

2152
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:38,250
uh,
it's got to be ready and it's gotta be

2153
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:41,130
easy to use.
And so right now,

2154
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:43,560
um,
it's not easy to use.

2155
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:49,040
It's not ready for mass adoption.
And in many parts of the developed

2156
01:48:49,081 --> 01:48:51,270
world,
we don't really need it.

2157
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,630
So in order to make it something we
need,

2158
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:58,110
either what we already have has to not
work so well.

2159
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,530
This is what's happening in the
developing world where you have banking

2160
01:49:01,531 --> 01:49:03,720
crisis,
which drives people into a safe haven,

2161
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,890
or you invent to applications that
couldn't be done before.

2162
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:13,280
A self driving car that you pay by the
mile automatically as you're driving

2163
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:15,100
along.
Um,

2164
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,140
uh,
um,

2165
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:20,100
uh,
micro payments industry for paying for

2166
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:22,120
contents directly.
Um,

2167
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:27,290
the intranet of things where devices can
buy services online automatically.

2168
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:30,600
Things that you can't do with credit
cards.

2169
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:33,930
I think if you start seeing applications
like that to merge and I'm very

2170
01:49:33,931 --> 01:49:37,320
confident they're coming because we're
seeing the innovation behind them,

2171
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,580
then you can make it something that is
more needed even in the developed world.

2172
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:47,380
So what,
what do you think could be done to sort

2173
01:49:47,381 --> 01:49:50,380
of further this along or to accelerate
this?

2174
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:53,870
Is there anything that can be done?
Um,

2175
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,800
as I said,
I think the third ingredient is making

2176
01:49:56,801 --> 01:49:59,590
it easier for people to use.
And that's a matter of innovation and

2177
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:00,730
maturity and we're doing that.
I mean,

2178
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:02,170
that's already happening.
Other than that,

2179
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:04,570
it's just a matter of time.
We just have to wait and be patient

2180
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:07,150
until it happens.
What could be like the steps that can be

2181
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:10,600
taken to make something like bitcoin
easier to use?

2182
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,430
Well,
there's a lot of things to do.

2183
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,080
Um,
user interfaces,

2184
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,920
design security,
making backup,

2185
01:50:16,921 --> 01:50:20,260
EEC,
providing infrastructure services,

2186
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:21,760
exchanges,
uh,

2187
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,630
um,
uh,

2188
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:25,110
your paycheck,
uh,

2189
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:29,350
your atm services,
your debit card services,

2190
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:31,660
merchant services,
things like that.

2191
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,900
Um,
you know,

2192
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:37,900
one of the examples I like to use is I
got on the intranet in 1989 I sent my

2193
01:50:38,261 --> 01:50:43,261
first emails shortly thereafter about
1,990 and in order to send my first

2194
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:47,290
email,
I had to have a unix command line

2195
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:50,920
skills,
a login into a unix mainframe with

2196
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:54,310
access to an Internet connection at an
academic institution.

2197
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:59,730
And then I worked very hard for about
two days to get the software working and

2198
01:51:00,731 --> 01:51:03,190
then eventually essence an email.
And then it took a couple of days to

2199
01:51:03,191 --> 01:51:05,920
cross the Internet,
right.

2200
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:11,310
And then almost exactly 20 years later,
my mom went swipe and did the same thing

2201
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:16,390
on her ipad.
So when you take,

2202
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:20,070
you know,
two days of compiling software writing

2203
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,800
complex unix commands,
sending an email and it takes a while to

2204
01:51:23,801 --> 01:51:27,670
get across the Internet and then 20
years later that's down to swipe.

2205
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:32,080
When we can take fic coin from after
install a wallet to understand what it

2206
01:51:32,081 --> 01:51:34,630
is,
the Qr Code of the bitcoin address and

2207
01:51:34,631 --> 01:51:36,310
how do I back it up and secure it,
et cetera.

2208
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:40,060
And you turn that into swipe,
then we'll be ready.

2209
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,450
But there isn't there a vast difference
though between something like email,

2210
01:51:43,451 --> 01:51:45,370
which is not just a disruptive
technology,

2211
01:51:45,371 --> 01:51:47,590
but a completely new innovation.

2212
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:52,030
The ability to send things wirelessly
through the air or even wired like

2213
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:56,930
electronic mail did not exist but,
but males,

2214
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,800
but mail did.
I mean it was just a change in the

2215
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:02,410
medium.
Essentially you're doing correspondence,

2216
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,960
but it's so much easier and more
convenient.

2217
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:08,710
Whereas like using a credit card right
now is fairly convenient.

2218
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:10,420
Yes.
Online banking,

2219
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:13,330
fairly convenient for people who have
credit cards.

2220
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,720
And now that's,
that's where the numbers really benefit

2221
01:52:16,721 --> 01:52:19,720
bitcoin because we're,
we're in the age of the Internet and

2222
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:23,920
instead of economic inclusion becoming
crater instead of more people around the

2223
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:26,530
world having ready access to these
technologies,

2224
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:30,870
we're seeing entire country's getting
cut off from economic inclusion.

2225
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,040
The banking system is not expanding as
fast,

2226
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,290
uh,
to reach these populations.

2227
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:39,340
And there's this vast gap left and this
gap is several billion people.

2228
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:45,090
And into that gap you can fit anyone who
has access to even a rudimentary,

2229
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,010
a feature phone or smartphone with a
very basic level of data service.

2230
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:55,670
Um,
so the level at which you need to have

2231
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:58,580
technology in order to,
for someone to adopt bitcoin and

2232
01:52:58,581 --> 01:53:03,581
immediately become in themselves a
global bank in the back pocket of their

2233
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:09,370
pants compared to the level that you
would need to reach before jp Morgan

2234
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:16,870
Chase built a branch within their area
and offer them services after going

2235
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:20,960
through a very careful verification of
their identity and blah,

2236
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:21,351
blah,
blah,

2237
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:21,800
blah,
blah.

2238
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:25,010
That's never going to happen.
So we're going to get to leap frogging

2239
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:29,420
effect.
Just like in many places in Africa.

2240
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:32,960
The first leap frogging events we saw
that was noted upon people wrote books

2241
01:53:32,961 --> 01:53:36,140
about this is the fact that in many
places in Africa,

2242
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,970
landlines were never deployed because
the,

2243
01:53:39,971 --> 01:53:44,630
the difficulty to actually extend
landlines was so high that when cell

2244
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:47,780
phones came along,
at some point it became easier to just

2245
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:51,620
go directly to cell phones and bypass
that entire generation of technology.

2246
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:55,760
Right.
So we're expecting,

2247
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,080
and I certainly see it as very possible
to see leapfrogging in economic

2248
01:54:00,081 --> 01:54:02,480
inclusion,
the ability for people to join the

2249
01:54:02,481 --> 01:54:05,600
Internet of money long before they ever
see a bank.

2250
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:09,770
The end result is it's not just about
banking,

2251
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:13,760
the unbanked,
it's about debunking all of us to my

2252
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:17,300
banking as an application.
You don't need an institution,

2253
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,990
you just need an application.
And that that transition is pretty

2254
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:21,824
powerful.

2255
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:25,440
Is there any concern that people would
take people's phones and hold them at

2256
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:27,690
gunpoint and just steal all their
bitcoin?

2257
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,130
Like,
if that's all you own,

2258
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:32,250
like if you have a wallet and that
wallet is all you own,

2259
01:54:32,251 --> 01:54:35,130
if you're on bitcoin 20 years from now
or whatever it is,

2260
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:38,640
and that's it.
Your entire financial portfolio exists

2261
01:54:38,641 --> 01:54:42,510
on your phone and someone can come along
and force you at gunpoint to transfer

2262
01:54:42,511 --> 01:54:44,550
that over their phone and then they take
off in the night.

2263
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:45,581
Yeah.
Uh,

2264
01:54:45,581 --> 01:54:47,890
well,
first of all already today,

2265
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:51,040
you wouldn't keep your entire financial
portfolio on your phone.

2266
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:52,930
I certainly don't.
Um,

2267
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,550
there are a number of very convenient
and easy to use devices that allow you

2268
01:54:57,551 --> 01:55:02,080
to storage or bit coin securely on an
offline device.

2269
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:04,090
Um,
I have a couple of my bag,

2270
01:55:04,091 --> 01:55:06,100
I might show them to you later,
which,

2271
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:07,240
which allow,
you might,

2272
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,141
but you might not.
I mean,

2273
01:55:08,141 --> 01:55:09,220
if you want,
I'll show them to you now.

2274
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:10,713
Okay.
Let's see.

2275
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:16,510
The way you said it was,
it's like teasing me.

2276
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,320
This is it for people at home that are
listening to this,

2277
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,400
you like,
um,

2278
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,500
I don't know what to make of this.
I don't,

2279
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:28,660
I didn't want to get wrapped up in the
headphone cord.

2280
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:29,990
And,
uh,

2281
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:34,660
what is that?
So this is a device that a lot of people

2282
01:55:34,661 --> 01:55:36,880
in bitcoin are familiar with.
Can we see that?

2283
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:37,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2284
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:41,080
So this is called a bitcoin tresor.
It looks like one of those things,

2285
01:55:41,081 --> 01:55:41,680
those old ladies

2286
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,590
ladies press when they fall down.
Yes.

2287
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,340
I have fallen

2288
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:48,420
and I can't get up.
Yes,

2289
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:49,890
it's a bit different.
Um,

2290
01:55:49,891 --> 01:55:53,250
so this is a USB device.
I can connect it to my computer.

2291
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,061
Can I see it?
Yes,

2292
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:55,860
please.
Who have all your money now?

2293
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,020
So feel weird.
You don't have all my money.

2294
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:01,020
You have got it.
So I have,

2295
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:03,760
I have a backup of that device.
Um,

2296
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,710
and this is where what I mentioned
before is this 1224 word backups that I

2297
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:10,440
have,
which means that if I lose that device,

2298
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:12,480
um,
I can recreate,

2299
01:56:12,481 --> 01:56:16,710
it's on my backup device,
which I'm carrying here already.

2300
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:18,180
Second one,
I have a second one.

2301
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:23,260
You have four of these and you can
transfer that 24 words seed to any

2302
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:27,190
device you want and it will immediately
have access to all of your money and

2303
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:28,350
render this.
No.

2304
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:29,970
Yes.
Ah,

2305
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:31,950
well,
I mean it won't render this one now

2306
01:56:31,951 --> 01:56:36,000
because it can coexist on all of them,
but that one has a pin number and a pass

2307
01:56:36,001 --> 01:56:37,230
phrase that you have to put in.

2308
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,900
You would not be able to break into that
device.

2309
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:40,930
I could,
yeah.

2310
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,710
Maybe most people can't.
I'm good at that shit,

2311
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:44,430
dude.
Yeah.

2312
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:49,230
Excellent.
But is it possible that someone could

2313
01:56:49,231 --> 01:56:53,010
figure out a way to crack your 24 word
code?

2314
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:53,940
No,
I mean,

2315
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,750
no.
No.

2316
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:56,810
You say that man,
don't say that online.

2317
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:00,480
I say that Fuckin hackers man,
they take that shit as a challenge.

2318
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,070
Well,
never say you can't hack me.

2319
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:07,200
Here's the thing.
Bitcoin in itself is the world's largest

2320
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:12,060
bug bounty and this is something that
most people haven't realized bounty.

2321
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:16,890
A bug bounty is when a manufacturer of a
piece of software,

2322
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:19,350
for example,
puts out the bunting bounty and says,

2323
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,250
I'll give you $10,000 if you find a bug
in my software that someone could

2324
01:57:23,251 --> 01:57:26,670
exploit to break my software.
Pull does bug bounties.

2325
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:30,000
Google does bug bounties.
A lot of companies do these bug

2326
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:30,810
bounties.

2327
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,680
It's very wise and it's great because
what they do is that way they,

2328
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:37,080
they find these,
they have professional packers really

2329
01:57:37,081 --> 01:57:39,660
who go in and break the software and
it's legal.

2330
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,610
They do it perfectly.
Yeah.

2331
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:46,830
But another way to look at this is the
bitcoin has 10 to $12 billion of market

2332
01:57:46,831 --> 01:57:50,040
capitalization behind it.
And if you can find a way to break,

2333
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:54,390
say my 24 words seed,
you have access to my money.

2334
01:57:54,391 --> 01:57:59,391
So my money is the bounty that's sitting
behind that bug and this means that

2335
01:58:00,331 --> 01:58:05,331
bitcoin is being tested and has it been
tested every single day of its seven

2336
01:58:05,581 --> 01:58:08,880
year existence with an ever increasing
Jack Bolt at the end of it,

2337
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:13,560
which is why you see bitcoin exchanges
when they don't do good security,

2338
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:17,970
they get hacked and whoever hacks them
gets the bounty.

2339
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:21,210
But bitcoin itself,
which has the biggest bounty of the mall

2340
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,670
remains secure.

2341
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,760
And the reason it remains secure,
Islam magical.

2342
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:30,930
It's about spreading out the risk in
such a way that there is no single

2343
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:33,480
point.
You can put your thumb on an attack.

2344
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,280
So anyway,
this little device,

2345
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:39,480
these types of devices,
there are ones that have a fingerprint

2346
01:58:39,481 --> 01:58:42,790
scanner on them that are easy to use.
They're um,

2347
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:46,330
they come in various form factors.
We call these hardware wallets.

2348
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:51,340
And what's interesting about this is
that the Bitcoin keys that's control my

2349
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:56,341
bitcoin are created on this device.
They remain on this device and this

2350
01:58:56,681 --> 01:59:01,390
device signs transactions,
which means I can take it and I can plug

2351
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:04,240
it into this laptop.
And if this laptop is compromised,

2352
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:08,170
I don't care,
it will not be able to compromise this.

2353
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:12,130
I can take this and I can plug it in to
the,

2354
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:15,400
you know,
those desktops they have in hotel

2355
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:17,770
lobbies where you can print your
boarding pass.

2356
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:21,940
Okay.
Consider that the Cesspool of computing

2357
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:23,110
you,
you go there.

2358
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:27,220
That thing has 25 different viruses
fighting for dominance.

2359
01:59:27,221 --> 01:59:29,710
Right.
Once you plug in a device,

2360
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:33,550
they start tearing each other apart,
trying to get to your device.

2361
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:38,050
I can plug this in there and make a
bitcoin transaction and not have to

2362
01:59:38,051 --> 01:59:40,990
worry about that because the keys stay
on here.

2363
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:43,670
Right.
And no one can figure out a virus for

2364
01:59:43,671 --> 01:59:46,060
one of those.
Well that's the thing.

2365
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:48,520
This is designed specifically to have a
very,

2366
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:53,521
very narrow well defined interface.
So the only thing you can send to it is

2367
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:58,540
a bitcoin transaction and then displays
that bitcoin transaction on the screen.

2368
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:01,090
And I can decide is that too I actually
wanted to pay.

2369
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:03,220
Yes.
Confirm and then I've paid them and

2370
02:00:03,221 --> 02:00:05,500
nobody else.
Is it impossible to integrate a virus

2371
02:00:05,501 --> 02:00:10,501
into a bitcoin transaction
code messages and certain software like

2372
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,330
it wasn't that what al Qaeda was doing,
what they were sending pictures and

2373
02:00:15,331 --> 02:00:19,450
inside the actual digital image,
the ones and Zeros,

2374
02:00:19,451 --> 02:00:23,170
there were encoding actual information
that you could read and you can embed

2375
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:25,750
data,
the differences.

2376
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:29,830
You can't execute that data because this
thing will not execute the data it

2377
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:34,390
receives in the transaction.
It simply runs a fingerprint function on

2378
02:00:34,391 --> 02:00:37,990
it and signs it.
So yes,

2379
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:40,720
the,
the point of this is that Jamie's

2380
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,520
incredulous look at them.
Yeah.

2381
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:46,570
Seems like it's,
you're setting a rule that's just going

2382
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:47,830
to be broken in a month.
Like,

2383
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:51,760
I can't do it today,
but next week we figured it out and now

2384
02:00:51,761 --> 02:00:53,020
we're,
well,

2385
02:00:53,021 --> 02:00:53,531
I,
you know,

2386
02:00:53,531 --> 02:00:55,300
I've had this device now for three
years.

2387
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:57,280
Um,
this is one of the first additions.

2388
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,580
I keep,
uh,

2389
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:05,160
my bitcoin on there and I haven't had a
problem yet.

2390
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:09,040
I don't put my money on exchanges.
I keep it on devices like this,

2391
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:11,230
which is why I haven't had lou money
stolen.

2392
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,550
The point of this is not to make it more
secure,

2393
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:19,030
although it does,
it's to make security easy for someone

2394
02:01:19,031 --> 02:01:20,110
who's not technical.

2395
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:25,030
I could create a whole elaborate system
as security experts to secure my

2396
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:27,100
bitcoins.
That was never a problem.

2397
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,130
The point of this devices that you can
secure your bitcoin,

2398
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:33,640
my mum can secure her bitcoin without
really knowing how,

2399
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,190
but just simply following how this
works.

2400
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:41,000
So it takes security packages,
attendant device and simplifies it

2401
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:43,040
dramatically.
Um,

2402
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,890
that kind of thing.
Here's the other question you asked me.

2403
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,680
What happens if someone points a gun at
you?

2404
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:52,370
Right?
We call that the $5 wrench solution.

2405
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,770
It's like,
shall we build a 10,000 super?

2406
02:01:54,771 --> 02:01:58,310
It's,
it's from a cartoon by Randall Monroe

2407
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,810
and XKCD.
He says,

2408
02:01:59,811 --> 02:02:03,020
should we build a 10,000 supercomputer
to crack his encryption?

2409
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,101
Um,
no.

2410
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:06,590
Here's a $5 wrench.
Just beat him until he tells you what

2411
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:07,424
the password is.

2412
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:15,370
So resistance to that is difficult.
But one of the things that these devices

2413
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:19,850
have and all the systems in bitcoin have
is duress passwords.

2414
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:23,810
So you can put a small amount of bitcoin
in a specific accounts that opens with a

2415
02:02:23,811 --> 02:02:26,270
different password.
And so you shouldn't know.

2416
02:02:26,271 --> 02:02:29,750
So the people know,
they see the motherfucker,

2417
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,050
you gave me the duress password.
Yeah,

2418
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:36,380
but they don't know which one is which.
And this is a well known technique and

2419
02:02:36,381 --> 02:02:40,970
we actually recommend using fat as part
of it.

2420
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,920
Listen,
when I go to a country,

2421
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,980
uh,
where security isn't as good,

2422
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:51,400
right?
I carry my cash in a money belt or leave

2423
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:56,831
it back at the hotel in a safe.
But I also carry a bundle of notes,

2424
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:58,880
high value notes,
like the equivalent of say,

2425
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:02,570
$50 here in the United States in my
front pocket.

2426
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:06,530
And if somebody comes at me,
pulls out a knife and says,

2427
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:11,531
give me your money,
I will hand them my phone is a throwaway

2428
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,050
cash.

2429
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:14,870
I haven't in my front pocket.
And I will walk away from that,

2430
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,760
listen to this podcast,
and they're going to know this

2431
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:19,460
motherfucker has a belt and that's where
our real lewd is.

2432
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:20,630
There you go.
That's it.

2433
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,660
So I mean this is something a lot of
people do,

2434
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:24,290
right?
Yeah.

2435
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:27,020
I'm sure.
And that's why robbers are aware of it.

2436
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:30,170
Yeah.
But for the most part they'll take the

2437
02:03:30,171 --> 02:03:32,090
cash that you hand them and run away
probably.

2438
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:32,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2439
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:37,370
I can't help thinking like although
these little devices that you're storing

2440
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:42,050
your bitcoin on look elegant in 2016 I
can't help thinking that they're just

2441
02:03:42,051 --> 02:03:44,960
going to be like those Gordon Gekko
giant brick phones when he was walking

2442
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:47,300
around the beach looking like a pimp
from Wall Street.

2443
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:50,410
Remember that movie that they are that
know like he's holding that big ass

2444
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:54,230
[inaudible] they are that people will be
watching this show.

2445
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:56,030
Yeah.
A decade from now.

2446
02:03:56,031 --> 02:03:57,950
Laughing at those,
laughing at those things.

2447
02:03:57,951 --> 02:04:00,800
And that's fine because guess what?
I just found a photo yesterday.

2448
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:03,700
I was looking through some of my files.
I just found a photo of mate.

2449
02:04:03,701 --> 02:04:04,534
Yes,
thank you.

2450
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:09,020
Look at him like a pimp with that big
stupid phone.

2451
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:14,140
I found a photo of me from 1991 with a
leather,

2452
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:19,550
uh,
side carrier with one of those in that

2453
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:21,410
holster.
Right.

2454
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:25,490
One of those brick phones is,
I think the second generation Motorola.

2455
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:28,040
So it was about this big dot.
Can like ruin your hip,

2456
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:30,590
like all that weight.
Look at that.

2457
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:32,240
Yeah,
I was,

2458
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,103
I was,
uh,

2459
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:38,110
I was a sophomore in college.
It's like 1991 first cell phones who

2460
02:04:39,151 --> 02:04:40,740
just come out.
I'm in computer science.

2461
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:41,940
I'm a geek.
I love gadgets.

2462
02:04:41,941 --> 02:04:44,970
So I go by one of the first cell phones.
It cost me an arm and a leg.

2463
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:48,190
I paid like $5 a minute to make calls on
it.

2464
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:50,170
$2,000.
Right?

2465
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:55,000
I think I paid something like 750 pounds
sterling at the time.

2466
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:58,330
It was probably about a thousand bucks
for a thing like this.

2467
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,940
Who's battery lasted an hour.

2468
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:04,680
Uh,
the batteries are so terrible.

2469
02:05:04,681 --> 02:05:08,400
I've got a fantastic photo of me with
the leather holster with that strategy

2470
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:11,220
and I look so cool.
Can I see it?

2471
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,510
No,
I don't have her with me.

2472
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:15,840
We have a physical photo somewhere.
I actually found the physical foot.

2473
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:18,620
I haven't digitized them yet.
When you do,

2474
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:20,010
please send it my way.
I will.

2475
02:05:20,011 --> 02:05:21,870
Absolutely.
It was straight up on instagram.

2476
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:26,930
I also have poofy hair in the front and
I'm wearing a ridiculous shirt.

2477
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:32,670
You were Pimpin 1991 19 nature.
College.

2478
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:34,410
Yeah,
I understand.

2479
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,930
So yeah,
it will look ridiculous.

2480
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:41,931
But the point that you make so well is
that we did go from Gordon Gecko to

2481
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:43,930
them.
It says five,

2482
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:45,240
right?
And,

2483
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:49,890
and we're going to do that again in the
bitcoin technology.

2484
02:05:49,891 --> 02:05:51,540
This isn't something that's standing
still.

2485
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:53,550
The amount of innovation that's
happening today,

2486
02:05:53,551 --> 02:05:56,430
even though it's not mainstream yet,
is staggering.

2487
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:00,900
I work in this space full time.
All I do is read about what is new in

2488
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:04,320
bitcoin and that's a full time job.
How many people are there like you?

2489
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:06,090
Are you the only one like this?
No,

2490
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:07,230
no.
Absolutely not.

2491
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:11,040
The only one who's this integrated.
No,

2492
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:13,140
absolutely not.
There are a bunch of people like you.

2493
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,691
Yeah.
There,

2494
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:17,730
there's probably about a thousand people
like you who are doing this.

2495
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:20,580
Yeah.
Who were living off bitcoin constantly

2496
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:22,830
investigating bid corn,
reading about it all the time,

2497
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,370
lecturing and writing books about
bitcoin.

2498
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:27,330
Well,
not so many lecturing and writing books

2499
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:31,310
about it or speaking with conferences,
but there's hunt a hundred to 200 who

2500
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:33,390
are doing that too.
Yes.

2501
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:35,220
Hundred to 200.
Yeah.

2502
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:38,400
Maybe you should talk to the other
hundred and 99 maybe they make better

2503
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:39,710
guests.
You're crying.

2504
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:42,680
You
know,

2505
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:43,523
I,
there's,

2506
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:45,450
I,
I'm not claiming any special mantle

2507
02:06:45,451 --> 02:06:45,630
here.

2508
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:49,350
There's lots of people who are very much
into it as I am and it is a full time

2509
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:51,960
job and because so much is happening.
So yes,

2510
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:53,880
you're right.
These devices will seem antiquated.

2511
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:56,320
What this shows,
however is that won't,

2512
02:06:56,340 --> 02:07:00,720
when I came on the show the first time,
I think about three years ago,

2513
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:05,310
um,
I didn't yet have one of these and I

2514
02:07:05,311 --> 02:07:09,360
used to store my bitcoin on what was
called a paper wallet,

2515
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:14,750
which is basically where I print out to
additional keys with a convoluted

2516
02:07:14,821 --> 02:07:18,360
process to make sure my computer that's
doing the printing isn't compromised

2517
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:22,290
cause then they're compromised and then
send the money to those digital keys and

2518
02:07:22,291 --> 02:07:25,290
then put those in a vault in a safe
deposit box in a,

2519
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:28,560
in a safe.
And that worked great for two years.

2520
02:07:28,561 --> 02:07:32,160
I kept a small amount of bitcoin safe
that way.

2521
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:37,000
Problem is,
it took a lot of expertise to execute on

2522
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:39,820
that and there are many ways to get it
wrong.

2523
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:44,410
So we've progressed now the way you back
this up,

2524
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:48,370
as you write down 24 English words,
like how hard is that that it shows to

2525
02:07:48,371 --> 02:07:50,470
you one at a time on the screen and it
tells you,

2526
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:54,880
write them down a runs with software in
a website which has really three or four

2527
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:56,590
buttons.
It's fairly easy to use.

2528
02:07:56,710 --> 02:08:01,300
The device itself has two buttons.
I could probably teach my mom how to use

2529
02:08:01,301 --> 02:08:04,330
this and she owns bitcoin,
so that would be useful.

2530
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:06,490
But,
and she owns one of these,

2531
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:11,820
but it's still not ready.
She'd probably only use it when you're

2532
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:12,790
around.
Yeah,

2533
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:15,090
no,
she doesn't use it coming over.

2534
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:18,250
Get Out.
My little goofy fucking bitcoin thing.

2535
02:08:18,251 --> 02:08:22,360
Let me pretend I use this for,
she wouldn't humor me that way.

2536
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:23,893
No,
no,

2537
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:28,450
no.
So the bottom line is that five years

2538
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:32,050
from now this is going to be even
simpler and we keep iterating and

2539
02:08:32,051 --> 02:08:35,440
maturing the technology.
It's not standing still.

2540
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:38,500
And as it gets easier and easier and
more people come on board,

2541
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:43,030
not only are they able to use bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies,

2542
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:47,260
but they're able to do it with security
in a way that doesn't require an

2543
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:50,110
enormous amount of expertise.
And this is the same.

2544
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:54,010
This happened with the Internet.
I remember this fantastic show you see

2545
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:58,360
in 1994 and they've got good morning
America and there's this clip from the

2546
02:08:58,361 --> 02:09:01,870
outtakes they're doing before they're
doing this big internet story.

2547
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:05,770
And they have the host chatting amongst
themselves before they started story and

2548
02:09:05,771 --> 02:09:08,470
one of them saying,
so what is the intranet?

2549
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:10,540
Is that the email?
No,

2550
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:10,901
no,
no,

2551
02:09:10,901 --> 02:09:12,520
no.
That's just email.

2552
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:14,620
So the at sign is the intranet?
No,

2553
02:09:14,621 --> 02:09:14,861
no,
no,

2554
02:09:14,861 --> 02:09:16,330
no.
The outside his email.

2555
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:18,790
It's the www.
That's,

2556
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:24,150
that's Internet and Dotcom.
That's intranet.

2557
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:29,340
And it's going through this process
where they're trying to grasp this alien

2558
02:09:30,311 --> 02:09:34,630
and strange seeming technology and all
of the terminology is weird.

2559
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:37,870
Let's play this

2560
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:40,260
as host.
Doing that little tease.

2561
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:43,290
Definitely mark with the a and then the
ring around it.

2562
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:47,780
So that's what I said.
Katie said she thought it was about,

2563
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:49,050
yeah.
Oh,

2564
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:52,390
but I'd never heard of it around.
I'd never heard of mark,

2565
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:54,960
but never heard it said.
And then it sounded stupid.

2566
02:09:54,961 --> 02:09:59,961
What I said at violence add NBC
in the lunchroom.

2567
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:03,840
You say if there is violence at NBC,
Ge Calm.

2568
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:08,100
I mean alison should know what is
Internet anyway?

2569
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:12,590
Internet.
Is that NASA computer network,

2570
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:16,350
the one that's becoming really big now?
What do you mean?

2571
02:10:16,351 --> 02:10:18,570
That's how does want it know?
What do you write to it?

2572
02:10:18,571 --> 02:10:19,520
Like male?
No.

2573
02:10:19,521 --> 02:10:22,950
A lot of people use it and communicate.
I guess they can communicate with NBC

2574
02:10:22,951 --> 02:10:24,360
writers and producers.
Alison,

2575
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:26,790
can you explain what Internet is?
No,

2576
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:28,530
she can't say anything in 10 seconds or
less.

2577
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:31,950
Alison will be in the studio shortly.

2578
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:32,813
What does,
what does that mean?

2579
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:35,660
A giant computer network made up,
made up of uh,

2580
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:38,840
started from how I touch your hand.
Tell us what this was and then look in

2581
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:40,430
the dictionary.
It's not an,

2582
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:41,800
it's,
it's,

2583
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,140
it's a computer billboard,
but it's,

2584
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,040
it's,
it's several universities and everything

2585
02:10:46,041 --> 02:10:49,640
all joined together and others can
access it and it's getting bigger and

2586
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:51,680
bigger roles.
Just spreading really handy during the

2587
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:52,640
quake.
A lot of people,

2588
02:10:52,641 --> 02:10:55,100
that's how they were communicating out
to tell family and loved ones.

2589
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:57,070
They were okay because all the phone
lines were down.

2590
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:59,150
I was telling Katie and I call me,
you don't need that.

2591
02:10:59,250 --> 02:11:01,170
You don't need a phone line to offer
even know.

2592
02:11:04,230 --> 02:11:06,070
So if you show this,
that's awesome.

2593
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,290
If you show this to a millennial right
now,

2594
02:11:08,291 --> 02:11:09,850
they're like,
ah,

2595
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:12,430
94.
That was just before the civil war,

2596
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,860
right?
This is 18.

2597
02:11:14,861 --> 02:11:17,380
Is it 1894 slavery was legal,
right?

2598
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:20,020
They had TV.
Then back then it's like they can't even

2599
02:11:20,021 --> 02:11:25,021
conceive of a time when the Internet was
just so completely impossible to

2600
02:11:26,081 --> 02:11:28,540
understand.
I feel very fortunate that I grew up

2601
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:31,310
without it and got to experience it in
my twenties right?

2602
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:35,530
I experienced it emerge and I was like,
Whoa,

2603
02:11:35,531 --> 02:11:37,660
what is this?
But it didn't really have the same sort

2604
02:11:37,661 --> 02:11:42,661
of impact on my life that it has on the
lives of young people today that are

2605
02:11:42,941 --> 02:11:46,000
growing up with it right there.
I mean,

2606
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:49,540
you look at kids today,
you go to a store or go to the mall or

2607
02:11:49,541 --> 02:11:50,980
something like that and to go to a
restaurant,

2608
02:11:51,010 --> 02:11:52,330
they're fucking glued to their phone.

2609
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,100
They're glued.
All right.

2610
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,540
Yeah.
Here comes the prediction.

2611
02:11:56,050 --> 02:11:58,210
This generation,
which is growing up right now,

2612
02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:01,090
they'd never know a world without
Internet.

2613
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:04,540
They also never know a world without
bitcoin.

2614
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:08,680
I don't dare you now,
15 to 18 years from now,

2615
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:12,100
none of them are going to get the
driver's license because there will be

2616
02:12:12,101 --> 02:12:16,390
no self driving cars.
I need one and wouldn't be no driving

2617
02:12:16,391 --> 02:12:18,190
cars.
The fucking Montana where I could drive

2618
02:12:18,191 --> 02:12:21,610
my own God damn car won't be on hobby.
A hobby.

2619
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:24,310
It will be a hobby.
And you'll pay $3,000 a month in

2620
02:12:24,311 --> 02:12:27,010
insurance to drive your own car.
How much?

2621
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,860
I think you'll see.
That's where it's going to go.

2622
02:12:29,861 --> 02:12:32,650
Come on.
I don't know humans behind the wheel,

2623
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,300
grandpa.
That sounds insane.

2624
02:12:34,301 --> 02:12:38,140
Housing dollars a month didn't.
So you're going to be telling your

2625
02:12:38,141 --> 02:12:39,160
grandchildren.
Yeah,

2626
02:12:39,161 --> 02:12:41,740
we used to drive our own cars and say
that sounds crazy.

2627
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,810
Did to hundreds of thousands of people
die every year.

2628
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:46,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2629
02:12:46,061 --> 02:12:47,950
But we live like men.
Yes,

2630
02:12:47,951 --> 02:12:50,050
we didn't live suck in this digital
dick.

2631
02:12:50,051 --> 02:12:52,060
Like all these other policies out there.
Yeah,

2632
02:12:52,061 --> 02:12:55,120
there you go.
But think about it this way.

2633
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:58,750
Imagine a child born today that never
sees cash.

2634
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:00,173
You know?
I mean,

2635
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:04,210
they travel to another country where
they're backwards and they still use

2636
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:07,990
paper as money.
Right now it's entirely possible.

2637
02:13:07,991 --> 02:13:11,590
So what seems inconceivable to us then
becomes the norm.

2638
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:14,470
Then it becomes inconceivable to live
without it.

2639
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:17,350
Right?
And then you're trying to explain,

2640
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:22,180
you know,
so what consensus algorithm did the

2641
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:22,841
Federal Reserve use?
Oh,

2642
02:13:22,841 --> 02:13:27,310
it's used the 12 white dudes decide for
you consensus.

2643
02:13:30,950 --> 02:13:31,980
Was this,
what is a

2644
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,720
proof of work algorithm?
No,

2645
02:13:33,721 --> 02:13:36,720
no johnny,
it was a proof of war algorithm backed

2646
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:37,554
by oil.

2647
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:42,100
I am happy you exist.
I love having you on the show.

2648
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:45,160
I love talking to,
I love the fact that you have this

2649
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:49,990
beautiful vision of digital currency and
if it worked and if you're correct and

2650
02:13:49,991 --> 02:13:52,540
it all pans out,
I think it's going to be amazing.

2651
02:13:52,570 --> 02:13:57,130
I love that you know so much about it.
I love that you come on here and educate

2652
02:13:57,131 --> 02:13:59,800
us.
I love that every time you come on there

2653
02:13:59,801 --> 02:14:02,320
really does seem to be more and more
progress.

2654
02:14:02,321 --> 02:14:04,510
It is tangible.
It's trackable.

2655
02:14:04,690 --> 02:14:07,810
It's interesting and it's fascinating.
And uh,

2656
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:10,390
I'm all in,
I'm on team bitcoin.

2657
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:13,330
I'm 100% committed.
I really wanted to happen.

2658
02:14:13,690 --> 02:14:15,520
Uh,
but it's just one of those things,

2659
02:14:15,521 --> 02:14:17,320
man.
It's just entirely fascinating.

2660
02:14:17,321 --> 02:14:22,321
And until it absolutely is here.
Like credit cards,

2661
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:26,170
like the car,
like all the other things that you were

2662
02:14:26,171 --> 02:14:30,430
describing that really didn't exist
before and now exists almost primarily.

2663
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:31,781
I mean,
I think,

2664
02:14:31,781 --> 02:14:33,570
um,
it's,

2665
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:36,610
it's,
it's absolutely amazing and fascinating

2666
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:41,640
and again,
in a lot of ways it's a solution for the

2667
02:14:41,981 --> 02:14:46,090
control that the federal government,
the Federal Reserve,

2668
02:14:46,091 --> 02:14:50,110
the banks and even politicians have over
us today.

2669
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,920
That conduct control is slowly being
eroded by the Internet.

2670
02:14:53,921 --> 02:14:56,770
Not even slowly,
pretty rapidly being eroded by the

2671
02:14:56,771 --> 02:14:59,350
Internet.
Even whatever control politicians used

2672
02:14:59,351 --> 02:15:02,590
to have,
it's not nearly as,

2673
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:06,700
it's not nearly as easy to hide.
It's so much more transparent.

2674
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,200
It's so much easier to protest today.
It's just a different realm or living in

2675
02:15:11,201 --> 02:15:14,110
a different world.
And that world is happening incredibly

2676
02:15:14,111 --> 02:15:18,400
rapidly from a,
I got on in 1994 you were on before then

2677
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:21,700
when it was like this really fragile,
strange internet.

2678
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:23,530
I mean,
you were in the early days.

2679
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:27,640
I'm really fascinated to see what it's
going to be like 20 years from now and I

2680
02:15:27,641 --> 02:15:28,480
really do hope you're right.

2681
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:32,960
Well,
that's one of the beautiful things about

2682
02:15:32,961 --> 02:15:37,340
this is I think if you've experienced
things like this before,

2683
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:40,700
and we're very lucky to be part of a
generation where we have,

2684
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:44,060
um,
advancements in technology happening at

2685
02:15:44,061 --> 02:15:46,460
a rate where you don't just see one or
two,

2686
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:49,580
but you see several in a lifetime,
right?

2687
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:55,060
That are pretty earth shattering in
their complexity and involvement.

2688
02:15:55,131 --> 02:15:58,160
We've seen the Internet's,
we've seen social media,

2689
02:15:58,161 --> 02:16:00,530
we've seen the miniaturization of
computers.

2690
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:05,950
Now we're going to see self driving cars
and digital currencies and all of these

2691
02:16:06,531 --> 02:16:09,380
other things in a single lifetime.
Once you've seen two or three of these,

2692
02:16:09,381 --> 02:16:14,381
you start capturing the pattern and the
pattern is when it starts,

2693
02:16:15,921 --> 02:16:18,590
everybody ignores it,
makes fun of it.

2694
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:21,620
Can't possibly see how change would
happen,

2695
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:22,770
right?
Um,

2696
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:27,140
and this happened with the automobile
that's happened with electricity.

2697
02:16:27,141 --> 02:16:29,980
It happens with credit cards.
First time credit

2698
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,260
cards were introduced.
Nobody thought they were going to work

2699
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:34,450
is a crazy,
stupid experiment.

2700
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:38,320
Nobody wanted to take them.
This happens with every type of

2701
02:16:38,321 --> 02:16:40,990
technology.
It's ridiculed at first and then

2702
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:44,830
gradually it matures.
It gets less cumbersome to use.

2703
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:48,430
And if it has some,
some fundamental properties,

2704
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:52,060
some utilities,
something it's useful for that's

2705
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:53,080
different,
that's new,

2706
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:55,450
that you can do things with it you
couldn't do before,

2707
02:16:56,050 --> 02:17:00,760
then at some point it hits an inflection
point and it becomes mainstream very,

2708
02:17:00,761 --> 02:17:05,080
very rapidly.
And then everybody is both surprised and

2709
02:17:05,081 --> 02:17:06,640
at the same time claims ownership and
say,

2710
02:17:06,641 --> 02:17:08,710
well,
I always thought that this bit coin

2711
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:10,750
thing would succeed.
Well,

2712
02:17:10,751 --> 02:17:13,070
let's hope we're those people.
Um,

2713
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,360
this book is available right now.
The Internet of money.

2714
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:21,420
Where can people get it other than some
funky exchange in some dark web corner

2715
02:17:21,761 --> 02:17:23,260
of the world?
Where can people get this?

2716
02:17:23,290 --> 02:17:25,450
Yeah.
So this is available on an obscure side

2717
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:26,970
called Amazon dot.

Actually.

2727
02:17:48,041 --> 02:17:50,380
What's up with it?
It does not have any pictures in it.

2728
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:52,840
Um,

02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:25,420
It's always a pleasure to talk to you.
I hope you're right.

2743
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:28,330
I really do.
And the Internet of money is available

2744

Yes.

2745

Right now I have copied number one.
You fucks right here in my greasy hands.

2746
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:36,401
Thank you,
sir.

2747
02:18:36,401 --> 02:18:37,930
Always a pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

2748
02:18:46,350 --> 02:18:46,430
Okay.
