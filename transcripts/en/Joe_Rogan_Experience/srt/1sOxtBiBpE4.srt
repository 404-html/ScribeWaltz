1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,500
Oh,
you creeps that are controlling money

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:12,501
all throughout the world.
Your time is slowly closing in.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Am I right?
You Hip Andrea's Antonopoulos author a

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,180
published author of the Internet of
money.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,340
Uh,
you've been on the show many times

6
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,500
before,
but you've never been on the show two

7
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,290
days after a book,
fresh off the presses.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,410
Tell a story about how this book got
delivered to you today because it's kind

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,244
of hilarious.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
Yeah.
So nobody knew about this.

11
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,520
This is my announcement.
This is my second book.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,860
First book was mastering Bitcoin was for
techies.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,080
Uh,
the internet of money is for everybody

14
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:49,081
else and it's a collection of my talks
and I was having the first copy

15
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,960
delivered to my hotel this morning in
order to bring it to the show and give

16
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,840
it to you.
And uh,

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,130
it was a day late.
It was supposed to be delivered

18
00:00:57,131 --> 00:01:01,840
yesterday and I'm waiting and I'm
refreshing the tracking number site.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,190
And then you said,
you know,

20
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:06,130
we can push it back by half hour because
you're running a bit late.

21
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,840
And,
and in that half hour,

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,110
the book God delivered,
it literally was printed September

23
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,390
fifth.
This is the first copy I've touched.

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,063
And this yours.

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,380
Oh boy,
I've got it.

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,400
Folks.
Issues Zero,

27
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,660
zero,
zero one.

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,880
Now why did they do that?
Just one.

29
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,460
Why don't they just make it one?
Why does everybody have to do a one?

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,030
Well,
I'm not printing 10,000 issues so.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,620
Well,
they never go.

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,170
It's never like zero.
Zero,

33
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,670
zero,
zero,

34
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:37,870
zero.
Zero one.

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,380
Did they ever do that pair of shoes
once?

36
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:42,870
Recently with that?
It was like one out of.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,440
Why are you in one of my ears?
Only.

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,940
What the Hell's going on there?
That bond.

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,740
I can't have you in my left here.
It's like you're like the voice of good

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,200
or the voice of bad.
Oh yeah.

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,670
Yeah.
I got it too.

42
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,770
Yeah,
that's too weird.

43
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,590
We can't have that.
Try it again.

44
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,480
Check.
Check.

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,010
Nope.
You fucking Weirdo.

46
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:04,350
You're coming in my left ear.
Only.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,880
Probably the.
The rest of America too,

48
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,180
right?
Yeah.

49
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,220
They can't have that.
People are at the gym going,

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,060
what the fuck?
Jamie's in my left ear.

51
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,520
So this is a collection of all your
talks,

52
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,100
what has changed in the world of
bitcoins.

53
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,590
And so last time we spoke we spoke and
we hung out in Vegas,

54
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:23,440
which was great.
I had a great time with you and um,

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,350
but what,
what has changed in the world of bitcoin

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
since the last time?

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,470
Well,
it's been a bout a year and a half

58
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,790
almost,
and so much so much happening in the

59
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,791
meantime that we had a pretty slow 2015
and 2016 picked up again 2015 still

60
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,890
coming off a slow and gradual drop in
the price.

61
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:49,160
People were very reluctant and
skeptical.

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,650
The media was constantly bashing
bitcoin.

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,260
And then,
um,

64
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,140
at the same time we saw this really
interesting phenomenon where the banks

65
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,760
started getting interested in this
thing,

66
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,190
but

67
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,150
not bitcoin itself.
No,

68
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,310
the blockchain,
the technology behind Bitcoin,

69
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,620
which is rather amusing.
I,

70
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,310
I look at that a bit as if,
you know,

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,810
the Horse Buggy Association of America
is going,

72
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,180
oh,
we like this automobile thing you've

73
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,240
designed,
but we have a very big investment in Hay

74
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,650
and horses and stables and veterinarian.
So we're going to use the technology

75
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,150
behind the automobile pneumatic tire and
we're going to revolutionize horse

76
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,950
buggies.

77
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,160
But in all fairness,
I think what you're saying,

78
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,720
it's hilarious,
but in all fairness,

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,200
it is a weird thing to invest in,
like to go all in on bitcoin.

80
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,710
I mean,
I know you do it,

81
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:44,070
but you also make all of your money this
way and this is,

82
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,880
you know,
you're.

83
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,130
You're a proselytizing person when it
comes to Bitcoin,

84
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,500
right?
For good reason.

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,920
But for the average person saves,
saved up actual cash money their whole

86
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:59,520
life and is involved in this established
system of money to throw all their money

87
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:03,450
into bitcoin would be insane.
You watched the money fluctuate,

88
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,700
it goes up and it goes down.
Well,

89
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,870
I'm thinking,
I'm glad you said that,

90
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,460
that it would be insane.
That would be a terrible idea.

91
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Right?
But don't you think that that's probably

92
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:15,441
why the media bashes it and why banks
are just looking at it going like people

93
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:18,750
see that there's a growing number of
people that are using it for

94
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:19,530
transactions.

95
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,510
There's Bitcoin ATM now and people are
using it to to purchase things.

96
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:27,660
There's several companies that accept
bitcoin for for products,

97
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:30,810
for actual real physical products,
but yeah,

98
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,380
but I mean it's not an investment so it
shouldn't be treated as an investment.

99
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,170
I mean not don't even mean like as an
investment.

100
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:41,160
I mean as like a primary source array of
money,

101
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,140
of,
of,

102
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,820
of if you decided to take all of your
money,

103
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,610
not as an investment,
but just say,

104
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,510
I'm going going to live off a Bitcoin,
I'm going to spend bitcoin.

105
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:52,590
Much like your money's going to go up
and down.

106
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,170
Yeah.
What are you going to be really hard,

107
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:58,910
especially if you're.
If you're accustomed to privileged

108
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:01,040
banking,
like if you have the kind of banking

109
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,610
that we have in this country,
if you actually have access to that and

110
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:09,611
you have a a nice visa debit card and
you don't pay account fees and your

111
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:15,581
money doesn't get confiscated by a
dictator too often and you know you can

112
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,660
earn your money and interact with other
people,

113
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,430
then why?
Why would you use bitcoin?

114
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,550
The simple answer is that's not really
the use case,

115
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,480
but there are lots of people around the
world who simply don't have access to

116
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,980
that and for them,
you know,

117
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,660
in many cases bitcoin is the stable
currency,

118
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,080
you know,
ask a,

119
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,810
an Argentinian,
Venezuelan,

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Brazilian Supriya to Greek and the list
goes on and on and on.

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,460
Whether they're worried about volatility
in bitcoin and in many cases if they've

122
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,720
heard of it,
if they've used it,

123
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,430
that's the stable currency.

124
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,060
They're national currency is far,
far worse.

125
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,530
Right.
Did you say Brazil?

126
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,040
Yeah.
Brazil has had a massive devaluation the

127
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,010
last year.
How much devaluation,

128
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,610
because I know that they have
experienced some sort of a really

129
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,840
radical economic downturn,
which is really interesting because a

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
few years ago when we first started
going into Brazil,

131
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:10,010
their economy was booming.
W W we.

132
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,660
I'm saying the UFC,
yeah,

133
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,090
they're at a currency crisis right now.
Massive currency crisis.

134
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,560
What's going on?
Well,

135
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,900
apart from the political crisis that's
going on,

136
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,260
and I won't speak for that because I'm
not the Brazilian,

137
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,010
but you know,
they've had impeachment proceedings.

138
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,780
They just impeached their president.
There's been a lot of economic

139
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,170
difficulty with the country and I think
they,

140
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,540
their currency has devalued almost 30
percent in the last year of 20 or 30

141
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,000
percent.
Some staggering amount in currencies

142
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,470
don't move like that.
Mainstream national currencies that have

143
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,680
very large economies behind them simply
don't move like that.

144
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,660
We've seen it happened only a couple of
times.

145
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,470
We've seen it happening in Greece and
Cyprus during the economic crisis.

146
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,860
We saw it happen in Britain,
uh,

147
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,020
during brexit.
And we've seen it in places like Brazil,

148
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,760
Venezuela,
Argentina,

149
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,300
and places like that.
How much currency did,

150
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,390
how much of a percentage of Britain you
lose during brexit?

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Almost 20 percent in a day.
And three things responded to.

152
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,980
That's in the opposite direction.
Gold,

153
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,500
the Japanese yen and bitcoin heading in
the exact opposite direction.

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,650
A bitcoin climb,
20 percent that they almost really.

155
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,920
So did Britain rebound.
Um,

156
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,770
it did a bit,
but it's still in historic,

157
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,810
close,
multi-decade lows.

158
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,220
So they took a really big hit.
And what we've seen again and again is

159
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,290
at times of crisis,
um,

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,100
we see this pattern repeating where
people use bitcoin as a safe haven

161
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:41,000
investment to get money out of a
national currencies,

162
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:45,740
especially where there are very strict
currency capital controls.

163
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,500
So one of the reasons we've seen a
bitcoin,

164
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,910
probably one of the reasons we've seen a
lot of activity with bitcoin in China is

165
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,520
because of currency controls.
Every time the yuan,

166
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,840
the Chinese currency devalues against
the dollar and it's done.

167
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:04,841
So I think four times in the last year,
every time there was a massive uptick in

168
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,710
bitcoin buying in China.
So people are parking their money in

169
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:13,190
bitcoin or using it to convert it to
other currencies and get money out of

170
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,730
the country.
So what is the biggest fluctuation that

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,860
bitcoin has had?
Um,

172
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,510
well,
it,

173
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,110
it depends whether you look at it on a
monetary basis or on a percentage basis.

174
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,930
If you look at the movements now,
it can go up 30,

175
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:29,360
40,
even a hundred bucks in a day.

176
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,780
Um,
which seems like a lot,

177
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,100
but as a percentage,
the biggest fluctuations that had were

178
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,900
in 2010 and 2011,
uh,

179
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,390
when it rose from under a dollar to over
$30 and then back down to under a dollar

180
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,930
in a period of a couple of months.

181
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,420
For people who don't understand what
this means when you're,

182
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,690
when you're saying it a hundred bucks or
a dollar $30.

183
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,260
Like what is that in relationship to one
bitcoin,

184
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,330
one bitcoin equals $30 or in 2011.
And what does it equal right now?

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,070
Six hundred and 17.
Six hundred $17.

186
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,900
Jesus,
it was about $230 at the beginning of

187
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,280
this year.
So I've seen a massive ramp pop and a

188
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:14,880
renewal of interest that.
Okay,

189
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,880
so massive ramp up.
But like what's the fluctuation?

190
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,280
So if it's at 616,
is that what you said?

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,830
Yeah,
it's tripled since the beginning of the

192
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
year almost.
Is it possible that it could drop to

193
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,370
like 200 tomorrow?
Yes.

194
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,940
See that scares the shit out of people.
Yes.

195
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,630
And,
and which is why,

196
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,340
you know,
here's,

197
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,720
here's the,
here's the truth,

198
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,170
over the seven years that it's existed,
the volatility as a percentage has been

199
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,330
going down every single here.

200
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,690
So as the economy gets bigger,
the bigger it is,

201
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:48,900
the more stable it is.
A doesn't get buffeted around,

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
right?
It's just like a very large boats

203
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,750
doesn't get pushed around by the waves.
And bitcoin is like a Zodiac next to

204
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,681
theU ,
s dollars,

205
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,470
titanic and the Little Zodiac is
bouncing up and down on the waves a lot.

206
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,450
And it might be uncomfortable at times.
Of course,

207
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,810
if you're heading to an iceberg,
you want to be in the thing that can

208
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:13,380
actually turn on a dime.
That's a good way to look at.

209
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,080
But,
uh,

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,910
I don't know if it's a fair analogy,
but it's a good way to look at.

211
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:16,880
Yes,
it's volatile.

212
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,000
And that's part of,
it's part of the fact that a 10 to

213
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,620
$12,000,000,000 economy stretched across
the entire globe is a small economy,

214
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,410
is a currency.
Now in the interest of making this a

215
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,550
standalone podcast.

216
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,040
So people are not going to go back and
listen to all the other podcasts that

217
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,280
we've done.
Explain very briefly if you could,

218
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,030
what is bitcoin and how does it work?
I'm glad I have this opportunity to do

219
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,460
it again because every time we have a
new audience.

220
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,230
So bitcoin is internet money.
It's a system of money that exists on

221
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:49,200
the Internet,
was created on the Internet and it

222
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:54,150
allows you to send and receive value the
same way you can send to receive an

223
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:58,080
email anywhere in the world
instantaneously without intermediaries.

224
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,250
And,
and that's kind of what you see at first

225
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,500
glance behind that.
It's a whole platform.

226
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,250
It is as the title of the books as the
Internet of money.

227
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,730
It is,
it is a set of protocols that allow you

228
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,910
to basically exchange value with other
people.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,640
But you can do a lot more with it than
just that.

230
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,960
Most people will use it as a currency.
It's basically money that you can

231
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,160
transmit from your smartphone to
somebody else's smartphone directly,

232
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,950
just like cash.
Um,

233
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,050
but electronic.
And the thing about it that's unique is

234
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:37,830
that it's not owned by any corporation,
any bank or any government,

235
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,831
just like the web isn't owned by anyone
or email isn't owned by anyone.

236
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,930
And there's lots of companies that can
send or receive email.

237
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,150
There's also companies that can set up
websites.

238
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,380
There's a lot of companies that can set
up applications that use bitcoin.

239
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,110
And I should say that when you set it up
for me,

240
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,590
the first time you did it,
a bunch of people donated bitcoin.

241
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,130
So what I did was I'd said whatever
people donated,

242
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,300
I would match or I would double it,
and then we would donate it to fight for

243
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,850
the forgotten have build wells in the
Congo.

244
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,990
And we built.
I don't remember how many Justin Wren

245
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,260
said,
but it was A.

246
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't even remember how much money,
but it was many thousands of dollars.

247
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,840
People donated.
And then I doubled it and then we sent

248
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,170
it over to the Congo.
So the bitcoin community is very

249
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,870
generous,
is my point that that is true.

250
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,430
And part of that generosity comes from
the fact that a lot of the people in

251
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:37,660
this community are very excited about
this technology and want to share it

252
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,370
with others.
They want to tell other people about

253
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:44,200
this technology.
It's really quite interesting what

254
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:47,590
happens when you create a form of money
that is truly global.

255
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,100
We really don't have forms of money that
are truly global.

256
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,750
If you even even with your very advanced
banking system and your access to all of

257
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,060
the technology that you have in the
American banking system.

258
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,730
If you try to send money to some
countries,

259
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:04,510
it's almost impossible to do.
And I experienced this every time I get

260
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,610
paid in Bitcoin,
I'll go into a conference in Europe,

261
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,870
um,
and I'll do one conference with the

262
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,820
banking industry and one conference with
the bitcoin community and the little

263
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,340
bitcoin conference.
It's going to be free to attend and I

264
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,330
don't make any money,
but they sometimes cover some of my

265
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:25,331
expenses and I'll send them an invoice.
And the banking industry conference will

266
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:31,120
send me a wire transfer.
It takes on average four weeks for me to

267
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,810
get it with several calls to find out
where it went,

268
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,940
what's going on,
why did it get lost?

269
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,820
And it takes me on average 15 minutes to
get paid in Bitcoin,

270
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,910
no matter which country and being paid
it is.

271
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,200
This is the cynic in me is this because
when they take the money and they're

272
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,450
transferring it,
they're moving it around and now it's

273
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,440
sitting in banks.

274
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,840
When banks have money,
if they have your money,

275
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:56,140
even if it's just for a few weeks,
they have the opportunity to use that

276
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,600
money to make more money.
Are they doing that?

277
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,890
Um,
it,

278
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,830
it certainly doesn't.
It doesn't hurt to keep it a bit longer.

279
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,450
They're doing it primarily because,
um,

280
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,800
because the system has a series of
intermediaries and each of those

281
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,890
intermediaries represent a risk.
If one of those intermediary says,

282
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,220
I have the money for Mr Antonopoulos
wire and you give that money to

283
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,360
Antonopoulos,
but the intermediary doesn't give it to

284
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,130
you,
you're out of money.

285
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,870
Right?
So there's those risks with every

286
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,940
intermediate you put in,
there's risk.

287
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,230
And that's called counterparty risk.
The because of the way the banking

288
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,750
system is with perhaps five,
six,

289
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,120
seven intermediaries in a single
transfer,

290
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,150
uh,
that creates a lot of cumulative risk

291
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,270
and they protect with at risk by slowing
things down and um,

292
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,580
that risk doesn't exist in bitcoin
because it's from one party directly to

293
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,020
another,
no counter parties.

294
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,800
That's one of the core principles.

295
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,710
And the funny thing,
I had this conversation with my bank

296
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,310
instead said I had done this,
um,

297
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,000
conference in Germany,
Frankfurt at the headquarters of the

298
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,410
Bundesbank.
Now,

299
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,500
for those of your viewers or listeners
who don't know,

300
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,501
the Bundesbank is the Federal Bank of
Germany and they probably consider the

301
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,090
United States Federal Reserve to be a
mediocre creditor compared to the

302
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,050
Bundesbank.
This is like the best credit rating on

303
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,640
the planet.
Right?

304
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,990
And I'm going to speak at a conference
there and they're paying me for my

305
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:34,790
expenses and they send a wire transfer
and I call my bank and after four weeks

306
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,640
they finally find it and tell me we've
received your bank,

307
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,220
your bank wire transfer.
We're going to hold it.

308
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,160
Um,
because of the risk profile.

309
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,280
Like I don't understand,
well,

310
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,930
you haven't been paid by this particular
payer before,

311
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,850
so we're going to put a hold on it said
you do know this is the Bundesbank

312
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,250
you are holding and they held it for two
weeks.

313
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:03,251
You are holding for two weeks because of
the credit risk of the Federal Bank of

314
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,430
Germany,
the most credit worthy institution.

315
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm not trying to receive money from
Somalia,

316
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,840
you know,
this isn't even something weird.

317
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,210
And if,
if even they campaign me in the age of

318
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:22,010
the Internet instantaneously,
there is something wrong with this

319
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:26,030
banking system.
And there is because I got paid for the

320
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:29,270
bitcoin conference was doing in the same
town instantaneously.

321
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,650
But there's also concern on their end
about fraud,

322
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,581
right?
I mean,

323
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,770
isn't it,
but there's fraud with bitcoin as well.

324
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,730
I mean,
wasn't there,

325
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,670
um,
that issue with those guys that were

326
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:43,400
investigating the dark web,
it turned out that the agents were

327
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:46,970
stealing bitcoin to the tune of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

328
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,410
Wasn't that the case with.

329
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
Yes,
absolutely.

330
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,480
So the difference,
the difference is a difference between

331
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,050
systemic fraud and individual cases of
fraud.

332
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,610
Um,
so I'm in Bitcoin as in the traditional

333
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:03,520
banking system.
If,

334
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,770
if a bank or an organization
concentrates a lot of money,

335
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,790
then you can go in and steal it.
You basically robbed the Big Coin Bank

336
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,150
just like people rob the normal bank.
And how would they do that?

337
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:18,240
Just hack into it.
So they hack in and they do it.

338
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,040
And this has happened many,
many times.

339
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:24,750
And this is a problem with bitcoin banks
as opposed to person to person

340
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,100
exchanges.
Correct?

341
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:29,280
Because the whole point of Bitcoin is
that you don't need to put your money in

342
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:34,281
the custody of someone else and if
instead you use bitcoin as it is

343
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,850
intended,
where everybody keeps control of their

344
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,460
own money,
then in order to hack all of those

345
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:46,200
people either have to hack the bitcoin
protocol itself has not happened in

346
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,510
seven years.
And the way it's structured is

347
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,040
impossible.
Do or you

348
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,970
have to hack each individual account
holder and you can hack individual

349
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,870
account holders depending on their level
of security and sophistication.

350
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,520
But,
um,

351
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,370
you know,
to get very large amounts you have to

352
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,350
wait for them to give their money to
someone else.

353
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,360
What was that exchange?
The bitcoin bank that started off as

354
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,750
like a fantasy website and some,
what was that again?

355
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,900
Uh,
this was a Mt.

356
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,970
Gox in Japan.
The magic,

357
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,150
the gathering online,
which they see in the early days of

358
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:23,220
bitcoin.
There wouldn't know exchanges.

359
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,100
So you've got to think back like,
do you remember on the web,

360
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,670
uh,
in the early days when even the largest,

361
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:33,540
most sophisticated corporations had a
page with a single logon,

362
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,870
a gray background,
and some flashing lights that said under

363
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,060
construction,
like in 1994,

364
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,640
that's where we are in bitcoin's still.
So there's,

365
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,990
there were no,
um,

366
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,640
well run exchanges at the time.

367
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,740
It was very difficult to buy and sell
bitcoin.

368
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,250
And so this guy in Japan had a site that
could trade these magic,

369
00:18:55,621 --> 00:19:00,621
the gathering online cards and um,
he converted the site to trade

370
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,130
currencies instead to create trade
cryptocurrencies.

371
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,220
It turns out it's a lot easier to hack
in and steal cryptocurrencies than it is

372
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:12,150
to steal the cards.
Whatever happened with that,

373
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,710
because the story was like hundreds of
thousands of dollars in bitcoins,

374
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:19,140
just hundreds of millions of dollars.
Millions.

375
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,050
They didn't vanish that event or someone
stole it.

376
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,650
They got stolen.
Uh,

377
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,540
they got cycled through the economy and
they're back in the economy now,

378
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,200
but just not with the same owners.
No one knows who.

379
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,990
No one knows who.
That seems bizarre.

380
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:38,070
Like if you rob a bank,
like they can put a trace on the bills

381
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,530
and they can figure it out eventually in
most people get caught,

382
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,100
right?

383
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,210
Yeah.
Not really.

384
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:42,940
I mean,
no,

385
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,730
no.
If you,

386
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:48,490
if you do wire fraud perhaps,
but in many cases with cash,

387
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,450
bitcoin is ly cash.
Uh,

388
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,460
it is equally untraceable.
It's very difficult to actually catch

389
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
like,
I think recently,

390
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,590
um,
I was reading about the FBI closing the,

391
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,980
a db cooper case is the Guy who robbed
the bank,

392
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,550
got into seven,
one seven aircraft,

393
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,380
opened the rear staircase and jumped out
to the parachutes over the midwest was

394
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,620
never seen again.
Um,

395
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,460
you know,
they think that guy died though.

396
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,980
Hm.
Well that,

397
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,750
that,
that would be a convenient to

398
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,460
explanation for the failure of the FBI
to catch him.

399
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,500
Yeah,
it would be convenient,

400
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,930
but also didn't even like drop into the
woods.

401
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,453
Uh,
I,

402
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,960
I don't know the details.
They never found him body or money ever

403
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,600
again.
But that can happen pretty easy.

404
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,970
I would be more likely or more,
uh,

405
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,240
apt to believe that if someone dropped
into the woods,

406
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:44,241
out of a parachute with some fucking
haphazard gear and left out of the back

407
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,170
of a plane,
they probably died.

408
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,070
Probably got eaten by bears or
something.

409
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,210
Yes.
Or,

410
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,210
or found by a local woodsmen and the
cabin who's like some,

411
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,080
some dude fell out of the sky with a
Satchel full of money from my money.

412
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,450
I need a new chainsaw.
Yeah.

413
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,680
Yeah.
Um,

414
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,820
but when you're stealing money from a
bank,

415
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,390
can't they trace the serial numbers?
Like if you steal cash,

416
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,100
like if you go,
you know,

417
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,560
this is a robbery,
stick them up and he pointed gun at the

418
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:18,100
tower and they fill up the bag with
currency and you run out the door.

419
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,360
Don't they have like a trace on that
money like where they can if you spend

420
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,380
the cash?
No,

421
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,281
no,
not really.

422
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,220
And they can't because they have all
kinds of.

423
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,330
I mean,
yes,

424
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,110
if they had a batch of sequentially
numbered clean money,

425
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,870
yeah,
but that's not how most banks work.

426
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,320
What the money they have on hand is the
stuff that came to positive did in the

427
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,150
last week by various people,
cash businesses like Delis and grocery

428
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,570
stores and things like that,
and they have no idea what the numbers

429
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,220
on those bills are and they don't trace
it.

430
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,070
It's simply considered part of the risk
of business.

431
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,930
And what does this avoid?
Deb Cooper's money before.

432
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,920
Oh Shit.
Some of them get this out of the left

433
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:03,280
side of my ear.
It's bad cable after reset.

434
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,960
Okay.
No sign of DB.

435
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,690
Cooper ever emerged.
Investigators doubt he survived and

436
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,490
never been able to determine his true
identity,

437
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:14,260
but a boy digging on the Columbia River
beach in 1980 found three bundles of

438
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,800
weathered $20 bills.
Cooper's cash according to the serial

439
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,960
numbers.
That guy's dead as fuck.

440
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,130
They found his money.
Some of his money.

441
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,620
Was he like left of because being
sneaky,

442
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm going to pretend I'm done.

443
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm just leave some of those fears.
No,

444
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,400
they.
They only found like a very.

445
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,790
I don't think they recovered more than a
tiny fraction of it.

446
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,700
Oh yeah,
but I don't know.

447
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:38,590
I mean I remember the details always
stealing like 200 grand though.

448
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,550
I think it was only like $200,000 or
something.

449
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,540
In those days you could pay the national
debt with that kind of money.

450
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,190
What year was it?
Like sixties,

451
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,490
71.
There's a lot of money in those days.

452
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,680
That DB Cooper store is an interesting
story.

453
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,440
It's A.
People love a story like that when

454
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,350
people don't get caught.
Yeah.

455
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:59,590
The mystery of the unknown.
All the Mt.

456
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,810
Gox thing.
Exchange is kind of a mystery to.

457
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,480
It's a $100,
million dollar.

458
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,810
Many hundreds of millions of dollar
mystery inside story of Mt.

459
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,370
Gox bitcoins.
Four hundred $60.

460
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,400
Billion dollar disaster for 60.
Look at that guy.

461
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:16,060
They're leading them around.
That's Martin who is a.

462
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,300
Yes,
it was the guy who is now out on parole.

463
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:23,920
I believe four on or pending trial.
So that guy's out $460,

464
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,600
million dollars and he's out.
Yeah,

465
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,800
of course.
Well,

466
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,010
is he responsible?
Just because he's retarded,

467
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,270
you know that.
That's one of the things we don't know

468
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:38,220
and maybe we'll never know how much of
that responsibility,

469
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,300
whether it was deliberate,
whether it was an inside job,

470
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,120
whether it was a in something in
competence.

471
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,730
Well,
he was certainly.

472
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,800
That was an enormous amounts of
incompetent.

473
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,700
That's clear.

474
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,600
And when you listened to him talk,
I've heard him in speeches when he's

475
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,790
discussing the issue of you're like,
wait a minute,

476
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,043
that guy

477
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,453
I.
Yes,

478
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,260
exactly.
What have you heard Bernie madoff talk?

479
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,800
Yes.
True.

480
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,430
Yeah,
right.

481
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,780
I mean,
the thing is the,

482
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:01,860
even,
even the most.

483
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,030
And the interesting thing is that just
up to the day before Bernie madoff was

484
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,140
indicted,
indicted,

485
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:10,710
he was the top trusted name on Wall
Street.

486
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,270
He had the most stellar credit rating.
He was the head of the credit rating

487
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:17,120
agency for,
uh,

488
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,500
those types of funds that he was rated
under.

489
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,560
Um,
and the next day he's a CROC.

490
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,040
So
you can see these things happen

491
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:30,020
throughout human history,
the changing the form of money you used

492
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:33,270
doesn't change that,
but if he changed the architecture of

493
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,070
money and you make it less necessary,
uh,

494
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,330
and I'm less useful to concentrate the
money in the hands of third parties that

495
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,350
has an impact.
And so that

496
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,620
it's one of the issues with this.
Something like Mt Gox or with any

497
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:48,490
banking system.

498
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,090
Yes.
Other than the bitcoin system.

499
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,650
W,
yes.

500
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,630
I mean,
the problem is the counterparty risk.

501
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:57,830
If you give your money to other people,
the entire reason we have oversight in

502
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,310
banking is because of the simple truth
that if you give your money to other

503
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,080
people,
eventually they'll try to steal it.

504
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,190
That's it.
And the only reason they,

505
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,000
they don't get someone in the bank is
going to have a tremendous need.

506
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:15,740
The tremendous gambling problem and
addiction something,

507
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,200
right?
Or just have a lack of empathy in and

508
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,640
social socialization and just be,
you know,

509
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,780
correct.
Crooked,

510
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,000
but they don't even have to be crooked.
They can make a mistake and trading and

511
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,470
tried to cover it up with customer
money.

512
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,130
They can have a,
uh,

513
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,630
debts there,
their parent may require an expensive

514
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:38,870
surgery that they can't afford.
There's lots of reasons why people

515
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,920
commit financial fraud and not all of it
is because they're just greedy,

516
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:45,180
evil assholes.
But,

517
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,370
but the bottom line is that all of the
oversight system we have in banking,

518
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:54,340
which by the way fails again and again
and again and again to protect and

519
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,460
regular people from these thefts.
All of these systems we have exists for

520
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,150
that one reason.
So the answer is not build better

521
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,400
systems to watch the people who hold
your money.

522
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,320
The answer that bitcoin gives us,
don't let others hold your money,

523
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,410
hold your own money and then you don't
have this problem.

524
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,710
There was recent

525
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,710
investigative report about a firm in
Georgia,

526
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,840
I want to say it's Atlanta that has a
ridiculously high rate of success with

527
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:29,721
investments and they interviewed the Guy
who runs it and you know his reasons for

528
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:35,310
why they're so wildly successful and
they make so much more money than

529
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:38,310
anybody else.
We're very suspect and they're closing

530
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,530
in on this guy like,
what's going on over here?

531
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:44,220
And they think that not only is the
Bernie model,

532
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,910
not just Bernie Madoff,
but they,

533
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,210
they think that it's common and that
there's a lot of people that might be

534
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:56,190
supplementing legitimate investments
with a pyramid scheme and that it's been

535
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,030
a standard operational model for a lot
of these firms because they've been able

536
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:00,864
to pull it off.

537
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,230
What we've seen again and again
throughout history in the area of

538
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:10,430
finance,
is that when there's a recession,

539
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,490
when there is a drop in income and
profitability for everyone,

540
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,350
uh,
that event is actually really good for

541
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:20,660
capitalism.
What it does is it washes out the

542
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,060
frauds.
It washes out the failures,

543
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,340
it washes out the unprofitable
businesses.

544
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
It's a great cleansing event,
right?

545
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,200
Because the tide recedes and suddenly
you see who's not wearing swimming

546
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:37,400
trunks.
So we knew there was something fishy

547
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:39,020
going on the water,
but

548
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,350
it's a good way of looking at it.
When that happens in,

549
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:48,370
in Wall Street's all of those companies
that were simply reinvesting the recent

550
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:52,790
gains to pay the people who are
withdrawing their money or the retirees

551
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,240
that are supporting in their pension
funds,

552
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,760
et Cetera,
suddenly they don't.

553
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,610
They can't do that anymore.
They're washed out of the business.

554
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,390
A badly performing businesses on
profitable.

555
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:07,391
As all of these things get washed out.
We haven't been doing this in this

556
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:11,900
country for the last three decades.
Instead what happens is every time

557
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:16,160
there's a recession,
the Fed steps in a or the government

558
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,450
steps in and basically they pump water
to raise the tide again.

559
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,340
Right?
As much as possible,

560
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,750
and that means that a lot of the crux
float from recession to recession

561
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:31,751
without getting revealed worse,
it encourages that kind of behavior.

562
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,420
And so you get all of these businesses
whose only ability to make profits is

563
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:41,570
when the interest rates to zero and this
$20 million dollars a month being

564
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:46,571
injected by the Fed and their business
model is take that and lend it to

565
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,060
consumers for 29 99 Apr Right?
Or do payday loans or subprime loans or

566
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:56,450
subprime auto,
student loans,

567
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:57,740
mortgages,
etc. Etc.

568
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,960
You nEed a cleansing events to wash out
the fraud.

569
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,530
Um,
I,

570
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,990
I liked the example of a forest fire.
If you suppress all of the small fires

571
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:11,450
will happens,
is eventually you build up a lot of

572
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:15,500
undergrowth in the forest.
A small fire doesn't kill the trees.

573
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,820
It just cleans out the undergrowth.
You keep putting out the fires,

574
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:22,040
which we've seen since the seventies
here in the states.

575
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,760
You let all of the undergrowth grow up.
Then when a fire comes through,

576
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,480
it's not just a little forest fire,
it's a raging inferno.

577
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:32,510
Now.
You can't put it out and it burns the

578
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:36,860
trees and destroys the soil.
Sterilizes the top foot of soil.

579
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,150
We've seen this happen,
right?

580
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,970
And so this is now happening in terms of
our economy,

581
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,930
which is that all of this,
um,

582
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,620
bible creation doesn't get washed out in
a recession.

583
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,080
More stimulus,
more funding.

584
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,420
The federal reserve pumping more money
into the economy.

585
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,740
Trillions of dollars since 2008.
And all of this stimulus,

586
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:03,370
where does it go?
It goes into inflating not one bubble.

587
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,000
We had real estates,
but now we have real estate and subprime

588
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:12,001
auto and student loans and and and and
bonds and stocks and currencies all

589
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,650
inflating at the same time.
Is it possible to do a controlled burn

590
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,410
for the economy?
Like that's what they're doing in some

591
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:28,210
places where they want to deal with the
issue that you're talking about how

592
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,480
there's stop forest fires.
That's theoretically part of the mandate

593
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,940
of the federal reserve,
which most people don't realize is a

594
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:37,030
private corporation owned by the banks
and not a government agency.

595
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,440
Yeah,
that's a tricky name.

596
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,060
Yeah.
Yes.

597
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,620
Federal reserve.
That has nothing to do with that.

598
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

599
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,200
It's kind of gross.
Yeah.

600
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,030
In fact,
I can't name say my pUblishing company

601
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:49,861
for the book,
the,

602
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,430
the,
the federal publIsher.

603
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,190
They won't allow me to put the word
federal in the name of my company as

604
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,390
they shouldn't.
Right.

605
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,970
But in order to create an organization
like that,

606
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:02,950
you need an act of congress.
In fact,

607
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:07,120
actually what you need as an act of
congress passed in the middle of the

608
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,560
night on a recess,
which is exactly how they passed the

609
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:12,370
federal reserve act in 1913.
It was a long ass time ago.

610
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,860
It's so ridiculous.
They keep that name,

611
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,350
but there is federal ammunition.
I should just say that you could buy

612
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,900
bullets.
Company called federal ammunition,

613
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:22,890
has nothing to do with the federal
government interest is to good good

614
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,490
company to buy bullets from.
[inaudible]

615
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,970
just seems like the.
The controlled burn idea.

616
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,480
How would you apply that to the economy?
I mean,

617
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,000
if what we're talking about,
raise the interest rates.

618
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,080
You raised them.
Yep.

619
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,080
It was.
Drains the drains.

620
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,660
The swamp.
Raised the interest rates.

621
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,360
Basically the interest rate controls the
cost of money.

622
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:51,361
If you make money more expensive than
those who borrow have to have a pretty

623
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:55,630
good rate of investment return on their
investment to invest that.

624
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,190
Right.
Otherwise they don't borrow money.

625
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,020
That's an extremely unpopular idea
though,

626
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,580
right?
So how do you get that across?

627
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,630
Well,
it's an.

628
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,630
It's an unpopular idea because it
benefits savers instead of debtors.

629
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,290
Right?
So if you,

630
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,090
if you have savings,
it's a great idea.

631
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,510
I remember a time when I could get a
certificate of deposit for my savings in

632
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:19,150
the bank and I could get three percent a
year,

633
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,730
three percent a year,
right?

634
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,650
I can't get point three percent now.
So savers get wIped out.

635
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,950
If you're a retiree who's got all of
their money in savings right now,

636
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,000
the return you're getting on those
savings isn't enough to cover your cost

637
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,150
of living.
So your money basically is shrinking and

638
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:40,610
that's a tax on savers that benefits

639
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,580
debtors,
especially very large debtors like the

640
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,260
federal government.
Yeah.

641
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:48,800
It's such a complicated system that for
the average person is working all day

642
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,780
and you know,
you get home,

643
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:54,320
you have hobbies and family and things
that you want to do.

644
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:59,120
It's very difficult to get a grip on
exactly how money works.

645
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,901
Yes,
it is,

646
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:00,590
and it's one of those,

647
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,400
the things I found through my
experiences doing these talks that I do,

648
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,990
and I talk about that in the book too,
that the whole point of this particular

649
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:13,400
book of the internet of money is why
bitcoin and I talk about the philosophy

650
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,071
behind money,
the,

651
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:17,750
the topics of money that most people
don't understand.

652
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,460
And what's really astonishing is that
here I am and I'm talking about the

653
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:28,340
greatest experiment in money.
Um,

654
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,890
started in 2008,
2009.

655
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,660
And this great experiment is completely
unprecedented in the history of money.

656
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,370
And I'm not talking about bitcoin.
I'm talking about 22 central banks

657
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:44,600
simultaneously taking their interest
rate to zero and pumping the largest

658
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,790
amounts of money ever created into the
world economy,

659
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,080
trying to stop it from collapsing.
And that has created the largest bubble

660
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:54,920
in history.
and the weird thing is that most people

661
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:59,150
are not even aware that they're living
in a time where we're doing this

662
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:01,640
completely unprecedented,
untested.

663
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,560
No one knows where it goes.
Huge monetary experiments in which 2

664
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,630
billion people are hostage as part of
it,

665
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,040
at least,
right,

666
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,100
and nobody knows where this is going to
go,

667
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,340
but most economists,
mainstream economists say,

668
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:20,000
this doesn't end well.
What does that mean though?

669
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,580
And then we have the other lifts,
monetary experiments,

670
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,414
which is,
hey,

671
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,500
money on the internet with a controlled
issuance,

672
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,260
only a certain amount of the money is
created.

673
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,540
It's controlled by a mathematical
formula.

674
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:36,320
You can't make more and as a result it's
got a stable

675
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,390
ply.
It sound money and it cannot be

676
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,700
manipulated by governments or banks
will.

677
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:47,680
It's so confusing for anyone as it is
when you get into the issue of what is

678
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:51,760
money and where's money coming from and
how does the federal reserve,

679
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:54,610
how does the government,
how does anybody create more money?

680
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:57,490
How do you print more money and if you
are printing more money,

681
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:59,800
where's it coming from and what is it?
Debt.

682
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,080
Right?
But what is it like?

683
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,220
What is it used to be gold.
It used to be the gold standard.

684
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:08,340
It used to be if you had a dollar,
a dollar's worth of gold,

685
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,320
it was a note that was worth a dollar's
worth of gold.

686
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,330
Yes.
That made sense.

687
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,193
And that stopped

688
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,540
first stopped in 1936,
I believe,

689
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,260
bretton woods agreement.
And then it stopped completely in 1971.

690
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,260
when nixon closed the gold window,
he basically said,

691
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,620
if anyone comes to your bank and gives
you one silver dollar,

692
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:30,440
a one gold dollar and says,
I want my silver,

693
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,760
you say no,
and basically defaulted on the backing

694
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,050
of us dollars.
Buy gold.

695
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,160
I met this wacky guy

696
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,710
a long time ago that was,
um,

697
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,870
he was coming around the comedy store's
this really odd guy for a bunch of

698
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,040
reasons.
Um,

699
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,960
but one of the things is he cArried a
gun everywhere he went and he believed

700
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,020
in.
He believed in precious gold coins that

701
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:02,151
were minted outside of the federal
government and using those as currency.

702
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,980
Yes.
And so he would have these coins that he

703
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:05,701
carried with him,
everything.

704
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,160
And we try to pay for things in these
coins,

705
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,950
like gold and silver coins,
mostly silver.

706
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,490
It's silver coins.
And he was trying to explain to me that

707
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:16,570
this is legal and that,
you know,

708
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,490
they're supposed to accept these.
And it was a very weird stuff.

709
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,810
It was a very,
very odd.

710
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,510
He was very annoying too because one of
the guys,

711
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:27,150
they like talk to you.
He kept touching you would talk to you

712
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,110
and like hold you.

713
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,450
And like,
like grab your arm and hold you and

714
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,710
touch you.
And all right fucker.

715
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,280
What are you here here?
A control freak.

716
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,770
A weird control freak.
You know,

717
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,260
if someone's saying something to you and
they are holding onto you while they're

718
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,240
saying that to you,
unless you're in love with them,

719
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,420
you know,
like you creates a very strange moment.

720
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,360
Why are you holdIng me?
Can I get loose here?

721
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,850
What if I have to run away real quick?
Do you have to break this grip?

722
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,300
But this guy used to carry these coins
around with them.

723
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,880
I can't fucking sack.
He likes to touch his money.

724
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,920
Elvis off commercials and shit like
that.

725
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,710
No man,
they were like some weird fucking coin

726
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,470
with like an american eagle on them.
Yeah.

727
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,430
This.
Yeah.

728
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,680
They're not weird,
they're minted in the u.

729
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:11,240
S full silver coins.
Now they're weirdest.

730
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,120
Fuck their weird if he tried to use them
to buy a coffee.

731
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,570
Although a lot of people buy these and
gold coins and small gold bars as

732
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,380
investments,
they keep them in a safe.

733
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Right?
And the idea is if there is a

734
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:29,561
significant crash in the car and seat,
then these have holding value,

735
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,360
right?
And it's not.

736
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,320
It's I think,
perfectly sane to say if you have some

737
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,200
money put aside in savings,
don't put it all in stocks.

738
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,390
Maybe diversify,
put a bit in precious metals,

739
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:45,530
maybe put a bit in digital currencies,
maybe put a bit in commodities and other

740
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:49,010
things that's kind of reasonable
investing.

741
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,370
And here's the thing,
a lot of the people who have these kinds

742
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:57,371
of attitudes come from families and from
cultures where there has been the time

743
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,850
in the past two generations where you
leave in the middle of the night with

744
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,880
all of your belongings in a pillowcase
and with people with guns and dogs after

745
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:08,720
you trying to murder you.

746
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,320
And this happens today in Syria,
right?

747
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,370
Um,
it happens one generation to go to my

748
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:20,000
parents' generation in,
in Greece with the nazis,

749
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:26,150
and it happens to the russian people.
It happens to people all over the world.

750
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,350
And when that happens,
and it's,

751
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,970
it's really close when it happens,
is generation before,

752
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,830
right?
Your parents tell you the stories.

753
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,860
It's a,
it's a different feeling.

754
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,070
It hasn't happened to most americans in
at least two or three generations.

755
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,920
But when that happens,
what do you put in the pillowcase?

756
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,840
And I'll tell you something,
the pieces of paper are worthless when

757
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,510
that happens.
And that's why some people do want to

758
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:54,100
have physical coin.
Now,

759
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:59,101
one of the things we've noticed now is
that digital currencies may start to

760
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,130
serve a role.
Uh,

761
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,500
the,
the fact is that you can memorize 12

762
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:09,400
english words and carry your entire
bitcoin wallets in your head.

763
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,340
And if you do that well,
you 12 english words.

764
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,120
What are those words?
Celsion party on?

765
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,103
Yeah.
So,

766
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,750
um,
you can generate a bitcoin wallet,

767
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,760
right?
And then make a backup of it.

768
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,880
And for convenience,
some of the inventors and the space

769
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,520
developed a system where you can back up
any bitcoin wallet,

770
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,800
even if it has millions and billions of
transactions and assets in it,

771
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,750
you can back it up to between 12 and 24
english words that are generated

772
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,790
automatically by the program.
So we can

773
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,360
be like that speech and pulp fiction
where Samuel Jackson pulls a gun on that

774
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:46,510
kid.
That could be your password.

775
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,040
Yes.
You don't pick the words though.

776
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,750
Oh,
you don't pick the words.

777
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,980
You're going to get a series of words
and they're going to be a,

778
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,050
you know,
asparagus,

779
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,610
forest,
a attorney,

780
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,600
whatever.
All.

781
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,090
I like dick's please.
Shit on my head.

782
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,660
Yeah.
No sentences and no words like that.

783
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,330
But think about the power of being able
to transport an unlimited amounts of

784
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:16,020
money simply by memorizing 12 words that
can't be confiscated from you when

785
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:16,710
you're a refugee.

786
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,600
It's amazing.
the whole,

787
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:21,660
uh,
the whole idea behind it is incredibly

788
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:25,020
fascinating to me.
And I've been a fan of it since the time

789
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,750
I met you.
And before that I was reasonably

790
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:31,080
interested in it.
But of course having you illuminated and

791
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:34,970
such a great way,
it really made it much more,

792
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,660
um,
much more enticing and much more

793
00:40:36,661 --> 00:40:41,661
interesting and I've always been,
I'm curious from that point on as to

794
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:43,680
where it's going to go.
And,

795
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:44,880
uh,
I just don't,

796
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,620
I don't know,
when I look at the landscape of money

797
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:53,730
and I look at the landscape of people
that are willing to make this leap.

798
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,170
I don't know what it would take to get
people fully onboard with bitcoin,

799
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,460
but I believe like you do that the
system that we have now,

800
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:06,270
the banking system is incredibly corrupt
and just bizarre

801
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,580
and fragile and fresh.
And I think that's the thing that most

802
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:12,670
people are missing.
It looks giant imposing.

803
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,700
It's been there for a century that is
not a sign of strength.

804
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,310
You find that the company in atlanta
that has this massive return on your

805
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:31,390
investment that's being investigated.
I'm not sure if I found the right guy

806
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,530
and I don't want to call them.
Okay,

807
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,364
I'll look.
I'll look again,

808
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,453
but

809
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,100
it's got to be a bunch of those people
out there that are doing that,

810
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,420
right?
Yeah,

811
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,330
absolutely.
The,

812
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,500
there's,
there's a lot of um,

813
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,440
a system like that which is,
which is very opaque,

814
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,310
which most people don't understand is
the kind of system you want to corrupt

815
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:52,100
because that's where you can make the
most money without anybody noticing.

816
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,993
And of course,
You know,

817
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,200
financial crime is not really prosecuted
in this country.

818
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,590
Um,
in 2008 giants crisis,

819
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,960
millions of homeowners kicked out of
their homes,

820
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:04,940
illegal foreclosures,
robo signing,

821
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:05,661
mills,
blah,

822
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:05,871
blah,
blah,

823
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,550
blah.
The only person who went to jail,

824
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,890
bernie madoff,
who stole from the rich,

825
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,560
uh,
pretty much everybody else,

826
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,410
scott free.
And that was pretty interesting.

827
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,270
It's almost like he was just a
scapegoat.

828
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,220
Well,
he was obviously a crook.

829
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,770
He was obviously,
he was obviously a crook,

830
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:26,771
but in sociopath or something,
surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and

831
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,980
hundreds of books in the same scale and
giant investment banks that are just as

832
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,920
corrupt and we don't see that right.

833
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,270
You,
you can get,

834
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,600
you can get pulled over for a busted
tail light and thrown in jail in plenty

835
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:46,700
of the states in this country for six
months for having an herb in your car.

836
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,950
And aT the same time you can put a
million people out of their homes

837
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,120
through straight up fraud with mountains
of evidence and emails and things like

838
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:57,470
that.
And they're untouchable.

839
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,600
That system,
the problem isn't the fact that there's

840
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,960
fraud.
The problem is that the system itself is

841
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:10,430
fragile because of that.
And if it was just them going out of

842
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:13,880
business,
when the fragile system has problems,

843
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,480
when it has hiccups as it did in 2008,
that's fine,

844
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,420
but it's not just them going out of
business.

845
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:24,680
It's a generation of kids who leave
college with nothing waiting for all of

846
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,240
them,
but a job.

847
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,880
Um,
and you know,

848
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,630
coming into a generation where their
parents could get by with one income and

849
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:40,871
a household and now three jobs each in a
household of two.

850
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,640
And you can't afford to buy a car,
let alone a house.

851
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:45,890
Right?
So we're part of the new sharing

852
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,600
economy.
And what is the sharing economy?

853
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,310
It's the,
I can tone anything because I can't

854
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:54,311
afford anything economy,
so that whole generation is now

855
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:59,720
suffering because of that fragility of
the system and the fragility hasn't gone

856
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,740
away,
but I don't want to dwell too much on

857
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,820
the negative,
right?

858
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:08,600
Because they're.
The thing that I find positive and

859
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:13,601
interesting about bitcoin is that it
serves a global society.

860
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,170
It is truly global traNsnational money.
There's plenty of places in the world

861
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:20,840
that have it worse than the u.
S there's some places that have it

862
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,640
better financiallY.
Um,

863
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,140
but it really is quite an incredible
concept to be able to have this money

864
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:32,141
that can operate on a global basis.
And with that the opportunities to a buy

865
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:40,131
and sell and trade and invest and borrow
internationally.

866
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,570
The fact that what we did with the
fundraising here to fundraise for those

867
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,560
wells,
right?

868
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,300
We don't know if that was just people in
the us donating.

869
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,850
It wasn't.
I can guarantee you there were people

870
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:58,110
from all over the world donating and
that's almost impossible to do with

871
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:02,250
traditional payment systems.
You could have sent that money directly

872
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:06,630
to where the wells were being built
again anywhere in the world,

873
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,420
and that's really exciting to me.

874
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,430
People are uncomfortable with bitcoin
because it represents changing one of

875
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:21,750
the fundamental ancient technologies of
civilization money and we've only

876
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:25,890
changed that technology four or five
times in the history of human

877
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:30,420
civilization.
We've gone from bare bones,

878
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:32,340
barter systems.
here's a goat,

879
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:37,341
give me three chickens,
right to systems of precious metals

880
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,870
and other nice objects,
feathers,

881
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,960
shells,
etc. To excluSively precious metals to a

882
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:48,360
precious metal stamped with the faces of
kings,

883
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,150
and then at some point around the 15th
century,

884
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,200
you start seeing certificates of deposit
for,

885
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:02,010
for precious metal being exchanged.
Paper notes that I have a deposit of

886
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,840
gold there.
I'm not going to move the gold from my

887
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:06,300
deposit to your deposit.
They'll just give you the piece of paper

888
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:11,301
that says you're now the owner and paper
money is introduced and then plastic in

889
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:14,460
the 19 fifties,
a diner's club,

890
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,600
a traveler's checks and the first credit
cards,

891
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,540
and if you think any of these
transitions were smooth,

892
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,430
none of them were smooth.

893
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,910
You go to someone who's been using
precious metals for 10 generations and

894
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:27,744
you say,
hey,

895
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,120
this piece of paper is money.
They're like,

896
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,990
give me something shiny that I can bite.
That's money that this paper,

897
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,660
I don't know who you are.
Go away.

898
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,640
How long has that transitioned?
For?

899
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:45,550
A hundred years,
right?

900
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,920
Until broad acceptance of paper money
for 100 years with huge resistance.

901
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,430
It took almost 40 years for credit cards
to go mainstream.

902
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,300
With bitcoin,
we're going to do it probably in less

903
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,890
than 20.
You think so,

904
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:01,650
but it was almost 10.
It's seven.

905
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,580
Seven,
yeah,

906
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,670
and it's accelerating very much.
I think in some countries you're going

907
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:10,671
to see either bitcoin or cryptocurrency
very similar or based on bitcoin be used

908
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,150
as commonly as a national currency.
We're not looking to displace national

909
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,590
currencies.
We're looking to supplement them.

910
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,480
I think the idea being that people will
get comfortable using multiple

911
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,360
currencies just like many places they
are.

912
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,100
If you're,
you know,

913
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,880
between the border of Kenya and Tanzania
for example,

914
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,270
you're probably going to use for
different currencies,

915
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,080
kenyan money,
Tanzania in us dollars and euros easily.

916
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:45,280
Possibly also south african rand,
so you've got four or five currencies,

917
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,540
you can stop at a four year old in the
streets and ask them what the exchange

918
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:53,740
rate is and they'll tell you right,
because they trade for their parents and

919
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,000
merchant stalls along the border and
they have people come in with all kinds

920
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,970
of different currencies.
It's not that difficult to assume that

921
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:02,890
there's digital currencies in that
future,

922
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:08,070
either there or in a major modern
metropolis Where people are using

923
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,310
bitcoin to transact online to buy
things,

924
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,310
virtual things,
a music video,

925
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,950
things like that.
What you want to make very,

926
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:22,540
very small payments with credit cards
and not suitable and use bitcoin as well

927
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,520
as their normal currencies.

928
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,950
What is the progress it makes you so
optimistic?

929
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,890
Like what is the.
If you could point to any one thing or

930
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:33,100
several things that make you optimistic
about bitcoin's future?

931
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,880
Well,
I think watching it as,

932
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,070
as a computer scientist,
as a technologist,

933
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:44,190
I look at this and I see innovation that
is accelerating and I see much of the

934
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:50,491
early vision opening up the possibility
of doing things that are so far outside.

935
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:55,210
What we could do with traditional money,
um,

936
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,700
that it,
it often blows my mind,

937
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,600
for example,
I'm a technology that's being introduced

938
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,700
into bitcoin now is called payment
channels.

939
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,600
And what it allows you to do is to do a
very high volume of small transactions

940
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,580
at a very rapid rate.
Let's say your,

941
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,010
you want to watch a video and you want
to pay the owner of that video to send

942
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:21,844
it to you.

943
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,770
Um,
how about paying by the second.

944
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,760
And so you say you set up basically an
account and you pay by every second of

945
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,470
video,
maybe every fifth of a second,

946
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,570
200 milliseconds of video at a time and
you're paying a fraction that is a

947
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:42,571
thousandth of a penny and you keep
watching video and paying a thousandth

948
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:47,710
of a penny for every fifth of a second
on this drip metered basis.

949
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:48,820
Well,
you're not doing it.

950
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,410
You're a computer.
Software is doing it,

951
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,750
communicating with our computer
software.

952
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:56,260
And now you can do this really
incredible thing.

953
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:58,960
You can pay for content what it's
actually worth.

954
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,840
Um,
whereas the thresholds for a payment on

955
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:05,080
a credit card is two to $3,
unless you're apple and you're doing

956
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:06,550
billions,
in which case you can take it down to

957
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:09,130
ninety nine cents.
That's about the lowest you can go.

958
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,460
So meaning watching something on youtube
or some similar video streaming device,

959
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:17,550
you would have to pay service rather.

960
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,110
You'd have to pay,
but you would pay a very minuscule

961
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:20,944
amount.
Yes.

962
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,200
Like what?
Like whAt are you talking about a couple

963
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:24,690
of cents like to watch?
No,

964
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,150
I'm,
I literally mean a of 500th of a cent to

965
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,550
watch a video.
Well it depends how long the video is,

966
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,480
but you could,
you could.

967
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,770
Yeah.
it could be a scale.

968
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:35,090
You could pay a penny.
Yeah.

969
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,230
You could pay a penny or half a penny or
a 10th of a penny to watch a video.

970
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,110
But what,
how would that work for the people that

971
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:46,380
are providing content like.
Well you see the thing is they operate

972
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:51,381
at a scale.
I have 30,000 views on one of my videos,

973
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:55,610
right?
So youtube pays me 30 bucks for that.

974
00:50:55,611 --> 00:51:00,611
If I put ads in front,
if I was getting a penny from each of my

975
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,440
customers or because these are like hour
long videos,

976
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,470
maybe I'm going to charge more baby.
I'm going to charge twenty five cents.

977
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,460
Know 30,000 views.
Twenty five cents.

978
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,630
Somebody do the math please.
Uh,

979
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,060
not good at math.
Seven grand?

980
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,290
No,
it's like 70 bucks.

981
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,370
$70.

982
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,380
Twenty five cents as a quarter of a
dollar.

983
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,640
No,
it's 7,000.

984
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,474
You're right.
Yeah,

985
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,343
yeah.
Yeah.

986
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,000
So it's a rare time where I'm writing
the math fucking quick question like

987
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:34,470
that.
So maybe I'm going to charge less maybe,

988
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,550
but in any case I can beat what youtube
gives me in terms of ad revenue with

989
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,770
each customer paying a fraction
of a penny.

990
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,970
And here's the real question,
but I get this content for free right

991
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:50,720
now.
Interest.

992
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,110
Why would I pay a fraction of a penny?
You don't get it for free.

993
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,250
You're paying,
you're paying in.

994
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,880
Yes.
In micro violations of your privacy.

995
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,740
What's your.
If the product costs less than two or

996
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:07,200
$3,
making the stank face now if agreeing

997
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,480
with you.
But that was a weird way to word it.

998
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,490
Yeah.
If it'll get another cord,

999
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,070
if,
if the payment is worth less than two or

1000
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,610
$3,
right?

1001
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,200
Which means they can't collect it with a
credit card.

1002
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,020
What they're doing is they're selling
your data to advertisers.

1003
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,440
There are selling your identity,
your demographics,

1004
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,960
your data to advertise a series here
you're getting.

1005
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,280
You're having to give up things you
don't give them up at that moment.

1006
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:36,140
You've given them a previously when you
registered for the thing and verified

1007
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:41,141
your email and then verified your age
and your gender and provided all of this

1008
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:46,070
demographic information which they then
parcel often and gives to the

1009
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:49,100
advertisers,
But you're still paying for the content.

1010
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:54,101
What you're paying by the fact that you
can no longer engage with the web

1011
00:52:55,311 --> 00:53:00,311
without it being filtered to what they
think you want and who they think you

1012
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:01,304
are.
Right?

1013
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,900
So you're getting this highly filtered
pigeonholed view of content,

1014
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,030
and they do that using your information
to present what they think you would

1015
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:13,790
like to watch based on what they've sold
to the advertisers.

1016
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,130
You're no longer a customer,
you're the product,

1017
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:22,250
the customer is the advertising agency.
Whereas if you sell content directly,

1018
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,010
you reestablish the relationship of who
is the creator

1019
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,610
and who is the customer,
the consumer of this content,

1020
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,100
and you cut out the middleman.
Yeah,

1021
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,650
but you're cutting out advertising.
Good luck.

1022
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,880
And also the other thing is like people
don't want to pay even if it's a

1023
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,070
fraction of a penny,
they just don't want to pay.

1024
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,830
I disagree.
Do you think if people.

1025
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,820
There's a lot of dopes at watch youtube
all day,

1026
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,960
like they sit in front of the coMputer,
they slack jaw from morning to night and

1027
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:51,870
they just watch youtube videos.
If they just calculated those fractions

1028
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,730
of a penny all day,
that would be dollars and dollars every

1029
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,900
day,
which would mean hundreds of dollars

1030
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,280
every few months or.
Well,

1031
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,840
you got to think about this as a broader
economy because a lot of these people

1032
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:07,320
could also earn a bath by making a a
good comment,

1033
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,090
which actually ends up covering some of
our costs of viewing.

1034
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,240
So you've got to think about.

1035
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,330
You can earn from comments.
Yeah.

1036
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:17,330
That's where it gets really interesting.
Blockchain,

1037
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:18,870
all this that you're talking about.
No,

1038
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,180
you could do this with bitcoin.
You could do this with blockchain.

1039
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,040
What is the difference between
blockchain and bitcoin?

1040
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,460
Sorry to hijack that.
No,

1041
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,970
no problem.
Um,

1042
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,610
so blockchain is one of the technologies
used in bitcoin.

1043
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,170
IT's a distributed database where all oF
the transactions are linked together

1044
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,790
using cryptographic proofs.
Um,

1045
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,210
bitcoin is one implementation of a
blockchain.

1046
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,940
And blockchain has now been used as a
maRketing term.

1047
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,570
That means very little.
It's kind of like web to datto.

1048
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,400
We don't really know what it is.
Right?

1049
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,270
It's a lot of datto yet.
Yeah.

1050
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,500
Which is blockchain.
Oh,

1051
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,393
okay.

1052
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,010
That's ironic,
isn't.

1053
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:56,760
It?
Is.

1054
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,320
Yeah.
And it's nebulous.

1055
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,590
Um,
but the point is that you can do more

1056
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,170
than just currency.
Um,

1057
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,790
earlier we were talking a bit about a
trolling on twitter and other platforms

1058
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,950
like that before we started the live
broadcast.

1059
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,620
Well,
think about what a troll is doing.

1060
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,630
What they're doing is they're stealing
attention.

1061
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,540
They're taking attention without
contributing anything back to the

1062
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,590
community.
Uh,

1063
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:24,850
there's an interesting and fairly
effective market solution to this,

1064
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,460
which is instead of assigning someone to
do oversight and decide who is and who

1065
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:34,140
isn't a troll and censor them,
you basically allow people to contribute

1066
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,280
again,
a minuscule fraction for the comments

1067
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:41,490
they like.
They are power like thumbs up.

1068
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,680
But with each one of those likes and
thumbs up,

1069
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:47,620
you attach a 10000th of a penny with it,
you know,

1070
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,990
irrelevant,
small,

1071
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,300
tiny money.
Um,

1072
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:56,280
and then the people who write comments
that are broadly appreciated,

1073
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:58,470
that add value to the community or in a
tiny bit of money,

1074
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,980
not really anything serious,
but if they tried to come and they have

1075
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:05,190
to spend a bit of that credit that
they've earned that reputation that

1076
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,024
they've earned.

1077
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,210
And if they're not a troll,
it doesn't.

1078
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,930
It all comes out equal in the wash.
They don't end up spending anything.

1079
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,570
They don't end up hurting anything.
It's just participation in the

1080
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,950
community.
But if they're a troll is suddenly

1081
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:20,490
starts getting interesting because now
it gets expensive to steal the attention

1082
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,950
to the community because the less you
have

1083
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,450
positive feedback,
the more expensive it gets for you to

1084
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,430
post until eventually you're priced out.
BuT does that also,

1085
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:36,250
they're also can kind of enforce or or
encourage confirmation bias because if

1086
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:41,200
you go to a website that's just
completely ridiculous and it's a message

1087
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:44,050
board filled with morons and you argue
with them,

1088
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:48,020
it could cost you to argue with morons
[inaudible] they're going to downhill

1089
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:48,440
you.

1090
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,340
Yeah,
yeah.

1091
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:53,180
It could just choose to not comment,
but you,

1092
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:57,440
you've got to think about this again,
across a broader economy with a broader

1093
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:01,190
set of forums in which in some you are
valued experts in other.

1094
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:05,180
You're the idiot who's arguing against
the conventional wisdom and,

1095
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,300
and you know,
you can actually balance these things

1096
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:08,670
out.

1097
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,660
Well if you go to a flat earth forum and
argue with those people and it costs you

1098
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:13,360
money.

1099
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,010
Yes.
I had an argument with someone about

1100
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,230
chem trails.
How did thAt go?

1101
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,710
It went really went very,
very interestingly.

1102
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:23,380
I wasn't expecting them to change their
mind,

1103
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,980
um,
and they really wanted to hear my

1104
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:30,520
opinion and it was really interesting
because we started the conversation.

1105
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:31,600
I said,
okay,

1106
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,490
first I'm a pilot,
I have a pilot's license,

1107
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,660
I fly small planes.
that puts you at an extreme advantage.

1108
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,980
Yes.
This conversation will you think you

1109
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:46,610
would think that it's.
I mean,

1110
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,710
it's,
it's not,

1111
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,960
it's not appeal to authority,
right?

1112
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,260
It's saying those nozzles that you're
pointing at,

1113
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,940
I know what those are.
I have to,

1114
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,300
I have to walk around the plane before I
take off and make sure all of them have

1115
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:04,450
correctly attached into the place they
should be doing the things they should

1116
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:07,270
be doing.
Otherwise I don't survive the flight.

1117
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,650
So you are a part of the chem trail
sprayers,

1118
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,910
association of America,

1119
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,380
what you're saying?
Yes.

1120
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,210
So that was pretty much the conclusIon
we reached.

1121
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,820
What are those nozzles?
I'm actually in the,

1122
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:22,180
in the,
in the ones pointing forward are called

1123
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:26,380
peto tubes and they're used to measure
the velocity of the aircraft through the

1124
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,790
air by a pressure differential.
And the ones pointing backwards are

1125
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:35,480
usually to break up of fortresses,
these little swirly current severity

1126
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:37,690
that come off the wing,
the cause turbulence,

1127
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,330
and you want to break those up so they
don't swirl.

1128
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:45,070
Um,
by the weight of the trails are clouds.

1129
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,890
How long have you been a shell with a
water?

1130
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,370
The government.
Indeed,

1131
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,380
of course.
I'm michelle.

1132
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,670
I'm michelle for.
Can't believe one of the things I'm

1133
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,200
interested in.
Shut it off jamie.

1134
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,500
Yeah.
I've had these conversations with people

1135
00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:00,010
and frustrating you can present
mountains of evidence if someone really,

1136
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:04,420
really doesn't want to believe they,
they really will not belief.

1137
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,693
There's also,

1138
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:09,610
I mean,
it's been going on forever.

1139
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,810
I mean if you go back to the 19 forties,
there's pictures black and White photos

1140
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:18,100
from world war one or world war two
rather where you can see planes leaving

1141
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:21,650
behind these enormous trails.
So it's a stupid argument.

1142
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,790
I mean,
it really is.

1143
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,280
I mean,
we've known for a long time that

1144
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,680
depending upon how much moisture is in
the atmosphere,

1145
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,560
when planes pass through it,
they will create clouds.

1146
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,100
And it's just real simple changes the
temperature of the air.

1147
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,710
And it creates clouds and it's usually
on hazy days.

1148
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,760
Not only that,
but nasa has a website where you can go

1149
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:43,400
to it and it will accurately predict
contrary.

1150
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:43,770
I was like,
ooo,

1151
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:47,690
that that is,
those are from propeller engines in the

1152
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:50,690
19 forties.
And what's happening is the propeller is

1153
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,930
compressing the air and when it
compresses the air of the change in

1154
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:58,931
pressure changes the dewpoint and the
dewpoint is what determines whether the

1155
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
error moisture consensus into a visible
vapor into droplets that are clouds.

1156
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,040
And so by pushing a thing through the
air,

1157
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,850
you're pressing on the air and when you
press on the air is that causes

1158
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:17,390
condensation to form.
And that conversation follows you in a

1159
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,280
circle,
a cloud behind the plane.

1160
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,260
And this happens at any plane propeller
plane that I,

1161
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,880
I've done it in a,
in a four seater cessna that's smaller

1162
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:28,400
than a than a fiat sedan,
right?

1163
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,230
And on a,
on a,

1164
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,750
on a wet day,
you can see little trails coming off the

1165
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:39,530
tips of the wings.
and I pretty short and put any spray

1166
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,660
nozzles there or flip this.
I didn't,

1167
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,990
I saw this,
which it said chem trail them and I

1168
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:46,460
didn't flip it.
I didn't,

1169
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:51,560
you don't how much liquid you would have
to have in your plane in order to spray

1170
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,470
these enormous jets across the sky.
I mean,

1171
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:55,760
it would be insane.

1172
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,240
It would be insane.
I mean if the entire plane was filled

1173
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:02,210
up,
I mean filled and you would have so much

1174
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:05,540
liquid that it will be visible from the
ground floating in space.

1175
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,950
And then he talked to people,
you know,

1176
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:10,190
I did that television show on scifi
called joe rogan questions,

1177
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,950
everything.
And one of the things that I questioned

1178
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,960
was chem trails.
So I talked to a bunch of temp trill,

1179
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,680
air quote experts,
and one of these guys had this study

1180
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:25,871
that he had done on water and the
standing water study was proving that

1181
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,260
the spraying and the air was making
aluminum.

1182
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,830
Uh,
it was putting aluminum in the water and

1183
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:37,730
the water supply.
And so he had this water tested.

1184
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,650
And so I,
he showed me the test.

1185
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:40,610
I'm going over the test.
I go,

1186
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,810
well,
it says sludge.

1187
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:43,310
And he goes,
well,

1188
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,330
it was water.

1189
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:45,350
I gave them water,
I go,

1190
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:49,130
okay,
but it set sludge like the laboratory

1191
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:53,450
that you sent this stuff to says sludge
and he and he was like,

1192
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:54,980
well,
what is exactly sludge?

1193
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,090
What's the definition?
I'm like,

1194
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,020
well,
let's google it.

1195
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,040
So we googled sludge and with sledges is
water mixed with dirt.

1196
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,091
So I said,
okay,

1197
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:06,290
so your water mixed with dirt contains
aluminum.

1198
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,010
Do you know how much aluminum there is
in dirt?

1199
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:15,530
Because it's the exact amount that they
tested when they tested the world.

1200
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,600
The water that you had with dirt.
So what happened is your dirt tested

1201
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:25,881
positive for being dirt and you're using
that as proof that the government is

1202
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:32,091
spraying the skies above everybody's
head and you want to talk about like a

1203
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:37,370
piss poor cost ineffective shitbag
program that does absolutely nothing.

1204
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,820
Chem trails would be it because it's not
doing anything like no one's getting

1205
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:42,490
sick.

1206
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:47,190
There's no lake rise in illnesses.
There's no like mind control going on.

1207
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,370
There's nothing.
There is no mind control going on.

1208
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,230
There is no mind control going on.
There Is no mind controlling.

1209
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:58,110
I mean it's the dumbest fucking thing.
It can be easier to just put it in your

1210
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,560
municipal water supply.
Yeah.

1211
01:02:59,561 --> 01:03:01,630
Well I mean as arguments that are doing
that too.

1212
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,281
It's.
Well,

1213
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:05,910
of course,
of course they move it with the planes

1214
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,030
to the spraying.
It drops.

1215
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,820
It falls in the water supply.
And then you drank something like that.

1216
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,713
Anyway.
Yes,

1217
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,800
themselves too,
by the way.

1218
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,630
But they're immune to it because there
are lizards,

1219
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,440
you know they're down here too.
So you spray the sky indiscriminately.

1220
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,260
I guarantee you some illuminati or
getting sprayed.

1221
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,880
I'm going to get some hate mail for
this.

1222
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:24,780
I know it well.
Yeah,

1223
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:25,920
for sure.
We're getting it right now.

1224
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,820
People are wiping the cheetos off.
They're greasy little fat fucking

1225
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,010
fingers right now in hammering at the
keyboards.

1226
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,890
Ready to call a shills.
It's the dumbest.

1227
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,210
It's what?
There's a guy who runs,

1228
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,580
um,
what is the website?

1229
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,680
Metta bunk.
[inaudible] dot com.

1230
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,830
What is his name?
Anyway?

1231
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,060
He,
uh,

1232
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,990
he calls it the training wheels for
conspiracy theorist because it's above

1233
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,060
your head.
Are you seeing it all the time?

1234
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:55,590
You're like,
what is going on up there?

1235
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,710
Why does that look very cloud?
Like what is that when you started

1236
01:03:58,711 --> 01:03:59,341
thinking,
man,

1237
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,990
the government's doing something
secretly.

1238
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,180
Yes.
Mapquest.

1239
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,180
Thank you.
Oh,

1240
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,670
metta bunk debunked.
Look,

1241
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:08,220
mic west is a shill.
He's a shill.

1242
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:09,180
Debunk,
debunk,

1243
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:10,350
debunk,
debunk,

1244
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:13,890
debunk it,
but he got death threats and hate mail

1245
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,900
when he came on that tv show with me.
Woo.

1246
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,430
Yeah,
no,

1247
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:18,480
this is the guy.
Yeah.

1248
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,910
This is.
How does this hedge fund manager makes

1249
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:21,630
so much money?

1250
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,660
Look at them.
Just look at him.

1251
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,040
Sweating
will get is.

1252
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,240
Look at this annual returns of 30
percent,

1253
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,740
24 percent,
or even 91 percent since 2013.

1254
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,510
Telling anybody how it's done.
Just a computer program.

1255
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,880
You have to pay for a decade upfront and
if you leave,

1256
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:41,730
he gets half the principal.
Oh gee.

1257
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:46,110
I wonder how it works.
Jesus fucking christ you crook clients.

1258
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,260
Hold on a second.
Lose clients aren't sure how it's done.

1259
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:52,710
And joseph a myer junior,
the man behind the obscure hedge fund,

1260
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,790
our our june lp is keeping his cards
close.

1261
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,890
Oh,
jesus christ.

1262
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,970
Invest most of his client's money and
safe treasury bonds.

1263
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,410
Yeah,
it's safe as fuck.

1264
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:06,090
If you can't take your money out for 10
years,

1265
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:07,650
you know,
everybody in there can't take their

1266
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:09,900
money out for 10 years.
That's insanity.

1267
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,620
That's insane that that's kind of like.
I mean,

1268
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,270
you don't know this guy,
but look at that.

1269
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,010
What's that?
What is that?

1270
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,000
All right.
I don't

1271
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,833
know.
I mean,

1272
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,660
if you had to guess,
if I had to guess,

1273
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:24,130
I'm going to give you two options.
Yeah.

1274
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,920
legit or scam.
Yes.

1275
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,040
Um,
I don't know.

1276
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,950
I would say it is most likely a ponzi
scheme,

1277
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:39,070
which is outrageous.
Something people throw around a lot.

1278
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,790
But here's the interesting thing is why
do these schemes happen?

1279
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,580
Right?
what do you look at his offer?

1280
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,270
He offers an extraordinary guarantee
with our june.

1281
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,660
You never lose money.
Well,

1282
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,573
first of all,
what kind of names?

1283
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,710
I think that's actually part of the
definition of investment fraud is

1284
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:58,670
guaranteed returns.
So if you make a guarantee like that,

1285
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,210
it's usually one of the triggers that
gets people investigated.

1286
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,480
He doesn't,
but you never lose money.

1287
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,790
Yeah.
That's a great investment.

1288
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,620
That's fantastic.
Investment should get involved.

1289
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,920
Maybe put some bitcoin in that and to
solidify it.

1290
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,330
Yeah,
okay,

1291
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,890
I'm going to do the opposite.
If you invest your money in bitcoin,

1292
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,660
you will lose money.
Whoa.

1293
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,030
You will.
You will gain money.

1294
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,800
You will lose money,
you will gain money,

1295
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:25,210
you will lose.
We don't know.

1296
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:29,110
That's no one is an.
And I want to be really careful about

1297
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:34,111
this because many people go out and they
push these things as investments and you

1298
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,790
can have a lot of volatility and
sometimes when you have a lot of

1299
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,800
policies,
some people get lucky and they make a

1300
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:45,970
lot of money and some people are great
at picking their moment and they make

1301
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:46,520
some money

1302
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,020
bail out.
They make a ton of money.

1303
01:06:48,021 --> 01:06:51,200
Like right now we're at 600 bucks.
If you bought it back when it was like,

1304
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,520
what was it?
The lowest point,

1305
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,980
uh,
the lowest,

1306
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:56,330
lowest point,
lowest lowest,

1307
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,640
uh,
about a thousandth of a dollar,

1308
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,560
uh,
thousands of a dollar to two to $600.

1309
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:03,530
He says,
yeah,

1310
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:04,140
you could.

1311
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,190
Yeah.
So I mean if you put in like a fucking

1312
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,830
big pile of money,
yes,

1313
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,500
five grand and he took it out the wrong
moment,

1314
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,440
you would lose all of it.
And this is why this isn't,

1315
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,290
this isn't a speculative instruments.
People can speculate in it,

1316
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,220
isn't it?

1317
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,710
It isn't.
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

1318
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:28,420
but isn't the well kind of poisoned the
financial well with speculative

1319
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,850
investing like what,
what people are doing,

1320
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,500
it seems like it shouldn't be legal and
what's really fucked up about it is that

1321
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,480
they're doing it with algorithms and
they're,

1322
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:40,030
they're gambling and they're,
they're,

1323
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:45,130
they're buying and selling within like a
fraction of a second and they're doing

1324
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:49,240
it in the point where there was a
radiolab podcast where they talked about

1325
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:52,180
how investment firms.
Did you see that one or listen to that

1326
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:53,200
one.
I have heard that one yet.

1327
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:58,260
We're investment firms moved their
servers closer to the exchange so that

1328
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:04,240
you get in there their orders and their
exchanges quicker.

1329
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:04,490
There

1330
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,530
is small on New Jersey where the data
centers of the.

1331
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,800
None of the stock trading happens in
manhattan.

1332
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:14,070
It happens across the water in New
Jersey as a data center.

1333
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:19,071
There were probably largest amount of
money moves ever and they have measured

1334
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,610
runs of fiber,
meaning that in order to be fair,

1335
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,420
the fiber optic cable between the
service that do the trading and every

1336
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:30,800
one of the racks that are in the room
are measured to be the equal length so

1337
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:35,801
that the speed of light to limitation
across a room of a hundred feet does not

1338
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,950
advantage one customer over another.
Isn't that incredible?

1339
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,900
We're talking microseconds,
right?

1340
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,080
Yeah.

1341
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,531
Yeah.
Well,

1342
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:48,531
people have been forced because of this,
to move their offices from the middle of

1343
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:54,171
the country where they were to right
there or rent space where their servers

1344
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:56,250
are right there.
It's really.

1345
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:00,210
It's so bizarre because a lot of this
stuff is actually done with computers,

1346
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,340
so these computers are operating on an
algorithm.

1347
01:09:02,341 --> 01:09:06,450
The algorithms recognize patterns.
They start these exchanges and they buy

1348
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:10,410
and sell and buy and sell and buy and
sell and do all of this within fractions

1349
01:09:10,411 --> 01:09:11,030
of a second.

1350
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,140
Yeah.
Over the last decade,

1351
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:15,320
most trading floors have seen 90 percent
of their traders disappear.

1352
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:18,530
So they're empty rooms,
you can see photos all that to align

1353
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,680
where it shows before and after photos
of very big banks like ubs and jp

1354
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,370
morgan,
goldman sachs,

1355
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,370
companies like that.
So you see their trading Floor and it is

1356
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:33,320
empty because a lot of that has now
moved to algorithmic trading.

1357
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:35,720
So strange.
What a weird,

1358
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:38,290
weird way to invest in bias.
Thank you.

1359
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,690
Oh my god.
That's the before and after and it's not

1360
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,250
because they're making less money.
Right.

1361
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,680
This is not.
This is not a downturn.

1362
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,780
This during this time they've actually
made more money,

1363
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,940
but there's something about those stock
exchange videos that were in movies,

1364
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,880
you know by,
by sal,

1365
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:57,920
sal and they've got their hands up and
there I want to have these and five of

1366
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:01,250
these and they're holding up pieces of
paper that is so daunting.

1367
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:06,020
All that stuff is so confusing to a
person on the outside looking at that

1368
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:08,150
and trying to figure out what the fuck
those people are doing.

1369
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:13,710
Like it seems exciting and chaotic and
vibrant but so confusing.

1370
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,350
Right.
But that is.

1371
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,420
That is the american economy right now.
Essentially it's based on confidence all

1372
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,430
that's happening.
Yeah.

1373
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:27,090
So
should we talk about a slightly

1374
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:28,440
different topic?
Sure.

1375
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:31,440
Whatever you want.
I want to tell you about some of the new

1376
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:33,120
developments that are happening in
bitcoin,

1377
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:37,740
which I find interesting and I'm not
going to show because this is not really

1378
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:41,820
about a company or a specific product,
but I want to talk about one of the

1379
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:45,210
things that has me excited,
which is a,

1380
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,690
um,
what happens when you combine a

1381
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:54,020
technology that looks very much like
peer to peer napster or bit torrens with

1382
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,840
a merchant service like [inaudible] bay
and you create this hybrid technology

1383
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:03,260
which is a completely peer to peer,
um,

1384
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:07,500
store service called open bazaar.
And,

1385
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:12,570
and this is basically a system where you
run on your computer some software and

1386
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,640
you can open a store to delivery the
physical goods or virtual goods,

1387
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,520
have them listed,
have them found by others,

1388
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,580
and then all of the payments are done in
bitcoin.

1389
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,820
So by decentralizing the payment system,
we can also decentralize the store

1390
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:38,781
system completely.
And it is a completely borderless

1391
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,520
multinational,
uh,

1392
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,640
open and peer to peer open source
software merchant system running on top

1393
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:52,440
of bitcoin,
which I just find fascinating.

1394
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,830
The ability for anyone to open a store,
especially in countries where you don't

1395
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:56,940
have ebay.
Right.

1396
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,490
And be able to sell goods and services
anywhere in the world and receive

1397
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:05,970
payments in bitcoin.
And does this operational right now?

1398
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,400
Yup.
And I'm selling that book,

1399
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,380
uh,
on open bazaar.

1400
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,260
So how does one access openbazaar to
the,

1401
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,030
to the luddite?
They run software,

1402
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,100
no fees,
no restriction.

1403
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:24,580
And they downloads the software,
run it on their computer funds a bit

1404
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,060
bitcoin wallet and which sits on their
computer.

1405
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:28,590
They don't have to give their money.
Twenty one.

1406
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:32,520
There was no intermediaries.
And you buy directly from the store and

1407
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:35,610
the person running the store is running
the same software.

1408
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,050
Well,
let's see what some of the things that

1409
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:39,690
they have available.
We went to openbazaar.org.

1410
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,060
I have to download the program so to
find another way to look at it.

1411
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:42,750
Oh,
okay.

1412
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,860
Yeah.
If you go to,

1413
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:45,680
um,
do.

1414
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:50,460
Oh,
search is a search engine on top d u o s

1415
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,450
e a r c h.
So duo search.

1416
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:58,140
Yeah.
So because this is an open protocol and

1417
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:00,780
because all of the listings are in a
peer to peer network,

1418
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,650
you can just go online and run a search
engine and create a search engine that

1419
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:06,740
searches the store.
Wow.

1420
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:10,650
This is the third party that just has a
search engine for searching the store.

1421
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:15,651
So you can um,
you can search online there and tell him

1422
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:20,620
what you're looking for and find
something from tee shirts to gary and

1423
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,570
find my bank.
Okay.

1424
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:24,180
But no,
that's not what I want to buy a flip

1425
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,043
phone.

1426
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,630
Go back there.
You can get a phone for ari.

1427
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,140
What's going on there?
A lot of these darks are going to flip

1428
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:34,710
phones now.
20 bucks for a cryo.

1429
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:39,711
Sarah or that's an lg lg 44 damn
bargain.

1430
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,780
Have you ever thought about going flip
phone?

1431
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:44,663
me?
Yeah.

1432
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,340
no,
I'm,

1433
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:50,640
I'm in the opposite category.
I haven't actually received a phone call

1434
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:55,440
on my phone probably in three years and
I don't have a phone I had out of here.

1435
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:00,060
I have a portable computer which also
has a phone function on it that I keep

1436
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,250
switched off.
You keep it off pretty much.

1437
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,780
Yeah.
It doesn't bring ever.

1438
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,500
It doesn't every text you um,
but people text you.

1439
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,330
Um,
yes,

1440
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,070
but that actually gets redirected to my
email.

1441
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,290
So I don't do texts.

1442
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,000
I,
I,

1443
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,830
I do it through either hangouts or
email.

1444
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,110
So when I send you a text,
it doesn't really appeal to you as a

1445
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:17,890
text?
No,

1446
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:21,450
it comes through to a google hangouts.
You are one of the weirdest guy.

1447
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,770
I know.
I use it as a portable computer.

1448
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:27,970
It's my communicator device.
The phone function is irrelevant to me.

1449
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,770
Well,
don't You ever want to talk to people?

1450
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,730
Don't you go,
hey man,

1451
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,510
how you doing?
Um,

1452
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,870
I do video talks most of the time.
I know.

1453
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:35,950
I'm worried.
OkaY.

1454
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,180
Uh,
when I talk to people,

1455
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,910
it's on where they're selling cbd oil,
cbd oil,

1456
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:41,770
organic,
pure,

1457
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:43,310
raw,
natural cbdc.

1458
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,930
That is where the god damned
government's going to come in and close

1459
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,940
this whole thing down.
What do you guys do?

1460
01:14:48,941 --> 01:14:51,130
And mitigating pain.
You pieces oF shit.

1461
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,710
We're going to come in with dogs and
bite you.

1462
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,340
Yeah.
They're probably actually only selling

1463
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:01,930
that's within oRegon within a
jurisdiction where it's legal,

1464
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,400
right?
Because they can sell it within that

1465
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:07,290
jurisdiction from that jurisdiction and
it's perfectly legal in Colorado.

1466
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,540
It's growing and getting insides.
It's funny,

1467
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,640
we're talking about how weird you are.
He showed up.

1468
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,400
Uh,
andrews has a apple laptop and I was

1469
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:17,860
like,
how dare you walk in here with an apple

1470
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:20,140
product?
I expect you to have some linux box.

1471
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,650
And of course he's running linux on his
apple compuTer.

1472
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:27,460
Well,
I'm also running linux.

1473
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,020
I'm running a bunch of things,
but yeah,

1474
01:15:29,021 --> 01:15:30,880
it's a beautiful piece of hardware.
I like it.

1475
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,280
That doesn't mean that like everything
else the company does or will,

1476
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,130
you just don't like the restrictive
aspects of it.

1477
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:37,271
Yeah.
Yeah.

1478
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:38,380
You're all android,
right?

1479
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,670
Yes,
I am on my.

1480
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,990
What are you using now?
Which I have a nexus five.

1481
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,611
Oh,
that's okay.

1482
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:49,090
So this is the newest and the latest
greatest of the google phones.

1483
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,710
So it runs the pure google or did you
know carrier branding?

1484
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:55,750
It's I bought,
I own the phone,

1485
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,400
right?
It's not a lease.

1486
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,100
Well,
those,

1487
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,620
the newest,
latest and greatest android phones,

1488
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:06,290
or at the very least commensurate with
the newest and latest and greatest I

1489
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,510
iphones,
I think the theme average person,

1490
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:15,340
the slight differences in hardware
really are irrelevant at this point.

1491
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,680
While it does matter,
however,

1492
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:21,970
is watch You can and can't do with the
software and how much of your life at

1493
01:16:21,971 --> 01:16:26,200
controls and how much privacy you have
with the software that you run on these

1494
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,420
devices.
As You may have noticed,

1495
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:33,450
I'm all about control and privacy.
Being able to control my money,

1496
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:35,920
control my devices,
control my privacy.

1497
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,270
I think that's,
that should be a principle that we

1498
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:41,370
should all celebrate.
It's,

1499
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,580
it's a fundamental freedom and we're
gradually losing it.

1500
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,370
Well,
I'm a big fan of options as well,

1501
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,140
so I'm happy that,
uh,

1502
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:52,810
androids come along and created options,
right?

1503
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:54,520
Because it was for a long time.
It was like,

1504
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:55,660
yeah,
it's an option,

1505
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,010
but it sucks.
Right.

1506
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,550
And now it's,
it's not just me.

1507
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,080
The galaxy s seven.
Have you ever messed with that?

1508
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,820
The samsung galaxy s seven,
but I've seen it.

1509
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,460
Yeah.
It's a phenomenal phone.

1510
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,770
It is easily as good as an iphone.
It's amazing phone.

1511
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:15,310
Throw it into a gear vr headsets and you
get fully immersive vr that is

1512
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,940
mindblowing.
Yeah.

1513
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,980
I actually have a little headset that I
can put this phone into,

1514
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,910
into vr.

1515
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,350
That stuff's good,
but it's not as good as the htc vive.

1516
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,980
MY friend duncan duncan trussell as the
vive.

1517
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,340
AlrIght.
I also paid $30 for my headset

1518
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,750
is what?
1,200?

1519
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,640
It's probably something like that.
Slight difference in price.

1520
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,710
Yes.
There's definitely differences in price,

1521
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,670
but it is,
it's very encouraging that not only is

1522
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:46,760
there a competitor to apple but it is
actually an equal now,

1523
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,160
you know,
and I just think the more options people

1524
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:52,640
have like that,
the better there are for everybody and

1525
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,470
it,
it'd be nice if there was a commensurate

1526
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:56,900
operating system because there's not
really.

1527
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,960
Well no,
not really.

1528
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:00,130
Um,
for,

1529
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,350
for geek heads like me,
it's linux,

1530
01:18:02,351 --> 01:18:05,650
but essentially what happened is because
linux was so successful,

1531
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,880
it became android.
Android was built on top of linux.

1532
01:18:09,881 --> 01:18:12,640
Essentially it is at its very core,
it is linux,

1533
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,020
right?
But why don't they make,

1534
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:16,690
um,
that kind of an operating system for a

1535
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:17,800
computer,
for a laptop,

1536
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,900
um,
because from what I can tell,

1537
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:23,200
really laptops are gradually
disappearing.

1538
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,660
The laptop market is disappearing
really,

1539
01:18:25,661 --> 01:18:28,840
really fast today.
There were some announcements from

1540
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:32,290
apple.
They're changing some of their operating

1541
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,210
system commitments,
but they're making the seven.

1542
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,360
Yeah,
they're making the operating system more

1543
01:18:37,361 --> 01:18:42,361
and more like ios and gradually
diminishing the importance of,

1544
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:47,950
of laptops because most people do pretty
much everything they need to do on their

1545
01:18:47,951 --> 01:18:48,970
smartphones.
Nowadays.

1546
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,860
It is,
it,

1547
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:55,620
it makes a difference that it's nice
that I can take my phone with me.

1548
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:59,370
I have the larger iphone that I use most
of the time and I also have a samsung

1549
01:18:59,371 --> 01:19:01,950
phone,
but the larger iphone that I use most of

1550
01:19:01,951 --> 01:19:05,880
the time I can take with me and I don't
feel like I'm missing a laptop,

1551
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:08,640
but if I need to work on and get some
stuff done,

1552
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:12,250
I want a laptop keyboard.
I want to.

1553
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,580
If I'm writing especially I want to be
able to work.

1554
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,510
Yeah,
you know,

1555
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,050
I want to be able to also plug in
headsets and listen to music while I'm

1556
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:21,180
working and also have power at the same
time.

1557
01:19:21,181 --> 01:19:25,110
And so there's a lot of.
I'm a big fan of actual computers.

1558
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:30,111
I like an actual computer at home with
an attached keyboard and a real monitor.

1559
01:19:30,121 --> 01:19:32,880
I mean just,
I just think those things.

1560
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:35,880
There's some benefits of those things to
someone who writes in particular.

1561
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,793
Yeah.

1562
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:41,080
Do you think the great american novel is
being written by thumbs right now?

1563
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,140
Well,
Steven Wright was writing a whole book

1564
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:44,460
and tweets.
Yeah.

1565
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:48,420
Yeah.
He was writing a novel in tweets on a

1566
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:53,100
real keyboard book.
Money were for people who are listening.

1567
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:58,290
So what else is exciting for you right
now about

1568
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,360
bitcoin?
So I think one of the things we've seen

1569
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:04,270
that,
that has been quite interesting is that

1570
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:09,271
it has become easier and easier and to
use and easier to get into bitcoin and

1571
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:12,510
easier to use bitcoin in your everyday
life.

1572
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,860
I remember a time when it was very,
very difficult to do all of those

1573
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:21,060
things.
Now there are probably six or 700

1574
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,150
exchanges around the world.
Uh,

1575
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,920
you talked about mt.
Gox in Japan,

1576
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:30,210
the first bitcoin exchange,
the really the first major bitcoin

1577
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:32,880
exchange at the time it was the
exchange,

1578
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,120
there were no others and that was both a
single point of failure and a weakness

1579
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:42,100
for bitcoin as it proved.
Um,

1580
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:47,150
buT it also made it very difficult.
Now there are at least four or five

1581
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,870
major exchanges operating in the us,
very easy to access,

1582
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:55,590
um,
access the system to connect it to maybe

1583
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:57,390
to a bank account or a debit card.

1584
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:01,290
And two,
if you want to convert dollars to

1585
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:03,530
bitcoin or bitcoin to dollars.
Uh,

1586
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:07,110
I'm mostly on the other side.
I earn bitcoin and then I converted into

1587
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,120
dollars to pay for things.
The,

1588
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:12,000
I campaign bitcoin,
very easy to do that.

1589
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,820
Um,
that's a major advancement that makes it

1590
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,990
much easier for people to get involved
as much as they want.

1591
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,190
They don't have to earn everything they
don't have to do.

1592
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,660
There's a company called between age,
uh,

1593
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:30,770
which allows you to take a percentage of
your paycheck and have it sent to you in

1594
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:33,010
bitcoin.
Um,

1595
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,300
and it's very easy for an employer to
set it up with any of their traditional

1596
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:38,460
payroll systems where they say,
you can say,

1597
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,860
just like,
I'm going to put two percent of my

1598
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:45,861
account into a savings account and a 98
percent into my checking account.

1599
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,220
A lot of companies offer that.

1600
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,820
Well now you can say,
and I also want to put two percent of my

1601
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:54,960
paycheck every month into this.
And to the employer,

1602
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,350
it looks like a routing number and
account number,

1603
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,980
but on the other end it gets converted
into bitcoin and send to your bitcoin

1604
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,890
wallet.
So you can very easily incorporate this

1605
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:08,850
as part of your everyday life.
Now here's another thing,

1606
01:22:08,851 --> 01:22:12,030
I'm going to try and show this in a way
that doesn't cause me a big problem with

1607
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:13,290
my finances,
but

1608
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,590
how it,
it caused you a big problem if someone

1609
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:18,180
sees something to show the credit card
number.

1610
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,840
Oh,
I see.

1611
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,080
So this is a,
this is a super crypto

1612
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,950
bitcoin credit card.
It's a bitcoin debit card and basically

1613
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:32,310
it operates.
I'm one of the exchanges in the us

1614
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:37,311
offers this and there's actually tore
three in the us that now offer this kind

1615
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,603
of service.

1616
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,430
Now,
what's behind this is a bitcoin wallet.

1617
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:45,240
So I don't have dollars in this.
I have bitcoin in this,

1618
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,890
but when I went to the coffee shop or I
got this coffee earlier today,

1619
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,640
I swipe this.
And um,

1620
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,410
did they look at you sideways?
No,

1621
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:58,230
I mean they can't tell they they see a
visa card.

1622
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,600
It says visa on the front says debit
visa.

1623
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,000
It doesn't say bitcoin anywhere.
um,

1624
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,240
and so I make a payment and I get a
little message on my phone that says

1625
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,370
we've debited zero point zero,
zero,

1626
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:11,770
zero,
two bitcoin from your account for your

1627
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,450
purchase at the coffee shop.
So you can even tip them in bitcoin.

1628
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,370
Yes.
Here's where it gets interesting.

1629
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,050
You know,
I tRavel all around the world,

1630
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,350
do these talks and these conferences.
So I'm constantly on the road and I've

1631
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:25,690
tried again and again with my bank
account to tell them,

1632
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,280
listen,
I travel.

1633
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,810
When are you traveling,
sir?

1634
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,510
All the time.
Where are you traveling next?

1635
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,810
Oh,
16 different countries in the next seven

1636
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:37,450
months.
Can you just put a note somewhere in my

1637
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:41,080
account that says do not Block his visa
if it shows up somewhere we don't expect

1638
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:44,650
because this person travels.
American express can do it.

1639
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,350
My bank can't.
They simply can't.

1640
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:52,090
They want me 24 hours before I leave to
call them and give them a specific list

1641
01:23:52,091 --> 01:23:54,670
of places that I'm going to be.
Um,

1642
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:57,460
and when I don't do that,
when I tried to use my card,

1643
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:02,610
it gets blocked until I come back to the
us and talk to them on the phone and a

1644
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:06,010
whole bunch of questions about whether
it was really me who bought,

1645
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:09,040
you know,
a pastry in prague or something like

1646
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,420
that.
And then that all block it.

1647
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:14,530
And what's happened repeatedly in the
last few months is I'll go somewhere,

1648
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:18,160
my card will get blocked because I
forgot to tell them and then I'll pull

1649
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:22,450
out the line card and it works
everywhere without fail because it's a

1650
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:24,940
prepaid because it's a debit everywhere.

1651
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,180
Without fail,
if I need to move more money into it,

1652
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:29,980
if I need to take money cash out of an
atm when I'm traveling,

1653
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:34,870
I can use this and it's so much easier.
I can simply transfer bitcoin into that

1654
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:39,871
account and 10 minutes later I can
withdraw that in cash in any currency in

1655
01:24:40,631 --> 01:24:43,150
any country.
You say that it was such glee.

1656
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,940
It's convenience.
So excited about you are.

1657
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,280
You can't hide it.
But yeah,

1658
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,150
I get it.
I get excited about these things because

1659
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:54,090
it makes it easy for me to use bitcoin,
right?

1660
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,450
And,
and yes,

1661
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,840
it's visa as the evil empire,
the banking system,

1662
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:01,420
etc. Etc.
But for many people who are going to

1663
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:05,320
experience bitcoin as an additional
currency in their life when they use for

1664
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:09,820
online purchases,
having the flexibility to use both and

1665
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:13,390
making it easier and more transparent is
how you get to mainstream adoption,

1666
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:14,770
especially in the developed world.

1667
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,300
Now,
how would someone get ahold of one of

1668
01:25:16,301 --> 01:25:17,000
those cards?
How did,

1669
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,150
how did they just open an account with
an exchange?

1670
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:23,320
They have to do all of the patriot act,
bank secrecy act,

1671
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:26,320
show me id,
proof of residence,

1672
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,071
et cetera,
et cetera.

1673
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:32,071
But in the end they get a visa card and
what exchanges are available for getting

1674
01:25:32,471 --> 01:25:34,780
visa debit cards like that.
Like can you name some?

1675
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,431
Sure.
Uh,

1676
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,850
in the us a coinbase,
coinbase.com,

1677
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,800
uh,
and bitpay bitpay.com.

1678
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,280
Both offer a visa debit cards,
uh,

1679
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,990
in many countries around the world,
uh,

1680
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:51,820
zappo x,
a p o offer a debit card and there's a,

1681
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,310
there's a bunch of others.
There's a bunch of others.

1682
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,900
interesting.
That's interesting.

1683
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:58,540
That's actually very promising because
that makes it practical.

1684
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,490
Yes,
so that's one side.

1685
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,160
Then a few other things that have
happened in this space.

1686
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:08,150
Certainly we have seen a lot of the
banking industry realized that they

1687
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:13,151
could actually use this technology and
not just fear it and you know,

1688
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:18,940
we have this and I certainly bring this
view of banks as giants,

1689
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,370
kara couture,
dinosaur evil things,

1690
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,410
but within them there's just normal
people,

1691
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:24,680
right?

1692
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,770
So swept up in the institutional inertia
of this beast,

1693
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:31,700
but there's people who,
some of them get it,

1694
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,030
they get this is exciting and
interesting and disruptive.

1695
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:38,660
They want to use it within the banking
system and they're trying to work from

1696
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:43,661
within to get people interested in this
and we're seeing more and more of these

1697
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:50,171
organizations gradually try to find ways
to adopt this technology to streamline

1698
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:56,111
and to improve banking itself.
This is very similar to what we saw in

1699
01:26:57,591 --> 01:27:02,240
the early nineties when the internet
started happening muCh more mainstream.

1700
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,000
The phone companies at first fought it
tooth and nail,

1701
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,720
right?
They fought.

1702
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,650
The service providers tried not to give
them access to their lines,

1703
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:13,310
try not to kick them off.
The knock of them dsl networks at the

1704
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,990
tIme.
Um,

1705
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,510
they faulted the fcc,
they tried to control it,

1706
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:23,410
and eventually they all became isbns,
right?

1707
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:27,710
So eventually jumped on the bandwagon
and use it to improve their own

1708
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:28,610
infrastructure.
Now,

1709
01:27:28,611 --> 01:27:32,180
if you make a phone call on a regular
traditional old phone,

1710
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,430
your phone call is going over the
internet,

1711
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,700
almost 90 percent sure that it is.
So they wouldn't let the internet beyond

1712
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:42,110
the phone network.
Now the entire phone network is on the

1713
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:42,944
internet.
Well,

1714
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:45,680
if flipped,
that's called infrastructure inversion.

1715
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,680
Um,
in the early days of the automobile,

1716
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:53,681
they wouldn't let automobiles in towns
too because they would disrupt the

1717
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,100
horses,
the horse traffic,

1718
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,530
right?
And they had all kinds of weird laws,

1719
01:27:57,531 --> 01:27:59,870
including in the uk,
they passed the law,

1720
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,660
which required someone to run ahead of
the Car with a red flag.

1721
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,440
I call the red flag act.
That did wonders for the british

1722
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,230
automobile industry,
which was 20 years ahead at the time.

1723
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:11,190
And then wasn't,
um,

1724
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,450
wow.
That kind of reactionary behavior is

1725
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:19,451
very common in new technologies and then
infrastructure and version happens

1726
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,533
eventually.

1727
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,580
The thing that was considered
impossible,

1728
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,760
the roads will be paved to make
automobile travel,

1729
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
practical everywhere happens and horses
were quite happy to ride on paved roads,

1730
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:32,600
right?
Uh,

1731
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,740
whereas for automobiles was almost
impossible to use in a rutted,

1732
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:41,741
muddy road when you have a four wheel
drive vehicle trying to compete against

1733
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:48,881
a four wheel drive animal.
And in those early days they pointed

1734
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,380
that that said,
look,

1735
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,200
this thing is never going to work.
Automobiles and never going to happen

1736
01:28:54,201 --> 01:28:55,700
because you don't have the
infrastructure,

1737
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,940
but if you have the need infrastructure
happens,

1738
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,920
and we've seen that with,
with the automobile up with electricity,

1739
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:04,800
we've seen that with the internet.
We seen that with all of these

1740
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:09,360
technologies and now we're going to see
it again with money because if you have

1741
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:13,380
this technology,
building the banking institutions on top

1742
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:18,381
of this is easy,
but making bitcoin or other

1743
01:29:18,571 --> 01:29:21,510
cryptocurrencies,
making the internet of money play by the

1744
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:23,610
rules of the old banking system is
almost impossible.

1745
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:29,180
Now I like that expression,
crypto currency and crypto currencies.

1746
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,420
One is the stop banks from creating
their own cryptocurrency and what I

1747
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:39,990
mean,
what is so wonderful about bitcoin in

1748
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,630
comparison to other cryptocurrencies?
Now,

1749
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:45,090
that's a great question.
There's nothing to stop them.

1750
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,830
In fact,
they're already doing it.

1751
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:48,240
There are,
yes.

1752
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,820
First of all,
you've got to realize there's more than

1753
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:53,370
a thousand cryptocurrencies already.
A thousand.

1754
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:54,540
Yes.
More than a thousand dollars.

1755
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:57,430
What's the worst one?
Was the one we should avoid that,

1756
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,840
that list is almost 900 long.
Oh

1757
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,473
yeah.
I mean,

1758
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:03,960
it's a long tail,
right?

1759
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,510
Um,
there's a couple that are interesting

1760
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,820
that offer different perspectives.
Um,

1761
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,790
but we're,
we're seeing a lot of private

1762
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:14,250
institutions interested in creating
their own,

1763
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,730
um,
and there's nothing stopping them from

1764
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,280
doing that,
but they have to make a fundamental

1765
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,530
choice.
They can either create some things that

1766
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:26,580
is controlled,
contained with specific outlines and

1767
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:28,770
borders,
with controlled access,

1768
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,050
permissioned access,
as they would call it.

1769
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:35,130
Um,
and that by definition is not global.

1770
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,770
It can be global.
It has to be contained within a specific

1771
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,500
jurisdiction because that's how they
operate.

1772
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,800
Both corporations and banks operate
within specific jurisdictions so they

1773
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:48,420
can do that,
um,

1774
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:52,170
but then it has to be close to
innovation,

1775
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:55,770
close to permission and not global and
transnational,

1776
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,890
and so what?
Bitcoin has a,

1777
01:30:57,891 --> 01:31:02,891
not just bitcoin,
but any public open cryptocurrency of a

1778
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:07,560
global nature like bit coin is that you
don't need to ask permission to join.

1779
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,690
You don't need to ask permission to
innovate.

1780
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:13,680
You don't need to ask permission to
create a new application and any

1781
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:16,290
application,
you're right will instantaneously work

1782
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,960
anywhere in the world to anyone without
permission.

1783
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:23,310
That's the magic of bitcoin and if you
think about that,

1784
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:27,180
that's also the magic of the internet.
That's why the internet has been

1785
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:31,500
successful because it allows anyone to
join without permission connect to any

1786
01:31:31,501 --> 01:31:32,400
application or service.

1787
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,090
They won't write an application and
launch it globally without tasking the

1788
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,740
phone company if they're allowed to do
that,

1789
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,800
there's no one to ask permission from.
And to extend that analogy,

1790
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:49,700
they also tried to build private
internet and they're still trying

1791
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,100
compuserve,
aol,

1792
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:56,700
prodigy,
and the early closed networks that had

1793
01:31:56,701 --> 01:31:58,590
their own content that you could connect
to.

1794
01:31:58,591 --> 01:32:02,680
The part of the internet and then after
that corporates internets,

1795
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,700
have you heard of the internet term?
Right.

1796
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:10,480
So when you have an internal network
within a company that has stale content,

1797
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:13,060
crappy applications and doesn't talk to
the rest oF the world,

1798
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,490
and it's behind firewalls,
that's an intRanet,

1799
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:21,950
intra and tra and they've built those
and they sometimes serve very useful

1800
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:25,840
purposes,
but they're not the internet And you

1801
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:29,380
can't scale them and make them secure
and make them useful enough.

1802
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,550
So essentially that would be

1803
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:35,630
exactly be what would happen with money
if local banks or national banks.

1804
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,190
Yes.
So to follow from the title,

1805
01:32:39,191 --> 01:32:44,191
the internet of money is a very powerful
expression because it really explains

1806
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:47,590
what this is.
This is the internet of money,

1807
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:49,760
which means it's open,
borderless global,

1808
01:32:49,761 --> 01:32:53,080
and requires no permission to
participate and people will try to

1809
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:58,081
create the intranet of money
and it will have all of the limitations

1810
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:04,090
that the traditional banking system has.
So yes,

1811
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:05,920
they can come along and do that.
Um,

1812
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,990
and the nIce thing is that people don't
have to make a choice to use one or the

1813
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:15,991
other.
The only system of monopoly we have is

1814
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:21,190
that you have to use the national
currency of the country you were born in

1815
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:23,860
and you live in,
in order to pay the government of that

1816
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,690
country.
Other than that,

1817
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:28,090
you're free to use any currency you want
anywhere.

1818
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:30,460
some of us are free,
many of us are not,

1819
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,990
and bitcoin fits into that model.
It's the if you want to use it for this

1820
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:36,670
particular use,
use it

1821
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,381
well.
If,

1822
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:39,850
if you extrapolate where all this stuff
is going,

1823
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:43,930
if you look at.
I mean if you're correct and if over the

1824
01:33:43,931 --> 01:33:48,250
next 20 years,
bitcoin really does emerge as not just

1825
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:52,570
an acceptable currency worldwide,
but it's right up there with everything

1826
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:57,460
else and and maybe even preferred by a
lot of people that are in the know or

1827
01:33:57,461 --> 01:34:00,940
tech savvy or what have you.
If that really does take place,

1828
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,600
it's going to slowly but surely erode a
lot of the major problems that we have

1829
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:12,420
with society today as far as this
government having massive amounts of

1830
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:17,881
control over the economy and the banks
being the ones who sort of enforce the

1831
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:25,990
kind of laws that have allowed the
mortgage crisis is and I'll allow these

1832
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:30,991
bubbles to occur and also to fund and
help fund the politicians that enable

1833
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:37,580
them to keep these laws in place.
I mean all of That sort of is a lot of

1834
01:34:37,581 --> 01:34:42,520
that is because of power and a lot of
that power is going to go away if

1835
01:34:42,521 --> 01:34:47,521
something like cryptocurrencies emerge
as being the predominant way that we use

1836
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:50,050
and exchange money.

1837
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:52,810
That's the optimistic way to look at it.
Yeah.

1838
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:58,400
The less optimistic way to look at it is
that over the decade we're going to

1839
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,500
gradually move into a cashless digital
money society.

1840
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,480
We're kind of doing that now with apple.
We are doing that already and there are

1841
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:10,430
some countries that are completely
cashless,

1842
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:16,060
really were that are very close to
completely cashless the ironically one

1843
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,190
of the.
One of the countries that has a very

1844
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:21,840
high degree of,
um,

1845
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,900
digital money is Kenya because of
empaysah,

1846
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:29,150
which is the mobile money they have,
which has now taken over a significant

1847
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:32,450
percentage of the gdp.
We're also seeing in scandinavian

1848
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:34,250
countries now,
cash is less than,

1849
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:37,610
I think is less than eight percent of,
um,

1850
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:42,530
of the productive use of money and other
using credit cards is what you're

1851
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:45,490
saying.
I credits debits mobile pay,

1852
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,840
uh,
what is kenya's mpa?

1853
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:48,470
What is that?

1854
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:52,280
And paste it as a text message.
Text message money.

1855
01:35:52,281 --> 01:35:54,260
Yeah.
It's money you can send through sms.

1856
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:58,190
it started off as basically people
exchanging minutes,

1857
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:02,210
mobile minutes that were transferable by
sms and they started using it as

1858
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:06,830
currency and then eventually it became
officially a corresponding currency to

1859
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:09,770
the kenyan pesa.
Announced the predomInant currency.

1860
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:10,853
Um,
it's,

1861
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,980
yeah,
in most places.

1862
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,240
From what I understand,
uh,

1863
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,730
I haven't been to Kenya,
but I've talked to a lot of kenyans who

1864
01:36:16,731 --> 01:36:17,271
told me,
yeah,

1865
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,860
we,
we all use that.

1866
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:21,500
And only that we don't use cash.
We don't use credit cards.

1867
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:24,200
Wow.
It is kind of shocking,

1868
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:27,950
but here's the problem.
The problem is we are going to a digital

1869
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:32,951
current society where cash will be
gradually eradicated either through non

1870
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:38,291
use or a lot of countries and a lot of
governments are trying to actively ban

1871
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:42,350
it so they're putting limits on how much
you can use cash,

1872
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:46,310
say you know,
a thousand dollars and if it's more than

1873
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:51,020
a thousand dollars using cash as illegal
when we go to the society,

1874
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:53,360
we have to really think about the
implications.

1875
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:58,130
Do we want a society in which our
digital money is under complete

1876
01:36:58,131 --> 01:37:03,131
surveillance and complete control where
if you go to the wrong protest or if you

1877
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:08,060
support the wrong political campaign or
if you make a payment to the wrong

1878
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:10,040
person or receive money from the wrong
person,

1879
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:13,640
suddenly your money disappears.
It's no longer yours anymore.

1880
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:15,650
It's frozen,
it's seized,

1881
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,040
it's gone.
Um,

1882
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:21,260
and someone has control of that.
Corporations,

1883
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:22,430
banks,
governments,

1884
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,400
and in most cases there is no difference
between corporation,

1885
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:26,630
bank and government.
Right?

1886
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:30,200
Um,
and so that's one scenario.

1887
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,550
And the other scenario is one in which
individuals control their money and it

1888
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:37,440
is digital money,
but it's digital cash like bitcoin,

1889
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:41,390
where you can pay an individual from one
person to another just like I can with

1890
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:44,720
cash today without tiny other party
getting involved.

1891
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:50,270
What really strikes me as amazing is
that we've gotten used to this idea so

1892
01:37:50,271 --> 01:37:54,650
quickly,
which is that we no longer pay people,

1893
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,830
we no longer pay people directly.

1894
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:03,570
The less we use cash is the more we pay
people through a corporation.

1895
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:08,190
Right?
So from tipping your valet to tipping

1896
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:13,191
your taxi driver to tipping wherever
tipping is pretty much the last

1897
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:18,501
remaining part of our society and where
cash is used to pay from one person who

1898
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:24,060
is not an incorporated entity to another
person who is not an incorporated

1899
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:26,220
entity.
Everything else you have to pay through

1900
01:38:26,221 --> 01:38:27,960
a corporation,
whether it's a bank,

1901
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,390
right?
Whether it's venmo,

1902
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,360
whether it's paypal,
whether it's any of those things.

1903
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:37,680
And we've gradually gotten used to this
environment where we can't pay another

1904
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:39,570
person unless there's a corporation
involved.

1905
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,340
And that's astonishing to me.
And as cash disappears,

1906
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:49,341
that then becomes a final fact that
every single payment in your life will

1907
01:38:49,951 --> 01:38:53,870
be from you to a corporation and the
corporation takes a piece of that every

1908
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,120
single thing and not just that,
it doesn't just take a piece,

1909
01:38:57,121 --> 01:39:01,050
it also controls and surveils and
monitors your use.

1910
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:02,970
And if you violated the terms and
Conditions,

1911
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:05,340
you are destitute.
Wow.

1912
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:10,020
So are.
So the issue is not what we have today

1913
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:14,640
versus the digital currency of the
future or bitcoin or whatever.

1914
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:19,440
It's both futures are digital currency
and in both futures.

1915
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:22,890
Cash will no longer exist.
That is inevitable.

1916
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:26,190
We are going down that road and now we
have to choose.

1917
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,930
Do we go to the digital,
cashless society of corporate control

1918
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:35,931
over money with the complete and total
merging of corporates and state money

1919
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,880
where instead of having separation of
state and money have the merging of

1920
01:39:41,881 --> 01:39:46,260
states and money and corporation and
money where your money is branded money,

1921
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:51,950
you have chase dollars,
you have goldman sachs dollars,

1922
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,410
you have coca cola dollars,
right?

1923
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,480
You have money that is controlled by a
corporation or do we go down the other

1924
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:04,020
future where we have money that is
basically an internet protocol that is

1925
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:06,780
completely global,
that any person can pay any person they

1926
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:10,120
meet in the streets without any
corporations getting involved just for

1927
01:40:10,121 --> 01:40:14,070
me to you digital cash and that's really
the.

1928
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,720
It's a less optimistic view because I'm
fully aware of what the other future is

1929
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:21,720
and it's already playing out and it is a
very,

1930
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,730
in my opinion,
a very dangerous future.

1931
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:28,530
This is so fascinating to me because
it's so speculative and I love when you

1932
01:40:28,531 --> 01:40:31,890
don't know what's going to happen and
someone presents a bunch of different

1933
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:36,891
scenarios and you get the mind starts to
wander in and then you also sort of plan

1934
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:40,110
for the future.
Like it becomes something to.

1935
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,340
It almost become something to look
forward to our bet on.

1936
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,570
You know like,
boy,

1937
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:48,630
I bet it's going to work like this or I
bet you because we really don't know

1938
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,020
what I mean and what.
What is the resistance that bitcoin is

1939
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:57,021
facing from standard financial
institutions that are in control right

1940
01:40:57,491 --> 01:40:59,810
now?
Because there must be some form of,

1941
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,430
of resistance.
And is there any fuckery involved?

1942
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:08,290
Like is there any sabotaging of bitcoin
that has been suspected or proven?

1943
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:14,150
I think I don't really know if there's
any sabotaging going on.

1944
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:15,450
So that's,
that's um,

1945
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:18,320
that's expected.
I'm not going to make any,

1946
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:20,660
any claims,
just wink at me.

1947
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,780
Tell him what to say.
Well,

1948
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,800
what I'm going to talk about is the
progression of what happens when a

1949
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:30,080
giant,
well established financial institution

1950
01:41:30,081 --> 01:41:35,081
that's been around for 50 years or 100
years is faced with a disruptor that

1951
01:41:35,511 --> 01:41:40,511
they cannot tamp down.
They cannot shut down sue by coopt

1952
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:44,030
eradicate band legislates against.
Right?

1953
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,760
And,
and what happens then is what I call the

1954
01:41:46,761 --> 01:41:51,761
five stages of grief.
First we start with denial.

1955
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,040
So,
and,

1956
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,450
and we saw this play,
I think exactly like this with the

1957
01:41:56,451 --> 01:41:59,000
banking industry.
The first reaction was denial.

1958
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:02,390
Bitcoin can't possibly work.
It's not real money.

1959
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:05,510
It doesn't really exist.
It has no value.

1960
01:42:05,511 --> 01:42:09,020
It will never survive.
Fast forward five years,

1961
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:10,900
you keep making that argument.

1962
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:15,260
It becomes less and less credible
because it's not real money yet.

1963
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:20,210
The big metal bird that brought me to
los angeles today was paid,

1964
01:42:20,211 --> 01:42:21,590
was not money,
so

1965
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:28,400
you can claim it's not money all day
long and I've been living on it for

1966
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:31,550
three years,
which kind of undermines the argument,

1967
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:33,930
right?
If I earn it tonight,

1968
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,320
spend it,
and people give me rides and big metal

1969
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,000
birds,
it's money.

1970
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:41,150
Um,
so that isn't working.

1971
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:43,190
It's going to go away on its own.
It's going to die.

1972
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:46,880
It's going to lose all its value.
Every time it dumps in value,

1973
01:42:46,881 --> 01:42:48,990
they cheer.
It's like finally bitcoin is dead.

1974
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:52,070
They write another obituary,
we publish them on bitcoin.

1975
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:54,260
Obituaries.com to make fun of them
later.

1976
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:58,070
Now has 110 obituaries I think
published.

1977
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,350
Every time they say will die,
which is every two months.

1978
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:03,030
Again,
denial only works for a while.

1979
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,560
Then they go into anger.
It's the money of terrorists,

1980
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:07,700
criminals,
pedophiles,

1981
01:43:07,701 --> 01:43:11,750
pornographers,
and the unsavory elements of this world.

1982
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,590
Pedophiles.
That's always the one they pull out,

1983
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:15,971
right?
Oh,

1984
01:43:15,971 --> 01:43:17,300
they love to use that one.
Yeah.

1985
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:21,070
If they find one by one pedophile,
he uses bitcoin.

1986
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:22,623
Pedophile kern.

1987
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,350
Yeah,
exactly.

1988
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,470
I'm dirty trick.
It is a bit of a,

1989
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:30,350
it is a bit,
a bit of a dirty trick and they've tried

1990
01:43:30,351 --> 01:43:34,420
to do this again and again and again.
They did it with the internet,

1991
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:35,510
right?
The internet,

1992
01:43:35,511 --> 01:43:37,370
when it first came out,
they,

1993
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:40,220
you heard this media narrative,
the,

1994
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:42,320
it's,
it sells papers.

1995
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,660
It sell,
it didn't sell clicks at the time

1996
01:43:44,661 --> 01:43:46,100
because they were doing,
it's about the internet,

1997
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:49,250
but it sells papers,
which is the idea that the internet is a

1998
01:43:49,251 --> 01:43:52,730
haven of crooks and fraudsters,
terrorists and pedophiles and

1999
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:53,720
pornography.
Great.

2000
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:55,730
Um,
yes,

2001
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,220
criminal use of advanced technology,
criminal use,

2002
01:43:58,221 --> 01:44:01,940
the most advanced technology they can
get their hands on because they're in a

2003
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:03,890
very highly competitive,
high margin,

2004
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:08,040
high risk business.
And of course they're going to say they

2005
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:12,470
criminals wear shoes to run away from
bank heist criminals drive cars to get

2006
01:44:12,471 --> 01:44:14,120
away from bank robberies.

2007
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,130
They use cell phones to coordinate with
each other.

2008
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,100
They drink water.
So it is not to die of dehydration.

2009
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,380
We're not going to ban all of those
things.

2010
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:26,000
Right.
And so you have that anger.

2011
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:29,110
Um,
and they tried that for awhile.

2012
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,790
Um,
every time they try that,

2013
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,290
you just turn around and say,
oh,

2014
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:34,070
well,
you know,

2015
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:39,070
actually the biggest money launderers of
drugs in the world are hsbc,

2016
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:40,580
the Hong Kong,
Hong Kong,

2017
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:45,581
shanghai banking consortium.
Inconvenient fact is that this is the

2018
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:48,350
laundry is in the world.
Yes,

2019
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:51,860
they would call it the model new
laundering $700,000,000,000 for the

2020
01:44:51,861 --> 01:44:56,660
sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years
during which 19,000 people died in

2021
01:44:56,661 --> 01:45:00,270
Mexico as a direct result of that.
Um,

2022
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:04,160
and they got a fine and no one went to
jail.

2023
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,950
So there are inconvenient facts like
that.

2024
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:09,520
Every time they say bitcoin funds
terrorism,

2025
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,363
you say,
oh,

2026
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,400
I see them driving toyota's and humvees.

2027
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,480
Um,
right.

2028
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:16,950
Uh,
that doesn't,

2029
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,160
that's a bit incongruence.
Like they're,

2030
01:45:19,161 --> 01:45:24,161
they're driving around in the vehicles.
We left behind and there they got a lot

2031
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:29,300
of their funding from pallets of money
that we left behind and they're getting

2032
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:34,301
paid for dollar in dollars for oil that
they're selling to our closest allies.

2033
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,830
We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi
Arabia.

2034
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:39,710
Um,
so these are the inconvenient truths,

2035
01:45:39,711 --> 01:45:42,500
right?
So you don't talk about these in polite

2036
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:46,430
company or at least you do like,
that's what I said when I was invited to

2037
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:48,950
the,
to speak in front of the senate in

2038
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:52,670
Canada and they started asking me about
terrorism and I said to actually mostly

2039
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:55,100
funded by our allies.
And what did they say when you do that?

2040
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,630
That was the end of that train of
thought.

2041
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,760
They stopped,
you know,

2042
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:01,770
it was live public tv,
but what,

2043
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:04,420
what,
like what went down when we moved on to

2044
01:46:04,421 --> 01:46:07,010
talk about more realistic and
interesting things in a much more

2045
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:08,780
positive view of what this thing is.

2046
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:12,380
So they tried to discredit bitcoin by
attaching it to terrorism and you

2047
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:16,520
informed them of the facts of where
terrorists are actually funded from.

2048
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:19,160
Yes.
In a very public forum on live tv,

2049
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:22,490
which was very difficult to continue
that line of conversation.

2050
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:27,560
So that's anger.
Is there a resistance in Canada?

2051
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:28,960
Like there is in the United States?
No,

2052
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,010
actually,
um,

2053
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:31,130
the,
they've been very,

2054
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:33,260
very positive,
very positive to,

2055
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:35,000
towards,
um,

2056
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,820
towards cryptocurrencies in general.
Yeah.

2057
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:40,010
Interesting.
And there's a lot of development going

2058
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:42,650
on.
There isn't that much resistance in the

2059
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:43,670
United States.
Really.

2060
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:45,950
The banks were shutting down bank
accounts.

2061
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:48,980
In some cases.
We've seen that in the United Kingdom to

2062
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:53,190
what is the right right now,
what's the percentage of people that are

2063
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:58,191
using bitcoin on a regular basis?
It's very difficult to say,

2064
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:02,730
um,
primarily because there is no clear

2065
01:47:02,731 --> 01:47:06,930
association between one person in one
bitcoin address or I can't.

2066
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,020
There is no account right to,
to use bitcoin.

2067
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:12,330
All you have to do is download an
application on your phone.

2068
01:47:12,331 --> 01:47:13,920
Nobody.
You don't have to register anything.

2069
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:17,670
And so as a result,
it's just like how many ip addresses are

2070
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:19,500
in use.
Does that tell you anything about how

2071
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:22,350
many people are using the internet?
You can't really tell.

2072
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,860
That's a good thing.
It's because of its nature.

2073
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:31,460
I would say we're probably looking at
about two to 4 million users based on.

2074
01:47:32,221 --> 01:47:35,280
It's very interesting based on activity
levels,

2075
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:37,380
based on logins to websites that some of
them,

2076
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:41,340
the published results.
It's very hard to say for sure exactly

2077
01:47:41,341 --> 01:47:44,280
how many mostly concentrated in the us
at the moment.

2078
01:47:44,281 --> 01:47:48,810
So it's plus or minus one percent,
somewhere in the range of one percent

2079
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:51,480
of,
of the United States population.

2080
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,620
Oh no.
This is globally,

2081
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,180
globally,
globally,

2082
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:56,190
globally.
Maybe two to 4 million people.

2083
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:57,900
You said most of them are in the United
States.

2084
01:47:57,901 --> 01:48:00,720
Most of them in the United States.
Many of them are also in China.

2085
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:02,730
So was a $4 million.
It is possible.

2086
01:48:02,731 --> 01:48:05,770
That's one percent of maybe yes,
less.

2087
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,460
Yes,
maybe half a percent or something like

2088
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:09,600
that.
That's interesting.

2089
01:48:09,601 --> 01:48:12,210
That's a lot.
But what is happening is it's doubling

2090
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:14,280
every year in terms of transaction
volume,

2091
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:18,420
transaction amounts,
number of everything is doubling every

2092
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:19,130
year.
And that's,

2093
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:23,580
that's the kind of characteristic curve
you see in disruptive technologies being

2094
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:25,710
adopted.
And that's a very promising curve.

2095
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,880
What is the tipping point like what
needs to happen?

2096
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,950
Is there anything that needs to happen
for,

2097
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,530
for widespread adoption,
you've got to need it.

2098
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,250
Uh,
it's got to be ready and it's got to be

2099
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:43,251
easy to use.
And so right now it's not easy to use.

2100
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:49,070
It's not ready for adoption.
And in many parts of the developed

2101
01:48:49,081 --> 01:48:51,270
world,
we don't really need it.

2102
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,600
So in order to make it something we need
either what we already have has to not

2103
01:48:57,361 --> 01:48:59,250
work so well.
This is what's happening in the

2104
01:48:59,251 --> 01:49:01,980
developing world where you have banking
crisis,

2105
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:06,330
which drives people into a safe haven or
you invent to applications that couldn't

2106
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:10,680
be done before,
a self driving car that you pay by the

2107
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:13,050
mile.
I'm automatically,

2108
01:49:13,051 --> 01:49:16,620
as you're driving along,
I'm a,

2109
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:21,300
I'm a micro payments industry for paying
for contents directly.

2110
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:25,110
Um,
the internet of things where devices can

2111
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:30,150
buy services online automatically.
Things that you can do with credit

2112
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:32,520
cards.
I think if you start seeing applications

2113
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:35,520
like that to merge and I'm very
confident they're coming because we're

2114
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:39,480
seeing the innovation behind them,
then you can make it something that is

2115
01:49:39,481 --> 01:49:44,481
more needed even in the developed world.
So what,

2116
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:49,780
what do you think could be done to sort
of further this along or to accelerate

2117
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:50,794
this?

2118
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:53,860
Is there anything that can be done?
Um,

2119
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,800
as I said,
I think the third ingredient is making

2120
01:49:56,801 --> 01:50:00,010
it easier for people to use and that's a
matter of innovation and maturity and

2121
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:00,731
we're doing that.
I mean,

2122
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:02,190
that's already happening.
Other than that,

2123
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:04,570
it's just a matter of time,
we just have to wait and be patient

2124
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:07,150
until it happens.
What could be like the steps that can be

2125
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:10,570
taken to make something like bitcoin
easier to use?

2126
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,430
Well,
there's a lot of things to do.

2127
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,080
Um,
user interfaces,

2128
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,030
design,
security,

2129
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:20,260
making backup,
etc. Providing infrastructure services,

2130
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:21,720
exchanges,
uh,

2131
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,790
uh,
your paycheck,

2132
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:29,380
your atm services,
your debit card services,

2133
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:31,660
merchant services,
things like that.

2134
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:32,900
Um,
well,

2135
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:37,030
one of the examples I like to use is I
got on the internet in 1989.

2136
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:42,090
I sent my first emails shortly
thereafter about 1990 and in order to

2137
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:47,890
send my first email I had to have a unix
command line skills,

2138
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:52,891
a login into a unix mainframe with
access to an internet connection at an

2139
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:54,280
academic institution.

2140
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:59,700
And then I worked very hard for about
two days to get the software working.

2141
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,460
And then eventually I sent an email and
then it took a couple of days to cross

2142
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:05,770
the internet.
Right.

2143
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:10,450
And then almost exactly 20 years later,
my mom went,

2144
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:14,200
swipe and did the same thing on her
ipad.

2145
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,240
So when you take,
you know,

2146
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:21,530
two days of compiling software writing
complex unix command,

2147
01:51:21,531 --> 01:51:24,340
sending an email,
it takes a while to get across the

2148
01:51:24,341 --> 01:51:29,341
internet and then 20 years later that's
down to swipe when we can take a coin

2149
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:32,350
from after install a wallet to
understand what it is,

2150
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:35,970
the qr code of the bitcoin address and
how do I back it up and secure it,

2151
01:51:35,971 --> 01:51:37,960
et cetera,
and you turn that into swipe.

2152
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:42,070
Then we'll be ready.
But there isn't there a vast difference

2153
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:44,740
though between something like email,
which is not just a disruptive

2154
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:47,560
technology but a completely new
innovation.

2155
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,000
The ability to send things wirelessly
through the air or even wired like

2156
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:57,030
electronic mail did not exist but.
But males but mail did.

2157
01:51:58,541 --> 01:52:00,280
I mean it was just a change in the
medium.

2158
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:04,270
Essentially you're doing correspondence
but it's so much easier and more

2159
01:52:04,271 --> 01:52:07,150
convenient.
Whereas like using a credit card right

2160
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:10,390
now is fairly convenient for gas or
online banking.

2161
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:14,820
Fairly convenient for people who have
credit cards and now that's,

2162
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:17,710
that's where the numbers really benefit
bitcoin because we're,

2163
01:52:17,711 --> 01:52:21,640
we're in the age of the internet and
instead of economic inclusion becoming

2164
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:25,660
crater instead of more people around the
world having ready access to these

2165
01:52:25,661 --> 01:52:28,870
technologies,
we're seeing entire country's getting

2166
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:32,620
cut off from economic inclusion.
The banking system is not expanding as

2167
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:37,330
fast to reach these populations.
And there's this vast gap left and this

2168
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:41,380
gap is several billion people into that
gap.

2169
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:45,800
You can fit anyone who has access to
even a rudimentary,

2170
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:50,990
a feature phone or smartphone with a
very basic level of data service.

2171
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:55,670
Um,
so the level at which you need to have

2172
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:58,580
technology in order to,
for someone to adopt bitcoin and

2173
01:52:58,581 --> 01:53:03,560
immediately become in themselves,
a global bank in the back pocket of

2174
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:08,561
their pants compare to the level that
you would need to reach before jpmorgan

2175
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:16,510
chase built a branch within their area
and offer them services after going

2176
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:20,890
through a very careful verification of
their identity and blah,

2177
01:53:20,891 --> 01:53:21,201
blah,
blah,

2178
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:21,800
blah,
blah.

2179
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,970
That's never gonna happen.
So we're going to get to leapfrogging

2180
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:29,420
effect,
just like in many places in africa.

2181
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:33,230
The first leapfrog a event we saw that
was noted upon people wrote books about

2182
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:36,140
this is the fact that in many places in
africa,

2183
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:41,470
landlines were never deployed because
the the difficulty to actually extend

2184
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,740
landlines was so high that when cell
phones came along,

2185
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:49,730
at some point it became easier to just
go directly to cell phones and bypass

2186
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:52,670
that entire generation of technology.
Right?

2187
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So we're expecting an.
I certainly see it as very possible to

2188
01:53:58,071 --> 01:54:00,650
see a leap frogging and economic
inclusion,

2189
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,820
the ability for people to join the
internet of money long before they ever

2190
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:09,020
see a bank.
The end result is it's not just about

2191
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,480
banking,
the unbanked,

2192
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:15,050
it's about debunking all of us.
Banking is an application.

2193
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:19,040
You don't need an institution,
you just need an application.

2194
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:21,500
And that that transition is pretty
powerful.

2195
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:25,440
Is there any concern that people would
take people's phones and hold them at

2196
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:27,690
gunpoint and just steal all their
bitcoin?

2197
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:30,450
Like if that's all you own,
like if you have a wallet,

2198
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:34,390
that wallet is all you own.
If you're on bitcoin 20 years from now,

2199
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:37,680
whatever it is,
and that's your entire financial

2200
01:54:37,681 --> 01:54:41,520
portfolio exists in your phone and
someone can come along and force you at

2201
01:54:41,521 --> 01:54:44,250
gunpoint to transfer that over their
phone and then they take off in the

2202
01:54:44,251 --> 01:54:44,830
night.

2203
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:45,580
Yeah.
Uh,

2204
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:47,860
well,
first of all already today,

2205
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:51,040
you wouldn't keep your entire financial
portfolio on your phone.

2206
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,800
I certainly don't.
Um,

2207
01:54:52,990 --> 01:54:57,580
there are a number of very convenient
and easy to use devices that allow you

2208
01:54:57,581 --> 01:55:02,050
to store your bitcoin securely on an
offline device.

2209
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:04,090
Um,
I have a couple of my bag,

2210
01:55:04,091 --> 01:55:07,270
I might show them to you later,
which you might,

2211
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,220
but you might not mean if you want to
show them to you now,

2212
01:55:09,221 --> 01:55:10,240
you might just say,
okay,

2213
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:11,163
let's see.

2214
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:16,510
The way you said it was just like
teasing me.

2215
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,290
This is for people at home that are
listening to this.

2216
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:23,800
You're like,
I don't know what to make of this.

2217
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:27,530
I didn't want to get wrapped up in the,
uh,

2218
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:32,080
headphones for it.
And why is that?

2219
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:35,950
So this is a device that a lot of people
in bitcoin are familiar with.

2220
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:37,210
Can we see that?
Yeah.

2221
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,940
Yeah.
So this is called a bitcoin tresor.

2222
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:42,420
It looks like one of those things,
those old ladies press when they fall

2223
01:55:42,421 --> 01:55:43,560
down.
Yes.

2224
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,310
I've fallen

2225
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:48,420
and I can't get out.
Yes,

2226
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:49,920
it's a bit different.
Um,

2227
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:53,250
so this is a usb device.
I can connect it to my computer.

2228
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,061
Can I see it?
Yes,

2229
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:55,130
please.
Well,

2230
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:56,580
all your money now.
So I feel weird.

2231
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:59,430
You don't have all my money.
You have got it.

2232
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:04,140
So I have a,
I have a backup of that device and this

2233
01:56:04,141 --> 01:56:08,040
is where what I mentioned before is this
12 to 24 word backup that I have,

2234
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,380
which means that if I lose that device,
um,

2235
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:15,840
I can recreate.
It's on my backup device which I'm

2236
01:56:15,841 --> 01:56:16,720
carrying here.
Alright.

2237
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,120
The second one,
I have a second one.

2238
01:56:18,121 --> 01:56:23,121
I actually have four of these and you
can transfer that 24 words seed to any

2239
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:26,880
device you want and it will immediately
have access to all of your money.

2240
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:28,320
It would render this.
No.

2241
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:30,240
Yes.
Well,

2242
01:56:30,241 --> 01:56:33,270
I mean it won't render this one now
because it can coexist on all of them,

2243
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:37,200
but that one has a pin number and a pass
phrase that you have to put in.

2244
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:40,370
He would not be able to break into that
device could.

2245
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,150
Yeah.
Maybe most people can't.

2246
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,370
I'm good at that shit dude.
Yeah.

2247
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:49,200
Excellent.
But is it possible that someone could

2248
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:53,010
figure out a way to crack your 24 word
code?

2249
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:54,450
No,
no,

2250
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:55,740
no.
You say that man,

2251
01:56:55,741 --> 01:56:56,920
don't say that online.
I,

2252
01:56:56,950 --> 01:57:00,480
I say that fucking hackers man,
they take that shit as a challenge.

2253
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:03,000
Never say you can't hack me.
Here's the thing.

2254
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:08,130
Bitcoin in itself is the world's largest
bug bounty and this is something that

2255
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:14,930
most people have been realized,
but bounty a bug bounty is when a

2256
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:17,520
manufacturer of a piece of software,
for example,

2257
01:57:17,521 --> 01:57:21,510
puts out a bunting bounty and says,
I'll give you a $10,000 if you find a

2258
01:57:21,511 --> 01:57:24,900
bug in my software that someone could
exploit to break my software.

2259
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:28,260
Apple does bug bounties.
Google does bug bounties.

2260
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:30,690
A lot of companies do these bug
bounties.

2261
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,870
It's very wise and it's great because
what they do is that way they.

2262
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:37,080
They find these,
they have professional packers really

2263
01:57:37,081 --> 01:57:39,660
who go in and break the software and
it's legal.

2264
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,480
They do it perfectly.
Yeah,

2265
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:46,410
but another way to look at this is the
bitcoin has 10 to $12,000,000,000 of

2266
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:50,040
market capitalization behind it and if
you can find a way to break,

2267
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:54,390
say my 24 words seed,
you have access to my money,

2268
01:57:54,391 --> 01:57:59,391
so my money is the bounty that sitting
behind that bug and this means that

2269
01:58:00,301 --> 01:58:05,301
bitcoin is being tested and has been
tested every single day of his seven

2270
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:08,880
year existence with an ever increasing
jack bolt at the end of it,

2271
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:13,560
which is why you see bitcoin exchanges.
When they don't do good security,

2272
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:18,000
they get hacked and whoever hacks them
gets the bounty,

2273
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:21,210
but bitcoin itself,
which has the biggest bounty of them all

2274
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:25,650
remains secure and the reason to remain
secure,

2275
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:26,760
it's not magical.

2276
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:30,930
It's about spreading out the risk in
such a way that there is no single

2277
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:33,450
points you can put your thumb on and
attack.

2278
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,280
So anyway,
this little device,

2279
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:39,480
these types of devices,
there are ones that have a fingerprint

2280
01:58:39,481 --> 01:58:44,020
scanner on them that are easy to use
there or they come in various form

2281
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:46,330
factors.
We call these hardware wallets.

2282
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:51,340
And what's interesting about this is
that the bitcoin keys that control my

2283
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:56,341
bitcoin are created on this device.
They remain on this device and this

2284
01:58:56,681 --> 01:59:01,390
device signs transactions,
which means I can take it and I can plug

2285
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:04,240
it into this laptop and if this laptop
is compromised,

2286
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:08,140
I don't care,
it will not be able to compromise this.

2287
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:12,130
I can take this and I can plug it in to
the,

2288
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:16,900
you know those desktops they have in
hotel lobbies where you can print your

2289
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:18,730
boarding pass.
Okay.

2290
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:22,130
Consider that the cesspool of computing
you.

2291
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:25,800
You go there.
That thing has 25 different viruses

2292
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,490
fighting for dominance,
right?

2293
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:32,110
Once you plug into device,
they start tearing each other apart,

2294
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:36,520
trying to get to your device.
I can plug this in there and make a

2295
01:59:36,521 --> 01:59:40,390
bitcoin transaction and not have to
worry about that because the keys stay

2296
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:42,220
on here,
right.

2297
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:44,140
And no one can figure out a virus for
one of those.

2298
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,060
Well,
that's the thing.

2299
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:48,520
This is designed specifically to have a
very,

2300
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:53,521
very narrow well defined interface.
So the only thing you can send to it is

2301
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:56,740
a bitcoin transaction.
It then displays that bitcoin

2302
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:59,380
transaction on the screen and I can
decide,

2303
01:59:59,381 --> 02:00:01,600
is that who I actually wanted to pay?
Yes.

2304
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:03,730
Confirm.
And then I've paid them and nobody else.

2305
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:08,760
Is it impossible to integrate a virus
into a bitcoin transaction code messages

2306
02:00:09,851 --> 02:00:12,280
and certain software or wasn't that
would,

2307
02:00:12,281 --> 02:00:13,660
uh,
al qaeda was doing.

2308
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:17,530
They were sending pictures and inside
the actual digital image,

2309
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:21,580
the ones and zeros,
there were encoding actual information

2310
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:25,600
that you could read and you can embed
data differences.

2311
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:29,830
You can't execute that data because this
thing will not execute the data it

2312
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:34,390
receives in the transaction.
It simply runs a fingerprint function on

2313
02:00:34,391 --> 02:00:37,960
it and signs it.
So yes,

2314
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:41,800
the point of this is that jamie's
incredulous look at them.

2315
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:44,680
Yeah.
Seems like it's,

2316
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,500
you're setting a rule that's going to be
broken in a month.

2317
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,070
Like,
yeah,

2318
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:51,760
I can't do it today,
but next week we figured it out and now

2319
02:00:51,761 --> 02:00:53,020
we're,
well,

2320
02:00:53,021 --> 02:00:53,561
I,
you know,

2321
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:55,300
I've had this device now for three
years.

2322
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:57,280
Um,
this is one of the first additions.

2323
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:58,740
Um,
I,

2324
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:02,590
I keep my bitcoin on there,
um,

2325
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:07,390
and I haven't had a problem yet.
I don't put my money on exchanges.

2326
02:01:07,391 --> 02:01:10,810
I keep it on devices like this,
which is why I haven't had low money

2327
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:11,644
stolen.

2328
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,550
The point of this is not to make it more
secure,

2329
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:19,030
although it does,
it's to make security easy for someone

2330
02:01:19,031 --> 02:01:22,480
who's not technical.
I could create a whole elaborate system

2331
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,540
as security experts to secure my
bitcoins.

2332
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:29,170
That was never a problem.
The point of this devices that you can

2333
02:01:29,171 --> 02:01:31,630
secure your bitcoin,
my mum could insecure her bitcoin

2334
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:35,710
without really knowing how,
but just simply following how this

2335
02:01:35,711 --> 02:01:39,220
works.
So it takes security packages,

2336
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:41,870
attendant device and simplifies it
dramatically.

2337
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:44,150
Um,
that kind of thing.

2338
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:48,440
Here's the other question you asked me.
What happens if someone points a gun at

2339
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:49,274
you?
Right?

2340
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:52,870
We call that the $5 wrench solution.
It's like,

2341
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:55,100
should we build a $10,000 super.
It's,

2342
02:01:55,101 --> 02:01:59,810
it's from a cartoon by randall monroe
and xkcd says,

2343
02:01:59,811 --> 02:02:03,020
should we build a 10,000 supercomputer
to crack his encryption?

2344
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:04,101
Um,
no.

2345
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:06,590
Here's a $5 wrench.
Just beat him until he tells you what

2346
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:07,424
the password is.

2347
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:13,680
Um,
so resistance to that is difficult,

2348
02:02:13,911 --> 02:02:17,540
but one of the things that these devices
have in an all the systems in bitcoin

2349
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:22,070
have is duress passwords.
So you can put a small amount of bitcoin

2350
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:26,250
in a specific accounts that opens with a
different password and so shouldn't know

2351
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:29,900
so that people know,
get the mother fucker.

2352
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:32,060
You gave me the duress password.
Yeah,

2353
02:02:32,061 --> 02:02:36,380
but they don't know which one is which.
And this is a well known technique and

2354
02:02:36,381 --> 02:02:41,180
we absolutely recommend using that as
part of it.

2355
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,920
Listen,
when I go to a country,

2356
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:45,950
uh,
where security isn't as good,

2357
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:51,400
right?
I carry my cash in a money belt or leave

2358
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:56,831
it back at the hotel in a safe.
But I also carry a bundle of notes,

2359
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:58,880
high value notes like the equivalent of
say,

2360
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:02,570
$50 here in the United States in my
front pocket.

2361
02:03:03,110 --> 02:03:06,530
And if somebody comes at me,
pulls out a knife and says,

2362
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:11,531
give me your money,
I will hand them my phone is a throwaway

2363
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:12,050
cash.

2364
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:14,840
I haven't in my front pocket.
And I will walk away from that.

2365
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:17,450
Listen to this podcast,
they're going to know this motherfucker

2366
02:03:17,451 --> 02:03:19,480
as a belt.
And that's real ludas.

2367
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:20,660
There you go.
That's it.

2368
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:23,660
So I mean this is something a lot of
people do,

2369
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,290
right?
Yeah,

2370
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:27,020
I'm sure.
And that's why roberts are aware of it.

2371
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:30,170
Yeah.
But for the most part they'll take the

2372
02:03:30,171 --> 02:03:32,070
cash that you hand them in runaway
probably.

2373
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:33,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2374
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:36,950
I can't help thinking like,
although these little devices that

2375
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:40,430
you're storing your bitcoin on look
elegant in 2016,

2376
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:43,400
I can't help thinking that they're just
going to be like those gordon gekko

2377
02:03:43,401 --> 02:03:46,160
giant brick phones when he was walking
around the beach looking like a pimp

2378
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:48,440
from wall street.
Remember that movie that they are,

2379
02:03:48,441 --> 02:03:50,450
that they're like,
he's holding that big ass.

2380
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:54,230
They are,
that people will be watching this show,

2381
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,260
you know,
a decade from now laughing at laughing

2382
02:03:57,261 --> 02:03:57,980
at those things.

2383
02:03:57,980 --> 02:03:59,240
And that's fine.
Because guess what,

2384
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:00,810
I,
I just found a photo yesterday.

2385
02:04:00,811 --> 02:04:03,690
I was looking through some of my files.
I just found a photo of me.

2386
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:04,543
Yes,
thank you.

2387
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:08,990
Look at him like a pimp with that big
stupid phone.

2388
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:14,170
I found a photo of me on the 1991 with a
leather,

2389
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:19,990
a side carrier with one of those in that
holster,

2390
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,820
right?
One of those brick phones.

2391
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:27,080
I think it was second generation.
Motorola was about this big document,

2392
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:29,660
like ruin your hip.
Like all that weight.

2393
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:30,713
Okay.
That.

2394
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:32,240
Yeah,
I was,

2395
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:35,150
I was uh,
I was a sophomore in college.

2396
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:39,830
It's like 1991 first cell phone.
So just come out.

2397
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:41,220
I'm in computer science.
I'm a geek.

2398
02:04:41,221 --> 02:04:43,690
I love gadgets.
So I go by one of the first cell phones.

2399
02:04:43,691 --> 02:04:48,090
It cost me an arm and a leg.
I paid like $5 a minute to make calls on

2400
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:49,890
it.
It's like $2,000,

2401
02:04:49,930 --> 02:04:54,150
right?
I think I paid something like 750 pounds

2402
02:04:54,151 --> 02:04:57,420
sterling at the time.
It's probably about a thousand bucks for

2403
02:04:57,421 --> 02:04:59,940
a thing like this.
Who's battery lasted an hour.

2404
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,710
Batteries.
Just so terrible.

2405
02:05:04,711 --> 02:05:08,040
I've got a fantastic photo of me with
the leather holster with that.

2406
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:11,190
My and I looked so cool.
Can I see it?

2407
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,510
No,
I don't have it with me.

2408
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:14,610
You don't have a physical photo
somewhere.

2409
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,890
I actually found the physical photo.
I haven't digitized them yet.

2410
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:19,650
When you do,
please send it my way.

2411
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,431
I will.
Absolutely.

2412
02:05:20,431 --> 02:05:25,431
It was straight up on instagram.
I also have poofy hair in the front and

2413
02:05:25,741 --> 02:05:30,150
I'm wearing a ridiculous shirt.
You were pimpin 1991.

2414
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,970
Nineteen 90 nature college.
Yeah,

2415
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:34,410
I understand.
I understand.

2416
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,960
So yeah,
it will look ridiculous.

2417
02:05:36,961 --> 02:05:41,961
But the point that you make so well is
that we did go from gordon gecko to the

2418
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:48,980
right and and we're going to do that
again in the bitcoin technology.

2419
02:05:49,891 --> 02:05:51,510
This isn't something that's standing
still.

2420
02:05:51,511 --> 02:05:53,520
The amount of innovation that's
happening today,

2421
02:05:53,521 --> 02:05:56,430
even though it's not mainstream yet,
is staggering.

2422
02:05:56,820 --> 02:06:00,900
I work in this space full time.
All I do is read about what is new in

2423
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:04,320
bitcoin and that's a full time job.
How many people are there like you?

2424
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:06,080
Are you the only one like this?
No,

2425
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:07,200
no.
Absolutely not.

2426
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:11,040
The only one who's this integrated.
No,

2427
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:13,140
absolutely not.
There a bunch of people like you.

2428
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,810
Yeah.
There's probably about a thousand people

2429
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,000
like you who are doing this.
Yeah.

2430
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,650
Who were living off bitcoin constantly
investigating big corn,

2431
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:25,050
reading about it all the time.
Lecturing and writing books about

2432
02:06:25,051 --> 02:06:25,710
bitcoin.
Well,

2433
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:29,100
not so many lecturing and writing books
about it or speaking of conferences,

2434
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:32,190
but there's 100 to 200 who are doing
that too.

2435
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:34,680
Yes.
One hundred to 200.

2436
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:37,590
Yeah.
Maybe you should talk to the other 199.

2437
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:40,740
Maybe they make better guests out there.
You

2438
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:42,931
know,
I,

2439
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:43,764
there's,
I,

2440
02:06:43,790 --> 02:06:45,660
I'm not claiming any special mental
here.

2441
02:06:45,661 --> 02:06:49,350
There's lots of people who are very much
into it as I am and it is a full time

2442
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:51,570
job and because so much is happening.

2443
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,321
So yes,
you're right.

2444
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:55,080
These devices will seem antiquated.
What this shows,

2445
02:06:55,081 --> 02:06:58,260
however,
is that when I came on the show the

2446
02:06:58,261 --> 02:07:00,690
first time,
I think about three years ago,

2447
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:05,280
um,
I didn't yet have one of these and I

2448
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:09,330
used to store my bitcoin on what was
called a paper wallet,

2449
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:14,750
which is basically where I print out the
digital keys with a convoluted process

2450
02:07:15,181 --> 02:07:18,530
to make sure my computer that's doing
the printing isn't compromised because

2451
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:22,440
then they're compromised and then send
the money to those digital keys and then

2452
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:25,290
put those in a vault in a safe deposit
box in a,

2453
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:28,590
in a safe.
And that worked great for two years.

2454
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:32,130
I kept a small amount of bitcoin safe
that way.

2455
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:37,000
Problem is,
it took a lot of expertise to execute on

2456
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:39,310
that.
And there were many ways to get it

2457
02:07:39,311 --> 02:07:41,620
wrong.
So we've progressed.

2458
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:46,240
Now the way you back this up,
as you write down 24 english words,

2459
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:47,380
like how hard is that?

2460
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:50,470
That it shows to you one at a time on
the screen and it tells you,

2461
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:54,910
write them down a runs with software in
a website which has really three or four

2462
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:56,560
buttons.
It's fairly easy to use.

2463
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:01,300
The device itself has two buttons.
I could probably teach my mom how to use

2464
02:08:01,301 --> 02:08:04,330
this and she owns bitcoin so that would
be useful.

2465
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:06,460
But.
And she owns one of these

2466
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:11,800
but it's still not ready.
She probably only use it when you're

2467
02:08:11,801 --> 02:08:12,760
around.
Yeah.

2468
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:16,420
No,
she doesn't use it or get out my little

2469
02:08:16,421 --> 02:08:20,880
goofy fucking bitcoin thing.
Let me pretend I use this for a.

2470
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:23,200
She wouldn't humor me that way.
No,

2471
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,133
no,
no.

2472
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:25,870
So,
um,

2473
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:30,790
the bottom line is that five years from
now this is going to be even simpler and

2474
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:34,000
we keep iterating and maturing of the
technology.

2475
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:37,150
It's not standing still.
And as it gets easier and easier,

2476
02:08:37,151 --> 02:08:38,470
more people come on board.

2477
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:43,030
Not only are they able to use bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies,

2478
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:47,210
but they're able to do it with security
in a way that doesn't require an

2479
02:08:47,211 --> 02:08:50,110
enormous amount of expertise.
And this is the same.

2480
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:53,980
This happened with the internet.
I remember this fantastic show you see

2481
02:08:53,981 --> 02:08:58,330
in 1994 and they've got good morning
America and there's this clip from the

2482
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:01,870
outtakes they're doing before they're
doing this big internet story.

2483
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:05,740
And they have the host chatting amongst
themselves before they started story and

2484
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:08,470
one of them saying,
so what is the intranet?

2485
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:10,150
Is that the um,
email?

2486
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:10,721
No,
no,

2487
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:11,081
no,
no.

2488
02:09:11,081 --> 02:09:14,350
That's just email.
So the outside is the internet.

2489
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:14,741
No,
no,

2490
02:09:14,741 --> 02:09:15,041
no,
no.

2491
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:18,280
The outside is email.
It's the www.

2492
02:09:18,281 --> 02:09:23,000
That's,
that's intranet and dotcom.

2493
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:26,560
That's internet.
And it's going through this process

2494
02:09:26,561 --> 02:09:31,561
where they're trying to grasp this alien
and strange seeming technology and all

2495
02:09:33,131 --> 02:09:37,900
of the terminology is weird.
Let's play this.

2496
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,290
As I was doing that little tease with
the a and then the ring around it.

2497
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:47,800
So that's what I said.
I'm katie said she thought it was about,

2498
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:53,480
but I've never heard of.
Never heard of mark but never heard it

2499
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:55,440
said.
And then it sounded stupid what I said

2500
02:09:55,441 --> 02:10:00,160
and violence at nbc
in the lunch room.

2501
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:05,190
So there is violence@nbcg.com.
I mean alison should know what

2502
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:12,600
that is.
That massive computer network.

2503
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:16,580
The one that's becoming really big now.
What do you mean you.

2504
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,570
How does one know?
What are you right to it?

2505
02:10:18,571 --> 02:10:20,640
Like male,
now a lot of people use it and

2506
02:10:20,641 --> 02:10:22,950
communicate it.
I guess they can communicate with nbc

2507
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,360
writers and producers.
Allison,

2508
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:28,260
can you explain what internet is?
She can't say anything in 10 seconds or

2509
02:10:28,261 --> 02:10:31,950
less.
Alison will be in the studio shortly.

2510
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:32,803
What?
What does that mean?

2511
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:36,680
A giant computer network made up,
made up of a startup from.

2512
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:40,320
Tell us what this was.
It's not an.

2513
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:41,790
It's.
It's.

2514
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:44,810
It's a computer billboard,
but it's wide and it's several

2515
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:48,890
universities and everything all joined
together and others could access it and

2516
02:10:48,891 --> 02:10:52,040
it's getting bigger and bigger role.
Just correct it during the quake.

2517
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:54,050
A lot of people,
that's how they were communicating out

2518
02:10:54,051 --> 02:10:56,360
to tell family and loved ones.
They were okay because all the phone

2519
02:10:56,361 --> 02:10:58,430
lines were down and I was telling katie
taught me,

2520
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:00,300
you don't need that.
You don't need to fall in line to

2521
02:11:00,301 --> 02:11:01,320
operate.
No,

2522
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:06,060
so can you show this?
That's awesome.

2523
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:08,290
If you show this to a millennial right
now,

2524
02:11:08,291 --> 02:11:09,840
they're like,
oh,

2525
02:11:10,210 --> 02:11:12,460
94.
That was just before the civil war,

2526
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,860
right?
This is 18.

2527
02:11:14,861 --> 02:11:16,060
Is it 18?
Ninety four.

2528
02:11:16,061 --> 02:11:17,330
Slavery was legal,
right.

2529
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:20,740
They had back then.
It's like they can't even conceive of a

2530
02:11:20,741 --> 02:11:25,741
time when the internet was just so
completely impossible to understand.

2531
02:11:26,860 --> 02:11:30,310
I feel very fortunate that I grew up
without it and got to experience it in

2532
02:11:30,311 --> 02:11:34,750
my twenties.
I experienced it emerge and I was like,

2533
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:36,310
whoa,
what is this?

2534
02:11:36,311 --> 02:11:41,170
But it didn't really have the same sort
of impact on my life that it has on the

2535
02:11:41,171 --> 02:11:45,450
lives of young people today that are
growing up with a word there.

2536
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,380
I mean,
you look at kids today,

2537
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:50,500
you go to a store or go to the mall or
something like that and they go to a

2538
02:11:50,501 --> 02:11:52,300
restaurant,
they're fucking glued to their phone.

2539
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,450
They're glued.
Yeah.

2540
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:56,920
Here comes the prediction.
This generation,

2541
02:11:56,921 --> 02:12:00,580
which is growing up right now,
they'd never know a world without

2542
02:12:00,581 --> 02:12:04,060
internet.
They also never know a world without

2543
02:12:04,061 --> 02:12:08,650
bitcoin.
Now 15 to 18 years from now,

2544
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:12,700
none of them are going to get a driver's
license because there will be no self

2545
02:12:12,701 --> 02:12:17,680
driving cars.
I need one wouldn't be fucking Montana

2546
02:12:17,681 --> 02:12:20,440
where I could drive my own goddamn car
hobby,

2547
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:23,830
a hobby.
It will be a hobby and you'll pay $3,000

2548
02:12:23,831 --> 02:12:25,990
a month in insurance to drive your own
car.

2549
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:28,900
How much?
I think you'll see.

2550
02:12:28,901 --> 02:12:30,700
That's where it's going to go.
Come on.

2551
02:12:30,701 --> 02:12:32,680
I don't know.
Humans behind the wheel,

2552
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,270
grandpa.
That sounds insane.

2553
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:37,090
Thousand dollars a month didn't.
So you're,

2554
02:12:37,091 --> 02:12:38,950
you're going to be telling your
grandchildren.

2555
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:40,450
Yeah.
We use to drive our own cars.

2556
02:12:40,451 --> 02:12:43,360
They say that sounds crazy.
Did hundreds of thousands of people die

2557
02:12:43,361 --> 02:12:44,194
every year?

2558
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:47,110
Yeah,
but we live like men.

2559
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,670
We didn't live in this digital dick.
Like all these other pussies out there.

2560
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:52,653
Yeah,
there you go.

2561
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:57,850
But think about it this way.
Imagine a child born today that never

2562
02:12:57,851 --> 02:12:59,630
sees cash.
No.

2563
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:03,640
Unless they traveled to another country
where they're backwards and they still

2564
02:13:03,641 --> 02:13:06,490
use paper as money,
right?

2565
02:13:06,491 --> 02:13:07,990
Yeah.
It's entirely possible.

2566
02:13:07,991 --> 02:13:11,560
So what seems inconceivable to us then
becomes the norm.

2567
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:14,440
Then it becomes inconceivable to live
without it.

2568
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:17,320
Right.
And then you're trying to explain,

2569
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:21,490
you know,
so what consensus algorithm did the

2570
02:13:21,491 --> 02:13:22,840
federal reserve use?
Oh,

2571
02:13:22,841 --> 02:13:27,310
it's used the 12 white dudes decide for
you consensus.

2572
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:31,980
What is a

2573
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,720
proof of work algorithm?
No,

2574
02:13:33,721 --> 02:13:36,720
no johnny,
it was a proof of war algorithm backed

2575
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:37,554
by oil.

2576
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:42,070
I am happy you exist.
I love having you on the show.

2577
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:45,130
I love talking to.
I love the fact that you have this

2578
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:48,800
beautiful vision of digital currency and
if it works,

2579
02:13:48,850 --> 02:13:52,540
if you're correct and it all pans out,
I think it's going to be amazing.

2580
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,210
I love that.
You know so much about it.

2581
02:13:55,211 --> 02:13:57,310
I love you.
Come on here and educate us.

2582
02:13:57,311 --> 02:14:01,690
I love that every time you come on there
really does seem to be more and more

2583
02:14:01,691 --> 02:14:03,430
progress.
It is tangible.

2584
02:14:03,431 --> 02:14:06,790
It's trackable.
It's interesting and it's fascinating

2585
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:10,240
and I'm all in.
I'm on team bitcoin.

2586
02:14:10,390 --> 02:14:13,300
I'm 100 percent committed.
I really wanted it to happen,

2587
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:15,730
but it's just one of those things,
man.

2588
02:14:15,731 --> 02:14:20,731
It's just entirely fascinating.
And until it absolutely is here,

2589
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:24,490
like credit cards,
like the car,

2590
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:28,240
like all the other things that you were
describing that really didn't exist

2591
02:14:28,241 --> 02:14:30,430
before and now exist almost primarily.

2592
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:32,140
I mean,
I think um,

2593
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:33,763
it's,
it's,

2594
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:37,600
it's absolutely amazing and fascinating.
And again,

2595
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:43,470
in a lot of ways it's a solution for the
control that the federal government,

2596
02:14:44,801 --> 02:14:47,680
the federal reserve,
the bank's end,

2597
02:14:47,681 --> 02:14:51,820
even politicians have over us today that
can control,

2598
02:14:51,821 --> 02:14:54,820
is slowly being eroded by the internet.
Not even slowly,

2599
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,390
pretty rapidly being eroded by the
internet even whenever control

2600
02:14:58,391 --> 02:15:02,590
politicians used to have.
It's not nearly as.

2601
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:06,670
It's not nearly as easy to hide.
It's so much more transparent.

2602
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:10,630
It's so much easier to protest today.
It's just a different realm.

2603
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:14,110
We're living in a different world and
that world is happening incredibly

2604
02:15:14,111 --> 02:15:18,910
rapidly from a I got on in 1994.
You were on before then when it was like

2605
02:15:18,911 --> 02:15:21,700
this really fragile,
strange internet.

2606
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:26,350
I mean you were in the early days.
I'm really fascinated to see what it's

2607
02:15:26,351 --> 02:15:28,480
going to be like 20 years from now and I
really do hope you're right.

2608
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:32,930
Well,
that's one of the beautiful things about

2609
02:15:32,931 --> 02:15:37,310
this is I think if you've experienced
things like this before,

2610
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:42,370
and we're very lucky to be part of a
generation where we have advancements in

2611
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:46,430
technology happening at a rate where you
don't just see one or two,

2612
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:49,580
but you see several in a lifetime,
right?

2613
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:55,080
That are pretty earth shattering in
their complexity and involvement.

2614
02:15:55,131 --> 02:15:58,130
We've seen the internet,
we've seen social media,

2615
02:15:58,131 --> 02:16:00,530
we've seen the miniaturization of
computers.

2616
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:05,950
Now we're going to see self driving cars
and digital currencies and all of these

2617
02:16:06,531 --> 02:16:09,410
other things in a single lifetime.
Once you've seen two or three of these,

2618
02:16:09,411 --> 02:16:14,411
you start capturing the pattern and the
pattern is when it starts,

2619
02:16:15,921 --> 02:16:18,590
everybody ignores it,
makes fun of it.

2620
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:21,590
Can't possibly see how change would
happen.

2621
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:23,300
Right?
Um,

2622
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:27,140
and this happened with the automobile
that happened with electricity.

2623
02:16:27,141 --> 02:16:30,190
It happens with credit cards.
The first time credit cards

2624
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,230
were introduced.
Nobody thought they were going to work

2625
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:35,500
is a crazy,
stupid experiments nobody wanted to take

2626
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:38,320
them.
This happens with every type of

2627
02:16:38,321 --> 02:16:40,450
technology.
It's ridiculed at first,

2628
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:44,830
and then gradually it matures,
it gets less cumbersome to use.

2629
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:48,420
And if it has some,
some fundamental properties,

2630
02:16:48,421 --> 02:16:52,060
some utility,
something that's useful for that's

2631
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:53,080
different,
that's new,

2632
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:55,480
that you can do things with it you
couldn't do before,

2633
02:16:56,050 --> 02:17:00,760
then at some point it hits an inflection
point and it becomes mainstream very,

2634
02:17:00,761 --> 02:17:05,080
very rapidly.
And then everybody is both surprised and

2635
02:17:05,081 --> 02:17:06,640
at the same time claims ownership and
say,

2636
02:17:06,641 --> 02:17:08,890
well,
I always thought that this bitcoin thing

2637
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:10,780
would succeed.
Well,

2638
02:17:10,781 --> 02:17:13,240
let's hope we're those people.
Um,

2639
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,360
this book is available right now.
The internet of money.

2640
