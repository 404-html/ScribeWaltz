1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,210
Holiday bender,
oh Jesus Louisa's.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Are you allowed to say that anymore?
Eventually you won't be allowed to say 

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:10,520
anything.
Duncan Trussell,

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,000
but you know you can do.
You'd say whatever the fuck you want.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:17,001
If you're using a Tang cell phone,
that sounds like a Mitch Hedberg 

6
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,230
punchline.
A tank cell phone thing is a one of our 

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:25,371
favorite sponsors because we've had 
friends that use it and they actually 

8
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,491
enjoy it and they do save money.
It's a way to use a high level cell 

9
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:32,511
phone service sprint.
They buy time on the sprint network and 

10
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,420
but they give it to you at a better 
rate.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,870
They give it to you in a way that's much
more flexible.

12
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,790
They make it so you can cancel anytime 
you want.

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,210
They offer you the highest of high end 
mobile devices and when you go over to 

14
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,910
ting,
according to them,

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,830
I have done no independent study of my 
own.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,620
I should just preface this advertisement
with that.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
Ninety eight percent of people would 
save money with Ting.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,370
They all offer the most high end android
phones that are available like the 

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,250
Samsung Galaxy note three,
which is what I have pretty dope 

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,791
malicious,
or if you're more reasonable person 

21
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,340
perhaps you would go with like the htc 
one or the galaxy s four.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,400
Galaxy has for us probably the perfect 
size phone,

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,520
but I'm a glutton so I needed that big 
fat,

24
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:20,760
stupid,
extra large screen sun,

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,800
uh,
but do it through ting.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,030
Go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot 
com and save yourself 25 bucks.

27
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,180
You could also bring your nexus five 
over to tank if you already have a nexus

28
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,710
five.
If you're a sprint customer,

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,050
you can get a Sim card from them in 
order to bring your device over to ting.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,860
Just go to the bottom of the devices 
page.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,910
Ting doesn't sell the nexus five yet,
but you can purchase one from the Google

32
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,940
play store and easily bring it over to 
ting.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,920
They also accept the iphone four and 
four s from sprint.

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,660
Super easy way to get cell phone service
from a company that's just not trying to

35
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,661
bullshit you and not trying to include 
all sorts of unnecessary charges that 

36
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,860
you can get from a lot of cell phone 
companies.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,440
I feel like I just listened to a Philip 
K,

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,460
Dick expert because like if you think 
about if you jumped back five years,

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,940
if someone heard what you just said,
it would just.

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,950
No one would know what you're talking 
about.

41
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,060
It's true,
right?

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,860
You use 17 words that are all new that 
are just new words.

43
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,770
Cell phone provider.
Your device.

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,960
It's not a phone.
It's device.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,810
Early termination fees.
Yeah.

46
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,590
Etfs,
they call them in the business.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,640
The business you have to.
Big Business Rogan.ting.com.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,760
We're also brought to you finally buy on
it.com.

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,910
This is a light week folks.
We don't want to borden you borden.

50
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:38,600
You burn

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,470
you lizzy board board in burden at the 
same time.

52
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,400
That's borden.
You.

53
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,980
That's a new word.
That's why can't we have a new word when

54
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,990
someone's burdening you and they're 
boring.

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,890
Bored.
Boredom.

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,050
Me,
we made up the word monotony,

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,990
but not to me for a book.
That's a good one.

58
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,070
Monogamy and monotony together.
Yeah,

59
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,470
that's a good one.
I like that.

60
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,190
I just read that boredom is if 
considered in Buddhism a form

61
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
of anger that boredom is one of the 
widows boredom itself or the expression 

62
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,360
of boredom.
Boredom.

63
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390
Boredom is in the boredom.
Falls under the anger umbrella actually 

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,780
because it's a resistance.
Boredom is a,

65
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,030
uh,
you're resisting what's happening in the

66
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:21,031
moment.
Cue The music was talking about this 

67
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:21,400
fucked on a commercial.
Use a codeword Rogan save 10 percent.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,350
I'll finding all supplements.
I do too.

69
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,460
I love it too.
I don't want to talk to you.

70
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,220
Don't do any commercials.
Experience podcast by night.

71
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,840
All Day.
Sorry.

72
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,360
Sweet.
Sweet on it.

73
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,350
I think everybody knows about you by now
on a Dotcom O,

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,010
n,
n I t,

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,990
t boredom.
You were saying Duncan trussell is a 

76
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,731
form of anger.
I was listening to this Jack Kornfield 

77
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,730
audio book and he was saying that 
boredom.

78
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,800
That ain't that boredom is part is it 
comes from anger because it's resistance

79
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,450
to what is when you're bored.

80
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,830
You're resisting what's happening and 
that's a form of anger.

81
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,390
It's in the family of anger.
Tell it to the dude.

82
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,660
Been in solitary confinement for five 
years.

83
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,420
I'd be fucking pissed you.
Yeah.

84
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,640
I think that guy needs to stretch out 
that definition a bit,

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,820
a little bit.
Reasonable boredom,

86
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,230
you know?
Have you ever taken an ear beating from 

87
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,230
somebody that's not anger,
that's your board?

88
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,250
Oh,
it's totally real,

89
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,310
but it's always resistance.
Like if you're experiencing boredom,

90
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,860
you're resisting what's happening.
You don't want to be there.

91
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,740
That's what border but isn't resistance 
sometimes.

92
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,900
Exactly the right thing to be doing 
mean.

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,620
There's a passivity at the heart of some
Buddhist scholarship that I find 

94
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,701
irritating.
That is something I used to think and I 

95
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:41,701
disagree with that now because I think 
that you.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,020
You definitely.
It's not like suddenly you're like,

97
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,420
I'm just going to be in every situation 
that I'm in.

98
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,770
It's just that instead of being in a 
situation experiencing that,

99
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,860
if what you're saying is the idea that 
the only thing that will motivate people

100
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,530
to change is pain and the idea is like,
no,

101
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,660
that's an illusion.
That's not what you need.

102
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,370
You don't need pain too.
If you.

103
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,480
If I'm in a house that's on fire,
I'm going to get out of the house before

104
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,850
the fire burns me.
I don't need a feeling,

105
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,270
a physical experience of pain and 
boredom,

106
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,550
desire,
anger,

107
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,860
all of these things.
If you really feel them,

108
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,440
it's not the greatest feeling.
It's never a great feeling.

109
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,441
It's always either a forum.
It's like an itchiness or a sense of 

110
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,290
just wanting to get out of where you're 
at,

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,150
but if you really want to get out of 
where you're at,

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,360
the best thing to do is to calm yourself
so you can get into a nice tranquil 

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,280
state and then get out of the situation.
You don't need the addition of a kind of

114
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,860
psychic heartburn,
which is what boredom is.

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,610
I'm full of psychic heartburn.
The worst when people are giving me your

116
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,630
beatings,
I know it can be doing something more 

117
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,630
pleasurable.
I,

118
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,630
I,
I just,

119
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,630
I can't take it.
I,

120
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,890
yeah,
I,

121
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:46,750
yeah,
and that's,

122
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,690
that is a,
um,

123
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,100
that's exactly like the idea is if we,
if you can,

124
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,550
if we can dissolve that,
that sense of resistance,

125
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,010
then it doesn't mean that you're going 
to be getting ear beatings from now

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,470
until infinity.
It's just when the ir beatings come,

127
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
you only be experiencing the pain of the
ear beatings and not the internal 

128
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,911
mirroring of that pain as you 
desperately try to get out of the 

129
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,100
situation by saying you have to use the 
bathroom for the ninth time.

130
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:18,101
And some people at the comedy store 
think I have like a serious bladder 

131
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:18,101
issue because

132
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,670
I gotTa Piss.
Dude,

133
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,700
can you excuse me?
I gotTa Piss you guys.

134
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,240
Do you know who Juliet b?
No,

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,490
she's French actors.
Beautiful French actors know.

136
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,480
Uh,
you've seen her.

137
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:36,481
You would know the name.
I've seen these in the unbearable 

138
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,911
lightness of being.
It's one of those names that I've never 

139
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:40,300
actually heard set out loud.
Be impeccable franchise.

140
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,340
Beautiful.
Isn't that beautiful the way it's been 

141
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,340
now?
But no,

142
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,650
I don't think I've ever see.
See,

143
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,190
I've only seen it written down.
Yeah.

144
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,900
Well anyway,
I met her in this weird story.

145
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:53,680
I was speaking at this event like a Ted 
style event in Toronto.

146
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,720
It's called idea city.
And uh,

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,130
the day I was supposed to speak Deepak 
Chopra was there,

148
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,990
all these big shots.
The day I was supposed to speak,

149
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,330
I told my wife because soda,
I'm just going to sleep in today.

150
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,620
Just let me sleep.
You go ahead,

151
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,480
go to listen to the lectures,
whatever.

152
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,140
And I'm gonna Hang.

153
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,220
Okay,
fine.

154
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,990
So she goes down.
Ten minutes later she's back up from the

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,290
room.
She says Julia had been,

156
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,710
she's downstairs having breakfast and 
she wants to meet you like Julia B.

157
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,510
No,
she wants to meet me.

158
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,380
Are you kidding?
No,

159
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:25,381
not really.
So I get out of bed and brush my teeth 

160
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,901
or anything.
I called downstairs and I immediately 

161
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,620
sense that she doesn't really want to 
meet me,

162
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:34,621
which she wants to do is sleep with my 
wife and my wife is completely 

163
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,100
misinterpreted everything and I'm 
barging in on this thing.

164
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,390
And,
and I started talking to her about the 

165
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,390
unbearable lightness of being this great
film.

166
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,201
She was in based on an amazing book and 
how this book sort of changed my life 

167
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,220
because it got me this job and all this 
weird shit and as I'm telling the story,

168
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,290
she's reaches over.
She's looking right at me.

169
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:55,291
She reaches over and she just touches 
her blackberry and 30 seconds later it 

170
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,320
starts ringing and she picks it up and 
she goes,

171
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,980
oh,
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:57,230
I have to.

173
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,560
Wow.
I was like,

174
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,220
ah,
yeah.

175
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:01,880
Okay.
I,

176
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,320
you know,
fine.

177
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:08,321
Right.
I'm not offended whenever I have done 

178
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,271
the same thing,
but I was really done the same thing 

179
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:10,271
though.
Oh yeah.

180
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,270
I wouldn't have said like,
I got to go pee for the ninth time.

181
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:16,271
This hour with Dunkin's doesn't seem 
like you're just throwing you under the 

182
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:18,270
bus.
No,

183
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,900
no.
Just saying it's the same phenomenon.

184
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,860
And I was on the other end of it and it 
was just at a different level.

185
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,110
It's escape hatches built in boring 
conversation because I know I'm going to

186
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,310
be talking to this dummy,
so why is that?

187
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:40,190
Not In the.
I'm sure it existed three,

188
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,390
but you need like a satellite,
a three button click or like five clicks

189
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,400
or taps out up with the volume and 
starts calling you in 30 seconds you 

190
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,290
would know or you just get busted 
immediately.

191
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,430
Everyone know like,
wait a minute.

192
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,431
What was that?
Did you don't touch your phone when I'm 

193
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:57,431
talking to you?
Right?

194
00:08:57,431 --> 00:09:02,031
Ultimately could never really,
truly be successful is if it became 

195
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,720
successful.
People know and it wouldn't work anymore

196
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:04,800
and you have to stop.
Wait a minute,

197
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,980
okay.
You program it yourself that way.

198
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,460
It's a different pattern all the time.
Nobody would know or a key word that 

199
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,421
Siri hears you say eventually triggers.
Eventually funds are going to be so 

200
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:20,640
smart that it's going to not want to get
an ear beating.

201
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,350
Like it's gonna.

202
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,800
It's gonna.
Call you and be like,

203
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,390
dude,
we gotta get Outta here,

204
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,740
man.
This is horrible.

205
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,850
Oh,
I thought you meant from,

206
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,110
you know the phone.
His cell phone will be like,

207
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,960
dude,
what did you think we were saying?

208
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,020
That's what I thought would be smart 
enough to be tired of listening to your 

209
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,820
stupid shit that that's what I feel like
with the NSA.

210
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:48,740
It's whoever's monitoring what they 
fucking deserve.

211
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,110
Every fucking morning they wake up and 
like,

212
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:57,111
look at a garden and then go to watch 
him jerk off fucking porn all day again.

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,750
Are you seriously idiot?
The idea that there is one person that's

214
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,850
actually watching everyone 
mathematically

215
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,940
possible.
The idea is that their store,

216
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:18,941
but it is a dirty thing to do,
to just store everyone's everything in 

217
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,740
some database somewhere.
It's a dirty thing to do.

218
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,710
Tell people that you're doing it too.
It promotes this massive state of 

219
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,781
paranoia almost instantaneously because 
you're doing it without letting anybody 

220
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,801
know that you're doing it and then 
you're denying its existence and it's 

221
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,621
ultimately proved to be true.
All of those things are very bad for 

222
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,680
public confidence and all of those 
things.

223
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,290
When,
when,

224
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,320
when they take place,
what's.

225
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,180
What's gross about it is that you did 
it.

226
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,270
You had the possibility to do it.
That's technological.

227
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,890
That's unavoidable,
but you did it.

228
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,440
You wouldn't just copied everybody's 
everything.

229
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:54,530
It's stored it and then he had denied it
when it came out,

230
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:59,531
like in principle.
It's a fascinating trend because it's a 

231
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,100
trend of a disillusion of boundaries.

232
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,830
The connection between a person and an 
idea,

233
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,980
a person,
a piece of information is becoming more 

234
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,040
and more instantaneous.
Whether it's a google search with it's.

235
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,070
I think that this is just a subtle 
victim of this overlying trend in 

236
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,540
technology of bringing people and 
information closer and closer together.

237
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:17,930
It's,
oh,

238
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,860
it's almost unavoidable,
but it just sucks that it had to be done

239
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,530
by the people that are supposedly 
protecting us,

240
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,550
supposedly watching over us like,
wait a minute,

241
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:29,840
how old are you,
Joe?

242
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:32,840
You don't believe they're protecting us 
and watching over time,

243
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,100
but,
but who does?

244
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,990
But it's the narrative is the narrative 
is the day propel that rent,

245
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,790
that narrative comes up every four 
years.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It comes up in various speeches that 
when the president gives speeches and 

247
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,410
people will pretend that drops news and 
CNN legs are heroes.

248
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,630
They pretend that these are legitimate.
We were all on the mainstream news 

249
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,321
sources,
so you almost have to address it in a 

250
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,961
way.
You almost have to at least pay it some 

251
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,170
service just to diffuse it.
Did you see that?

252
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,550
The NSA logo,
that

253
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,710
flying around fucking.
They're like not trying to pretend 

254
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:11,710
they're protecting us.
They're like,

255
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,151
no.
Put a evil octopus devouring Earth Vr 

256
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:16,850
logo.
Fuck you.

257
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,990
Snowden.
Yeah.

258
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,110
It's a fucking demon.
Octupus cracking from space to space 

259
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:23,960
cracking.

260
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,030
Oh,
could you imagine if there were space 

261
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,810
crackings?
Could you imagine if we had been all 

262
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,211
this time we had never been found,
but the universe is literally like an 

263
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,740
ocean and it just takes time for one of 
those fucking flying fish to to realize,

264
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,000
oh,
I can eat this one.

265
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,150
Just success up.
Socking things out of the atmosphere.

266
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,190
We're like a speck of plankton.
We find out we're actually in a notion 

267
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,310
dark matter.
It's just water.

268
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,820
It's just the we're.
We're in some strange state and that's 

269
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:50,820
the way emotions.
Yeah,

270
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,340
I mean there,
there are less believable scenarios.

271
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,140
There's not real water,
but there's dark matter water.

272
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,230
Nothing is beyond our reach.
Jesus Christ.

273
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:02,200
That's weird.
That's weird,

274
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,680
but it may,
maybe it's fake.

275
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:08,681
Is that phony?
Because that went flying all over the 

276
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,811
place and made me think I.
I just seems like I like it because 

277
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:11,240
people at the NSA or like,
you know what,

278
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,940
let's just fuck with a stoner.
Let's do it.

279
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,960
They're already paranoid.
Let's make him super fucking parents 

280
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:19,960
already.
A bunch of shit

281
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,120
gives fuel to the super paranoid.
Like the fucking I on the dollar bill.

282
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,080
All that weird Egyptian iconography,
Shit.

283
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,940
All that.
The,

284
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:30,330
the,
the,

285
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,240
the mason stuff,
the,

286
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,320
all that weirdness,
man.

287
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,360
Yeah.
E pluribus unum.

288
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,680
Yeah.
There's a lot of weirdness on,

289
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,470
on just money itself

290
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,190
and it's hilarious because all,
I don't know what it is,

291
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,460
but having been on your podcast enough 
times and like rambled about free 

292
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,020
masons,
inevitably some loon will send a message

293
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:54,920
or post something on my board that's 
like a,

294
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,960
are you a pawn of the new World Order 
Dunkin?

295
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,210
It's like,
I know I'm not upon of the new world 

296
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,210
order,
but it's funny to think,

297
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,970
Oh wow,
I what that Weirdo is doing to me.

298
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,250
I'm doing to the government,
you know,

299
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,540
like it's all just this endless state of
like,

300
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,800
we'll never figure it out.
You'll never figure out who's behind the

301
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,801
whole thing,
but it is funny how easily people will 

302
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:23,011
assemble Ed Arctic bits of information 
like that shit with Terence Mckenna 

303
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:25,660
being in the fucking CIA.
Are you kidding me,

304
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,920
man?
Really?

305
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,740
Terence Mckenna,
Mushroom Mckenna,

306
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,780
God of mushrooms.
The CIA is like,

307
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,830
let's,
let's use this guy as well.

308
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,790
Our spokesperson.

309
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,330
Well,
you know,

310
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:39,830
there was a cia guy going around helping
with distribution of LSD.

311
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Without a doubt.
There's been a lot of people that were 

312
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,281
in the psychedelic community.
Their problem is that yawns statements 

313
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:53,021
about Mckenna have been dismissed by 
everyone who's listened to the 

314
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:55,580
recordings that has half a brain that he
was joking.

315
00:14:55,581 --> 00:15:00,581
It was a sense of humor.
He was talking about the alien 

316
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,881
intelligence and the mushroom and the 
mushroom recruiting him as a 

317
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,220
spokesperson.
That's what he was talking about and I,

318
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,990
I hadn't heard that is yawns take on.
It is literal law.

319
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,420
Yawns take on the recruiting for the 
FBI,

320
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,710
which look,
I don't know.

321
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,740
You don't know,
but if you have to look at is what is 

322
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:17,740
most likely?
Well,

323
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,920
if that's your only piece of evidence.
If I listened to that,

324
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,120
most likely I would say that he's joking
around.

325
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,490
He's talking about the mushroom,
but yon is one of those weird dudes that

326
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,850
has been like researching this shit for.

327
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,320
Did he say anything about Gordon Wasson?
He knows.

328
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah,
because he was in the CIA.

329
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah.
There were some connection with Gordon

330
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,920
is hiring people that smoke dmt and 
talked about aliens.

331
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,460
I will.
I'll send you my resume.

332
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:45,990
I'll fax my resume to you.

333
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,740
I think the CIA like seaworld.
It's not 100 percent evil.

334
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,800
You know,
this is probably a bunch of people 

335
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,241
there.
The train dolphins that really loved 

336
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:56,241
dolphins.
It does it.

337
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:56,241
Does it stop the institution from being 
able to.

338
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,960
Just because a few of the people that 
are involved in it.

339
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,610
You guys know about John Lilly,
right?

340
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,440
Sure.
Yeah.

341
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,420
Yeah.
Well that's the.

342
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,840
Was He in the course?
It was,

343
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,300
but he was into hallucinogens and 
Dolphin.

344
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,740
The connection.
Yeah.

345
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:09,270
We have the documents.
You know,

346
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know if yawns right or wrong,
you know,

347
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,660
quite honestly,
I don't think he does either,

348
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,370
I think,
but if you look at it,

349
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:19,371
most likely,
most likely that's not what was going 

350
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:19,371
on.
Most likely.

351
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,300
Terence Mckenna was a hippie and he uses
also one point,

352
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,340
uh,
in his argument for saying that he was 

353
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,751
in trouble with the FBI and they got out
of trouble like seemingly out of 

354
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:30,430
nowhere,
but if that's all documented by dentists

355
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,440
and Qa and terrence,
they talked in depth about him turning 

356
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,470
himself in and them offering him some 
sort of a plea deal.

357
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,330
Uh,
Dennis sent me the email.

358
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,070
I could read it,
but I don't have his permission.

359
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,400
But yeah,
I don't think Transport Canada was in 

360
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,441
the fucking CIA know also is the data or
bi or whatever the fuck they can use you

361
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,980
without you ever even knowing you're 
being used.

362
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,450
Yeah,
sure.

363
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,440
Like a lot of peace corps people.
Well,

364
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,870
I think we're used as a listener.

365
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,010
Anybody,
and I really mean this.

366
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,150
Anybody who listens to Mckenna talk 
about cei talk about psychedelics.

367
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,520
Anybody who listens to that and is not 
intrigued is a fucking idiot and I think

368
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,330
that includes people that are in the 
CIA.

369
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:16,331
People are in the FBI just because 
people were square on paper and just 

370
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:18,230
because you know they're supposed to 
abide by the schedule.

371
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,390
One rules of the United States 
government,

372
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,920
human beings are individuals and 
individuals have autonomy,

373
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,950
a certain amount of it,
at least when it comes to their own 

374
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:29,950
thoughts and you listen to a guy like 
Terence Mckenna and you go,

375
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,800
well,
who's side do I take?

376
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,200
The evil overlord that I fucking work 
for,

377
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:38,201
that pays my bills and couldn't give two
fucks about me or this psychedelic bard 

378
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:42,940
who might be onto about a million things
that I've never even considered once 

379
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,240
might be correct about this idea that 
he's preaching about psychedelic drugs 

380
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,190
being the very why human beings

381
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,190
exist in the first place.
In our lack of use of them today is one 

382
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,460
of the reasons why we're so disconnected
from nature.

383
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,610
Like we just shot into space and then we
lost our cord that connects us.

384
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,460
We lost whatever the connection was to 
how we got there.

385
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,710
Sounds ridiculous when it comes from a 
guy like me,

386
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,900
but when you hear Mckenna talk about it 
and he's talking about climatological 

387
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,790
changes and about how the hominids moved
out of the trees to experiment with new 

388
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,090
food sources as the rain forest receded 
into grasslands,

389
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:23,091
I mean this is well documented shit and 
then also the positive attributes of 

390
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,050
Psilocybin,
the increase in visual acuity,

391
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,430
the fact that it makes them Hornier so 
you'd get like monkeys that were Horny,

392
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,520
they could see better if they ate these 
mushrooms and then the transcendent 

393
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,531
experience that it comes from them and 
like all those together can't be 

394
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:38,531
ignored.

395
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:42,230
I mean the idea that it's not considered
primarily as the reason why we're not 

396
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,181
monkeys anymore.
It's only because enough people or too 

397
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:50,211
many people are ignorant about it and 
because the propaganda involving these 

398
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:54,981
drugs,
it's been so strong that whether or not 

399
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:55,590
you believe that it's had any positive 
input influence on anybody.

400
00:18:55,591 --> 00:19:00,591
You know,
you can't deny that that experience is 

401
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:05,090
fucking mind blowing.
Like legitimately fucking mind blowing 

402
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,590
to the point where if you've haven't had
it,

403
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,340
you wouldn't believe it's possible and 
then when you do have it,

404
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,910
the world is never the same again 
because you believe anything's possible.

405
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,250
Fuck Buddy.
Ignore that.

406
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:22,310
How could you ignore that as a 
possibility for cognitive enhancement 

407
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,820
when you're looking at a primate,
a thinking thing that discovers this 

408
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,360
mind altering insanely powerful drug 
that happens to grow the fuck everywhere

409
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,170
in shit.
Yeah.

410
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,710
Shit.
And they're following these.

411
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,820
The following.
These monkeys clearly tipping over cow 

412
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,851
patties and pulling out worms.
They're experimenting with food sources 

413
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:44,730
constantly.
If this stuff was there and it was.

414
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,030
If they ate it and they did,
of course that's the X.

415
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,360
There's a doubling of the human brain 
size over 2 million years at directly 

416
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,691
coincides with this receiving of the 
rain forest in the grassland and 

417
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:59,961
experimenting with all these new foods,
new foods or what do you think that it 

418
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:00,870
listens to that and I think it's very 
interesting.

419
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:01,920
I,
you know,

420
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,990
having studied this kind of stuff for 
awhile,

421
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm very hesitant to say that it,
but I would certain because everything 

422
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,950
ends up being multilingual,
urea and out of other shit,

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,650
and I'll tell you,
here's a really interesting,

424
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,610
here's a,
well that's the whole man,

425
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,620
the hunter thing so far,
but here's a really interesting theory 

426
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,540
that I don't hear spoken about much that
sort of corresponds to this a little 

427
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,440
bit.
Same time period of course,

428
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,780
uh,
people were running under hot sun 

429
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,891
because of the receding forests.
It was savannah and one of the ways of 

430
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:35,010
hunting is to run the deer down,
right?

431
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:37,980
Because we can persist much further than
they can.

432
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,860
They're faster,
but only over 200 meters.

433
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,480
And then they get tired.
They don't sweat.

434
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,730
Right,
exactly.

435
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah.
So,

436
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,770
so these dudes are running.
It's hot,

437
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,190
lots

438
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,190
of Sun.
The brain gets overheated and so 

439
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,020
evolutionary pressure is on creating 
redundancy in the neural networks of the

440
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,120
brain as a,
as a,

441
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,570
as a,
as a sort of insurance policy against 

442
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:03,570
overheating.
Right?

443
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,380
And so what happens is we develop all 
this surplus in neural tissue that then 

444
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:12,811
gets wired into one thing as opposed to 
it's like having a spare tire and 

445
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,200
suddenly your car has now five wheels,
you know what I mean?

446
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,660
It like the,
the,

447
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,630
the evolution took advantage of this 
thing that was made for something else,

448
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,700
which is a very well known concept in 
evolution.

449
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:26,701
It's called a spandrel.
It's something that seems like it was 

450
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:30,661
designed to do that,
but in fact it's a byproduct of 

451
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:30,661
something else.

452
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:34,120
And ultimately of course,
every result is a combination of things 

453
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,541
coming together and creating.
This is one thing that we think of as 

454
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:37,541
like,
oh,

455
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,240
human beings,
human beings,

456
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:40,550
human consciousness,
the evolved human consciousness.

457
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,300
But when you think about all the 
possible factors that came into play and

458
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:49,301
all the different things that must have 
happened and selective breeding and how 

459
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:51,620
people figured out who to mate with and 
how.

460
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,310
Well,
that's David Eick.

461
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,260
David,
I,

462
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,990
uh,
I would,

463
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,010
I would like to have him on the podcast,
but I think apparently he doesn't like 

464
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,740
talking about that lizard thing anymore.
Talking about the reptilian things moved

465
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,930
on.
Feels like it's a distraction from what?

466
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,150
I don't know.
I mean maybe he's abandoned the idea,

467
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,790
but I've heard he got mad at somebody 
for talking about.

468
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,290
I think it was like a Jesse Ventura 
show.

469
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,800
Do you know?
Do you know you get.

470
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,420
Might've got mad at Jesse Ventura 
because I think that was it.

471
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:22,421
I think they got an argument.
Jesse Ventura was calling him off raw 

472
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:22,421
hide.

473
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:22,421
Yeah,
I saw that.

474
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,010
I saw that episode.
He like ambushes m and then he like 

475
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,260
really lets him have it and then it was

476
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,060
well uncomfortable.
You know,

477
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,350
there's a fucking,
there's a,

478
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,110
there's a good point there.
You know when you,

479
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,740
when you say something like someone's a 
Reptilian,

480
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,650
like everything else that you say,
I have to go,

481
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,150
come on man.
The fucking you get you.

482
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,180
You.
You're going to show the first instance 

483
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,180
of something that's able to change back 
and forth.

484
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,310
By the way,
not just,

485
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,420
Oh really?
Oh,

486
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,100
that's the idea.
It's not just like you're a caterpillar,

487
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:55,250
your butterfly know your counterpart,
your butterfly,

488
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,710
your batter fly you back to a 
caterpillar to a butterfly.

489
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,950
That's what they're saying.
They're saying that you can change back 

490
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,950
and forth like there's nothing that 
does.

491
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,040
That is nothing.
You've got to have a video.

492
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,780
You got to have something.
You gotta you gotTa.

493
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:10,781
Show me some fossils.
You can't just go around saying people 

494
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:10,781
are reptiles,
man,

495
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:14,950
you know you just can't do that because 
then that means you're thinking sucks 

496
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,320
and I can't trust you to be the guy that
talk.

497
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,830
But snakes used to be a huge,
huge problem for us.

498
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,240
Right?
Isn't that why there's like.

499
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,770
I mean,
yeah,

500
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:24,230
but it's not.
Back then it was like a big fucking.

501
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,830
Now snakes are a problem,
but you're not going to run into a snake

502
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:30,110
too.
When I'm getting coffee to starbucks,

503
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:32,090
I'm not going to like snakes.
Not gonna bite

504
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,010
pre,
pre.

505
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,080
If more than 5 million years ago,
snakes must've been such a problem that 

506
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,890
humans,
chimps,

507
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:43,891
and Bonobos,
infants all recoil at an image of a 

508
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:47,251
snake.
Even if Eskimos who were never going to 

509
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:47,251
see a snake,

510
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:51,010
right?
Eskimo kids will freak out if you show 

511
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,901
them a picture of a snake.
That reptilian thing is like a 

512
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:57,341
reflection of this,
like this weird residual neuro,

513
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,160
a horror story that got imprinted into 
our brains.

514
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:06,161
And so now when people like David Eick 
or just trying to make evil or 

515
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,450
categorize evil are in the book of 
Genesis.

516
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:08,900
What,
what,

517
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:11,120
what's the evil thing?
It's the serpent.

518
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,310
It's just a symbol that's supposed to 
embody ultimate evil.

519
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:17,500
It seems like.
Well,

520
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,430
every animal besides us is compassion.
Less they are compassionate,

521
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,210
especially if other animals,
they just don't.

522
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,170
It's not a part of the,
well,

523
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,800
not every animal other than those 
dolphins,

524
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,020
chimps and Bonobos,
intelligent ones,

525
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,180
intelligent fox.
Come on,

526
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,650
you've met this dog,
right?

527
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,070
You've ever seen foxes were people,
uh,

528
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:42,071
they start living in the woods near 
foxes and the foxes eventually gained a 

529
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,610
friendship and then they become like 
their pets.

530
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,800
It's very common for foxes to do that 
and to become almost like dogs and 

531
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,710
become like really friendly with people.
But you know,

532
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
ultimately what makes us human.
One of the big things that makes us 

533
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,651
human is this insane level of 
understanding we have for what we are 

534
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:04,391
and what our places and constantly 
recognizing constantly either coming up 

535
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:09,161
with some way to justify it and some 
self righteous position to take or 

536
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:14,261
coming up with some way to try to fix 
the damage we've done or coming up with 

537
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:16,190
some where you're just trying to at 
least understand it,

538
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,980
but all those things are going on all at
the same time.

539
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,510
Looking for validation is my idea right 
about this anger at this guy in traffic.

540
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,200
It's all this big sea of shit that goes 
on at the same time.

541
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,170
So to compare that to anything else that
exists,

542
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,280
it's like it's one of the weirdest 
animals that we've ever seen ever.

543
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,580
And it's us.
Yeah.

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,990
It's the weirdest shit ever.
If we didn't exist,

545
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,290
if we like found us objectively found us
and started analyzing our impact on our 

546
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:50,501
environment,
this ultimately colossally catastrophic 

547
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,600
effect of us even existing on everything
else around us.

548
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:58,601
Just to nihilists the ocean of fish to 
the point where tuner coming back,

549
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:02,630
radiated,
and there's fucking a massive.

550
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,730
Of garbage in the middle of the ocean 
and the numbers of fish are down so 

551
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,850
radically that people are worrying that 
within 100 years there won't be any wild

552
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:15,851
fish in the ocean anymore.
Within another hundred years we've 

553
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,970
cleaned out getting wiped out all over 
the light.

554
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,130
If we watched us from afar,
objectively,

555
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,500
we would be like,
oh my God,

556
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,080
this outbreak,
this is insane.

557
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,530
Planetary athletes,
but let's get that shit off of their 

558
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,710
super eight super eight,
just athlete's foot.

559
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,450
There's no lamisil.
It's going to get rid of people,

560
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,730
but we do spread.
You know what I mean?

561
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,130
You could,
if you looked at it historically,

562
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,920
you'd see these little sores and then 
rashes spreading out.

563
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,080
You

564
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,530
know,
we're about to take over.

565
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,590
We're about to eat the host.
It's like before humans,

566
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,080
Planet Earth,
some disgusting.

567
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,710
Other people should have worn a condom.
Yeah.

568
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,450
Humans is herpes.
Yeah.

569
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,270
Well maybe so,
you know,

570
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:09,180
or maybe we got offloaded or something 
or you know,

571
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:11,870
maybe it's just some.
Something that was on a craft.

572
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,950
So what did Mckenna say about this?
Right?

573
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:18,951
Because it,
along with the theory you were talking 

574
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:18,951
about earlier,
he's got the,

575
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:22,901
the,
the mushroom spores going through the 

576
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:24,360
outer space because they absorb cosmic 
rays and there they can last forever.

577
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
That to me,
that's one of the more compelling parts 

578
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,600
of that whole thesis.
He's got,

579
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,600
well allegedly

580
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,800
also the chemical composition of 
silicide in the first place.

581
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,890
So aside been,
which is very closely related to a euro 

582
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,200
trip transmitters,
dimethyltryptamine.

583
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,720
It's actually the,
I don't,

584
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,620
I'm not,
I'm going to butcher the pronunciation,

585
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:43,710
but it's something like for Fox,
for Ole oxy and,

586
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,740
and dimethyltryptamine.
So it is literally like the same 

587
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,120
compound as a human neurotransmitter and
it's mixed in with something else.

588
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,080
And this,
uh,

589
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,870
this phosphorus in the four positions 
for Fox for a lock,

590
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,890
see whatever the fuck it is.
It's the only compound like that on the 

591
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:00,890
planet.
And they don't,

592
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,720
they don't know what the origins of it 
was.

593
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,750
They don't know where it came from.
It doesn't mean that it couldn't have 

594
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,301
been just a unique fungus.
Fungus is in and of themselves are 

595
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:15,120
incredibly fascinating and closer to 
human than they are to plant funguses or

596
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,000
weird.
I mean there,

597
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,070
there are a strange sort of Karma free 
life form there.

598
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,080
It just doesn't hurt anybody and just 
free shit literally eats shit and exists

599
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,120
in shit

600
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,530
and isn't that and attacking really 
attacking you or are you just had 30 

601
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,150
hitch.
You're a dirty bitch,

602
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,750
found a good spot to live,
but you can call me whatever you want,

603
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:43,751
but that is definitely attacking.
It's to encourage cleanliness and 

604
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:47,230
encourage you to wash your balls.
Balls we will grow and itchy tag does 

605
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,230
God's way.
Well,

606
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,040
I think it's much more,
much more

607
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,250
that there is no good or bad when it 
comes to the natural kingdom,

608
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,250
you know that's much more of what it is.
Even though it's Karma free.

609
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,490
It's like the idea that it exists on 
your balls and it drives you crazy.

610
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:07,310
It might be bad for you,
but ultimately in the universe just sort

611
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:08,150
of balances out.

612
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Know I met this.
You can have a little itchy balls so 

613
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:13,760
that it can live.
He got like pets on you.

614
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,870
That's what you're saying like is it 
charity you should let because otherwise

615
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:20,540
you're murdering your pets.
It's like those guys in India who were a

616
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,210
filter over their mouth so they don't 
accidentally inhale and insect.

617
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,030
They there.
The Jane's though.

618
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah,
they killing anything,

619
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,090
so I don't know what they would do about
junket.

620
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,700
Fascinating,
isn't it?

621
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:36,070
It's an interesting discussion.
I met a guy.

622
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,100
You're talking about balancing out.
I met a really interesting guy in 

623
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Mozambique last week and had dinner with
them.

624
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,370
He

625
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,370
has a thesis that each life has just 
like you know,

626
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,390
the,
the,

627
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,850
the conservation of energy in the 
universe and energy's never made,

628
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,690
created nor destroyed everything 
balances out in the end.

629
00:29:55,691 --> 00:30:00,691
Right?
So his thing was each life has a 

630
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,670
balanced amount of suffering and 
pleasure and the more you suffer,

631
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:08,671
the more pleasure you'll get somewhere 
else and that these things always equal 

632
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:12,920
to zero.
And our great mistake as a civilization 

633
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,710
is thinking we can increase the amount 
of pleasure without compensating,

634
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,070
without having an increased amount of 
suffering as well.

635
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,310
And so we're running around chasing that
pleasure without realizing that we're 

636
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,310
also accumulating and creating

637
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,980
that makes sense to me,
man,

638
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:28,981
because the people that I know that have
the hardest time keeping it together 

639
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:30,160
emotionally are people that don't work 
out.

640
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,360
I don't know if it's a coincidence,
but the people that I know that have the

641
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,620
hardest time emotionally are people that
don't work out,

642
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:38,080
and the people that I know that do 
workout,

643
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,200
especially the ones that work out hard,
they expelled these big giant bursts of 

644
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,850
energy where your body's like almost 
dying.

645
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,670
You're heaving,
your heart's pounding,

646
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,830
your chest.
You're barely able to lift this,

647
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,900
this piece of metal up again,
your Bailey able to jump on this box 

648
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:55,900
again,
you're barely able to.

649
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,960
And by putting yourself in that intense 
form of stress,

650
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,500
it makes regular life more peaceful.
It's the Yin and the Yang.

651
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,190
You do see that

652
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:08,270
when,
when professional athletes are being 

653
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,270
interviewed,
like NBA Dudes,

654
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,270
they all seem

655
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,710
so the highest flow,
those guys are highest fuck.

656
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,390
Those guys get high.
They uh,

657
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:17,391
they actually keep marijuana off there 
or they did for a long time off their 

658
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,890
drug list of the things that get tested 
because they all like to play stone.

659
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:20,010
Okay.

660
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,710
That's cool.
Hell yeah.

661
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,470
I mean,
what's more fun than being a giant?

662
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,620
Throwing a bouncy ball around some 
polished arena.

663
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:30,870
That's a blast when you're high.
I think marijuana,

664
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:30,930
yeah.

665
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,610
Gives you a certain sensitivity to 
things,

666
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,880
to things like it gives you a certain 
sensitivity to art.

667
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,030
Like the art that you make gives you a 
certain sensitivity to physical 

668
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,670
movements.
Like a lot of guys love to do Jujitsu.

669
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,770
Can I throw something out here?
Sure.

670
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,880
And when you get really high,
do you kind of see things like become a 

671
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,960
little more orangy?
Is that happened to,

672
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:54,180
you know,
because that does happen to me.

673
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,630
Like when I get really high things 
seemed to take on a,

674
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,790
like a basket ball orange 10.
It's like that same kind of like the 

675
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,520
rose tinted glasses higher.
You get inside,

676
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,100
you're scaring me.
Just sit across the table from Duncan 

677
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,150
[inaudible] Duncan.
Normally you start getting high about 

678
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,121
4:00
PM and then the sun starts going down 

679
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:17,430
and everything gets golden.
That's the sunset and dunking.

680
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,390
Well,
yeah,

681
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:23,391
but I,
I definitely got high before four PM 

682
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:24,070
orange.
You get.

683
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,420
Well this whole room is already.
Maybe that's just shifted the light.

684
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,450
Well,
you're near your near this orange and 

685
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,191
you're also near the orange of the.
I remember when I was in high school 

686
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:34,670
getting into conversation with someone I
was,

687
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,580
whether it was really stoned.

688
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,070
I'm like,
you see like orange dots everywhere.

689
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,740
Must've shit gets crazy.
I thought he was my friend.

690
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,170
Now everyone's crazy.
You ever.

691
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,250
You ever have a friend go crazy on you?
Yeah.

692
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,730
I've had friends that like legitimately 
lost their mind.

693
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,140
I can't talk to them anymore.
Like,

694
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,230
like you would talk to them about events
and his version of events were just 

695
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,140
like,
so not what actually happened.

696
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,160
Hailey.
Oh,

697
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
this is the person that's lost their 
marbles.

698
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

699
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:06,071
It happens.
You can temporarily lose your marbles 

700
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:06,071
permanently.
Agent or permanently.

701
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:06,740
Yeah,
but I think that like,

702
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
I mean,
yes permanently.

703
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,390
Of course there's like,
no,

704
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:10,940
I'm not saying through psychedelics 
either.

705
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,990
I know what you mean.
Just saying people that just can't keep 

706
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:16,990
it together anymore and for whatever 
reason,

707
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,770
whether it's a combination of life,
stress and biological situation,

708
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,860
whatever the fuck they got going on,
you know,

709
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,250
uniquely in their own brain.

710
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,130
But some people just all of a sudden not
there anymore.

711
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,190
Not keeping it together too.
They think they're keeping it together 

712
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,190
sometimes.
Yeah.

713
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,980
I mean there's broad,
broad range,

714
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,450
right?
There's all kinds of.

715
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:36,620
Yeah,
it sucks man.

716
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:41,621
People,
the brain is an organ and it 

717
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,901
malfunctions and sometimes he'd go nuts 
and that's stigmatized for it,

718
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,950
which really sucks because if you like,
because that just adds to the problem.

719
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,270
Like if you,
you know,

720
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,390
you see somebody in a cast and you're 
like,

721
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,440
oh,
what happened to your arm?

722
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:55,230
And they'll tell you,
oh,

723
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:55,820
you know,
whatever.

724
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:57,160
I fell down.
But you,

725
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,230
you talked to someone who's been 
hospitalized for a few weeks and they 

726
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,070
tell you I had to go to the hospital.
I had a nervous breakdown.

727
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,420
I went crazy shit.
My pants during my dog through a window.

728
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,440
You'll want,
you want to be compassionate,

729
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:13,580
but there's some part of you that's 
like,

730
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,980
oh,
now this is a crazy person.

731
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:20,300
It's like it's just something happened.
The operating system temporarily crashed

732
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,630
and quite often I think that can be a 
very good thing.

733
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I think that having your,
your personality or your ego or crash 

734
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:34,841
can often mean that you were trying to 
be somebody that you aren't and some 

735
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:38,420
people invest so much energy,
so much energy into trying to find him.

736
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,180
Yeah,
they just want to be something.

737
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:40,840
You know,
they,

738
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:43,310
they it since they were a kid there,
mother was telling them,

739
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:48,311
you should be like this,
and then they try to be like this and 

740
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,801
they hold up this thing.
They're always working to hold up this 

741
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:54,521
giant tail feather in their arms,
start shaking and that they can't hold 

742
00:34:55,221 --> 00:35:00,221
it up and that's when they have like 
anger outbursts are suddenly like their 

743
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:00,260
friends are like you.

744
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,880
You turned into someone that I've never 
met.

745
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,470
I don't even know who that is.
It's like,

746
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,880
no,
that is.

747
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:09,881
You met them.
You met underneath the tail feather the 

748
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:13,300
seeding.
See the anger and disappointment and 

749
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,240
sadness,
they that you met,

750
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:18,230
that thing that they're trying to avoid 
by looking up at this mask,

751
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,480
they're holding up to the world,
but that fucking ceiling see of 

752
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,220
disappointment,
anger and horror and sadness.

753
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,020
That's where it's at,
man.

754
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,570
You got to go into that thing and for 
some people,

755
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:34,571
the only way they can go into that is by
having a full scale nervous breakdown 

756
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:36,260
because then they can have permission to
dive into that,

757
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,320
into that awful vortex of darkness 
because underneath that vortex of 

758
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,380
darkness is paradise.
Underneath that,

759
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,710
that's love and happiness and joy and 
connection and tranquility and all that 

760
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,560
stuff and everyone thinks that the way 
to get to that point is by avoiding this

761
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:56,850
awful black forest that surrounds the 
garden of Eden,

762
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,160
which is inside everybody.

763
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,060
It's inside everybody.
It's there,

764
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,240
it's there and it doesn't matter.
You know you can work out and that will 

765
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,500
definitely give you a temporarily 
temporary good feeling,

766
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,890
but until you address the internal 
structures that you haven't 

767
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,771
acknowledged,
you're always going to go back to that 

768
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:17,610
place where you find yourself morose and
depressed and angry,

769
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,700
and you don't know why.
You always go back to that place until 

770
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,570
you sit with the sadness inside of you.
You have to do that.

771
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,790
What you're describing is coming out of 
the closet.

772
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,040
Yeah,
for a lot of people,

773
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,150
that is what it is,
man.

774
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:32,910
It's coming out of the closet and 
there's a lot of closets.

775
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,510
There's not just the gay closet.
There's all kinds of closet.

776
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:39,630
There's the artists closet.
Some people are fucking accountants.

777
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,720
They're wearing suits and their ties on 
tight and they're fucking organized and 

778
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,500
disciplined,
but inside they're probably painters.

779
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,450
They probably want to fucking paint.
They want to paint Dayglo mountains down

780
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,040
at the beach.
That's what they really are,

781
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,310
but their daddy or their mommy wanted 
them to be a good little businessman,

782
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,460
so they became this thing that's the 
opposite of what they are.

783
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,680
This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.
God,

784
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,480
forgive me because I've quoted it way 
too many times,

785
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:08,481
but it's.
It's better to be an honest street 

786
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:11,361
sweeper than a dishonest king.
It's better to be a happy guy brushing 

787
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:16,461
fucking leafs up the street than it is 
to be some zillionaire who inside is 

788
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:19,710
dying or numb or miserable.
Mostly Numb,

789
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,520
numbs the word.
Most people are just

790
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,620
not.
As long as these people can quantify on 

791
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,230
paper,
I still have a x million dollar home.

792
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:31,340
My car still cost x thousand dollars.
This suit is an ex suit.

793
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I am still ahead.
I am not going to abandon all these 

794
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,611
things.
As long as they don't see through the 

795
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:39,611
bullshit with the game,
they think they're winning.

796
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:40,220
They have.
Yeah.

797
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,460
It's almost like you have to fall to.
Really.

798
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,550
That's what you got to appreciate those 
moments when it all falls apart on you 

799
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,150
because that means you've got an 
opportunity to try it again.

800
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,550
This let's take a new fresh perspective.

801
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,460
This is a cool thing that at this 
retreat I went to,

802
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,640
this Guy Jack Cornfield said,
which I really loved.

803
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,550
What a great name,
by the way.

804
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,840
Yeah,
with a k,

805
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,580
not a c,
Jack Kornfield,

806
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:04,310
mortal Kombat,
k Jack Cornfield.

807
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,110
But he,
uh,

808
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,270
he's really cool man.
But he was cool with the kids.

809
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,100
He's with our cat,
like the cigarettes and corny now.

810
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,140
This guy was awesome and he was,
one of the things he talked about is in 

811
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,460
some religious tradition how they like 
hold the scriptures a rabbi,

812
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:24,461
like had his students hold the 
scriptures over their heart and when 

813
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,330
they were memorizing them and they would
say,

814
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:31,331
why do we do this?
And he said so that when your 

815
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:31,460
heartbreaks they'll fall in.
And it's a beautiful idea,

816
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:36,461
which is that heartbreak is actually 
your ego cracking in the moment that 

817
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:41,040
cracks.
You're in the experience of truth and 

818
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,921
when you're in the experience of truth,
that's when you can really become who 

819
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:43,921
you are.
But,

820
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,010
but to get to who you are,
it's like when you know,

821
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:51,011
when a bone heals the wrong way,
like that's what a lot of people's 

822
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:51,011
entire personality is.
It's like

823
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,160
bone that grew the wrong way and that 
needs a fucking,

824
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,140
a snap or a crack.
You know,

825
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,880
we,
you get that through to,

826
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,190
you need that,
that initial fucking thing,

827
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:03,610
and it's a beautiful analogy and that 
hurts.

828
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,190
It hurts,
but we're paying avoiding creatures,

829
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:11,191
so we think that,
so we're always running away from this 

830
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:11,440
pain,
but the problem is as we're running away

831
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:12,030
from pain,

832
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,240
we're still exactly in pain.
It's basically like being on fire and 

833
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,771
running away from water.
You're just running away from the water 

834
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:21,771
because

835
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:21,771
for some,
I don't know,

836
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:24,030
that's a stupid analogy actually for 
great.

837
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,830
Up until that,
a lot of great points.

838
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,030
It's true.
You know,

839
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,690
there's the monster in the dark and the 
faster you run,

840
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:35,691
the more likely you are to run into 
something that's actually going to hurt 

841
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:35,691
you as opposed to turning around and 
saying,

842
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,020
Oh fuck,
there is no monster monster.

843
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,100
You know,
but you're never gonna know that until 

844
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,581
you stop and turn around.
In some cases people don't have the 

845
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,841
discipline or the assistance or the 
balls to stop and turn around so they 

846
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:48,900
have to trip over something and then 
there's like,

847
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,190
oh yeah,
that's a classic story.

848
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Classic story of someone hiding a secret
and going completely out of control 

849
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,260
because of the pressure of hiding that.
Right.

850
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,070
Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the 
secretly gay guy who's preaching against

851
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:03,330
gay people.
Ted Haggard,

852
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,790
Colorado.

853
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Yeah.
That was snorting meth off his gay 

854
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:09,840
lovers.
Yeah.

855
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,070
Was just going so far the other way.
He just so off the rails.

856
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,900
Crazy himself.
He's by himself.

857
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,050
He was a guy who likes to snort math off
of Cox,

858
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,480
the do a little math and he likes to.
Well,

859
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,270
there's a few Cox,
but I would say he wasn't being himself.

860
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,300
What I would say is that his,
his behavior was so extreme because he 

861
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,570
was seeking balance between that and the
other bullshit in his life.

862
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,510
Whereas if he weren't living that,
he'd be right in the middle.

863
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,540
Right?
Yeah.

864
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,920
Well,
but to get to the middle,

865
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:43,921
you know,
the way to get to the middle weirdly is 

866
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:46,051
whatever the behavior is that you're 
doing that you are so horrified about 

867
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:47,980
and terrified of sometimes.
They're really weird ideas.

868
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,430
This is something that I liked that 
Rhonda says,

869
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,110
which is like,
if you don't feel like meditating,

870
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,000
don't meditate.
Don't force it.

871
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:58,930
Don't impose this on yourself.
Keep doing the thing you're doing that's

872
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:02,020
upsetting you so much.
Have the balls to keep doing the fucking

873
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:04,390
thing that you're doing.
Keep doing it.

874
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,910
Society is going to tell you,
don't be like this.

875
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,040
Stop being like this.
You have to change.

876
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,830
That's what your parents always say.
The idea is like,

877
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:15,790
no,
sink into what you are right now.

878
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,850
Just be that thing.
Stop resisting exactly where you are 

879
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:25,710
right now is perfect and that's a hard 
truth to grasp because you think right 

880
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,070
away you think,
yeah.

881
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,800
What about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer?
Is he perfect?

882
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,360
Well,
what about the leopard?

883
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,040
When you're seeing a leopard rip apart a
creature?

884
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,290
Is that thing per.
Is that a perfect moment?

885
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,360
I think the lumbered fucks them and 
kills them,

886
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,160
but you know what?
Ducks do.

887
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,160
Ducks or necrophilia acts.
Are they fucking evil creatures?

888
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,050
We think they are.
Well yeah,

889
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,960
they are made that Phil Robertson Guy,
very famous person,

890
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,270
because he invented a call for grant and
now poor gay people have to hear that a 

891
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,580
man's anus is not as good as a woman's 
vagina.

892
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,700
Can you imagine if you made the choice 
for a man's anus and you hear this 

893
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,980
fucking bearded Fashionista with his 
camera on the Bandana?

894
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,700
It's absolutely fascinating.
It's so weird.

895
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:09,230
I never thought of that big bearded 
Christian Bible sling and Fashionista,

896
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,850
and he tells you that your choice was 
incorrect and in fact the woman's vagina

897
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,160
is the better choice.
The man's anus.

898
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,660
I mean,
come on guys,

899
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,720
but how can you say that if you haven't 
experienced it?

900
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:21,940
Maybe.
Yeah,

901
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,270
I think he has.
Again,

902
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:26,630
the balance theory.
I think he's so outspoken on that issue,

903
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,840
like most of these homophobes are 
because they're home jerking off to gay 

904
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:31,840
porn,
you know,

905
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,160
otherwise you just don't give a shit.
It just doesn't actually matter.

906
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,930
Right?
Know,

907
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,900
it doesn't come up in a gq interview to 
duff thing,

908
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:39,500
right?
It's like,

909
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,250
Duh.
Already if you really care.

910
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:46,251
If people are gay,
the care the two guys love each other 

911
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:49,871
and why are you against love?
You only like love if it's a man and a 

912
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:49,871
woman like,
fuck man.

913
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:50,950
Really?
Yeah.

914
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,050
If you're talking about men's anuses in 
Gq side,

915
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,330
you maybe you've got some issues to 
think about.

916
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,060
Shouldn't we be talking about ducks?
Ducks?

917
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,810
Isn't that your whole shit?
Shoot ducks all the time.

918
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:06,500
Right?
That's your thing.

919
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,520
Let's talk about murdering ducks.
Yeah.

920
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,610
Why?
You got to talk about men talking about 

921
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:13,610
asshole quality.

922
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:13,610
Dragging this in.
The blood sex sucks.

923
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,371
Penises or a corkscrew shaped the 
wonders of nature.

924
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,100
Evil Nature.
Such a cunt and just such.

925
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,500
You're going to fuck and you're going to
keep it in there too.

926
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,580
How about that?
It turns into a route and you know why?

927
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,980
You know why dogs stay stuck together 
when they have a bone?

928
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,760
No,
it's uh,

929
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:32,190
the,
the,

930
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:37,270
the head of the dogs.
Penis blows up like a ball and it just 

931
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,020
gives.
The females can hold it so he can't get 

932
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,090
the ball out and it takes time for the 
ball to go down.

933
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:43,940
So we can actually get it back out.
That's why they're stuck.

934
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,550
What does that help?
Anything?

935
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,860
Well,
most most penises have bone.

936
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:51,200
I figured what the baculum.
I think we're so lucky.

937
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:53,840
We're very unusual that we do not have a
penis bone.

938
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,200
If we had like a rhino horn that never 
got tired,

939
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,440
it would.
It would be so many people that you'd 

940
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:02,480
have to climb over people to get where 
you wanted to go.

941
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,680
We would have to figure out a way to 
carry our own shit with us at all times.

942
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,830
It would be really rude and then we 
would have to meet in shit depositing 

943
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,851
spots and places where you get food and 
he'd just be crawling over and people 

944
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:16,360
just fucking along the way with their 
random.

945
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,860
Never stopped on fracture.
What about that?

946
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,920
Well,
that can happen.

947
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,360
Guys get broken dicks all the time.
It bends badly.

948
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,070
It actually starts bleeding and they 
have to go to the hospital

949
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,350
and get it repaired.
If you have like a big,

950
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,540
strong crazy girl,
like a volleyball player,

951
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,430
perhaps you don't let her get on top.
It's very important.

952
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,770
Have a really strong woman like you 
gotta.

953
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,290
Be careful in sports.
Is that all right?

954
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:46,550
No,
no,

955
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,240
no.
Those girls was too strong in the legs.

956
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Were strong in the ass and legs because 
they could squeeze to tight yoga 

957
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,550
churches to grow with.
Generate too much force if.

958
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,550
Because if she gets on topic,
she's going crazy.

959
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,720
Some of them will be crazy.

960
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,430
So a small volleyball

961
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,200
players.
Okay.

962
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:02,090
You gotTa make sure you always keep an 
under hook.

963
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,220
No matter what.
He'd been under a.

964
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,350
You want to under hook and you want to 
control her hip so never let it go to 

965
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,070
because if she just one of those mad dog
get riders that just wants to pretend 

966
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,630
she's at the Rodeo.
She could break your dick man.

967
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,020
Especially a big girl.
Girls Stout bones make you a strong 

968
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,020
child.
See,

969
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,420
this is the stuff they don't tell you 
about this on Fox News.

970
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,730
Stand in the truth.
He doesn't say this and you should be 

971
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:28,730
saying this.
Did you see,

972
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,760
um,
public service announcement?

973
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:36,761
Did you see a Lee camp?
Do you know who lee campus now he's a 

974
00:45:36,761 --> 00:45:41,500
standup comic.
Who was on Fox News and they were 

975
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,500
talking about something and he goes,
he just goes,

976
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,560
can I just ask you a question?
He goes,

977
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,720
what is Fox News?
He goes,

978
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:49,070
this is just a parade of ignorance.
It's just a festival of propaganda.

979
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:54,390
Yeah.
I'm not sure I might've switched the 

980
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,800
parade and festival,
but those are pretty much paraphrasing 

981
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:56,800
his words here.
It will play it here.

982
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,840
Kind of fun.
Can I just ask a question?

983
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,710
Sure.
What?

984
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,250
What is Fox News?
It's just a parade of propaganda and it.

985
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,930
It's just that it's just a festival of 
ignorance.

986
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,410
What a million people are dead and Iraq.
Come on.

987
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,290
This is ridiculous.
What's the point of this?

988
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,740
This is insane.
Go outside.

989
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,530
Go,
go.

990
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,210
Well,
robots malfunctioning.

991
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Listen to the girls.
You can get more worried about that.

992
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,300
Thanks.
Watch this though.

993
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,910
It gets great.
Alright.

994
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,820
We're also talking about Captain Kirk 
this morning,

995
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,420
Saturday morning.
Like some fun.

996
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,520
Greg,
you.

997
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,370
We're having some fun.
Yeah.

998
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:41,371
Look who just beamed aboard right now?
The ladies from the Star Ship 

999
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:41,371
Enterprise.
Hello.

1000
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:45,750
Welcome their friend bones.
You know him as Dr Mccoy just wrote a 

1001
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,191
new book on Captain Kirk and the way he 
was able to woo beautiful one in like 

1002
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:50,191
this.
It's all coming up.

1003
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,290
He

1004
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,550
proved his point is that it's almost 
like it's scripted.

1005
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,280
It's almost like simulation theory is 
true and we're.

1006
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,140
We're living in a Goddamn Coen brothers 
movie.

1007
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,640
Yeah,
it does seem like that,

1008
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,810
doesn't it?
It really does.

1009
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:06,811
It's beautiful there.
I think there's something beautiful 

1010
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,881
about that.
It does feel like there's like a 

1011
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:11,310
narrative at work here and the only way 
you can live that fake life as if it's 

1012
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,880
fake.
The actual,

1013
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:13,690
you know,
this,

1014
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:15,700
this,
this puritanical ideal.

1015
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,740
They've held up.
It's not natural and they haven't been 

1016
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:20,750
really living in any way they've been 
pretending to be living,

1017
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:25,180
if be freaks in this sort of a rebound,
sort of a way to balance everything out.

1018
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,930
And I think that ultimately that's being
exposed over and,

1019
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,980
and over and over again

1020
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,440
to the point where it's not going to be 
a viable option anymore.

1021
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,360
Like powdered wigs aren't a viable 
option.

1022
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,810
You can't wear a fucking powdered wig,
you know,

1023
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,730
and you can't pretend you're this,
you know,

1024
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:42,490
Rick Santorum,
guy that you know,

1025
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,510
just as a good man who believes in the 
Bible and doesn't want to see gaze,

1026
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:51,511
get married,
doesn't want to ruin the institution of 

1027
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:54,601
marriage with homosexual activity that's
been shunned upon in the Bible and 

1028
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:55,980
you're like,
oh,

1029
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,330
fucking crime money.
What's going on?

1030
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:00,710
Really what's going on behind the scenes
with you cat?

1031
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,100
What is in your head,
man?

1032
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,130
I keep waiting for it to get to that 
point where anybody who's got a big 

1033
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,491
problem with homosexuality is by default
admitting to their own homosexual life,

1034
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,310
but I've been waiting 30 years for 
America to go,

1035
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,290
come on,
this is too silly to be real.

1036
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,670
Ronald Reagan,
are you kidding?

1037
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,580
That guy was such a joke,
but you know,

1038
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:24,970
he's St Ronald and the seeds he planted 
30 years ago.

1039
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,250
Even then,
even then,

1040
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:31,890
there was a lot for him,
but do you remember the criticism though

1041
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:36,891
is pretty open.
There was a lot of people that didn't 

1042
00:48:36,891 --> 00:48:39,631
like it.
I remember when he was not enough that 

1043
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:40,060
he didn't win 49 out of 50 states in 
Israel election.

1044
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,840
Oh,
well listen man,

1045
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:42,120
I'm not saying that.
You know,

1046
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,160
he didn't dominate the vast majority of 
the,

1047
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:50,161
you know,
mean there was a lot of idiots back 

1048
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:51,361
then,
but the difference between the way 

1049
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,621
people look at them now and the way 
people looked at him then now it's 

1050
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,310
almost all glowing when people talk 
about ringing.

1051
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,140
I hardly ever hear any criticism.
Yeah.

1052
00:48:55,141 --> 00:49:00,141
You don't hear about Iran Contra and 
Nicaragua and El Salvador and Oliver 

1053
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,100
Oliver North Oliver and all that 
craziness and you know.

1054
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,590
Yeah,
but my point,

1055
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:10,591
my point is that this idea that suddenly
we're going to wake up and realize how 

1056
00:49:10,591 --> 00:49:14,371
ridiculous it is and it's Rick Santorum 
is too ridiculous to be real fucking.

1057
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:15,880
What's her name?
Sarah Pailin.

1058
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,390
You know,
I am amazed that how flexible the 

1059
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,801
reality muscles seems to be that people 
are willing to accept this stuff that 

1060
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:27,810
Frank Zappa was laughing about 40 years 
ago.

1061
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,760
I wonder if they are accepting it 
though.

1062
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,870
I wonder.
I think that you watch these shows and F

1063
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,870
and it creates the illusion of 
acceptance,

1064
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:39,020
but then if you if anywhere on the 
internet or do you just see this 

1065
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,221
constant rebellion against that kind of 
square,

1066
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:45,000
mainstream,
homophobic,

1067
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,120
angry personality,
but you watch Fox News and yeah,

1068
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:51,480
you watch Fox News.
Are you watching anything on TV and it's

1069
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:52,770
an illusion.
You know,

1070
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:55,470
you watch the commercials,
everything's as big illusion.

1071
00:49:55,471 --> 00:50:00,471
You watch the commercials and it's like 
people go in and buy a car and make it 

1072
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:04,850
seems normal.
It seems totally normal that people are 

1073
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:04,850
going in to get deeply in debt to the 
banks.

1074
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:09,741
That all seems incredibly normal,
but then more and more on the Internet 

1075
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:13,280
you see like people rebelling against 
this and showing how the bankers like 

1076
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:18,411
the whole system is this fucked up thing
and emerging things like bitcoin which 

1077
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:20,550
are like slowly moving the energy away 
from it.

1078
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,140
I don't know.
I didn't know what you mean.

1079
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:23,490
I don't think it's going to be a sudden 
thing.

1080
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:28,730
I think it's going to be more like a.
just a gradual shift is people just stop

1081
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:30,250
watching TV.
That's,

1082
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,890
that's going to happen.
People are just going to,

1083
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:36,970
you know,
I drive down the street billboards for 

1084
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:38,180
fucking like Amazon.com
shows,

1085
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:43,181
you know,
like billboards for shows that aren't 

1086
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:43,220
really controlled by these big Netflix.
Netflix.

1087
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

1088
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,200
But isn't

1089
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,850
just another big network.
I mean,

1090
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,900
you know,
it doesn't matter if it's a network or 

1091
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:52,900
it's an international conglomerate or 
whatever it is.

1092
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,170
It's big money.
It is,

1093
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,290
but you're right.
But that's just the idea.

1094
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,810
The reality is it's not that.
Yeah,

1095
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:00,050
but it's not.
It's not right.

1096
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,880
Because the media is a very different 
thing.

1097
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,710
The media where you talking about 
television,

1098
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:08,711
you're talking about a very hard thing 
to get into the medium you're talking 

1099
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:11,771
about.
You're talking about an incredibly easy 

1100
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:13,721
for you to get into literally open to 
almost anyone with an internet 

1101
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:14,090
connection.
You can make a youtube video.

1102
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:19,091
It doesn't cost you a goddamn dime.
You have a laptop that has a camera on 

1103
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:19,091
it,
you talk into it,

1104
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:19,880
you can make a youtube video that,
yeah,

1105
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,490
that's a big change.
That's not just a big change.

1106
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,620
That might be the biggest change in 
human history.

1107
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,030
It might be the biggest change in some 
monkey to mushroom.

1108
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:32,330
Certainly since the printing press,
the printing press was a major for sure.

1109
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:37,331
Giant similar in the sense that it,
it took the power of communication away 

1110
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:40,340
from very few and gave it to a lot more.
Right.

1111
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,910
So we're in that sort of.
One of the more fascinating things about

1112
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,350
this is that there,
you know,

1113
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:48,320
even if Amazon does,
but something online,

1114
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,370
it's no better than justine who has,
you know,

1115
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,270
45 fucking billion,
right?

1116
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,300
Followers and she,
every video she'd put people like that 

1117
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:58,490
that just became famous through the 
Internet.

1118
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,350
Jenna marbles is another one,
right?

1119
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,620
She,
she's got like millions and millions and

1120
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:03,620
millions of hits.

1121
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,470
Okay.
Yeah.

1122
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,860
Here's what it is.
Here's what it is because I,

1123
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:10,870
I've just been reading sheldrake's new 
book science set free and he talks about

1124
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:13,980
morphic resonance or something and I 
know you have some.

1125
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:16,630
I think you've,
you're skeptical about sheldrake,

1126
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:21,650
but it's like when you've just have tv,
TV is a tuning fork and when there was 

1127
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:27,471
no internet and it was just tv and it 
was a depiction of here's what a family 

1128
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:27,471
looks like,
here's what people tend to.

1129
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:32,241
It's a corporation saying here's what 
people do when they're healthy and that 

1130
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:35,991
creates a tuning fork effect,
which is like if you're watching it 

1131
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:38,691
enough,
you're going to either resonate with or 

1132
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:38,691
are in feel like,
yes,

1133
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:43,491
I'm doing great.
I have a wife and a house and a car and 

1134
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:46,551
a job and that's great.
I'm in tune with what everyone else is 

1135
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:46,551
doing,
but that's an illusion.

1136
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:48,270
That's never been what everyone else is 
doing.

1137
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:53,271
It's just what massive conglomerates are
sending out there either in the form of 

1138
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:56,220
hypnotic content that keeps you glued to
your seat.

1139
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:59,820
As you watch corporations try to get you
in debt to buy cars.

1140
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:00,480
You know,
it's,

1141
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:01,560
it's,
it's generally,

1142
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:04,680
it's just,
it's the whole thing is just,

1143
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:09,681
uh,
a tuning all of society in a way that 

1144
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:11,370
society maybe isn't meant to be tuned at
all.

1145
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,670
And so with the Internet,
now you have all these different smaller

1146
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:15,840
tuning forks,
you know,

1147
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,020
your podcast is a tuning fork.
People tune in to the stuff that you 

1148
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,340
talk about and the different people that
you bring on the podcast,

1149
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,360
send out information that causes new 
kind of tuning to start happening.

1150
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,850
So that's why when you watch like 
Huckabee,

1151
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,060
you'd really feel like you're like 
listening to somebody sing off key 

1152
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:35,580
because you're not resonating or not 
resonating.

1153
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,470
You've been tuned into a whole different
thing,

1154
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:42,471
which is what the Internet,
I think one of the major things the 

1155
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:42,471
Internet has done,
you know,

1156
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:43,080
you get these communities,
Reddit,

1157
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,590
you can get tuned into the reddit 
frequency quite easily where suddenly it

1158
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,530
all just starts making sense.
And that is why the,

1159
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:54,550
you know,
the duck dynasty guy or any of these 

1160
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:54,550
Weirdos who are,
um,

1161
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,300
who are just ultimately just angry 
people.

1162
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:02,301
That's why they seem so fucking crazy.
Or they play angry people on TV.

1163
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,900
All right?
Because I think a lot of these people 

1164
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:08,900
aren't even politics.

1165
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,110
Dynasty guy.
The Duck Dynasty guy has been given 

1166
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:13,270
speeches like that for years that these 
biblical retreats and stuff,

1167
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:16,180
he's been doing that for.
This video is real stick.

1168
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:21,181
He's not fire and brimstone God fearing 
Christian man who was living on the 

1169
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:25,261
wrong side of the law and Jesus at one 
point in time and then turned it all 

1170
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,680
around and wants to let everybody know 
about the evils of sin.

1171
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,960
He's an old dummy.
That's what he is.

1172
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,260
He's an old dominant loved name for him.
He's an old dummy to probably just one 

1173
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
time,
sucked a dick and liked it.

1174
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:38,710
Way Too much of someone sucked his dick 
and it's his favorite moment.

1175
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,350
It looks back on his childhood and he's 
turned it into,

1176
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:41,730
you know,

1177
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,090
career.
I bet he was hunting ducks when it 

1178
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:47,090
happened.
I bet he was hiring that duck blind.

1179
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,620
They're all liquored up in the moonshine
and ducks.

1180
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:54,050
I bet.
Right when he came into like some guy's 

1181
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,590
mouth years ago,
out in the out in the swamps,

1182
00:54:55,591 --> 00:55:00,591
he saw what the call it,
a duck black duck and combined pleasure 

1183
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:01,920
and shame mixed inside of me.
He's like,

1184
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:05,460
I'm just going to kill jobs from now on 
and never think about this.

1185
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:10,200
She didn't see shit.
Your Mother didn't see shit.

1186
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:15,201
Your father didn't see shit if you 
imagined.

1187
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:17,310
That's really what it was.
All.

1188
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:22,311
It was just a duck psalm.
Get his dick sucked by a guy and he's 

1189
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:22,311
like,
fuck that.

1190
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:22,640
It didn't happen.
It didn't happen.

1191
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:26,530
He to kill ducks.
I think that something like that happen,

1192
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,170
man.
It's something like that happen,

1193
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,020
but you know man,
like what you do with,

1194
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:36,060
you know,
sex at dawn creates a resonance where 

1195
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,060
it's like,
it's a,

1196
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,650
it's a shame reliever.

1197
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,750
It's a shame.
Reduce your man because your book,

1198
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,990
I think it has been.
It's such a compassionate book for 

1199
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:48,111
people who are stuck in monogamous 
relationships and feel guilty about the 

1200
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,420
fact that they are attracted to other 
people and I like that.

1201
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:54,570
Guilt used to be a normal guilt that was
actually considered like,

1202
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:59,571
oh,
something must be going wrong with your 

1203
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,011
relationship.
If you're thinking about fucking other 

1204
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:01,200
people and your book make shows like,
no,

1205
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:04,440
actually that's just nature happening 
through you.

1206
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,890
You don't have to feel guilty about it 
or like something's off balance in you.

1207
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:12,891
It's just completely normal.
It doesn't mean you have to go and fuck 

1208
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:15,801
other people,
but at least now you don't have to feel 

1209
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:16,980
like I must not love her anymore or she 
must not love me anymore.

1210
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,720
What's that have to do with fucking 
ducks,

1211
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,140
country music songs.
That's the glue,

1212
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,700
the glue that connects

1213
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,520
fucking ducks and in the sadness you 
have for not wanting to be monogamous 

1214
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,020
group keeps it all together.
Glue that holds the.

1215
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,830
That's why you need to listen to Phil 
Robertson and uh,

1216
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:42,850
that,
that God damn communist and that puts 

1217
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:42,850
them on.
Is that what it's on?

1218
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,410
Because men,
hilarious.

1219
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:47,620
It's on a and e and they used to be like
fucking masterpiece theater and shit.

1220
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,040
He used to have like an arts and 
entertainment,

1221
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,780
you know,
interesting.

1222
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:55,800
Fascinating programming and stimulated 
the mind map.

1223
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,270
Don't sell cars now it's fucking,
you know,

1224
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,110
people let found a storage box.
What's in the storage box?

1225
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:10,850
Well,
but there's a lot of good stuff in 

1226
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:10,850
there.
I bet there's no more after the break.

1227
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,910
I'm wondering how much you take for that
$500.

1228
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:19,350
I can't give you five.
I gotta I gotta get at least four.

1229
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,110
I don't know.
To commercial a narrative arc.

1230
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:27,170
I'll tell you.
This is my last offer and I'll be in 

1231
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:27,170
serious cut to commercial.
Wow.

1232
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,170
Wonder what his last offer is going to 
be.

1233
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,980
He got them down to three.
I wish I could say there hadn't been 

1234
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,340
guilty of this too.
Dude.

1235
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,950
Just blessed.
Sorry to interrupt you though,

1236
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,460
but last week I was.
I was in Mozambique and where I was 

1237
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,701
staying they had one of these satellites
with 700 channels and I was scrolling 

1238
00:57:46,701 --> 00:57:50,391
through and who do I come upon?
Joe Rogan fear factor some.

1239
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:55,731
There was some thing shooting fish 
through the air and some woman in big 

1240
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:56,940
waiters had to catch the fish.
I wish I could remember.

1241
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,590
It was another level.
Wasn't your favorite episode?

1242
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,280
We did a $100.
40th

1243
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,020
eight of them more actually because we 
did seven or six.

1244
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,040
Six,
I think.

1245
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,860
Six more upon return.
So we did.

1246
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,320
Yeah.
We did a full season,

1247
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,750
like the biggest time.
It was like 34 episodes,

1248
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:20,751
34 one hour shows.
Were you having fun or are you 

1249
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,110
contractually prohibited from discussing
it or not at all?

1250
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:22,920
No,
I mean it was.

1251
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,950
It wasn't like doing standup or it 
wasn't like working for the UFC or 

1252
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:31,671
anything like that,
but the people were really nice that 

1253
00:58:31,671 --> 00:58:34,221
worked on the show.
They became good friends and they were 

1254
00:58:34,221 --> 00:58:34,221
fun folks.
We had fun,

1255
00:58:34,221 --> 00:58:38,740
you know,
like it was a real nice crew and when 

1256
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:38,740
when you have that,
it's like that,

1257
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,510
that that's like the most important 
thing about working on a show.

1258
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,470
It's a family,
right?

1259
00:58:43,471 --> 00:58:47,100
You're with the same people all day,
but ultimately the product itself,

1260
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,490
like you know what I mean?

1261
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,580
It's mindless entertainment,
you know?

1262
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:54,510
It's a competition of ridiculous 
competition.

1263
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,760
That's good to distract you if you look 
up for some distraction,

1264
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,380
but it shouldn't.
It's junk food,

1265
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,660
junk food for the mind.
Not that it's anything,

1266
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,060
nothing bad about it,
but nothing good about it either.

1267
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,090
There's no no reason to think that it's 
going to elevate anything in any way,

1268
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,530
but it's better than arguing over how 
much you going to pay for a container.

1269
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:12,270
I mean,
I guess it is,

1270
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:15,480
but there was real human drama and fear 
factor that was undeniable.

1271
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:20,580
People really shit their pants when they
were forced certain stunts and stunts 

1272
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,340
and think ridiculous thing they had to 
eat.

1273
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,480
It's a miracle fucked up for real and 
that I was just talking to my good 

1274
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,270
friend David Horowitz,
who will be,

1275
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,700
we're going to figure out a day to put 
him on the podcast.

1276
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,140
He was the executive producer of the 
show,

1277
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,160
one of the executive producers,
him and mack units and uh,

1278
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,760
we were talking about on the phone the 
other day.

1279
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:39,290
We're like,
I told them,

1280
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,670
I go,
I want to be honest with you,

1281
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,670
man.
I'm glad they ended the last season I go

1282
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,680
because I think it was like on its way 
to being like it was so wrapped up with 

1283
00:59:49,031 --> 00:59:51,260
a stunt is getting more and more risky.
Way More.

1284
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,010
Yeah.
Well,

1285
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:57,011
I don't want to say risky because it's,
I'd be ignorant to say that I'm not a 

1286
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:57,590
stunt man.
I'm not a stunt designer.

1287
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:58,970
I don't know what's dangerous and what's
not.

1288
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:01,340
I don't know what just looks dangerous 
was actually pretty safe,

1289
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,970
but all I know is that it became more.
They were starting to get more and more 

1290
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:07,310
spectacular.
We were,

1291
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:11,730
they had these people attached with a 
Bungee cord to a helicopter and the,

1292
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:17,240
I mean there were like 200 helicopters,
like 200 yards away on this enormous 

1293
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,240
bungee cord.

1294
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,810
And uh,
they had,

1295
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,690
uh,
their partner had an undo locks and when

1296
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:22,970
they undid the locks,
they have to find the right key,

1297
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:27,971
like this giant ring of keys.
And if they did it within a certain 

1298
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:30,800
amount of time,
the person got launched off of this tree

1299
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:35,801
like fucking 100,
200 yards into the air on a bungee cord 

1300
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:36,920
attached to the bottom of the 
helicopter.

1301
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:42,340
It was fucking crazy.
And I remember they were describing the 

1302
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:42,340
hell.
They're like,

1303
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:42,340
well,
you know,

1304
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:47,141
we have to be careful with this because 
you've got to make sure that the people 

1305
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:47,141
don't pull the helicopter at a weird 
angle.

1306
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:47,900
That makes the helicopter

1307
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:53,850
control.
Imagine as you're following the 

1308
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:53,850
helicopter just slices you in a 
hamburger.

1309
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:54,520
We did a lot of

1310
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,700
just where people hung from helicopters,
but that's really not that big of a 

1311
01:00:59,700 --> 01:00:59,700
deal.
They just hanging over water,

1312
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,350
you know,
if they fall,

1313
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:05,351
they just land on the water and they're 
not growing nearly as fast as it looks 

1314
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:05,800
like boosh though.
That's the job,

1315
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,760
but you're going to live.
It just.

1316
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,460
It sucks.
It feels weird,

1317
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:15,461
but you're going to live and you learn a
lot about human beings from shit like 

1318
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:18,281
that though.
It's fascinating because between that 

1319
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:20,890
and what do an MMA commentary a real.
I know a lot about seeing people when 

1320
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:26,981
they're.
When they're breaking like the at the 

1321
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:29,471
point where they can't,
they can't tolerate anymore and they 

1322
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,570
give up.
There's a give up point that some people

1323
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:30,920
have it,
some people don't even have it.

1324
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,960
Some people will never give up.
They just have this,

1325
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,160
that,
that whatever.

1326
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:36,650
That give up thing is a part of them is 
broken.

1327
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,690
They don't,
they don't even consider it.

1328
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,940
They'll just march forward their face 
hanging off.

1329
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,040
Is this Guy Diego Sanchez or fights like
that?

1330
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,290
This guy might not be the most skilled 
fighter.

1331
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:47,060
He's very skillful,
might not be the most skilled,

1332
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:50,660
but he's one of the most crazy in that 
he's not going to quit

1333
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,120
that.
This is dangerous man.

1334
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,800
Did you see that video?
If those two guys at the spa who broiled

1335
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:59,380
themselves,
did you see that they broil themselves?

1336
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,380
It's like a competition,
like who can get in?

1337
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,760
It's like a spa,
right?

1338
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,530
You could say in stay in the spa the 
longest in this,

1339
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:09,180
in this sauna and it's these two guys 
and they like,

1340
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:09,900
you know,
it's a,

1341
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,910
it's an elimination process.
These are really disturbing pictures if 

1342
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:18,391
you show them,
but it's like basically a one of the 

1343
01:02:18,391 --> 01:02:21,571
guys died,
like he roiled himself this thing 

1344
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:21,571
because

1345
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,070
he wouldn't get out.
He wouldn't listen to his body broiled.

1346
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:28,071
He just cooked himself like a fucking 
lobster in there and I think one of the 

1347
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:32,361
guys survived,
but there's just a picture of him you 

1348
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:34,341
can find if you google search,
like guys fried and sauna and I don't 

1349
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:35,670
know what it is,
but it's like he's just laying there and

1350
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:37,890
his whole body's rigid.
He's like,

1351
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,630
you know,
like,

1352
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,660
like you put a fucking,
like a lighter on a ant,

1353
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,920
which God forgive me.
I did want when I was a kid,

1354
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,690
I know,
but it's just like that.

1355
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:48,330
Like he just curled up and he's bright,
blistered,

1356
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,650
read really horrible because he wouldn't
give up and what a dumb ass waited a you

1357
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:57,651
die at a spa.
He died with his slippers on massage to 

1358
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:05,050
slippers on rubber slippers.
They gave you a fatal relaxation.

1359
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,850
The Guy,
he's a fucking hero in my book.

1360
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,390
Got Bald guys.
Got He didn't give up.

1361
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Is An interesting thing though.
You see like people who rise to the 

1362
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,000
occasion and people who doubt 
themselves,

1363
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,640
you see them like fumble and stumble 
because the pressure and some people 

1364
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,271
find a way to like get through it.
That's one of the more fascinating 

1365
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:30,231
things about watching anything that's 
competition is that we wonder how we 

1366
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:32,500
would do in that scenario and we're 
almost always fall short,

1367
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:38,030
so we're always in awe of the guy who 
manages to get by all those people that 

1368
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,120
are trying to drag them to the ground 
and carry that ball across the line,

1369
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,700
but with the list of things that people 
are afraid of consistently.

1370
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,050
Number one,
after death,

1371
01:03:46,051 --> 01:03:48,300
of course it's public speaking.
Right,

1372
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,610
and here you guys are to Standup 
Comedians,

1373
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,080
right?
I give public presentation.

1374
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,720
I mean I think that's.
That's a big one.

1375
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,900
I mean I don't know how it compares 
adrenaline wise to hanging from a 

1376
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,830
helicopter and a Bungee cord or sauna,
competition,

1377
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,980
sauna off show that.
Pick.

1378
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,600
Look,
I can't find the gross one.

1379
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:10,730
It's just to show.
Just told it from the Internet.

1380
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,750
That's not the guy.
It's like a guy's like maybe somebody 

1381
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,050
tweet or maybe it's not the real 
picture.

1382
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:19,720
Maybe you got a picture of a Jpeg of 
this guy getting broil.

1383
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:20,880
Man.
It's really.

1384
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,240
I know it's true.
Duncan,

1385
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:25,510
have you almost died in a song once?
Yeah,

1386
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,460
but I had been drinking a lot and then 
decided to have sex with my girlfriend.

1387
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,510
We passed out in the sun and we were 
alone and luckily I woke up somehow.

1388
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:43,190
You guys are fucking lightweights,
but sad to say that it was exactly what 

1389
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,360
I was going to say.
Chris Ryan fucks like a man and she was 

1390
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:55,570
a folly ballplayer.

1391
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,730
I'm lucky I didn't break my Dick.
That was really powerful.

1392
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,430
Strong athletic,
Puerto Rican volleyball.

1393
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,700
Play Jesus.
Good God,

1394
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,230
man.
Now he's still alive.

1395
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,620
A sauna is that?
We'll go.

1396
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,940
Yeah,
that's real man.

1397
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,470
Look at his skin falling off.
That's it.

1398
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,070
And he's all rigid.
He's daddy Friday,

1399
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,560
Bro.
He broiled himself.

1400
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:21,740
He themselves dying right there.
I think he's probably dead already 

1401
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:21,740
there,
but he's.

1402
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,590
Jamie.
What's the scroll down right there.

1403
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:25,210
Hold on.
It's being removed from the sauna.

1404
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,020
Oh my goodness.
That guy got fucking cooked.

1405
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:31,690
He got cooked to literally cook 
themselves for what?

1406
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,000
A trophy.
Probably one.

1407
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,790
At least $5.
It's ridiculous.

1408
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,440
It's so silly.
Humans get lured into awful things.

1409
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,520
I got to appear.
Yeah,

1410
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:40,690
that is a weird thing,
man.

1411
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,720
Darwin award.
That's a Darwin award winner right 

1412
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:45,720
there.
It is,

1413
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:45,720
but you know,
we,

1414
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,570
we also,
if,

1415
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,660
if he won and it was like a million 
dollars or something like that,

1416
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:54,661
and he was okay,
we would applaud him for his ability to 

1417
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:54,661
withstand extreme agony.

1418
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:59,610
We somehow or another admire people that
are willing to survive extreme agony and

1419
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:04,510
the force of endurance races and things 
for something meaningful though,

1420
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:06,880
not for a million dollars,
you know?

1421
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:10,420
I mean,
what's weirder this are dying in a super

1422
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:15,421
marathon while those 100 marathons,
100 mile marathons and your fucking out 

1423
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:16,930
both Kinda dumb.
Really?

1424
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:17,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

1425
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,660
I mean nothing against athletes,
but yeah,

1426
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:22,260
I just,
I,

1427
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,780
I find all that kind of hardcore 
competition,

1428
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,560
meaningless.
I just read a very interesting book 

1429
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,481
called man's search for meaning by 
Viktor Frankl who was in the 

1430
01:06:33,481 --> 01:06:35,890
concentration camp in world war two.
He was a psychiatrist and he said,

1431
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:41,250
he said the,
the how of anything is resolved.

1432
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,980
If you find the why and what he meant 
was you can survive anything if it's 

1433
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,360
meaningful.
If it's not meaningful anything,

1434
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:50,980
we'll take you down.
Wow.

1435
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,860
It's very interesting book.
Beautiful Book.

1436
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:59,940
Anyway,
I don't know why the hell I'm talking 

1437
01:06:59,940 --> 01:06:59,940
about that.

1438
01:06:59,940 --> 01:06:59,940
Oh,
insurance,

1439
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,190
right?
Because he endured Auschwitz,

1440
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,360
you know,
so I find that,

1441
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,670
you know,
that's obviously incredibly admirable,

1442
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,670
but somebody is like,
you put yourself in that position.

1443
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,280
I was talking to a friend in Africa and 
he was joking.

1444
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:09,910
He was like,
you know,

1445
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,820
only white people die,
bungee jumping and you know,

1446
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,330
motorcycles jumping and all this.
So that's a white dude thing.

1447
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:18,260
If I told my mother I died bungee 
jumping,

1448
01:07:18,261 --> 01:07:19,690
or if someone told me my mother had 
died,

1449
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:20,700
bungee jumping,
she'd be like,

1450
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,240
that idiot was bungee jumping you.
He didn't die from malaria or starvation

1451
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,250
or you know,
like what have you,

1452
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,540
white.
Well that's a hack standup comedian.

1453
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:36,541
Premise that's for black comics will 
talk about like camping,

1454
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:40,360
that's a big thing,
but they're terrified of bears and black

1455
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:45,361
people don't go camping.
It's like the whole thing that like 

1456
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:45,361
white people go bungee jumping.

1457
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,040
White people jump out of a helicopter 
and ski down the side of a mountain.

1458
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,410
So maybe he stole this from Dane Cook.
No,

1459
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:55,411
I don't think it's probably an obvious 
premise because it's true like a lot of 

1460
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:59,761
things.
There's a lot of parallel thinking when 

1461
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:01,411
it comes to the realization.
If you live in an incredibly dangerous 

1462
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:01,590
environment like Africa and you're 
looking at white people that are,

1463
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,450
you're not looking for danger jumping,
what are you doing?

1464
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:05,890
Stupid.
I mean it seems to be.

1465
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:10,891
It writes itself.
It's not like you can't like see how a 

1466
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:11,950
lot of people would come to the same 
conclusion.

1467
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:17,110
It's true.
People are fucking hang gliding and 

1468
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:20,771
shit.
Getting those fucking wing suits and 

1469
01:08:20,771 --> 01:08:23,450
flying to downtown.
I can't even watch that shit.

1470
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:24,290
Yeah.
Dude,

1471
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:24,890
you Saturday,

1472
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:29,120
did you see that video of the Gay Dance 
Troupe and Alabama?

1473
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,180
Yes,
I tweeted it so awesome that they hired 

1474
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:34,850
by accident.
Tell the story.

1475
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,240
Well

1476
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,460
like they hired like some,
they,

1477
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:42,870
they hired like a gay,
a female impersonator dance troupe to 

1478
01:08:43,631 --> 01:08:47,080
accidentally for this parade and they 
like,

1479
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,870
they like,
what was the name of the dance troupe?

1480
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:51,550
I can't remember the name.
I don't remember what it was.

1481
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:53,980
Something ridiculous.
But what's so funny is you have.

1482
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:58,981
So here's what you have,
you have these like gay dancers and 

1483
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:01,850
they're interviewing them and like 
combining that with interviews with an 

1484
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,250
angry mothers like my child never should
have had to see something like that.

1485
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,980
She's clearly the Satanist,
right?

1486
01:09:05,981 --> 01:09:09,130
She's like a pawn of the dark Lord.
She's an angry,

1487
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:11,500
angry person.
These guys,

1488
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,820
they're just saying like,

1489
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,830
they're saying like,
man,

1490
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:21,000
if this came to my town,
I would be fucking thrown money on them.

1491
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,360
It's just hilarious.
It's fabulous.

1492
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,760
It's great,
man.

1493
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,400
They're,
they're good to come on.

1494
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,770
That's funny.
In,

1495
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:32,700
in the,
in the interview that they did with him,

1496
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,400
they threw out like Alan Watts level 
wisdom.

1497
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,610
One of them says at the end of the day 
we just came to dance.

1498
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,370
It's really beautiful and sweet.
Meanwhile,

1499
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:45,750
this white angry white ladies like at my
child will never be the same.

1500
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:51,340
My child dancing cool Santa Claus outfit
on.

1501
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,180
Yeah,
yeah,

1502
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:55,840
yeah.
It's really good.

1503
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:00,610
It's really weird.
Like she'd be laughing with her.

1504
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,570
I'll tell you why these people don't get
any weed.

1505
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,010
That's what it is,
right?

1506
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,670
Weed is just not.
Not really getting down there.

1507
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:14,320
If we were high and we were at the side 
of the road and that we are here and we 

1508
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:18,900
would,
we might join them.

1509
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:21,960
Fuck if I pull your shirt up and join 
it,

1510
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:26,990
that would be distracting them from 
their work that they've obviously put 

1511
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,330
me.
Being a heckler thinks he's funnier than

1512
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:28,470
the comedian,
so.

1513
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,880
Yeah,
because they've.

1514
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:31,770
Obviously.
That was the other thing about it.

1515
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,770
Like that shit was choreographed.
It's true.

1516
01:10:34,771 --> 01:10:37,080
It's not their fault.
The fucking people hired him,

1517
01:10:37,081 --> 01:10:38,490
didn't really know what they are 
getting.

1518
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,640
It's like being a comic and you get 
booked for a club and they go,

1519
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:42,990
well,
we expect you to work clean.

1520
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:48,170
Well,
I expect you to know what the fuck I do 

1521
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,170
before you hire me.
Yeah,

1522
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,170
I'm here,
dude.

1523
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,260
You either want me to do comedy or not,
but you don't get to tell me what to do.

1524
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:50,750
It's like when Ted,
you know,

1525
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,760
the thing with Ted had Sarah Silverman 
and then she came out and did what Sarah

1526
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,770
Silverman always does and then the next 
day the head of Ted tweeted that it was 

1527
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,041
the most God awful performance he'd ever
seen and he was embarrassed to have 

1528
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:04,041
invited her and shit.
Like,

1529
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:08,931
how,
how were you surprised that Sarah 

1530
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:08,931
Silverman says shit that's offensive.
Well,

1531
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,990
what was her premise?
What was she going on to,

1532
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,540
uh,
to talk about?

1533
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,100
Do you know?
She just did her stand

1534
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,410
up routine.
She did the thing talking about,

1535
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:16,890
uh,
you know,

1536
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,760
adopting a baby with terminal illness,
you know,

1537
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:22,530
that you haven't heard that.
Oh,

1538
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,280
that's great.
It's,

1539
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:23,780
it's,
you know,

1540
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,800
the whole thing is like,
I love kids and you know,

1541
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:27,920
she does it with her cute Sarah 
Silverman thing,

1542
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:30,720
but I love babies,
but they get older and then they get,

1543
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:35,721
it's problematic.
And so there's so many kids who need 

1544
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:38,900
parents.
I'm going to adopt children with 

1545
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,700
terminal illnesses,
so they die when they're seven or eight 

1546
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:40,700
and then I can get another one.
Yeah,

1547
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,900
he is great.

1548
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:49,060
Fucked up.
But it's obviously comedy,

1549
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:54,300
like this idea that,
and this is one of the grossest things 

1550
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:54,580
that's going on these days.
I've actually started talking about this

1551
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:59,581
on stage.
There's a real problem with people 

1552
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,330
pretending that jokes are statements and
if this is your actual opinions,

1553
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:04,540
like there's an art to sank fucked up 
shit.

1554
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,810
You don't really mean.
If I know that you don't really mean it,

1555
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,630
it's fun.
You and I do it all sense of comedy.

1556
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:17,150
Duncan Duncan will call me up and say 
the most ridiculous shit and I'll say,

1557
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:20,290
well that sounds like a good idea.
Long.

1558
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,580
How long have you been working with 
them?

1559
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,680
You know,
Joe,

1560
01:12:23,681 --> 01:12:26,090
I've seen the error of my ways.
You're like,

1561
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,220
hang in there for like five minutes.
But when he got taken by the NSA to the 

1562
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,370
camp,
the camp,

1563
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:37,970
that was fantastic on my podcast,
I said that I've been taken to the camry

1564
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:43,010
education education camp and then like 
me and Brendan Walsh just sing songs 

1565
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:47,200
about how great the beaches just turned 
into this like vapid big.

1566
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,180
But man,
I think that like that.

1567
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:52,540
It's what people forget is that it's the
intention,

1568
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,310
the intention.

1569
01:12:55,660 --> 01:13:00,660
I think people feel like there's cheap 
laughs that people get away with at the 

1570
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,270
expense of other people's feelings and 
that's why they don't like certain kinds

1571
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:06,590
of of of jokes.
I agreed there's,

1572
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,480
there's a,
there's a balance and there's.

1573
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:14,481
There's off-color subjects that are 
absolutely done hilarious and then 

1574
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:18,231
there's off color subjects that are done
crudely and it's almost insulting how 

1575
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:22,341
bad the material is and you're obviously
just doing it just for shock value and 

1576
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:26,301
we know the difference between the two.
It's a difference between someone you 

1577
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,361
want to listen to where they're 
carefully considering what they're 

1578
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:32,361
saying and then someone who's just not 
really either capable of or not willing 

1579
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:38,121
to look deep enough to get true insight.
So when they both have to be accepted 

1580
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:42,201
though,
because you can't have one without the 

1581
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:42,201
other.
It's a judgement for them.

1582
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:45,120
You need shit comedy to compare comedy.
You need bad experiences.

1583
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,580
I think the hack for life is far as bad 
experiences like the,

1584
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:54,150
the sadness and the trouble,
and then the happiness is just exercise.

1585
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,430
Just fucking workout in a brutally hard 
way and avoid all that depression.

1586
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,640
Just get all that shit out of your way.
Like if you get through a brutal 

1587
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,860
kickboxing workout or a Jujitsu workout,
regular normal nonsense.

1588
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,270
Like I'm fucking leaving.
That's it.

1589
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:10,330
I've got my shit.
Okay.

1590
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,340
All right.
You're too tired to give it.

1591
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:17,341
Yeah,
so it's just been choking me all night 

1592
01:14:17,341 --> 01:14:17,900
leaving.
Okay.

1593
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:24,730
That is a shocking thing about exercise 
sometimes that I'm depressed and I 

1594
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:27,290
finally like drag myself out of the 
House and go to the gym and just run and

1595
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:30,080
sweat and then I'm in my car and I feel 
great.

1596
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:31,070
And it's like,
really?

1597
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,750
That's all I am.
Is that it?

1598
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,270
I just have to exercise.
There's no chance.

1599
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,280
Well,
you're a fucking bag of chemicals.

1600
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,370
You.
You want the mystical payoff?

1601
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,570
I want it.
I want it to.

1602
01:14:44,571 --> 01:14:47,750
It's like some part of when you realize 
just how very simple it is,

1603
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,960
some part of you will reject that 
because you want it to be complex.

1604
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:53,390
You want to be,
you want it to be something like,

1605
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,640
I don't want it to be complex,

1606
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,550
just wanting to hurt less.
Well,

1607
01:14:57,551 --> 01:14:59,570
yeah,
it's always doing that to you anyway.

1608
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:04,571
I mean there's a.
there's a transformative process 

1609
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:04,571
throughout every experience that you 
have throughout your life.

1610
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:06,140
Everything that you do,
you sort of get a balance on,

1611
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:08,330
well now I know how to handle this 
better this time.

1612
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:13,750
The reality of the situation is we have 
a certain amount of requirements that 

1613
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,770
our body needs.
It needs to move around.

1614
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,610
It has to but doesn't it atrophies 
because fairly useless,

1615
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:24,910
like you have to keep it leaving and 
good food to really appreciate the 

1616
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,720
movement of it.
You have to push it really hard.

1617
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:29,480
He pushed it really hard.
It's like a drag racer,

1618
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,140
like a race car that you could develop 
into a race car.

1619
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:36,200
You develop it just by pushing it and 
pushing it and pushing it and it becomes

1620
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:41,201
a race car or if you let it sit alone,
it becomes a really junky old shit box 

1621
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:42,380
that can't start anymore.

1622
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,900
I mean literally it's almost that 
simple.

1623
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,000
I wonder if you really have to push it 
though,

1624
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,740
because I'm thinking of hunter gatherer 
of people,

1625
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:53,741
right?
Who are sort of the model for what the 

1626
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:53,810
body needs.
They don't really push it,

1627
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,630
but they move constantly moving 
constantly.

1628
01:15:56,631 --> 01:16:01,631
It's hard.
Have you ever gone hiking with pack and 

1629
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,440
go fucking workout?
Real workout.

1630
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:05,780
Like you start to like walking up hills 
all day,

1631
01:16:05,781 --> 01:16:07,940
man.
You got fucking exhausted.

1632
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:09,860
Yes.
Nepal,

1633
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,750
there's a guy we were talking about,
this guy that he.

1634
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,120
There's a show called solo hunters and 
these guys,

1635
01:16:17,121 --> 01:16:19,030
they take like these little,
um,

1636
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,230
you know,
there's little gopros and attach them to

1637
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:23,690
their rifle or bow and Arrow and they 
have a camera with them.

1638
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:27,200
They'd go out into the woods and hunt 
bear and Moose and like crazy shit.

1639
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:27,840
Well,
one of the guys,

1640
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:29,150
this guy,
Remy Warren,

1641
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:34,240
who's a world famous hunter,
he's got a vo two Max of a high level 

1642
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:37,200
endurance athlete and all he does his 
height.

1643
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:42,210
He just,
he hunts 300 days a year constantly 

1644
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,980
walking around at high altitude,
constantly walking around and hills and 

1645
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,270
high altitude carrying backpacks.
It's fucking hard work.

1646
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:52,330
It's really hard work,
so that's what if you were going to 

1647
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,510
hunt,
like that's Chetty do you had to fucking

1648
01:16:53,511 --> 01:16:55,820
walk a lot and he was like,
hunting is not just like,

1649
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:00,940
oh,
let's go to the animal place and go 

1650
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:00,940
shoot one of those fucking things and 
drag it out of there.

1651
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:05,121
I mean you got to find them.
You got to track and we got to sneak up 

1652
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:05,121
on them.
Especially in the old days.

1653
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:09,251
You had dog shit equipment.
He had like bows and arrows that you 

1654
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:09,251
made yourself,
oh,

1655
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,060
beers,
terrible.

1656
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,910
And you got to get close enough to an 
animal to use that thing.

1657
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And there's a common misconception that 
like there were more deer back then and 

1658
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,700
actually there weren't.
There's more deer today in North America

1659
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:25,701
than they've ever been.
Way more than like when Columbus first 

1660
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:28,601
got here because of management,
because all of the different habitats 

1661
01:17:28,601 --> 01:17:29,570
because a farm lands,
they thrive and farmland.

1662
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:29,760
So

1663
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,500
because of the absence of predators,
which humans killed,

1664
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,400
it was just a stronger park in Africa a 
week ago.

1665
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:43,170
Intense place.
Really interesting place and I was 

1666
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,581
thinking about that very issue of like 
how because you drove Kruger park is 

1667
01:17:45,581 --> 01:17:45,581
this big area.

1668
01:17:45,581 --> 01:17:45,890
It's,
you know,

1669
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,230
I don't know how big it is,
but it's,

1670
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:49,870
it's like a county size or bigger

1671
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,470
and they're just dirt roads and you just
sort of drive around and the deal is you

1672
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:58,471
can never get out of your car because 
there are leopards and lions and all 

1673
01:17:58,471 --> 01:18:00,400
sorts of crocs and shit everywhere.
But you see a lot of stuff.

1674
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,460
I mean there we saw during the day we 
probably sold five or six lions just 

1675
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,300
along the side of one of these roads,
dirt roads.

1676
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,240
So if there are five or six lines just 
along the road,

1677
01:18:10,241 --> 01:18:13,130
how many lions are there in that place?
You know,

1678
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,790
it's like there's a lion every hundred 
meters along the road.

1679
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:20,791
Well,
how many fucking lines going a place 

1680
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:21,620
like that support of all my friends,
you're the most likely to get eaten by

1681
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,170
an animal and just realized that.
Well,

1682
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:29,171
did you know that in in those areas of 
the South Africa especially like a lot 

1683
01:18:29,511 --> 01:18:31,870
of those places where wild animals 
exist,

1684
01:18:31,871 --> 01:18:33,300
they're fenced in.
Yeah,

1685
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:38,000
that is a lot of what they call high 
fence hunting operations in South Africa

1686
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:42,620
because it's a dirty secret about Africa
and about a lot of North America,

1687
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:44,900
but even more dirty about Africa because
Africa,

1688
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:49,901
a lot of his trophy hunting,
the amount of money that people pay to 

1689
01:18:49,901 --> 01:18:54,101
go hunting over there is real.
That's responsible for a great deal of 

1690
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:55,910
the money that's used for conservation 
efforts.

1691
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,810
Like there's also for importing animals 
like they've.

1692
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:04,990
There's more a lot of African animals in
Texas than there are in Africa because 

1693
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:10,420
in Texas they bring them to these wild 
wild hunting ranches like thousands and 

1694
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,920
thousands of acres and they just have 
these deer just live there.

1695
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:17,200
They just live in Texas now and they 
just live off the land and then they,

1696
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:22,201
you know,
they take guided trips to go and hunt 

1697
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:24,251
these things,
but they have African wild animals that 

1698
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:25,610
are running around like Sitka deer and 
shit running around,

1699
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:28,010
access deer running around in Texas.

1700
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,240
It's weird with these people who paid 
for like hunting licenses,

1701
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:37,390
they go over and I mean it's Kinda crazy
like there was a piece on how cowardly 

1702
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:42,071
it is to hunt alliance like someone 
showed it on this website because 

1703
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:45,191
they're just sitting there like all you 
do is you run up to the difference 

1704
01:19:45,191 --> 01:19:48,311
between a normal day in a day where the 
car shoots them is that a metal stick 

1705
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:50,420
comes out and then all of a sudden their
life ends.

1706
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,670
So they're just sitting there.
They have no idea.

1707
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:57,671
You're a threat.
They have no idea that this is a game 

1708
01:19:57,671 --> 01:19:57,671
that we're playing.
We're going to shoot the line.

1709
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,430
They're just just sitting there chilling
and then someone comes along.

1710
01:20:01,431 --> 01:20:03,530
We'll isolate lion,
like it's kind of fucked,

1711
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:08,590
but people want to be able to say that 
they killed a line as if there were 

1712
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:08,590
danger

1713
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:08,950
whatsoever.
Yeah,

1714
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,410
yeah.
A lot of them are doing.

1715
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:15,411
They're doing it from trucks or junior 
from the roof of trucks is a great 

1716
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,381
hemingway short story about a guide who 
takes a man in his wife out to hunt 

1717
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:22,971
lions and the guy is about to shoot the 
line and the line charges and the dude 

1718
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:28,050
freaks and the guide has to kill the 
lion when he's about to kill the guy.

1719
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,680
And uh,
and then that night the guides leaves 

1720
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,380
with the guy's wife Holla course.
Hemingway.

1721
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,660
So fucking manly.
Did you ever see that?

1722
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:42,470
A Woody Allen movie where,
um,

1723
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,140
I think it's called midnight in Paris.
Owen Wilson movie.

1724
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:46,680
He goes back in time and he meets 
hemingway.

1725
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,900
Yeah.
That was pretty fascinating.

1726
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,680
I love that premise.
All the different writers and painters 

1727
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,880
and stuff that were there.
Yeah,

1728
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,610
just the idea of meaning.
Hemingway,

1729
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,210
man.
It's just getting drunk with them.

1730
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,270
Some people live like really live man.
Some people were like,

1731
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:06,930
when I hear your stories about African,
like you've been everywhere,

1732
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:08,090
listen to you.
Woe is me.

1733
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,110
You just got back from a fucking treat 
with Rom Dawson.

1734
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,170
No,
I don't feel so silly.

1735
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,850
I don't feel.
I don't feel woe is me,

1736
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:17,760
I'm just saying like when I was there 
when I was at that retreat,

1737
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,090
and by the way that's not like in Africa
there's no lions there,

1738
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:27,350
cougars,
but like they're more with crystals.

1739
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:29,940
But when,
when I was um,

1740
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,140
you know,
when I was there,

1741
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:33,580
you would run into people who all they 
do is just travel.

1742
01:21:33,581 --> 01:21:38,581
They figured out how to do it.
They just travel around the world and 

1743
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:38,970
you're Kinda like that.
Are you still make a traveler?

1744
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:41,130
You see you were just in Africa?
Yeah,

1745
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:43,800
but I was there because my,
my wife's daughter was getting married.

1746
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,490
Right.
I mean I didn't go to Africa.

1747
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,720
I used to for years,
for 15,

1748
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:49,710
20 years.
I,

1749
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:54,860
the thing that most,
most meaningful for me was movement and 

1750
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,470
travel and seeing new cultures and all 
that.

1751
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,210
So like you're talking about backpacks,
man,

1752
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:59,430
I wear a backpack for 15 years.
Like,

1753
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,690
well you're the real deal,
dude.

1754
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:05,691
You're,
you're a guy who really made that 

1755
01:22:05,691 --> 01:22:05,760
choice.
You're a guy like,

1756
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:06,660
you know what?
Nope,

1757
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,760
I'm going to have a bunch of really cool
experiences in a bunch of adventures.

1758
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,610
But just like anything else,
you SORTA,

1759
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,830
you get to a been there,
done that point,

1760
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,030
and it started to be like,
man,

1761
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:21,031
you know what,
another stamp in my passport really 

1762
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:22,230
doesn't fucking matter anymore.
You have a real gift for podcasting.

1763
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:27,300
I'm glad you're willing to take if you 
have a gift for the narrative that may 

1764
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:32,361
not,
may not come through in just a printed 

1765
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:34,160
word as much because he can't hear you 
say it right now.

1766
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:37,230
There's this.
It's not just the thoughts that you say,

1767
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:40,500
it's how you say it and you're,
you were very good at it,

1768
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,080
you know,
so the idea that you didn't do it before

1769
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:48,260
and now that you have done it,
like the idea that you're going to just 

1770
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:48,300
travel around the world and not give us 
fresh podcasts,

1771
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,100
people's like this bullshit,
bro.

1772
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,830
That's true,
man.

1773
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:55,780
I'm really glad you're doing.
The guy who got me into it is Duncan.

1774
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,380
I mean Danielle,
Ellie,

1775
01:22:57,390 --> 01:23:02,390
I'm really glad he's doing it as well.
It's a cool thing and I'm glad you're 

1776
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,390
doing this.
Well,

1777
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:06,250
I mean it's a,
it's podcasting is one of the and most,

1778
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:06,770
uh,
uh,

1779
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:10,930
fascinating entrance into the world of 
medium that's ever existed.

1780
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:15,931
It's one of the,
one of the weirdest and one of the ones 

1781
01:23:15,931 --> 01:23:17,270
where you can,
I think probably affect the,

1782
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:17,910
the,
the,

1783
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:21,430
like the curve of society.
I think the curve of society is going to

1784
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:26,431
get affected more by fascinating 
podcasts then buy virtually anything 

1785
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:29,740
that they've ever had as far as like 
the,

1786
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,760
like exposed electronic media,
whether it's television,

1787
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:38,761
whether it's radio.
I think all those things had a big 

1788
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:40,801
impact,
but I think podcasting and viewer 

1789
01:23:40,801 --> 01:23:43,030
created or you know,
a regular user created content,

1790
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,840
whatever it may be,
people with Webcams,

1791
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:50,850
people writing blogs like this,
this new stream of stuff that's coming 

1792
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,660
down the pipe now.
It's so different.

1793
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,120
There were,
there were no podcasts like yours.

1794
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,670
It did not exist when I was in high 
school.

1795
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,440
If it did exist when I was in high 
school,

1796
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,810
me and my friends would a huddled around
candles.

1797
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:07,150
Okay.
We would have sat around listening and 

1798
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,390
we would have talked about,
do you think Dunkin's right?

1799
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:09,930
Yeah.
My Dad's a fucking asshole,

1800
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:16,270
he just wants me to suffer like and 
he'll fucking regret it on his dying 

1801
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,760
death bed,
but will I let him regretted?

1802
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:22,930
Fuck No,
I'm taking my guitar and I'm fucking 

1803
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:26,171
hitchhiked into Canada and that's.
And I think you know that that exists 

1804
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:29,890
now in mass.
I'm not

1805
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,450
doing it.
You're doing it.

1806
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:36,451
There's so many of our friends have 
podcast bill burn and Brian Cowen and 

1807
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:39,290
Ari Shaffir and Joey Diaz.
It's like a fucking epidemic.

1808
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:41,900
And you want to talk about an epidemic 
of entertainment.

1809
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:45,020
It's podcasting is an epidemic.
Yeah,

1810
01:24:45,021 --> 01:24:47,230
it's definitely,
it's,

1811
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:52,410
I,
I wonder what it's going to evolve into 

1812
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:54,550
I,
because it's still in the early 

1813
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,800
embryonic phases of the thing.
I wonder what it's going to be in 15 

1814
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:01,121
years,
what it will be or how it will be 

1815
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:01,121
accepted or,
or what it will be.

1816
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:02,160
I'm sure it's going to vary.
Just like everything else varies.

1817
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:03,110
It's like books,
like,

1818
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,490
you know,
there's books that are dog shit.

1819
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:07,160
You're not going to get a goddamn thing 
out of him and his books that you read,

1820
01:25:07,161 --> 01:25:12,161
like the war of art.
It just read a couple of passages and 

1821
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:12,161
you're like,
God,

1822
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:13,310
yes,
it's fucking guys nailing it,

1823
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:13,740
right?

1824
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:14,690
Like,
Holy Shit.

1825
01:25:14,691 --> 01:25:16,740
Like this is a real game changer.
This is a,

1826
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:21,900
uh,
this guy has given me the tools to 

1827
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:22,220
reapproach my,
my way of looking at the very thing I do

1828
01:25:22,221 --> 01:25:23,210
for a living.
Like,

1829
01:25:23,211 --> 01:25:24,530
wow,
this is kind of nuts.

1830
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,650
You know?
So there's,

1831
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,150
there's,
there's a lot of variation when it comes

1832
01:25:29,151 --> 01:25:34,151
to podcasting,
but it's the possibility that someone 

1833
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:35,150
could just express something and it can 
get there immediately.

1834
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,370
Think of it all the time and effort.
You had to put two,

1835
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:42,371
creating a book like sex at dawn,
and think about if you just decided to 

1836
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:47,111
break that discussion up into x amount 
of podcasts and just freely relay your 

1837
01:25:48,861 --> 01:25:51,830
experiences on the subject,
the information where you got it from.

1838
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:57,130
Passionately talk about these cultures 
where these people have these unique 

1839
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,340
experiences with each other.
Passionately.

1840
01:25:58,341 --> 01:26:03,341
Talk about the roots of common 
misconceptions about things like 

1841
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:05,570
promiscuity and a lot this,
it's all missing in a flat word.

1842
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,710
You know,
you could get that,

1843
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:09,980
you gather the pros and you know,
you can kind of paint the.

1844
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,190
But to hear a person say it,
you know,

1845
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,960
to hear you talk about your work is 
almost more rewarding.

1846
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,570
Yeah.
And it's.

1847
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:20,430
And it's very rewarding on,
on my side is a writer because the thing

1848
01:26:20,431 --> 01:26:25,431
is like,
I'm not one of these people who always 

1849
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,991
wanted to be a writer.
I always had people telling me I should 

1850
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:27,570
be a writer because when I wrote 
something it worked,

1851
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,730
you know,
but I never liked.

1852
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:34,731
Right.
I still don't like writing and people 

1853
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:34,731
get really disappointed to hear that.
Like,

1854
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:34,731
Oh,
you know,

1855
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:38,720
what's your process and my process.
I just avoided it as long as possible 

1856
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:38,720
and then do it,
you know,

1857
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,230
that's my process.
I hate it.

1858
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:45,620
I really like public speaking and I like
stuff like this because there's an 

1859
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:45,620
immediacy to it.
You know,

1860
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:50,520
it's the difference between sitting in a
studio and making a record and doing 

1861
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,570
concerts.
It's,

1862
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:55,571
it's energy.
If you're not terrified by public 

1863
01:26:55,571 --> 01:26:56,540
speaking is none of us are.
You guys know better than me.

1864
01:26:56,541 --> 01:27:01,541
It it fills you with energy to be on 
stage and see people responding to what 

1865
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,330
you're saying as opposed to draining it 
out of you.

1866
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:04,200
Right.
Also,

1867
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:06,150
I think that I can clearly see that

1868
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,800
benefited greatly from all these 
conversations.

1869
01:27:08,801 --> 01:27:11,870
Like I know me personally,
it's expanded my thought.

1870
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,900
It's an education 100 percent.
It gives people a reason to take time 

1871
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,300
out of their day and talk with you,
which is so cool.

1872
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:19,930
It's also

1873
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:25,240
made me very enthusiastic about 
communicating with people and I think 

1874
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,360
the art of conversation,
you know,

1875
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:31,100
I think we're so lost in the day to day 
grind where people have to pretend to be

1876
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:33,050
something they're not for the majority 
of their day.

1877
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,560
They have to be reserved.
You can't make jokes,

1878
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:41,561
you can't talk about anything that's 
really crazy or current commercial 

1879
01:27:41,561 --> 01:27:41,780
because you have to work,
you know you're there to work.

1880
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:46,130
You're not there to be yourself,
so there's all this suppression and then

1881
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:51,131
when people get free of that,
now you know how much time do they 

1882
01:27:51,131 --> 01:27:53,561
really have to truly open up and the 
more people you are around that are 

1883
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:59,351
exposing you to different thoughts.
One of the things that I love about 

1884
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:00,650
talking to you as you and I often agree 
on things,

1885
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:04,550
but we also have wildly different 
perspectives that we come at things from

1886
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:05,130
and your.

1887
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:06,960
You'll oftentimes come at something.
Well,

1888
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:07,880
I'll go,
yeah,

1889
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:12,890
I didn't fucking know I agree with you,
but you're coming at it from such a 

1890
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,480
weird place that I probably never would 
have considered,

1891
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:19,630
but because you're my friend,
I get to consider that and then I get 

1892
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,410
enriched by this possibility and then 
you being my friend,

1893
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:26,411
you will come up with another 
possibility and we all feed off of each 

1894
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:30,071
other.
And then other people listened to that 

1895
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:30,071
and they say,
Hey,

1896
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,161
I was listening to Duncan trussell talk 
about this thing and Christopher Ryan 

1897
01:28:33,161 --> 01:28:33,350
said that this.
And then and then boom,

1898
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:36,320
and that branches out and then it 
spreads from there.

1899
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:40,010
The enhancement that you feel in having 
these conversations is contagious.

1900
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,170
It's contagious to other people that are
listening to it.

1901
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:44,250
I met people in,
in Maputo,

1902
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,350
Mozambique who listened to Dunkin's 
podcast.

1903
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:53,190
Seriously,
completely randomly,

1904
01:28:53,191 --> 01:28:58,191
right.
I'm sitting at a table in this wedding 

1905
01:28:58,191 --> 01:28:59,880
and I said something about a podcast and
then someone at the table is like,

1906
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,140
oh,
I listen to like,

1907
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,810
who do you listen to it,
you know?

1908
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:04,620
And he's like,
Oh,

1909
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:06,840
this Guy Duncan trussell,
I think he's in La.

1910
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,490
And it's like,
I heard of him.

1911
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:09,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1912
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:14,421
It's fucking bad.
So I got an email from someone saying a 

1913
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:19,520
fedex driver in Utah who listens to my 
podcast when he's driving and I'm sure 

1914
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,120
yours as well since we're all sort of in
the same.

1915
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:26,540
And a woman in Finland who listens to it
when she's commuting to work in the 

1916
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:30,831
morning,
she got up and she wants to know she's 

1917
01:29:30,831 --> 01:29:31,980
got to be hot and it's dark up there all
winter.

1918
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,200
She wants a hug.
She wants,

1919
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:38,870
she wants to make sure we don't get.
It's got to go to the bathroom again.

1920
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:46,870
The if you just stop and think about the
amount of downloads and the amount of 

1921
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,870
episodes,

1922
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:48,510
just throw it out there.
You know what this podcast is?

1923
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:49,580
I think that,
what do we like?

1924
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,940
Four 30,
400,

1925
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,760
30,
433rd podcast.

1926
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:58,790
Each one of them is,
the majority of them are at least two 

1927
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,340
hours long.
Most of them are three.

1928
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:03,870
The majority of my three hours,
there's only a few that are like an hour

1929
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:08,871
or more.
Just slightly more so that's a lot of 

1930
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:11,451
time.
That's a lot of fucking information 

1931
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:11,451
that.
Yeah.

1932
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:11,451
Can I just say what we're talking about 
this.

1933
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:16,290
It sounds like an ass kiss thing here,
but you have really kind listeners.

1934
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:21,780
Every time I'm on your podcast,
I get so many tweets and emails from 

1935
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,940
people and nobody's being a dick.
I'm sure there are addicts out there,

1936
01:30:24,941 --> 01:30:27,010
but for some reason they don't bother 
writing.

1937
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,250
Thank you.
Dicks.

1938
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,100
It's beautiful.
Yeah,

1939
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:34,780
I mean people are just so enthusiastic 
and supportive and cool.

1940
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,050
It's a really interesting self selected 
community,

1941
01:30:38,051 --> 01:30:41,630
I guess because people who are dicks 
probably wouldn't be attracted to this

1942
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:42,870
podcast.
Well,

1943
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:48,140
I think people resonate with like the 
imitator atmosphere to a great extent 

1944
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,620
and if you grow up in a terrible place 
or a place that has weird tribal 

1945
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:57,981
cultures,
I mean we've seen it time and time 

1946
01:30:57,981 --> 01:30:57,981
again,
go back to Africa and like the tradition

1947
01:30:57,981 --> 01:31:00,810
of putting plates in your lips to 
signify how many cows you get.

1948
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:05,760
It's not a weird fucking things that 
people do and you can get in a bad group

1949
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:11,030
and you can get into bad pattern and you
can get into a bad groove that a lot of 

1950
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:14,040
other people are also in and it's really
easy to do and you see that in.

1951
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:19,500
There's radio stations that have 
followings where it's known that if you 

1952
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:19,500
go on stage with the opiate,
that ego.

1953
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,230
I love Opie and Anthony,
but it was

1954
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,390
no in amongst a lot of comedians.
If you get up there,

1955
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:24,590
we're going to fucking torture you.

1956
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:29,780
Like bill burr has a famous video of.
This is my favorite radio show ever open

1957
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:31,800
anthony show,
so I'm not criticizing them.

1958
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:37,070
But there are a bunch of men talk and 
shit and they're what they call the 

1959
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,590
pests.
So the listeners,

1960
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:42,780
they're fucking savages sap badges and 
they booed dom irrera and after they 

1961
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:47,670
blew down the road,
Bill Burr is a huge [inaudible] fan,

1962
01:31:47,671 --> 01:31:52,671
always has been.
So Bill went on after him and just tore 

1963
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:53,940
the whole city a new asshole just kept 
talking shit about Philadelphia,

1964
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:58,941
but they created that somehow or another
with their intentions with their 

1965
01:31:58,941 --> 01:32:00,790
broadcast,
what they put out in their broadcast.

1966
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:05,290
And I did not plan on this in any way,
shape or form.

1967
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,110
This is just something that's happened,
all of it.

1968
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,870
The amount of positivity that's come out
of it,

1969
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:16,050
the attitude of the people that this 
idea of embracing health and,

1970
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:21,470
and,
and good thinking and being kind to 

1971
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:21,470
people being of paramount importance.

1972
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:22,600
One of the most important things in your
life,

1973
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,660
not get your shit together,
not you be the fucking man,

1974
01:32:25,661 --> 01:32:27,040
not you.
Be Successful.

1975
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:29,920
No number one most important thing is to
be nice.

1976
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:33,130
It's like the most important thing.
Be kind until you can't be kind.

1977
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,600
So you got to tell people to shut the 
fuck up.

1978
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:35,590
Come on,
you're killing me.

1979
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,440
You know,
it's be kind until you hit that point 90

1980
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:40,830
yourself to fuck.
Yeah,

1981
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,300
and also be willing to do that same shit
to yourself.

1982
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:48,590
You're willing to be like super 
objective to super self analytical and 

1983
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:50,290
be just.
Just try to get through this and realize

1984
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:52,150
that if five people can do it,
5 million can do it.

1985
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,910
It's that simple.
Like I always say like this room,

1986
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,150
here's a perfect example.
This is.

1987
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,120
I beaten it to death,
but it's a good one.

1988
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,310
If we were the only people on the 
planet,

1989
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,080
if it was just us and we existed on this
weird island and everywhere else,

1990
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,130
like,
look guys,

1991
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:08,290
we got a lot of food here.
We're fine.

1992
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,260
I mean this is a vibrant ecosystem.
Has No predators.

1993
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,390
We can live here.
We're going to be okay.

1994
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,320
Oh,
you were fucking Duncan.

1995
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:17,990
You know,
we found this weird sex shit.

1996
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,820
Get that out of the way.
He's got the beard is like,

1997
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,670
where are the girls?
We have to find girls.

1998
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,370
I know as soon as he said like us guys 
on an island,

1999
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:30,880
I'm thinking

2000
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:39,100
us friends,
if we were in any place where we were 

2001
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,701
forced to be together,
we would ultimately figure out a way to 

2002
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:41,701
work it out.
It would suck if there weren't girls.

2003
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:45,040
You're right,
but ultimately there would be no wars.

2004
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:47,040
What my point is,
there will be,

2005
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,550
there wouldn't be a war,
you know,

2006
01:33:48,551 --> 01:33:51,740
you and I have net.
We've even the minor disagreements,

2007
01:33:51,741 --> 01:33:55,090
so we have ever had ever in our 10 plus 
year friendship,

2008
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:00,240
they've been cured off with a couple 
sentences back and forth instantly and 

2009
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,040
always super cool and always on like,
you know,

2010
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:05,680
I would never say anything on purpose to
hurt your feelings.

2011
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,200
That's not what a friend does ever.
Well,

2012
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:10,150
if we lived on an island together,
it'd be the same thing.

2013
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,370
I wouldn't.
All of a sudden it'd be like,

2014
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,990
you know what the Fuck Dunkin,
you gotTa Stop Smoking Weed or I'm going

2015
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:19,540
to put you in my canoe cage,
made a cage in his fucking canoe and I'm

2016
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:24,541
going to wrap you up in there and you're
not following my fucking rules out the 

2017
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:24,541
cage.
You can.

2018
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:24,541
Oh,
I would say,

2019
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:25,540
you know,
I need all the fucking mangoes.

2020
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:26,800
Bitch.
I got a gun.

2021
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:28,420
You guys don't have any guns left.
I got.

2022
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:30,170
I need the fucking mangoes.
I want the mangoes.

2023
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:35,130
I'm tired of eating my mangoes and you 
know what you're talking about is,

2024
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,870
has happened a large scale.

2025
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:40,530
Six or seven,
the flies.

2026
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:45,590
It's a lord of the flies situation that 
that's how it was framed in the article 

2027
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:45,840
because the Lord of the flies,
of course,

2028
01:34:45,841 --> 01:34:47,820
for people who don't know what is this 
book about?

2029
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:52,820
Kids who get stranded on an island 
somewhere and it turns into this really 

2030
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:52,820
nasty hobbs,
Ian,

2031
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,670
you know,
dominating society.

2032
01:34:53,671 --> 01:34:58,671
Some kids,
if they break the kids glasses and it's 

2033
01:34:58,671 --> 01:34:58,671
all and shaky

2034
01:34:58,671 --> 01:34:59,300
piggy,
right?

2035
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,260
But,
but what?

2036
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:02,060
Fuck him,
I was that deliberate.

2037
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:07,070
Those deliverance to burt reynolds.
Fuck them in deliverance.

2038
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,140
Fuck that kid.
A blind kid.

2039
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,310
Oh,
even worse,

2040
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:19,690
but no,
these kids actually did get stranded on 

2041
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:22,151
an island somewhere.
I don't remember the the basis of the 

2042
01:35:22,151 --> 01:35:24,701
story,
but it was a historical event and they 

2043
01:35:24,701 --> 01:35:28,210
cooperated,
took care of each other and survived 

2044
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:28,210
months,
you know,

2045
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:31,040
and there wasn't any of that nastiness,
this whole hobbsy and idea.

2046
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:34,310
We were talking earlier about the 
dominant paradigm in the bullshit that,

2047
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:39,340
you know,
network tv was putting out for so long 

2048
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:42,131
that it's now getting subverted by the 
Internet and buy all these different 

2049
01:35:42,131 --> 01:35:43,700
channels of information.
For me,

2050
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:48,701
one of the most pernicious ones is this 
idea of human nature being nasty in its 

2051
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:50,410
essence.
The Hobbs Ian view of.

2052
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,040
I take it you're not a fan of the 
walking dead.

2053
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,650
No,
I just find it boring.

2054
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:57,410
I watched the first season or something 
and then it was like,

2055
01:35:57,411 --> 01:35:58,130
okay,
right.

2056
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:03,131
The heads of blow up.
The classic scenario of people wind up 

2057
01:36:03,131 --> 01:36:07,601
being their worst enemies around the 
Zombie seem pretty easy to deal with 

2058
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:08,360
after awhile because people that become 
the real issue,

2059
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,920
including,
you know,

2060
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,390
the men who want to choose the Alpha is 
always.

2061
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:13,770
We'll see the,
the,

2062
01:36:13,771 --> 01:36:16,570
the notion that we even have an Alpha 
is,

2063
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:19,850
is more complicated than it seems.
You know,

2064
01:36:19,851 --> 01:36:22,730
we're not.
Humans never organized themselves into a

2065
01:36:22,731 --> 01:36:24,750
wolf packs.
That's not the way we live.

2066
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:29,990
Know never did live that way.
Fatty while he never seen me and my 

2067
01:36:31,101 --> 01:36:32,030
boys.
When we go out,

2068
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,160
Chris Ryan,
Wolf Pack,

2069
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:39,600
we all went to move in together.
We slap our chest three times all in 

2070
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,060
synchronous.
Oh God.

2071
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,590
Well,
we'll pack jackets as well.

2072
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,570
Past my scattered gene.

2073
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:48,130
Letters over leather.
They,

2074
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,870
that's what they call us.
They call it the woolpack.

2075
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:54,860
And could you basically deal basically 
like lone wolves gathered together,

2076
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:59,000
gathered together a group of lone 
wolves,

2077
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:05,220
gang up.
Well,

2078
01:37:05,221 --> 01:37:05,750
the,
you know what?

2079
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:10,100
We have to ultimately realized that 
there's we 100 percent need each other.

2080
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:14,300
It's one of the most important things.
We also 100 per cent need the people.

2081
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:19,301
If you want to truly be happy,
you need the people around you to like 

2082
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:19,760
you and you need to have them.
They have to have a reason to like you,

2083
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:23,450
like you have to be giving out as much 
as you're taking away or more.

2084
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:28,710
And if that doesn't see this,
that what you just said is that the 

2085
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,841
basis of what I think is one of the 
greatest misunderstandings in human 

2086
01:37:31,841 --> 01:37:32,180
evolutionary theory,
which is,

2087
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:37,420
you know,
they use game theory to try to work out 

2088
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,061
how our ancestors lived in one of the 
assumptions is the freeloader 

2089
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:42,230
assumption,
which is that you can't possibly,

2090
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:47,231
our ancestors couldn't possibly have 
lived in a sharing kind of environment 

2091
01:37:47,231 --> 01:37:49,220
economically because some people would 
just take and take and take and not give

2092
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:50,360
anything back.
Right?

2093
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:55,630
And so that's a base assumption.
So then from that they justify 

2094
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,160
capitalism,
doggy dog

2095
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,030
economics,
right?

2096
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:57,510
And they say,
well,

2097
01:37:57,511 --> 01:38:02,511
it must have been that way,
but the fact is shame is a hugely 

2098
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:07,580
motivating force and as you just said,
we are designed by nature to really care

2099
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,850
whether the people around us love us or 
not.

2100
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,980
And if they don't,
it freaks us out.

2101
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,000
So people work always to give back to 
the group,

2102
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,920
right?
Because if you're not giving back to the

2103
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:21,990
group,
if you worst case scenario,

2104
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:24,060
you get banished by the group,
you're dead,

2105
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,450
right?
This is why they stayed at the party.

2106
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Your brain,
that experiences rejection is in a 

2107
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:31,500
different part of the brain hurts worse 
than anything.

2108
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:31,680
Yeah,

2109
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:37,400
it does too.
And that's why kids are so cruel with 

2110
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:37,400
each other.
When they reject each other,

2111
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,460
when they're at play,
we're not playing with you anymore.

2112
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:41,730
Oh,
they're exercising that little muscle.

2113
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:43,050
Figuring out like,
oh look,

2114
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:43,980
I can get someone to dance.

2115
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:45,980
You know,
man Shit.

2116
01:38:45,981 --> 01:38:50,981
To them,
this is like the thing at this retreat 

2117
01:38:50,981 --> 01:38:50,981
that they talked about that I really 
love,

2118
01:38:50,981 --> 01:38:50,981
man is,
is.

2119
01:38:50,981 --> 01:38:52,460
So you're saying be kind to other 
people.

2120
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:57,630
Well,
the question is how can you be 

2121
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:57,630
authentically kind to the people around 
you?

2122
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:01,450
And the simple simple answer is you have
to love yourself first.

2123
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:05,990
You can't reject yourself.
You can't be the rejecting force because

2124
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:10,991
a lot of times your personality is a 
personality constructed by people who 

2125
01:39:10,991 --> 01:39:12,980
rejected you from the moment you started
talking your parents.

2126
01:39:12,981 --> 01:39:15,620
It's not even you,
so you're rejecting yourself.

2127
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,710
The first thing is start loving 
yourself.

2128
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:23,740
Embrace yourself right now.
That's going to make a big change and 

2129
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,370
that cause like if you want to really 
change somebody's,

2130
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:30,790
love them,
love a person will get around unless 

2131
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,790
they're super annoying.
Just avoid them.

2132
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,730
Love everybody.
You can't fix it.

2133
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:33,900
I'm just saying,
no,

2134
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:35,310
no,
but here's you know,

2135
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,550
you're right.
Certain people are of course,

2136
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:41,390
but in general,
if you want to watch somebody change,

2137
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:46,930
get around them and just like them,
just beam love at them and watch how 

2138
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:47,990
they act.
Because here's one thing that is certain

2139
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,610
being mean to people does not make 
people better because if it did,

2140
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:55,390
we would live on a planet,
other cool motherfuckers.

2141
01:39:55,980 --> 01:40:00,980
This planet would be filled with the 
sweetest people ever because we're also 

2142
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:01,390
cruel to each other.
It doesn't work.

2143
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,330
That's very simplistic and here's why,
why

2144
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:08,330
it is because it's not that everybody's 
also mean to each other.

2145
01:40:08,331 --> 01:40:09,860
It's just that when we are mean to each 
other,

2146
01:40:09,861 --> 01:40:14,861
it hurts so bad.
If you stop and think about your 

2147
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:14,861
interactions with people on a daily 
basis.

2148
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:19,450
There's very few main ones.
I went to the mall today and I wandered 

2149
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:20,780
through a couple of stores and I met a 
bunch of people that said,

2150
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:22,520
hi.
I met a bunch of people that were at the

2151
01:40:22,521 --> 01:40:24,710
fucking coffee beans stand.
They said,

2152
01:40:24,711 --> 01:40:27,020
hi.
I met a guy in the parking lot.

2153
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:27,800
He said,
hi.

2154
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,110
There was very little negative 
interaction.

2155
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,080
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

2156
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,020
but when?
When it happens,

2157
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:38,230
it's terrible.
It's just the real problem is when we 

2158
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:41,441
look at life today,
and it is a huge issue with our view of 

2159
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:45,200
the world is based on seven fucking 
billion people and that's madness.

2160
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,470
You can have the information,
the fears,

2161
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:52,650
the tragedies,
the events of 7 billion people inside 

2162
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:53,800
your fucking head.
You can't that.

2163
01:40:53,801 --> 01:40:58,801
It's too God damn big.
Why don't you just think about the 

2164
01:40:58,801 --> 01:40:58,801
infinite amount of living beings in the 
universe itself?

2165
01:40:58,801 --> 01:41:03,720
Why not consider all the fucking mold 
spores that are probably going to die 

2166
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,960
when someone sprayed lysol on them?
Let's go fucking hogwild and worry about

2167
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:06,190
everything.
You can't.

2168
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:11,340
You can't.
If you want to get through your 24 hour 

2169
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:11,560
time period,
you know only of which you're awake.

2170
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:14,800
16.
You got to fucking prioritize.

2171
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:19,830
And if you don't fucking prioritize,
you're not going to have time to enjoy 

2172
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:23,551
this experience.
You're not gonna have time to take it 

2173
01:41:23,551 --> 01:41:23,551
in.
You'll be caught up in the wave of,

2174
01:41:23,551 --> 01:41:25,630
of momentum,
of other people's ideas and you'll never

2175
01:41:25,631 --> 01:41:26,560
be able to catch yourself.

2176
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:31,220
But rejecting someone takes energy.
And if I understand what you're saying,

2177
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:36,310
called Verizon and change the number 
that takes energy to,

2178
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,290
I don't know how long have you been on 
hold with verizon,

2179
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:40,790
but uh,
you know,

2180
01:41:40,791 --> 01:41:42,380
what you were describing is,
you know,

2181
01:41:42,381 --> 01:41:44,810
it's a psychotherapeutic thing where 
you're,

2182
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:47,860
no matter who's sitting across the table
from you,

2183
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:50,540
you have to accept them.
If you're not accepting them,

2184
01:41:50,541 --> 01:41:52,280
you're never going to be able to help 
them.

2185
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:58,010
It doesn't mean you have to like them,
doesn't mean you have to not be annoyed 

2186
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:58,190
by them,
but it means you'll respect them.

2187
01:41:58,191 --> 01:42:03,191
You respect like whatever it is that's 
annoying about them is something that's 

2188
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:07,220
resonating in you.
The Carl Jung said like every person who

2189
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:12,221
irritates you is an opportunity to learn
something about yourself because you 

2190
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:15,920
know that person is annoying to you in a
special sort of way.

2191
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:21,130
Often Times you know,
and so there's something about you 

2192
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:21,130
that's interesting,
terrified of seeing that those words,

2193
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:26,020
the implication of what you're saying is
if you embrace those qualities in 

2194
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,820
yourself that you can't even accept,
so you're casting them into the world,

2195
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:34,060
then all of a sudden those people who 
are so annoying to you stop being as 

2196
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,451
annoying because you're not seeing the 
part of yourself you hate reflected on 

2197
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:37,451
the screen of them

2198
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:42,190
possibly,
and also possibly they feel accepted so 

2199
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:42,560
they don't need to keep doing that 
bullshit to you.

2200
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:47,640
It's an experiment.
You can do an experiment and here's the 

2201
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:47,710
great experiment because probably for 
your entire life,

2202
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:51,520
when you get around Douche bags,
you either aggressively attack them,

2203
01:42:51,521 --> 01:42:56,521
passive aggressively,
attack them or try to get out of their 

2204
01:42:56,521 --> 01:42:56,521
presence,
so do a little experiment.

2205
01:42:56,521 --> 01:42:58,120
The next time you get around a real 
douche,

2206
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:03,210
somebody who's like really fucking 
annoying and the Douche temperature is 

2207
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:06,070
starting to turn up.
You don't have to stay there forever,

2208
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:11,370
but look at them and look at their face 
and you'll see lines in their face and 

2209
01:43:12,101 --> 01:43:17,101
if you look at those lines,
you'll realize this douche bag has 

2210
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:20,430
suffered just like you have suffered 
this douche bag,

2211
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:21,370
his,
his,

2212
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:26,490
his suffered so much that they've 
created a massive defense mechanism 

2213
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:30,570
called their personality,
which makes everyone think they're a 

2214
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,900
douche bag.
The world they wander through is a world

2215
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:35,980
of faces looking at them with either 
like a anxiety,

2216
01:43:35,981 --> 01:43:40,981
sadness,
a sense of claustrophobia and not 

2217
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:40,981
wanting to be in their presence anymore.

2218
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:45,360
They're 40 or 50.
It's not working that the reaction the 

2219
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,901
world is giving them isn't only making 
them more and more and more of a Douche 

2220
01:43:49,901 --> 01:43:49,901
bag.
So this is compassion.

2221
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:55,020
You recognize that this has suffered.
You don't have to stay in this way 

2222
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:55,070
forever.
I tried it the other night at a bar with

2223
01:43:55,071 --> 01:43:58,930
somebody passive,
hipster Buddhism,

2224
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:00,770
ducking.
It lasted,

2225
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:02,660
it lasted.
I was able to do it for like,

2226
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,970
because this is like a guy I would never
ever,

2227
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:06,890
ever be around.
Somebody brought him.

2228
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:11,891
He's like this like just lucky weird 
dude and he's like being just a pure 

2229
01:44:11,891 --> 01:44:13,000
defense mechanism.
Dick.

2230
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:15,260
I've just gotten back from this 
meditation retreat.

2231
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,140
So I'm like,
alright,

2232
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:16,730
okay,
I don't care.

2233
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:21,731
I'm going to see.
I'm going to find something in this 

2234
01:44:21,731 --> 01:44:23,591
person that I can love that I can 
connect to that I know that this person 

2235
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:23,591
is,
is,

2236
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,790
is gotten this way because you know,
who knows what.

2237
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:29,870
So I open myself up much more than I 
usually do in those situations.

2238
01:44:29,871 --> 01:44:34,871
I didn't go take a leak or I didn't just
go to some other part of the bar and 

2239
01:44:34,871 --> 01:44:34,871
he's,
you know what he starts doing man,

2240
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:38,180
he starts to like after this like whole,
like weird dickie,

2241
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:43,181
like Alpha male thing.
All of a sudden he starts pulling out 

2242
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:44,480
his phone and he's showing me pictures 
of his,

2243
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,920
of his,
of his kids,

2244
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,810
and it's like not an annoying thing.
He's like,

2245
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:52,940
you.
He's faces now lighting up and he loves 

2246
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,151
his kids and he's just.
All of a sudden there's just this one 

2247
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,740
moment where the Douche has fallen away 
and there's a sweet person who loves his

2248
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:59,570
kids do it.
You should read Christmas movies.

2249
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,430
Well,
I just,

2250
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:03,360
it's,
it's,

2251
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,240
it's,
it's,

2252
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,600
it's a,
it's an observer.

2253
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:10,601
If you know the observer effect and 
quantum physics where they say the 

2254
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:10,601
observation effects the thing itself.

2255
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:12,290
In that same way,
like if you're,

2256
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,810
if you,
if you just start experimenting a little

2257
01:45:14,811 --> 01:45:17,450
bit with shining compassion out into the
world,

2258
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:22,720
then you might get things bouncing back 
that aren't these douche bags that 

2259
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:26,531
you're so used to encountering and you 
don't have to trick yourself into 

2260
01:45:26,531 --> 01:45:29,351
thinking like,
I'm going to be fucking Gandhi or Rom 

2261
01:45:29,351 --> 01:45:29,351
dosser.
I've,

2262
01:45:29,351 --> 01:45:32,710
I'm always going to be in this state.
Just try to maintain the state for a 

2263
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:32,750
minute thing.
Go back to being a Dick,

2264
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,320
you know,
maintain the state for two minutes and 

2265
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,211
if you can't do it then start punishing 
the person or being weird or like 

2266
01:45:40,211 --> 01:45:41,450
talking shit to him or talking shit 
about him,

2267
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,540
but just for try two minutes and see 
what happens.

2268
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:46,910
The effects are going to really amaze 
you,

2269
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:52,180
especially if your entire life you've 
only been dealing with people in a 

2270
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:52,250
shitty way.
I've had to revise my whole.

2271
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:53,990
Cut The vampire out of your life thing,
man.

2272
01:45:53,991 --> 01:45:55,520
I'm not sure if that's the right way to 
do it.

2273
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:57,710
I think it's love the vampire in your 
heart.

2274
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:58,730
I've got to revise.

2275
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,020
Album is there's not enough time and you
know the real problem.

2276
01:46:02,021 --> 01:46:07,021
The number one real problem is how the 
fuck did they get that way in the first 

2277
01:46:07,021 --> 01:46:09,700
place and that's people are being raised
by shitheads,

2278
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
so they're imprinting,
they're copying the behavior of 

2279
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,430
failures.
Like Duncan said it.

2280
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:18,640
There's a deep rejection at the heart of
somebody like that.

2281
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,590
I'm reminded of some,
some people,

2282
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:25,540
some women I know who were sexually 
abused and then immediately put on a lot

2283
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:27,410
of weight right after,
right.

2284
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,900
Protection,
risk protection,

2285
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:32,620
and it's also remove me from that whole 
dynamic with men.

2286
01:46:32,621 --> 01:46:34,600
I got hurt in that.
Remove me from it.

2287
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:36,190
Make me unattractive to them.
Right.

2288
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:41,460
So the guy who was being a dick,
he's being a dick in a way because he 

2289
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:45,151
can't stand to be rejected by you.
So he has to be never accepted yet.

2290
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:46,930
Right.

2291
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:49,830
And just like negate the whole whole 
issue.

2292
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,930
It's no fun man.
When you start,

2293
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,650
when you compassion,
if you're,

2294
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:58,660
if you get a kick out of like rejecting 
people or if you get a kick out of like 

2295
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:01,990
creating a us and them paradigm,
it really is a uh,

2296
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:04,710
it's a problem because suddenly when you
like realize like,

2297
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:05,400
Shit,
man,

2298
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,830
this guy's just like me.
You know,

2299
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:09,780
he's,
if I had been in his situation,

2300
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:12,120
I might even been more of a dick then he
is,

2301
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:13,740
who knows,
you just don't know.

2302
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:16,590
And it's cooked into our society.
This is the thing.

2303
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:21,591
I mean,
I think you guys both probably agree 

2304
01:47:21,591 --> 01:47:24,141
with this.
I think that we live in a deeply 

2305
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:26,631
pathological society and a healthy 
person in the society is by definition 

2306
01:47:26,631 --> 01:47:27,790
going to seem really strange,
you know,

2307
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:30,870
because they're not,
they're not in sync with the society.

2308
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:33,270
Have you heard of the continuum concept 
now?

2309
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:34,150
It's,
um,

2310
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:39,220
it's a book written by a woman who found
herself pretty randomly living with more

2311
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:44,901
or less stone-age tribe in Venezuela and
she observed the way they raise children

2312
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:47,940
and she wrote this book and her and her 
thesis.

2313
01:47:47,941 --> 01:47:49,800
This was in the late sixties,
early seventies.

2314
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:53,460
The thesis is essentially when a baby's 
born in this society,

2315
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:58,850
that baby is in physical contact with 
his mother or another adult basically 

2316
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:03,021
constantly until he or she doesn't want 
to be anymore and is off running around 

2317
01:48:03,021 --> 01:48:03,240
with their friends,
right?

2318
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:05,610
There's.
Whereas in our society,

2319
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:10,700
up until the fifties,
doctors were telling parents not to 

2320
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,050
touch their infants,
put the infant in the crib.

2321
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:15,450
No matter how much it costs,
do not touch it.

2322
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:18,990
By caressing your child,
you create pathology.

2323
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:22,230
You create sickness and illness and 
weakness.

2324
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,860
This was until the 1950 right.

2325
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:31,250
Lots of lots of kids died.
It was called hospital ism because the 

2326
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:34,530
problem is you had on the one side of 
this sort of macho male asshole attitude

2327
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:38,550
dominating medicine,
no woman doctors and the nurses opinions

2328
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:43,551
didn't count for anything because the 
men knew best and on the other hand you 

2329
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:46,581
had the germ theory is I'm talking early
20th century now where it was,

2330
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,190
it was understood that contagion was a 
big problem.

2331
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:54,150
So they started putting newborn infants 
in these incubators,

2332
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:59,180
these isolation tanks and they weren't 
allowing the mothers to even pick them 

2333
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,230
up and touch them because they had no 
way of testing for germs.

2334
01:49:01,231 --> 01:49:02,220
They just knew,
you know,

2335
01:49:02,221 --> 01:49:07,221
germs were somewhere.
So all these kids are dying and the and 

2336
01:49:07,221 --> 01:49:11,061
the nurses are saying,
well of course you got to pick them up 

2337
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:11,061
there crying.
Look,

2338
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:12,210
you know the women are resonating and 
the doctors are saying no,

2339
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:13,080
you can't touch them.
No,

2340
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:13,410
no,
no,

2341
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,400
no touching,
no touching.

2342
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:19,620
And they were like 20,
25 percent death rate in the most modern

2343
01:49:19,621 --> 01:49:24,621
American hospitals that we're so weird.
It's really fucked up.

2344
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:31,230
And someone will be so confident to 
avoid the natural instincts.

2345
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:32,160
You can't.
Well,

2346
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:33,900
we override them all the time.
Right?

2347
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,340
A masturbation,
it'll kill you.

2348
01:49:35,341 --> 01:49:37,500
It'll make you blind.
It'll make you crazy.

2349
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,240
Well,
we will make.

2350
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,720
If you do it wrong,
you're coughing your eyes,

2351
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,800
your eyes,
and then into a tree

2352
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:54,740
which is right up there on sauna.
Tying yourself to death as far as stupid

2353
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:55,950
as.
Oh yeah.

2354
01:49:55,951 --> 01:49:58,060
That's texting while driving.
You go off a cliff.

2355
01:49:58,140 --> 01:49:59,290
Yeah.
There was a guy,

2356
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:04,291
I think it was like Paris Hilton's 
veterinary or a plastic surgeon or 

2357
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:05,080
something like that.
Like some famous plastic surgeon.

2358
01:50:05,081 --> 01:50:09,670
And he tweeted a second before he fell 
off the side of a fucking cliff.

2359
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:14,430
I really thing I just retweeted a thing 
a few days ago.

2360
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:19,580
Some some computer designer or somebody 
who was working in the office tweeted A.

2361
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,460
I've been on the job 30 hours feeling 
great.

2362
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:24,240
And then he died.

2363
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,060
Yes.
Like at his desk,

2364
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,700
wasn't it?
No.

2365
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:31,230
You're talking about a woman who went,
no,

2366
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:31,450
no,
no.

2367
01:50:31,451 --> 01:50:33,860
It's another one I think you're thinking
of going on right now.

2368
01:50:33,861 --> 01:50:35,630
She went to Africa.
She was a PR woman.

2369
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:36,670
Oh no,
that's.

2370
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:41,820
Yeah.
She just landed in and it got picked up 

2371
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:42,400
because she didn't know that the AIDS 
Joe.

2372
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,950
She goes well off to South Africa.
Hope I don't get aids.

2373
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:47,210
Just kidding.
I'm white.

2374
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:49,520
Right?
That's exactly what it was.

2375
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:53,290
Probably on Xanax.
It's probably had a glass of wine.

2376
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:57,410
Didn't know what the fuck she was doing.
Woke up to a national controversy.

2377
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:58,880
She had apologized.

2378
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:03,010
Father said he was ashamed over some guy
went to the airport to meet her and took

2379
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:06,190
some pictures and then interviewed her 
father while they were waiting I guess,

2380
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,710
and the father was like,
I can't believe she said that.

2381
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:11,380
He's South African.
Speaking of weird stuff.

2382
01:51:11,381 --> 01:51:13,920
What about the Steve Martin thing?
Do you hear about this?

2383
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:19,990
What he tweeted?
Somebody wrote like he was doing a back 

2384
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:23,701
and forth with some of his followers on 
twitter and somebody wrote a l like 

2385
01:51:23,701 --> 01:51:27,130
Lasagna,
l a s a n y a or something like that.

2386
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:30,070
Is that how you spell a Sanya and he 
wrote.

2387
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:31,840
Well,
it depends if you're going to an African

2388
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:33,850
American restaurant or an Italian 
restaurant

2389
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:39,960
and people got really offended by that.
He deleted the tweet and then when Cada 

2390
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,170
screenshot apologized and illegally.
Yeah.

2391
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,130
What is wrong with that?
That's not nothing.

2392
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,770
That's what I'm saying.
Like what's a

2393
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:51,970
have about saying there's a black 
American vernacular that sounds 

2394
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,550
different than you know,
like how is that insulting to anybody?

2395
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:58,710
Well,
I had this conversation with someone 

2396
01:51:58,710 --> 01:51:58,710
where I was talking about,
you know,

2397
01:51:58,710 --> 01:51:59,950
how you can listen to someone talk on 
the phone and know if they're black.

2398
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,540
And she was like,
no,

2399
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:02,230
no,
I don't know.

2400
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:03,190
I go,
bullshit.

2401
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:08,370
You do know I go,
it doesn't mean that there's anything 

2402
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:11,041
wrong with being black,
but you can tell when you're talking to 

2403
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:12,460
a lot of people on the phone,
you can tell if the guy's black.

2404
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:14,410
Well,
you then let me.

2405
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,940
I would argue that there are some people
who you can hear and know they're black.

2406
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:24,150
Very common,
but that doesn't mean that you can 

2407
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:26,911
listen to anyone and another black.
There are a lot of black people who 

2408
01:52:26,911 --> 01:52:26,911
would.
You wouldn't be able to tell.

2409
01:52:26,911 --> 01:52:28,480
Of course not.
I see a of white people that can say,

2410
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:29,600
well,
yeah,

2411
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:35,280
exactly,
but there is that quality that does 

2412
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:35,280
exists.
Of course there's nothing wrong with it.

2413
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:40,080
Like the idea that that was she was,
she was looking at it like she wouldn't 

2414
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,721
touch it with a 10 foot pole because it 
was politically incorrect and it was a 

2415
01:52:42,721 --> 01:52:42,721
dangerous thing to discuss.
I'm like,

2416
01:52:42,721 --> 01:52:47,280
why?
Why is it dangerous to say that black 

2417
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:47,360
people oftentimes have a different way 
of talking?

2418
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:48,590
It doesn't.
It's not.

2419
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:53,620
No one's saying bad or worse.
It's like saying that people that are 

2420
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:55,040
from the west coast,
they'll have a different way of talking.

2421
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:57,890
Then people that live in Minnesota or 
then people that live in New York,

2422
01:52:57,891 --> 01:52:59,720
of course they did dialect.
Of course they do.

2423
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:02,690
It's not bad or.
Or it isn't like super intelligent.

2424
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:06,080
People like fineman had a very 
pronounced New York accent.

2425
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:07,040
Right?
Didn't he?

2426
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,390
And he was Jewish.
Yeah.

2427
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:13,010
Pronounced Jewish New York accent and he
was one of the most brilliant physicists

2428
01:53:13,011 --> 01:53:13,570
ever.
Yeah,

2429
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,930
I mean it doesn't mean anything,

2430
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:18,650
but that's the thing in America now.
Anything around around sex,

2431
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:21,450
you and I talked about this last time or
or race is,

2432
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:24,760
is so explosive.
It here's a comedian,

2433
01:53:24,761 --> 01:53:25,750
Steve Martin,
come on.

2434
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:28,990
He's been in the trenches forever.
Why is he retracting that?

2435
01:53:28,991 --> 01:53:29,750
Why is he apollo

2436
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:35,930
going to die?
So that's my new song.

2437
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,480
While he's a good guy,
I mean that's really what it is.

2438
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:41,980
He's a nice guy.
He doesn't want anybody's feelings,

2439
01:53:41,981 --> 01:53:43,050
but yeah,
he was afraid of

2440
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:44,260
offend them,
but I mean,

2441
01:53:44,261 --> 01:53:46,240
when people are offended over you 
breathing,

2442
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:46,810
fuck them.

2443
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,910
You're right.
But he's not A.

2444
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:52,260
I don't think he's a confrontational guy
at all.

2445
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,380
He's an interesting cat.
You.

2446
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:59,220
Steve Martin is a fascinating dude 
because first of all he was unbelievably

2447
01:53:59,221 --> 01:54:03,150
hilarious and unbelievably innovative 
when he first came out.

2448
01:54:03,151 --> 01:54:06,570
I mean he was a unique cat.
This whole thing was very unique.

2449
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:08,640
It was.
His Act was very unique.

2450
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:11,280
It was really funny and silly and slap 
sticky,

2451
01:54:11,281 --> 01:54:14,440
but he's a unique guy in the fact that 
he got huge,

2452
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:19,441
really successful and then didn't like 
the fact that people would laugh about 

2453
01:54:19,441 --> 01:54:21,420
anything that he did and he didn't feel 
like you had this real honest connection

2454
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:23,850
with them anymore and like pulled away 
from comedy,

2455
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,070
couldn't,
couldn't do comedy in clumps anymore.

2456
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,490
Like the Beatles stopped touring because
nobody could.

2457
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,290
They're screaming so loud.
They couldn't hear the music.

2458
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:35,770
I went.
I went to this talk with Steve Martin 

2459
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:36,910
and Steve Martin was there with an 
author and [inaudible].

2460
01:54:36,911 --> 01:54:38,540
You were saying he's not 
confrontational.

2461
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:43,840
This was like six years ago.
He's there at Steve Martin's there with 

2462
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,051
this author.
It's clearly a big fan of this author 

2463
01:54:47,051 --> 01:54:49,040
and somebody in the audience.
The audience is getting to ask questions

2464
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:54,070
and some asshole says,
I have a question for the guy who isn't 

2465
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:56,870
Steve Martin and Steve Martin.
I can't remember exactly what he said to

2466
01:54:56,871 --> 01:55:00,500
this guy,
but it was a brutal evisceration of this

2467
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:05,501
guy for being a disrespectful asshole.
Like you saw the color just rush out of 

2468
01:55:05,501 --> 01:55:06,510
the guy's face.
I do,

2469
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:07,350
it was the,
uh,

2470
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:12,610
he's just being rude.
It's just by saying the guy who's not 

2471
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:12,610
like,
you're not dot Martin,

2472
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:13,380
we don't care who you are.
Yeah.

2473
01:55:13,381 --> 01:55:15,050
It was just rude.
It was just like you didn't need to.

2474
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,610
He did it to defend his friend.
Yeah.

2475
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:21,611
And it was brutal.
And then you still see that guy still a 

2476
01:55:21,611 --> 01:55:21,611
comic man because it was like,
you know,

2477
01:55:21,611 --> 01:55:23,690
like he hasn't stopped being a comic.
You just,

2478
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:28,850
that thing,
that edge that's inside comics that'll 

2479
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:29,570
come out is definitely inside of him.
He's a brilliant guy.

2480
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,280
You read his autobiography?
Yeah.

2481
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:32,560
Yeah.
It's really good.

2482
01:55:32,561 --> 01:55:34,350
He's an interesting dude.
He breeds it on.

2483
01:55:34,351 --> 01:55:36,670
If you go to audible.com,
you can get it.

2484
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:38,850
He actually reads it.
He's a,

2485
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:42,640
he's a brilliant guy and a great movie 
comedian.

2486
01:55:42,641 --> 01:55:44,070
I mean,
you back to the jerk.

2487
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,040
That is a masterpiece.
It's still holds up.

2488
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:51,330
I was born a poor black child.
He's not apologizing for that.

2489
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,890
There is something that while he was a 
young man,

2490
01:55:52,891 --> 01:55:55,210
then it's different.
I'm sure now he's just like,

2491
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:58,980
he sounds like a great books of short 
comedy essays that are hilarious.

2492
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,480
Yeah.
He's a unique talent.

2493
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,830
Steve.
Mine's a very unique town,

2494
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:06,860
although I never bought him as a mob guy
that the one we played an Italian guy 

2495
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:07,620
and they've given the crazy hair.
Remember that?

2496
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,380
I don't remember that.
Like a mob guy in the witness protection

2497
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:15,220
program and moves into this straight or 
comedy comedy comedy.

2498
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:20,221
I mean,
when was the last time we did street 

2499
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:21,651
movie?
Just does it do a lot of great movies 

2500
01:56:21,651 --> 01:56:21,651
now?
He did,

2501
01:56:21,651 --> 01:56:21,651
yeah,
he did.

2502
01:56:21,651 --> 01:56:22,770
Didn't he do like he did?
Is He.

2503
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:27,771
He's done some serious.
Was he like in a woody allen movie 

2504
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:27,771
playing a straight character?

2505
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:28,500
That's always.
When I stand up.

2506
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:31,430
Comedian branches spread their wings.
They do a woody allen movie.

2507
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,370
Well,
like Louis C,

2508
01:56:32,371 --> 01:56:34,290
k just did one.
Clay.

2509
01:56:34,350 --> 01:56:39,350
Andrew dice clay was in the same thing.
It was an article online about Andrew 

2510
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:39,350
Dice,
clay deserving.

2511
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:41,970
Then Oscar for that role.
It was really good.

2512
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:44,580
I just saw that on the plane.
I liked it,

2513
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,440
but I didn't see a lot of drama there.
I mean,

2514
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:52,350
he wasn't playing an autistic person or 
I just thought it was very authentic.

2515
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:55,430
I thought it was a really worked,
you know,

2516
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,850
he's a good actor.
It's,

2517
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:59,310
and it's surprising.
And Woody Allen,

2518
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,930
you know,
recognize that.

2519
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:06,320
Hey,
have you seen that preview for that 

2520
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:06,320
Werewolf movie coming out?
Of course.

2521
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:06,320
I'm sure you have.
Yes.

2522
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:06,390
Yeah.
What do you think?

2523
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:11,640
It's one movie Dunkin.
It's an American Werewolf in London.

2524
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,100
It's a God damn perfect movie of 
preaching to the choir.

2525
01:57:14,101 --> 01:57:19,101
Everything since then sucks the fat that
the one where he takes acid and turns 

2526
01:57:19,101 --> 01:57:23,391
into a werewolf,
which I resented that as an acid had at 

2527
01:57:23,391 --> 01:57:24,900
the time.
The preview or William hurt?

2528
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,200
No,
no.

2529
01:57:25,201 --> 01:57:26,760
I'm talking about American Werewolf in 
London.

2530
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:28,020
Oh no,
he got chomped.

2531
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:30,740
You know,
you're thinking of alternate.

2532
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:32,220
Oh,
that's right.

2533
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:38,840
That premise up so bad monkey turned 
into some sort of monkey from taking 

2534
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:39,930
acid.
Well,

2535
01:57:39,931 --> 01:57:43,350
he got into the sensory deprivation tank
that was based on living.

2536
01:57:43,351 --> 01:57:45,290
That's right.
That's the whole idea.

2537
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:47,700
Yeah,
it's terrible.

2538
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:52,790
Yeah.
I thought it was great at the time and 

2539
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:52,790
it was important to me because it got me
into isolation tanks,

2540
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:54,570
but it's terrible if you try to watch it
now,

2541
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,210
but the best part is the schizophrenia 
on acid saying,

2542
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,760
I feel like my heart is being touched by
Christ.

2543
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:02,910
Remember,
that was a great line in that movie.

2544
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,500
I can't.
I'm looking for new wedges.

2545
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:06,990
Saw the river's edge.
Have you seen that?

2546
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:07,920
What's that?
Quintin.

2547
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,550
Crispin Glover University.
I saw it a long time ago.

2548
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:14,880
It's a really strange movie.
That guy's too much for.

2549
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:17,250
Very funny.
He's like Dunkin.

2550
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:22,430
If he went completely off the ipad and 
became a meth head and I need to start 

2551
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,590
doing math.
I fucking love.

2552
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:25,110
Christmas.
Can be so crazy.

2553
01:58:25,111 --> 01:58:27,750
Like in his movies.
He's so good at what he does.

2554
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,040
You know?
Who else is really good?

2555
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:31,680
I can't remember the cat's name.
Why everyone's a cat today.

2556
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,330
I can't remember the guy's name,
but he was,

2557
01:58:33,331 --> 01:58:35,550
uh,
one of the bad guys and the x files.

2558
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:39,750
He's at one weird dude that you'd never 
know his name.

2559
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:41,360
But when he's in a,
on a movie like,

2560
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:41,990
Oh,
this guy's

2561
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,230
awesome.
He.

2562
01:58:43,231 --> 01:58:43,880
Yeah,
there,

2563
01:58:43,881 --> 01:58:46,690
there are several people like that.
Who is that old dude?

2564
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:52,080
Creepy old dude.
I don't know what this werewolf movie 

2565
01:58:52,771 --> 01:58:53,110
is,
man.

2566
01:58:53,111 --> 01:58:54,100
I can't find any,
uh,

2567
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:59,430
things online.
Have you seen the trailer for 

2568
01:58:59,430 --> 01:58:59,430
transcendence?
Yeah,

2569
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:00,370
the trailer for transcendence looks 
really interesting.

2570
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:03,970
Have you seen the japs?
Well,

2571
01:59:03,971 --> 01:59:08,971
it's essentially the idea of the full 
ray Kurzweil vision being realized with 

2572
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:14,941
one guy being Johnny Depp playing the 
Kurzweil character gets killed by 

2573
01:59:14,941 --> 01:59:15,700
somebody.
But as he's dying,

2574
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:17,980
they download his consciousness into a 
computer.

2575
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,050
You got to play it.
That's pretty good.

2576
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:25,970
She,
Jesus Christ requires us to one of the 

2577
01:59:26,131 --> 01:59:28,350
most fundamental secrets of the 
universe.

2578
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:37,580
Imagine that machine with a full range 
of human emotions intense will be 

2579
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:44,231
greater than the collective intelligence
of every person in the history of the 

2580
01:59:45,921 --> 01:59:50,921
world.
Some scientists refer to this as the 

2581
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:54,311
singularity.
I call it transcendence series of 

2582
01:59:58,141 --> 02:00:03,141
attacks conducted by radical anti-tech 
group known as rift labs all over the 

2583
02:00:03,601 --> 02:00:08,601
country.
We lost decades of research and 

2584
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:08,601
development.
It's radiation poisoning.

2585
02:00:08,601 --> 02:00:12,840
The bullet must've been laced with it.
The effect is the reversible will's body

2586
02:00:12,841 --> 02:00:17,841
is dying,
but his mind is a pattern of electrical 

2587
02:00:17,841 --> 02:00:18,240
signals.
We can upload his consciousness.

2588
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:23,220
We can save him.
Assuming that this works,

2589
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:26,850
if we missed anything,
thought childhood memory.

2590
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:28,770
How well do you know who you're dealing 
with?

2591
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:39,030
Well,
my God,

2592
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:39,690
I can't.

2593
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:45,710
I'm here.
Need to get me online.

2594
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:50,880
I need more power,
maybe intelligent bait and be sent to 

2595
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:50,880
you.
Shove it down.

2596
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:56,120
Your friends crossed a line out the 
danger.

2597
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:04,270
So how do we fight it?
Evolve?

2598
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,600
Where's the machine?

2599
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,580
Where are you going?

2600
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:33,890
Wow.

2601
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:40,300
That they could fuck that up.
That could be one of those movies where 

2602
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:40,300
like,
oh,

2603
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:40,340
okay,
fuck head.

2604
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,670
It already looks fucked up man.
Am I wrong?

2605
02:01:42,671 --> 02:01:44,830
Or does it seem like they told the whole
story in the.

2606
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:47,850
That's what they do now.
We just did this.

2607
02:01:47,851 --> 02:01:50,560
The spoiler alert.
Just show me Jennifer Lawrence.

2608
02:01:50,561 --> 02:01:53,080
I just want to watch her.
She's so pretty.

2609
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:57,190
She listens to your pocket.
Hope she does the American hustle movie.

2610
02:01:57,250 --> 02:02:01,120
She looks fantastic in that movie.
You're reaching out to Jennifer Lawrence

2611
02:02:01,121 --> 02:02:06,121
through Joe Rogan's podcast work.
I feel it happening now.

2612
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,970
I think she should call me to set up the
date though.

2613
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:14,260
Whatever it takes.
I'm sure she's a fan of your work.

2614
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:20,500
Yeah.
Well that'll be an interesting pairing 

2615
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:20,500
with her mom.
You know this.

2616
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,000
Do you know what I'm talking about her 
the movie,

2617
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:24,970
the new movie about the guy falls in 
love with the computer program.

2618
02:02:24,971 --> 02:02:25,500
Yeah,
yeah,

2619
02:02:25,501 --> 02:02:26,200
yeah.
Yeah.

2620
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:31,060
Which Duncan is living even as we speak.
Duncan is entering the oculus rift,

2621
02:02:31,061 --> 02:02:32,200
looking for a girlfriend.

2622
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:33,820
Right?
Is that what you're doing in there?

2623
02:02:34,630 --> 02:02:36,610
Put that thing on for two minutes.
I want to vomit.

2624
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:43,080
Nausea,
all my utopian ideas about the 

2625
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:45,001
occupants.
Really steroid corrected that they say 

2626
02:02:45,001 --> 02:02:45,040
the new ones.
There's this,

2627
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:47,050
there's this thing.
It's like latency.

2628
02:02:47,051 --> 02:02:52,051
If there's 15 millisecond latency or 
some kind of latency between when you 

2629
02:02:52,051 --> 02:02:56,101
move your head and when it registers 
that you've moved your head and it's in 

2630
02:02:56,101 --> 02:02:59,401
milliseconds and under a certain amount.
Apparently you don't get motion 

2631
02:02:59,401 --> 02:03:03,091
sickness,
but where my oculus rift is that right 

2632
02:03:03,091 --> 02:03:06,391
now,
like if I have a drunk friend over and 

2633
02:03:06,391 --> 02:03:06,391
they put on that rift,
they just turned green.

2634
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,800
It doesn't work,
so.

2635
02:03:08,830 --> 02:03:11,890
So police could use it as a.
As an alcohol test.

2636
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:14,170
Yeah.
You x could use it if you.

2637
02:03:14,171 --> 02:03:15,990
If you're sick of using your finger to 
vomit,

2638
02:03:16,050 --> 02:03:20,110
just put on the oculus rift and run 
around half life for six minutes.

2639
02:03:20,111 --> 02:03:21,820
You spew dementia

2640
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:26,030
in films is reproducing American 
Werewolf in London.

2641
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:28,460
They're going to reboot.
It has the same story.

2642
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,510
I hope it's good,
man.

2643
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,580
I hope so.
To leave it alone.

2644
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:36,820
Well,
I just hope they don't go CGI and fuck 

2645
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:36,820
it up.
They will.

2646
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:36,820
When?
When?

2647
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:38,870
When did we make that work?
I'm sure there's some,

2648
02:03:38,871 --> 02:03:43,871
but it's possible.
That worked with amazing of the body 

2649
02:03:43,871 --> 02:03:46,601
snatchers.
I remember when they remade Texas 

2650
02:03:46,601 --> 02:03:46,601
chainsaw massacre.
I didn't want me to call the police.

2651
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:52,310
I watched the second invasion of the 
body snatchers last night.

2652
02:03:52,311 --> 02:03:55,310
That Donald Sutherland one.
That's the second one I believe.

2653
02:03:55,330 --> 02:03:56,320
Yeah,
that's good.

2654
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:57,980
There's one from.
Is that true?

2655
02:03:58,010 --> 02:04:03,010
Am I correct?
A black and white was an old black and 

2656
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:03,010
white one.
That's right.

2657
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:06,581
You know,
I know it's true because I watched it 

2658
02:04:06,581 --> 02:04:06,581
actually and it was really fun.
Now that I remember.

2659
02:04:06,581 --> 02:04:06,860
Okay.
Because I've seen three of them.

2660
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:09,080
There's a Jennifer Tilly won two are meg
tilly,

2661
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:11,450
tilly one later.
But the uh,

2662
02:04:11,451 --> 02:04:16,451
the original one is really fascinating 
because it's like a lot like the 

2663
02:04:16,451 --> 02:04:19,850
twilight zone movie in that it's a time 
capsule you would not work today.

2664
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:24,880
It would be a terrible piece of shit 
that you wouldn't believe that they 

2665
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:27,521
could actually make.
But when you watch it in the context of 

2666
02:04:27,521 --> 02:04:28,100
it being from like 1951 or whatever the 
fuck it was,

2667
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:29,870
it's really interesting.
Oh,

2668
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:30,320
cool.

2669
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:31,610
And ideas.
I mean,

2670
02:04:31,611 --> 02:04:35,300
even if the effects are bullshit,
the ideas are timeless,

2671
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:38,280
like old star trek episodes or,
or twilight

2672
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,170
zone.
Some of those ideas were just amazing.

2673
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,090
Yeah.
Well they ran out of them though.

2674
02:04:42,091 --> 02:04:44,400
They used them all up on those fucking,
you know,

2675
02:04:44,401 --> 02:04:46,910
all those,
a hitchcock shows and all those,

2676
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:48,250
uh,
those.

2677
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:54,100
What are those?
What was that one show that they had 

2678
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:54,100
that um,

2679
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:54,610
fuck night gallery?

2680
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:56,860
Well,
no,

2681
02:04:56,861 --> 02:04:58,010
there was,
there was a,

2682
02:04:58,011 --> 02:05:00,430
the twilight zone and then there was one
that was like,

2683
02:05:00,431 --> 02:05:02,450
it.
God Damn it.

2684
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:03,850
There was another one that was like,
it

2685
02:05:04,030 --> 02:05:06,550
love American style.
The love boat.

2686
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Now.
There was a similar thing to the 

2687
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:12,000
twilight zone,
but I can't remember what it is now.

2688
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:15,520
I thought it was called night gallery.
Might have tales from the crypt.

2689
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:16,120
The outer limits.

2690
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:17,440
The outer limits.
Thank you.

2691
02:05:17,530 --> 02:05:18,520
Thank you Jamie.
Yeah,

2692
02:05:18,521 --> 02:05:20,620
that was it.
The outer limits was another one.

2693
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:22,360
It was very similar along those lines.
They,

2694
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:24,640
those guys burned through so many ideas.

2695
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:26,220
Yeah.
Are there shows like,

2696
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:30,270
is there a show like of ideas there?
There's no more creepy freaky ideas.

2697
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,760
There's all kinds of freaky ideas,
man.

2698
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:38,030
I think they get tired.
All this vampire shit and we're wolves 

2699
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:42,230
and zombies and vampires for girls to 
have.

2700
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:43,380
You know,
it's all about sex.

2701
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,140
Empires got so hot.
They weren't always like that.

2702
02:05:46,141 --> 02:05:48,010
Lookup nosferatu.
Have you ever seen that?

2703
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:50,280
[inaudible] love it.
That is a vampire.

2704
02:05:50,281 --> 02:05:53,460
That thing is scary.
It's got like long,

2705
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:57,840
awful fingers that just just,
it's a terrible being now.

2706
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:01,290
Like these glitter vampires,
the sun doesn't even hurt him.

2707
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:03,200
It just makes him like makes their.
Yeah,

2708
02:06:03,201 --> 02:06:04,140
there's not for auto

2709
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:05,740
and by the way,
I look at his teeth.

2710
02:06:05,741 --> 02:06:07,870
Very rat.
Like a completely different thing.

2711
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:13,350
Yeah.
He was there with like rats that were 

2712
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:13,350
people that would hypnotize people and 
suck their blood out.

2713
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:18,580
Ever since you told me,
you pointed out the fact that in 

2714
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:19,960
twilight this vampire is hundreds of 
years old dating a high school.

2715
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:22,150
Yes.
It's ridiculous.

2716
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:27,180
The idea is ridiculous that he would 
first of all have to keep going to high 

2717
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:27,940
school.
The idea is that he died when he was 17.

2718
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,580
He so cute because he died when he was 
17.

2719
02:06:30,581 --> 02:06:34,600
He's going to be 17 for perpetuity.
That's preposterous.

2720
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:36,400
That doesn't make any sense.
Like why?

2721
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:39,760
Why doesn't he just go to fucking high 
school for the 100th year in a row?

2722
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:45,450
Just keeps giving high school.
Nobody notices the fact that this guy 

2723
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:46,720
just fucking hopping around the country,
going to high school after high school,

2724
02:06:46,721 --> 02:06:48,150
showing in as the weird loner

2725
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:50,030
that white skin.
But that does happen,

2726
02:06:50,031 --> 02:06:50,570
man.
There's that.

2727
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:53,450
You heard the story about the guy who 
would pose as a fourth grader.

2728
02:06:53,451 --> 02:06:54,890
Did you ever hear that?
Oh my God,

2729
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:59,920
he's like some kind of like a little 
person or he's got some kind of aging 

2730
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:00,620
thing and you would enroll himself in 
elementary schools.

2731
02:07:00,621 --> 02:07:03,890
Like there was this guy,
he was an adult who was in an elementary

2732
02:07:03,891 --> 02:07:06,820
school for like a year.
It's like mine.

2733
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:08,660
Yeah.
I can't remember his name though,

2734
02:07:08,661 --> 02:07:12,170
but it was like he was,
he would just pretend to be a kid,

2735
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,270
you know?
And so as an adult,

2736
02:07:14,271 --> 02:07:14,700
it's funny.

2737
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:19,950
Uh,
well when I was in New York there was a 

2738
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:20,370
girl who was on the Arsenio Hall show.
Okay.

2739
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:25,390
She was a stand up comic and we all knew
her as this young teenage girl from the 

2740
02:07:25,541 --> 02:07:29,740
East village and she was like 14 or 15 
years old and she was going up and doing

2741
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:32,170
standup and she was funny,
man.

2742
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:35,080
She was funny,
like an adult and it was weird.

2743
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:39,610
It was weird watching because as far as 
standup comics go,

2744
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:44,670
it wasn't like going to see Dunkin or 
Joey Diaz or he wasn't like high level 

2745
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:47,440
standup comedy,
but it was impressive for a 15 year old.

2746
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:52,640
So she goes on the Arsenio Hall show and
the fucking had phones light up and 

2747
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,250
they're like,
I went to high school with this bitch.

2748
02:07:54,251 --> 02:07:56,990
She's fucking 30 like she's not in 
heights.

2749
02:07:57,290 --> 02:08:02,290
She's not 14 the fuck out of.
She graduated in 1986 and people start 

2750
02:08:02,531 --> 02:08:07,531
going crazy and calling in and she gets,
she gets exposed.

2751
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:10,570
Barry Katz client,
by the way,

2752
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:13,080
when she knew she'd get exposed.
Um,

2753
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:14,890
I don't think she did.
I don't think she did.

2754
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:17,030
I think she thought she'd get away with 
it on TV.

2755
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:19,270
I don't know if she changed her name.
I don't know what she did,

2756
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,720
but she went up there.

2757
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:22,840
Don't worry though.
I mean,

2758
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:24,020
what a movie,
you know,

2759
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:26,890
like 30 [inaudible].
She had a 15 year old kid.

2760
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,820
I didn't.
Shit like,

2761
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,880
that's going to start happening more and
more with the age regression therapies.

2762
02:08:30,881 --> 02:08:32,950
They're going to have,
I think there's going to be like this.

2763
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:38,100
Did you hear about that?
The thing that keeps popping up about 

2764
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:38,100
the mice,
did you hear about this?

2765
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,010
And they're going to start human trials 
in a year.

2766
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,130
It's some kind of.
They figured out some way to reverse.

2767
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,650
Apparently reverse the aging process in 
mice.

2768
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:46,780
They want to start human trials in a 
year.

2769
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:49,030
I love being around and scientists 
because his both.

2770
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:53,460
I know your bullshit fake,
but yeah,

2771
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:54,340
apparently.
I mean,

2772
02:08:54,341 --> 02:08:55,780
who knows really?
Yeah.

2773
02:08:55,781 --> 02:08:58,240
Where did you read this?
On the Internet?

2774
02:08:58,660 --> 02:08:59,800
No,
I think it's real.

2775
02:08:59,801 --> 02:09:01,470
I do think it's real,
like it's an actual.

2776
02:09:01,471 --> 02:09:02,870
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry,

2777
02:09:02,871 --> 02:09:04,570
but every time I hear this shit,
you know,

2778
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:07,670
ray Kurtzweil is going to die.
I'm really sorry.

2779
02:09:07,671 --> 02:09:10,090
And not because some guy shoots him with
a radioactive bullets,

2780
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,970
researchers reverse aging process in 
mice.

2781
02:09:12,971 --> 02:09:15,850
People could be next.
This is in the Huffington Post.

2782
02:09:15,851 --> 02:09:17,890
This is in a bunch of science science 
journals.

2783
02:09:18,190 --> 02:09:23,190
It's all over.
It's about the Mitochondria and it's 

2784
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:23,190
about,
um,

2785
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:25,630
uh,
they've figured out a way.

2786
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:31,030
It says,
the age process we discovered is like a 

2787
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,360
married couple when they're young,
they communicate well,

2788
02:09:31,361 --> 02:09:33,850
but over time,
living in close quarters for many years,

2789
02:09:33,851 --> 02:09:37,090
communication breaks down.
Harvard University based investigator,

2790
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:39,640
this is all like legit shit.
As with marriage,

2791
02:09:39,641 --> 02:09:44,641
the restoring of the lines of 
communication can nurse backs cells to 

2792
02:09:44,641 --> 02:09:45,580
health.
The communication breakdown is caused by

2793
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:48,490
lower levels of the chemical called n a 
d,

2794
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:51,010
which decreases with age.
Prior to this study,

2795
02:09:51,011 --> 02:09:56,011
the only known ways of slowing the 
decreased were to have a low calorie 

2796
02:09:56,011 --> 02:09:58,150
diet and regular exercise.
In this study,

2797
02:09:58,151 --> 02:10:03,151
researchers used to compound that mimics
the benefits of diet and exercise on 

2798
02:10:03,151 --> 02:10:03,151
mice.
There you go.

2799
02:10:03,151 --> 02:10:03,770
Fell off.
Give me a pill.

2800
02:10:03,771 --> 02:10:06,010
I'll take it.
In two year old mice,

2801
02:10:06,011 --> 02:10:09,970
the compound helped reduce insulin 
resistance and inflammation,

2802
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:13,780
making them nearly as healthy as mice 
that were just six months old.

2803
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:17,170
It's something like a 60 year old being 
similar to a 20 year old

2804
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:22,980
20 year olds.
You're about to be fucked because all 

2805
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:23,890
these 50 year olds are going to turn 
into 20 year olds.

2806
02:10:23,891 --> 02:10:26,350
Again,
you have a mattress on a floor.

2807
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:31,120
You know what I mean?
You're sleeping on a mattress,

2808
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:34,130
you're a d,
you're now competing with people

2809
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,110
who should be dead and her health

2810
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:39,070
and why does it have to be competition 
and can we all just get along?

2811
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:40,310
Can't we all just work together?
I can't.

2812
02:10:40,311 --> 02:10:42,760
This be the ultimate social utopia when 
there is no age,

2813
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:45,020
you got to be ageism anymore.
It'd be yourself.

2814
02:10:45,021 --> 02:10:46,250
Right?
Because think about it.

2815
02:10:46,251 --> 02:10:50,540
The 50 year old women are going to be 
like 20 year olds deck.

2816
02:10:50,630 --> 02:10:53,540
It's going to be in the game and they're
gonna have,

2817
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:58,930
they're gonna have all the experience of
having had kids and having live Loris 

2818
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:00,960
and they're not going to man.
Yeah.

2819
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:04,240
Well no,
but money and I find women,

2820
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:09,650
you know,
45 and over are a lot easier to deal 

2821
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:13,271
with a lot easier.
Do you think they're just more 

2822
02:11:13,271 --> 02:11:13,271
realistic?
More relaxed?

2823
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:16,340
Yeah.
They're not like living in that hallmark

2824
02:11:16,341 --> 02:11:20,090
bullshit world anymore of expected 
standards that you're trying to say.

2825
02:11:20,091 --> 02:11:22,660
Chris Ryan there,
they've got experience.

2826
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:25,140
They lower their standards,
their,

2827
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,600
they don't expect a lot from you.

2828
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,250
They're not looking for six pack 
anymore.

2829
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:29,230
They just,
okay,

2830
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:30,710
we just sit down.
Can we just watch TV?

2831
02:11:32,970 --> 02:11:35,160
We just have a dream.
We'd have to walk.

2832
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:39,720
I look forward to the future,
man.

2833
02:11:39,721 --> 02:11:44,070
I that I comments saw exciting to see 
that kind of research star start popping

2834
02:11:44,071 --> 02:11:46,000
up because if that's popping up that you
know,

2835
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:49,720
six more things based on it that are 
going to pop up and,

2836
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:51,560
and it's,
it's a really cool thing.

2837
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:53,510
They did say that.
Sorry,

2838
02:11:53,511 --> 02:11:56,390
go ahead.
They said that the cost of the treatment

2839
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:58,460
course is,
would be insane,

2840
02:11:58,510 --> 02:12:02,510
like hundreds of thousands of dollars as
was when you bought a cell phone,

2841
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:05,720
the first cell phone for thousands of 
dollars and now you can go to Bolivia.

2842
02:12:05,721 --> 02:12:07,280
In the middle of the jungle,
people have cell phones.

2843
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:12,580
There's also this artificial muscle that
they've created that has 1000 times 

2844
02:12:12,951 --> 02:12:17,951
human strength.
This is another story that came out 

2845
02:12:17,951 --> 02:12:17,951
today or yesterday.
Rather.

2846
02:12:17,951 --> 02:12:22,451
American scientists have developed a 
robotic muscle 1000 times more powerful 

2847
02:12:22,451 --> 02:12:26,351
than humans using a revolution.
It using a revolutionary material that 

2848
02:12:26,351 --> 02:12:29,750
fluidly cer changes its properties.
I want to.

2849
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:34,810
That means the invention gives vanadium 
dioxide amazing superhero style powers.

2850
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:38,960
It's most striking properties to change 
shape,

2851
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:42,350
shape,
and structure whenever differing amounts

2852
02:12:42,351 --> 02:12:46,760
of heat or applied to it.
We are in for some really freaky shit in

2853
02:12:46,761 --> 02:12:49,460
the next couple of decades.
Things are going to get really,

2854
02:12:49,461 --> 02:12:52,510
really weird because no one saw this 
coming years.

2855
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:57,230
Things always getting really weird.
Always have been the weirdest times ever

2856
02:12:57,410 --> 02:12:58,400
are always right now.

2857
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:01,450
Yeah.
I mean I feel like a curmudgeon,

2858
02:13:01,451 --> 02:13:04,000
but.
But you guys talking about reversing the

2859
02:13:04,001 --> 02:13:06,430
aging process and the super muscle and 
you know,

2860
02:13:06,431 --> 02:13:09,220
this and that.
I feel like Mark Twain,

2861
02:13:09,221 --> 02:13:14,221
you know,
when they invented the radio and he's 

2862
02:13:14,221 --> 02:13:14,221
like,
oh great,

2863
02:13:14,221 --> 02:13:14,221
we still don't have anything to say to 
each other.

2864
02:13:14,221 --> 02:13:14,221
You know?
It's like,

2865
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:16,810
do we not know?
I mean,

2866
02:13:16,811 --> 02:13:18,670
I'm talking about in his time.
The point is,

2867
02:13:18,671 --> 02:13:20,550
sounds like you had a hangover when he 
said Mark Twain,

2868
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:24,190
I feel like we're going in the wrong 
direction.

2869
02:13:24,191 --> 02:13:27,700
And so every time there's another carrot
dangling out there saying,

2870
02:13:27,701 --> 02:13:29,590
oh look,
you're eternal life.

2871
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:30,700
Oh look,
there's this all.

2872
02:13:30,701 --> 02:13:32,640
You're going to a super hero.
It's,

2873
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:36,570
it's like the casino guy.
We're almost out of money in the casinos

2874
02:13:36,571 --> 02:13:41,571
guys saying,
well maybe if you just place a few more 

2875
02:13:41,571 --> 02:13:41,571
beds,
you know,

2876
02:13:41,571 --> 02:13:41,571
you'll win it all back.
But again,

2877
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:45,680
it hasn't always been the case though.
Everybody always thought that the.

2878
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:48,210
You ever listened to a hunter s Thompson
talking in the 19 seventies.

2879
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,080
This is,
it's over.

2880
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:51,330
It's almost over.
The fucking great demise were,

2881
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:53,280
were,
were skidding into the,

2882
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:56,820
to the apocalypse.
Everybody's felt that way was right.

2883
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:59,480
But he was he still here?
Look what are we?

2884
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:01,170
We're here.
He's not shit's well,

2885
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:04,350
he shot himself in the head,
but shit shit is always weird

2886
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:05,560
by the way.
Cut It.

2887
02:14:05,561 --> 02:14:10,561
Three years from now,
Chris Ryan's going to be 21 and I'll 

2888
02:14:10,561 --> 02:14:14,060
shoot myself in the head and you're 
going to be healthy every day.

2889
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:16,720
Finally banging it.
Twenty year old.

2890
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:21,730
Yeah.
You give up on those 45 year olds and a 

2891
02:14:21,730 --> 02:14:21,730
fucking so needy cats.
Yeah.

2892
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:23,510
Yeah.
I,

2893
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:29,130
I don't know man.
I mean you can like philosophically 

2894
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:31,631
break it down as much as possible.
If it's going to give me a pill that's 

2895
02:14:31,631 --> 02:14:31,631
going to or not,
that's the thing.

2896
02:14:31,631 --> 02:14:34,280
They're just going to tell you they will
to keep you in the game,

2897
02:14:34,281 --> 02:14:36,440
keep you running.
What are you talking about?

2898
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,430
Well,
what about.

2899
02:14:37,580 --> 02:14:40,280
I mean,
I mean you said like everything's always

2900
02:14:40,281 --> 02:14:41,540
about to end,
right,

2901
02:14:41,541 --> 02:14:45,290
but on the alternatively everything's 
always about to be great.

2902
02:14:45,291 --> 02:14:50,291
I mean,
in the thirties and forties they were 

2903
02:14:50,291 --> 02:14:50,291
saying,
oh,

2904
02:14:50,291 --> 02:14:50,390
what are we gonna do with all our 
leisure time?

2905
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:55,390
The technology is going to give us.
We're going to be working three hours a 

2906
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:57,320
week and have jet packs and you know,
have her food grow out of the table just

2907
02:14:57,321 --> 02:15:00,230
as we're ready to eat it.
None of that shit ever happens.

2908
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:05,260
It never happens.
We're working more hours now than we 

2909
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:05,260
were then.
Those standard of living,

2910
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:06,080
you know,
we're talking about hunter s Thompson in

2911
02:15:06,081 --> 02:15:11,081
the seventies.
The middle class family now has less 

2912
02:15:11,081 --> 02:15:11,620
money than they had in 1970.
Right?

2913
02:15:11,630 --> 02:15:15,110
At least they're not dying of 
tuberculosis of a,

2914
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:20,120
you know,
insulin resistance and that over 

2915
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:21,620
coughing,
like spraying blood into my kerchief and

2916
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:26,621
watching everyone around me wigs are 
coming.

2917
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,830
You're really making a big,
big,

2918
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:33,160
big leap because I don't think it's that
black and white.

2919
02:15:33,161 --> 02:15:35,620
I don't.
I don't think that it really is worse.

2920
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:38,380
I don't think that.
I think it's gotten way better.

2921
02:15:38,381 --> 02:15:39,760
I think for sure.
Yeah.

2922
02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:42,280
Quality of life is still.
There's just too many people,

2923
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:47,570
a finite amount of resources,
corrupt economy beyond corrupt 

2924
02:15:47,570 --> 02:15:48,970
government.
All those excel good games for x,

2925
02:15:48,971 --> 02:15:50,710
but what about all this stuff that we 
said earlier?

2926
02:15:50,711 --> 02:15:52,510
What about all this stuff we said about 
communication,

2927
02:15:52,511 --> 02:15:55,480
about the access to information being 
different than it's ever been before.

2928
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:58,540
I think if anything,
it's more rosy today.

2929
02:15:58,730 --> 02:16:02,740
The view of society and the potential 
for the future more rosy today than it's

2930
02:16:02,741 --> 02:16:05,850
ever been before.
The Syria thing is a perfect example.

2931
02:16:06,310 --> 02:16:08,530
This is the first time in my 
recollection,

2932
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:11,470
my recollection that the United States 
people,

2933
02:16:11,471 --> 02:16:16,471
the populace stood up when there was a 
proposed military action and said fuck 

2934
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:20,911
that,
like a giant percentage of the 

2935
02:16:20,911 --> 02:16:21,760
population was so alarmed that these 
knuckleheads we were in,

2936
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:22,780
they were like,
hey guys,

2937
02:16:22,781 --> 02:16:26,530
this is revolution type shit.
Like if you go through with this,

2938
02:16:26,531 --> 02:16:28,960
this is your.
At the door of a revolution,

2939
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:30,010
and here's the best

2940
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,690
way to keep this revolution from 
happening.

2941
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:35,590
Keep them calm and the best way to keep 
them comms and not go into another world

2942
02:16:35,591 --> 02:16:40,591
right now.
You guys are running to shell games 

2943
02:16:40,591 --> 02:16:42,271
right now.
You're sucking minerals out of 

2944
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:42,271
Afghanistan.
You sucking oil out of Iraq.

2945
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:44,290
How would everybody just back the fuck 
off and stop trying to invade everything

2946
02:16:44,291 --> 02:16:49,030
all at once and they did and that was a 
sign of progress.

2947
02:16:49,031 --> 02:16:52,210
I see that as a sign of like so much 
blood has already been lost.

2948
02:16:52,211 --> 02:16:56,050
The body can't bleed anymore.
And once a half full guy exhaustion,

2949
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:59,920
the country's exhausted,
broke and people are saying,

2950
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:01,900
you know,
we can't do anymore.

2951
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:04,420
We get the national guard doing seven 
tours in Iraq.

2952
02:17:04,421 --> 02:17:09,421
You know,
the national guard never went anywhere 

2953
02:17:09,421 --> 02:17:09,850
overseas until Bush and now we've 
accepted that as normal.

2954
02:17:09,851 --> 02:17:14,851
We've got higher percentage of people in
prisons than any country in the world 

2955
02:17:14,851 --> 02:17:15,220
than this country ever has before.

2956
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:15,890
Doubt,
you know,

2957
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:20,900
it's like I,
I think going back to my friend that I 

2958
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,490
was talking about earlier in Africa,
it might be a wash,

2959
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,780
it might be the,
yeah,

2960
02:17:22,781 --> 02:17:24,340
the Internet is really cool and that's 
it,

2961
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:26,930
but on the other hand,
the prison industrial complex is,

2962
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:27,970
you know,
and yeah,

2963
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:29,680
it might be cool that we didn't get into
Syria,

2964
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:34,681
but on the other hand were blown up 
wedding parties in Yemen from the sky 

2965
02:17:34,681 --> 02:17:35,830
and nobody gives a shit because nobody's
dying on our side.

2966
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:38,710
And you know what I mean?
It's like maybe it's a wash,

2967
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:42,460
but when people start telling me utopia 
is right around the corner,

2968
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,580
my bullshit detector start blinking 
really rightly.

2969
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:49,360
I don't necessarily take you Topia,
but terminal life,

2970
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:51,970
super muscles,
whatever.

2971
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:54,420
It's a sales pitch.
Oh,

2972
02:17:54,421 --> 02:17:57,490
I don't agree for something that isn't 
gonna pay off,

2973
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:02,520
but I don't agree because I,
I think if you just look at what we 

2974
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:02,520
have,
I mean we already have superpowers.

2975
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,590
You have God goddamn phone and you can 
talk to and it answers anyways,

2976
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:09,660
but are people happier?
Are People really happier now than they 

2977
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:09,660
were 50 years ago?
Some are,

2978
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:14,610
some are happy,
some I don't think you could ever say 

2979
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:17,071
that are people happier because if 
you're just going to generalize about 

2980
02:18:17,071 --> 02:18:17,470
just people overall,
well,

2981
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:18,880
what kind of people we talking about?
Well,

2982
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:21,910
you have to take an aggregate.
We're talking about people in America.

2983
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:24,130
That's exactly right.
People in Nice neighborhoods,

2984
02:18:24,131 --> 02:18:26,710
we were talking about people in poverty 
is in progress,

2985
02:18:26,711 --> 02:18:31,711
but if we're talking about progress for 
the human race or human species than we 

2986
02:18:31,711 --> 02:18:35,671
are talking about all people.
We've got to be talking about the 

2987
02:18:35,671 --> 02:18:35,671
aggregate,
right?

2988
02:18:35,671 --> 02:18:37,360
Jesus Christ.
Isn't that what progress would be?

2989
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:37,940
Well,
we don't have.

2990
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:40,990
I mean you have influence on your.
Your immediate environment.

2991
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:45,991
You have influence on the people that 
you're allowed to reach outside your 

2992
02:18:45,991 --> 02:18:48,570
immediate environment with technology,
but once you start talking about the 

2993
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:49,180
entire world,
if we're really responsible for that,

2994
02:18:49,181 --> 02:18:51,970
well then all societies have to break 
down and we have to start from scratch.

2995
02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:57,030
I'm not saying we're responsible,
I'm just saying that when people start 

2996
02:18:57,030 --> 02:18:57,030
talking about how things are getting 
better,

2997
02:18:57,370 --> 02:19:00,580
I think you need to.
What we need to do is understand,

2998
02:19:00,581 --> 02:19:05,581
define our terms.
What do you mean by better a and 

2999
02:19:05,581 --> 02:19:05,740
secondly,
what do you mean by for us?

3000
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,410
I'll tell you better.
Here's better for me.

3001
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:13,240
I can go on audible.com,
download an audio book of Jack Kornfield

3002
02:19:13,241 --> 02:19:18,241
talking about describing Buddhism.
This super simple way that I've never 

3003
02:19:18,241 --> 02:19:18,241
heard it.
Like,

3004
02:19:18,241 --> 02:19:19,900
oh,
wakes me up to this idea of like,

3005
02:19:19,901 --> 02:19:20,590
Shit,
man,

3006
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:23,290
I get it.
I've got to like if I don't love myself,

3007
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:27,350
if I don't figure out a way to to to to 
really embrace myself,

3008
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:28,010
I'm going to be

3009
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,930
a miserable,
are going to be kind of unhappy.

3010
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,450
I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of 
my life.

3011
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:37,600
So are things are getting better because
we have access to information that can 

3012
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,730
improve our internal states and then 
once you're happy,

3013
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:43,460
all the innovation can be enjoyed,
but if you're.

3014
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:44,170
If you,
if you.

3015
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:49,180
If so,
I'm saying that the access to 

3016
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,250
information now is so much greater than 
it ever was.

3017
02:19:49,251 --> 02:19:52,760
That if somebody really wants to plug in
and transform themselves,

3018
02:19:52,761 --> 02:19:55,250
they can and that's better.
That's better.

3019
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:57,740
But another point is,
in Buddhism,

3020
02:19:57,741 --> 02:20:00,500
there's an idea of something called 
fundamental dissatisfaction,

3021
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:03,830
which comes from being a human being,
and it doesn't matter what time you were

3022
02:20:03,831 --> 02:20:06,320
born into,
it doesn't matter where you were born or

3023
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:08,810
if you're born in a futuristic society 
where,

3024
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:12,740
uh,
you never will age and flying android,

3025
02:20:12,741 --> 02:20:17,741
blowjob machines come down the moment 
they detect any type of horniness from 

3026
02:20:17,741 --> 02:20:20,180
your neural patterns and,
and make you come.

3027
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:22,940
You're still,
if you don't deal with your internal,

3028
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:24,190
if you don't deal with the,
the,

3029
02:20:24,191 --> 02:20:29,191
the basic,
fundamental problem of being a human 

3030
02:20:29,191 --> 02:20:30,020
being,
the idea that life is suffering.

3031
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:32,450
If you don't deal with your attachment 
to,

3032
02:20:32,451 --> 02:20:33,290
uh,
to,

3033
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:35,840
to,
to your ego and your identity,

3034
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:38,630
you're going to suffer no matter what.
And that doesn't change.

3035
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:41,390
That's just part of being a human being.
So,

3036
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,180
I mean,
I just think it's more interesting time,

3037
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:47,030
better lotions,
more interesting.

3038
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:52,860
Cars go faster,
zero to 60 times a down.

3039
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:54,630
Yeah.
Um,

3040
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:59,020
I think the potential for expansion is 
monstrous.

3041
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:03,010
And I think that the the potential for 
information to get to you,

3042
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,010
the possibilities of it getting to or 
greater than it's ever been before,

3043
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:10,780
the access to knowledge is insane.
And putting it all together and making a

3044
02:21:10,781 --> 02:21:14,380
package as a happy human being is always
a difficult pursuit.

3045
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:19,590
Always will be even more complicated now
because there's an increasing amount of 

3046
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:22,450
variables and it staggeringly increased 
amount of variable and you can only.

3047
02:21:22,451 --> 02:21:24,100
I mean there are two things.
There's a bottleneck.

3048
02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:29,130
Like you say,
there's more information than ever 

3049
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:31,051
before and I completely agree with that,
but your brain still has to processes 

3050
02:21:31,051 --> 02:21:34,680
and they can only go a certain speed.
Well that's where the shit like this 

3051
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:35,330
terminator star muscle comes in because 
it's gonna,

3052
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:37,550
it's gonna,
they're gonna move into the neuro field,

3053
02:21:37,810 --> 02:21:41,680
they're going to implant muscles and no,
they're saying they're able to create an

3054
02:21:41,710 --> 02:21:46,400
artificial style muscle that place your 
muscles.

3055
02:21:46,420 --> 02:21:47,700
They're implying,
well,

3056
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:52,970
this is a.
This is the very early stages of 

3057
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:55,441
anything that would apply to a robot or 
to whatever the fuck they're going to 

3058
02:21:55,441 --> 02:21:58,141
do.
But essentially they're trying to mimic 

3059
02:21:58,141 --> 02:21:59,260
what the possibilities of muscle tissue.
You know,

3060
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:04,360
there's another one that I've done where
they combined spider silk with human 

3061
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:06,430
human skin to create some artificial 
bulletproof skin.

3062
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:09,850
Spiderman today,
they just these.

3063
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:15,040
It's fascinating to watch people break 
down the very structure of reality.

3064
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:18,940
They're very compounds of the various 
aspects of life,

3065
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:22,180
whether it's flesh or bone or cognitive 
function.

3066
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:25,770
The brain itself,
they've created artificial brain cells.

3067
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:30,980
I mean there are like literally miss 
things or materializing and it's going 

3068
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:35,130
to be any credible puzzle that we have 
to solve as far as our possibilities for

3069
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:40,131
altering our environment.
But none of it matters if we're not 

3070
02:22:40,131 --> 02:22:42,910
getting information about government,
about the inner workings of corporations

3071
02:22:42,911 --> 02:22:44,430
and because these are the people.

3072
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:47,850
Those are the institutions that unless 
we're not getting more,

3073
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:50,340
we're not our access to good information
about,

3074
02:22:50,410 --> 02:22:55,410
about what's really going on is 
destroyed by the Internet because the 

3075
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:59,391
Internet has killed journalism sort of,
but isn't the real problem with all 

3076
02:22:59,391 --> 02:23:04,050
these.
Whether it's corporations that give 

3077
02:23:04,050 --> 02:23:05,310
money to lobbyists that give money to 
politicians and influence isn't.

3078
02:23:05,311 --> 02:23:08,190
The real problem is that it's not clear 
and obvious what's going on.

3079
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:12,210
People are slowly starting to unveil all
these issues of corruption.

3080
02:23:12,390 --> 02:23:17,390
Well,
as the boundaries between people in 

3081
02:23:17,390 --> 02:23:18,750
information becomes smaller and smaller 
to the point where there's no boundary.

3082
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:23,910
If everyone's going to be accountable,
you're going to be accountable for 

3083
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:23,910
everything,
including corporations.

3084
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:25,860
Corporations are going to be accountable
for their actions.

3085
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:27,930
Who's but who's going to do that work?

3086
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:33,230
Who's going to go to the board meetings 
and record who voted for what and where 

3087
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:33,290
the money's going.
That's journalism.

3088
02:23:33,370 --> 02:23:35,130
That's if you,
and there's no money in journals.

3089
02:23:35,131 --> 02:23:37,660
If you live today in this world,
that is the case.

3090
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:40,750
I think the world where we live in in 
20,

3091
02:23:40,751 --> 02:23:41,560
30,
40,

3092
02:23:41,561 --> 02:23:43,720
whatever it is,
there's gonna be no secrets.

3093
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:45,880
It's not going to be like the board has 
to meet.

3094
02:23:45,881 --> 02:23:49,720
Everyone's going to know in the on the 
whole planet what the corporation's been

3095
02:23:49,721 --> 02:23:52,150
up to,
what the ramifications of this,

3096
02:23:52,330 --> 02:23:57,330
who's profited from this directly and 
the Bradley Manning's are going to win 

3097
02:23:57,791 --> 02:24:01,870
out over the NSA percent for life.
Yeah,

3098
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:08,420
Greenwald.
I just listened to him on the way over 

3099
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:08,420
here.
I was listening to him,

3100
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:11,900
he was talking,
he was at Marxism conference or 

3101
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:15,351
something and he was talking about how 
he was on meet the press and how David 

3102
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:21,500
Gregory essentially called for him to be
arrested and put in prison for being a 

3103
02:24:22,231 --> 02:24:23,520
journalist.
Unbelievable.

3104
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:28,521
You know,
and David Gregory himself is completely 

3105
02:24:28,521 --> 02:24:31,431
complicit in,
in selectively using the leaks that are 

3106
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:32,550
given to him.
Right.

3107
02:24:32,551 --> 02:24:34,740
Which is what he was accusing Greenwald 
of having done,

3108
02:24:34,741 --> 02:24:36,900
you know,
utilize a leak and writing your story.

3109
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:39,630
And he's like,
that's what David does every week,

3110
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:41,430
you know,
at some dinner party,

3111
02:24:41,431 --> 02:24:44,790
somebody mentioned something to him that
they want to be disseminated.

3112
02:24:44,990 --> 02:24:49,990
That's all those guys do.
And he described them as actors playing 

3113
02:24:49,990 --> 02:24:52,941
journalists on TV.
But I mean going Greenwald's one of the 

3114
02:24:52,941 --> 02:24:52,941
only ones out there,
you know,

3115
02:24:52,941 --> 02:24:54,100
Jeremy Scahill I

3116
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:55,870
see.
I don't think the Internet is destroyed.

3117
02:24:55,871 --> 02:24:59,580
Journalism journalism destroyed itself.
The Internet has created real journalism

3118
02:24:59,581 --> 02:25:04,581
and the Internet has given birth to a 
totally new style of journalism that's 

3119
02:25:04,581 --> 02:25:05,560
not connected to the machine that's 
actually viewer supported.

3120
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:09,430
Whether it's shows like the young Turks 
or podcasts or anything,

3121
02:25:09,730 --> 02:25:14,730
what you're getting is a viewer 
supported experience where there's no 

3122
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:18,301
incentive to lie to you anymore.
The incentive is actually to tell the 

3123
02:25:18,301 --> 02:25:21,721
truth.
These shifts are you can't ignore them 

3124
02:25:21,721 --> 02:25:25,750
and there's this new access and this new
thirst for information.

3125
02:25:25,751 --> 02:25:29,380
It's very different than anything any 
culture has ever experienced before.

3126
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:31,900
I don't think you could take it lightly 
and I think.

3127
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:37,680
I think ultimately it spells progress 
because it spells outrage and outrage 

3128
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:39,820
over corruption.
Once there's a balance,

3129
02:25:39,821 --> 02:25:43,120
there's a yin and a Yang when it comes 
to government and once there's a balance

3130
02:25:43,121 --> 02:25:48,121
in the corruption has been least forced 
to relinquish its grasp.

3131
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:54,640
Whether prosecuted,
whether people will go to have to go to 

3132
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:54,700
jail for the way they've been running 
this society is debatable.

3133
02:25:54,990 --> 02:25:59,990
You know,
this is what the law used to be at a 

3134
02:25:59,990 --> 02:25:59,990
certain point in time.
Yeah.

3135
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,490
None of this torture guys are anywhere 
near a jail,

3136
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,490
but there's no debate that it's got all 
stop.

3137
02:26:03,530 --> 02:26:05,920
Whether whether it comes from that,
whether it comes from.

3138
02:26:05,921 --> 02:26:10,390
There was a recent story about how the 
drug war is a complete and total fucking

3139
02:26:10,391 --> 02:26:15,391
joke based on the fact that these banks 
that have been caught laundering money.

3140
02:26:15,611 --> 02:26:17,800
Did you read this in Florida?
UBC?

3141
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,080
Billions of dollars.
Yeah.

3142
02:26:20,081 --> 02:26:21,110
Unbelievable.
I'll,

3143
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:23,920
I'll pull it up because it's such a 
fucking crazy,

3144
02:26:23,921 --> 02:26:25,930
crazy story,
but when you,

3145
02:26:25,931 --> 02:26:27,490
when you read it,
it just,

3146
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:31,000
it shows you that the idea of a drug 
war,

3147
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:35,530
of the fact that they're trying to stop 
drugs from coming in nonsense.

3148
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:37,390
They're just trying to arrest black 
people.

3149
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:42,540
They're trying to fill up jails.
They trying to make it so that the 

3150
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:45,781
people who are in control of the 
distribution stay in control of the 

3151
02:26:45,781 --> 02:26:47,680
distribution.
It's madness.

3152
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:50,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

3153
02:26:50,021 --> 02:26:55,021
I always feel like I'm raining on the 
parade when I talked to you two guys 

3154
02:26:55,021 --> 02:26:55,021
because you're so hopeful for the 
future.

3155
02:26:55,021 --> 02:26:55,330
I think you,
you're,

3156
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,010
you've just seen more than we have.

3157
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:02,450
You've been to more places to see me or 
fuck and educated.

3158
02:27:02,650 --> 02:27:04,170
I love it.
It's so great,

3159
02:27:04,171 --> 02:27:06,090
man,
because like it's so you need that.

3160
02:27:06,091 --> 02:27:08,010
You need balance.
It's good to have balance,

3161
02:27:08,011 --> 02:27:09,360
man.
You don't want an echo chamber,

3162
02:27:09,361 --> 02:27:14,361
you need somebody who's going to throw 
out the facts and [inaudible] in that 

3163
02:27:14,361 --> 02:27:15,270
process.
Maybe you'll,

3164
02:27:15,350 --> 02:27:16,350
you know,
obviously,

3165
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:20,700
are we headed towards some utopian 
reality or some Utopian future?

3166
02:27:20,701 --> 02:27:22,950
I'd say the odds of that are pretty 
slim.

3167
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:24,840
Um,
especially,

3168
02:27:24,841 --> 02:27:29,841
uh,
as long as people are caught up in 

3169
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:30,630
themselves as an individual instead of 
recognizing they're part of a whole,

3170
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:33,270
uh,
regardless of any kind of innovation,

3171
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:35,850
there's going to,
that's always going to create problems.

3172
02:27:35,851 --> 02:27:40,851
But I do think there's some beautiful 
things on the horizon that are just 

3173
02:27:40,851 --> 02:27:40,851
going to be wonderful.
Of course,

3174
02:27:40,851 --> 02:27:45,610
throw the thing of these conversations 
get complicated because anyone I'm 

3175
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:47,040
talking to always says something like,
oh,

3176
02:27:47,041 --> 02:27:49,860
I don't want to have tuberculosis,
or there are good things on the horizon.

3177
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:52,560
That's all true.
What I'm talking about right

3178
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:56,090
is,
is the general trajectory of our species

3179
02:27:56,091 --> 02:27:59,450
trip through time going in a good 
direction or a bad director?

3180
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,750
Let me tell you before anybody.
Uh,

3181
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,840
Oh,
the rolling stone article is a 

3182
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:07,880
outrageous SBC.
HSBC settlement proves that the drug war

3183
02:28:07,881 --> 02:28:09,520
is a joke.
It's by Matt Matt Taibbi.

3184
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:14,590
He's fantastic.
The Best Thompson even better because 

3185
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:15,510
he's more prolific and he's not fucked 
up on meth.

3186
02:28:16,470 --> 02:28:17,570
My title.
Oh,

3187
02:28:17,571 --> 02:28:20,570
you gotta read my greatest journalists 
of all time.

3188
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,310
That octopus thing reminded

3189
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,070
me of him because he's famous for the 
octopus squid.

3190
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:27,890
Yeah.
What I was gonna say is that in my world

3191
02:28:27,891 --> 02:28:30,440
it's better.
So if you're saying this society better,

3192
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:32,840
well I only as applied,
you know,

3193
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:34,520
but in my world,
100 percent.

3194
02:28:34,990 --> 02:28:36,020
But look,
look at us.

3195
02:28:36,130 --> 02:28:38,790
We're three guys dudes,
you know,

3196
02:28:38,810 --> 02:28:43,160
with three beautiful muscular men,
magical white people were magical way.

3197
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:45,440
People with no job,
right?

3198
02:28:45,441 --> 02:28:48,860
None of us is punching a clock anywhere.
A lot of the people who are listening to

3199
02:28:48,861 --> 02:28:51,710
this or sitting in a cubicle somewhere 
and they're working 40,

3200
02:28:51,711 --> 02:28:53,240
50 hours a week,
they get home,

3201
02:28:53,241 --> 02:28:56,330
they're fucking exhausted.
They don't have time to read Matt Taibbi

3202
02:28:56,331 --> 02:29:01,331
because they got to like change the 
diapers and the kid and take the other 

3203
02:29:01,331 --> 02:29:02,780
one to soccer and you know,
pay the alimony and it's like,

3204
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:07,610
I think it's really important that we 
don't have.

3205
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:12,880
We don't forget how incredibly fortunate
we are and what an amazing pinnacle we 

3206
02:29:13,521 --> 02:29:16,910
happen to be standing on looking at 
experience that said,

3207
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:19,040
you figured it out,
you figured it out.

3208
02:29:19,190 --> 02:29:21,950
I figured it out.
Here we are in our world.

3209
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:25,070
The world is better today,
or we're just really lucky.

3210
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:26,020
Or we're living.
I don't know.

3211
02:29:26,021 --> 02:29:31,021
I don't know what we figured out.
Why can't we embrace the simulation 

3212
02:29:31,021 --> 02:29:33,020
theory that this simulation that we have
all subscribed to.

3213
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:37,710
We jumped into a really good simulation.
We don't have jobs and uh,

3214
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:41,290
like the world is a Goddamn Hologram.
It's been proven that.

3215
02:29:41,330 --> 02:29:42,560
Yeah,
that was last week,

3216
02:29:42,561 --> 02:29:43,550
right?
The hologram.

3217
02:29:43,551 --> 02:29:45,320
The universe is a Hologram Dunkin.

3218
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:50,720
Some is something at the retreat they 
said that they were talking about this 

3219
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,390
thing broke you.
I loved it.

3220
02:29:51,790 --> 02:29:53,290
Here's something they said I really 
like,

3221
02:29:53,291 --> 02:29:58,291
which is because it's this thing that 
you're doing the starving African child 

3222
02:29:58,291 --> 02:30:01,261
thing where it's like there's always 
this starving African child to think 

3223
02:30:01,261 --> 02:30:01,860
about when you're too happy.
And the thing is,

3224
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:07,230
if you really want to honor and respect 
the suffering of the world and people 

3225
02:30:07,230 --> 02:30:11,941
who are trapped in various predicaments,
the greatest thing you could do is not 

3226
02:30:11,941 --> 02:30:13,750
feel guilty about your own happiness

3227
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:15,160
ride.
That shit.

3228
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:18,640
I don't feel guilty about it.
Guilt to me.

3229
02:30:18,970 --> 02:30:19,450
I mean,
you know,

3230
02:30:19,451 --> 02:30:21,170
Chogyam Trungpa,
right?

3231
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:22,690
Okay.
One of the things that guy,

3232
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:24,670
who the fuck are you talking to me about
trump,

3233
02:30:24,671 --> 02:30:28,890
is that he was a.
He was a Tibetan Guru who came to the US

3234
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:30,100
early and

3235
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:32,080
in a past state.
He was a Tibetan.

3236
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:37,240
He was like a,
a reincarnation who came to the United 

3237
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:37,240
States,
started wearing suits,

3238
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,720
drinking,
humping girls in his,

3239
02:30:39,721 --> 02:30:43,080
in his Buddhism is breakdown of Buddhism
is amazing.

3240
02:30:43,081 --> 02:30:46,650
He's got two great books that I know of 
cutting through spiritual materialism.

3241
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:49,110
What's the war?
The warrior thing,

3242
02:30:49,111 --> 02:30:50,310
the path of the Shambala,

3243
02:30:50,810 --> 02:30:52,240
the warrior,
and another beautiful.

3244
02:30:52,241 --> 02:30:57,241
Yeah.
My children as a teacher who was his 

3245
02:30:57,241 --> 02:30:59,091
disciple,
there's a great documentary on Netflix 

3246
02:30:59,091 --> 02:30:59,091
about them that you can watch with 
years.

3247
02:30:59,091 --> 02:30:59,480
This guy from,
he's from,

3248
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:00,590
I guess the sixth,
67th,

3249
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:05,140
but he died from liver disease,
from drinking.

3250
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:10,150
He was a like Alan Watts who also died 
from liver disease,

3251
02:31:10,930 --> 02:31:12,850
died from liver disease too.
That's so sad.

3252
02:31:12,851 --> 02:31:13,060
But,

3253
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:15,010
but he,
his whole thing was like,

3254
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:20,020
just be be who you are,
like who you are like

3255
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,740
to do to really love booze.
He did and he would like,

3256
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:25,790
like there's a story which is.
Anyway,

3257
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:30,880
he liked playing with people's 
conception of how he should be and like 

3258
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,430
in this documentary there's a story 
where he's onstage with some,

3259
02:31:32,431 --> 02:31:33,960
like very like,
you know,

3260
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:39,110
a tight square spiritual teacher and 
he's onstage with a spiritual teacher 

3261
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:42,210
and he's wasted.
He's acting drunk and he's wasted.

3262
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:46,050
And like after the talk,
he's in the hallway walking with some of

3263
02:31:46,051 --> 02:31:48,180
his disciples,
totally not drunk anymore.

3264
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:49,080
He's like,
how did I do?

3265
02:31:49,081 --> 02:31:51,240
What do you think?
He was acting drunk.

3266
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:54,150
He was doing this because he was fucking
around with like,

3267
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:59,180
he was trying to create a contrast 
between this guy who apparently like 

3268
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:00,510
considered himself to be a very buttoned
up,

3269
02:32:00,511 --> 02:32:03,750
very spiritual spiritual man and him.
It was just like,

3270
02:32:03,751 --> 02:32:05,610
look,
I can do whatever I want.

3271
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:10,820
I can be whoever I want to be.
I don't have to act like I'm holy or 

3272
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:11,160
sacred,
you know?

3273
02:32:11,161 --> 02:32:13,260
I don't have to act like a spiritual 
person.

3274
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:18,470
I can be a drunk guy who humps hippies 
and still be a spiritual teacher and 

3275
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:21,600
still have something to offer the world.
That's a beautiful thing,

3276
02:32:21,601 --> 02:32:21,870
man.

3277
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:25,450
It is a beautiful thing except that he's
pretending to be drunk.

3278
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:28,690
I never side with the people that are 
pretending to be drunk.

3279
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:32,470
I always suspect foul play.
You're pretending to be drunk.

3280
02:32:32,471 --> 02:32:34,870
Why would you pretend to be drunk or 
pretend to be anything else?

3281
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:40,690
Why your documentary?
I don't know if you've ever seen comics 

3282
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:42,520
that get like a shot of water and 
pretend it's Tequila onstage now.

3283
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:44,980
It's dark,
it's dark.

3284
02:32:44,981 --> 02:32:47,830
They fake drunk.
They fake pretending to be drunk.

3285
02:32:48,260 --> 02:32:49,130
Well,
he's think wasn't.

3286
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:51,620
I don't think anyway,
I can't defend it because attack is.

3287
02:32:51,621 --> 02:32:52,460
Fuck.
I can't do.

3288
02:32:52,461 --> 02:32:54,630
It wasn't when he did it.
Maybe he was one of the first.

3289
02:32:54,860 --> 02:32:56,960
He wasn't at the fucking Improv.
Well,

3290
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:59,900
Dean Martin,
but it mean seriously.

3291
02:32:59,901 --> 02:33:01,400
What is he doing?
He's faking it.

3292
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:02,680
He was doing,
but it was.

3293
02:33:03,150 --> 02:33:04,150
Listen,
I'm.

3294
02:33:04,550 --> 02:33:06,380
First of all,
I'm not a disciple of Chogyam Trungpa,

3295
02:33:06,381 --> 02:33:07,590
so I don't know why I'm getting 
defensive.

3296
02:33:07,630 --> 02:33:09,060
Alan Watts anyway.
No,

3297
02:33:09,061 --> 02:33:10,410
no.
Chogyam Trungpa.

3298
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:11,630
Oh,
he's the one who did that?

3299
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:13,760
Drunk.
I got confused.

3300
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:14,810
Well,
either one.

3301
02:33:15,010 --> 02:33:20,010
Why did the guy do that?
I think he was demonstrating the power 

3302
02:33:20,010 --> 02:33:21,770
of not giving a shit,
which is one of my pet theories.

3303
02:33:21,771 --> 02:33:26,771
Recently.
I think it's the only power we get that 

3304
02:33:26,771 --> 02:33:26,771
that actually becomes stronger as we 
age,

3305
02:33:26,771 --> 02:33:29,460
but how you guys not giving a shit if 
he's pretending to be drunk.

3306
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:31,330
He obviously gives a shit.
I think I.

3307
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:33,250
I'm going to say he had on show.
No,

3308
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:36,200
he doesn't give a shit about his 
reputation as a spiritual guru,

3309
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:41,230
so he's making a fool of himself 
intentionally to demonstrate the fact 

3310
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:42,410
that he's no big deal.
A lot of these gurus,

3311
02:33:42,411 --> 02:33:43,430
that's what they do,
man.

3312
02:33:43,431 --> 02:33:48,431
That's part of what they do is they get 
around people and they do some 

3313
02:33:48,431 --> 02:33:51,221
incredibly untraditional,
weird thing that doesn't seem to make 

3314
02:33:51,221 --> 02:33:54,581
much sense or really like affects the 
people who watch them and it usually is 

3315
02:33:54,581 --> 02:33:57,620
a way to like point out you're your own 
like ego and you're where you're stuck.

3316
02:33:57,830 --> 02:34:00,380
That's the idea and you have to.
It's a leap of faith.

3317
02:34:00,381 --> 02:34:02,480
Like was Chogyam Trungpa doing that on 
purpose?

3318
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:07,520
Maybe he was really drunk.
Maybe you just wasn't having a good 

3319
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:08,180
night or maybe he wasn't doing it 
because he had a weird sense of humor.

3320
02:34:08,390 --> 02:34:13,390
Who knows?
But all you can say is this guy put out 

3321
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:16,421
some amazing fucking books that really 
break down Tibetan Buddhism and also 

3322
02:34:16,421 --> 02:34:17,770
like some of his disciples,
like children,

3323
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:21,010
they're amazing teachers and they asked 
her about him,

3324
02:34:21,270 --> 02:34:26,270
you know,
what did she think about him being a 

3325
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:26,270
boozer drinking and she's just like,
what can I say?

3326
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:29,500
He was a great teacher and he taught me 
the Dharma.

3327
02:34:29,501 --> 02:34:30,820
He taught me Buddhism,
so like,

3328
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:32,620
how can I judge?
I don't know.

3329
02:34:32,621 --> 02:34:34,810
That's just what he was like.
It's really cool,

3330
02:34:34,811 --> 02:34:35,350
man.
There's a,

3331
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:38,020
there's a,
especially in Tibet and Buddhism,

3332
02:34:38,021 --> 02:34:43,021
one of the progenitors of it was a t 
Lopa was his name and this was a,

3333
02:34:44,081 --> 02:34:49,081
you know,
they would go out and try to gather 

3334
02:34:49,081 --> 02:34:49,081
information about Buddhism.
And so this guy,

3335
02:34:49,081 --> 02:34:50,290
I think his name was Marva,
is that right?

3336
02:34:50,291 --> 02:34:52,890
Mark Miller.
Miller Miller up.

3337
02:34:52,930 --> 02:34:55,050
Not really.
I don't know if there's very rapey.

3338
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:57,220
I don't know if you had EPA.
Yeah,

3339
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:58,530
Milarapa.
Reva.

3340
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:02,300
He was like wandering to try to gather 
information about Buddhism and uh,

3341
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:03,250
he,
you know,

3342
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:05,590
he kept asking who can teach me this?
You can give me,

3343
02:35:05,591 --> 02:35:10,591
you can really teach me about this.
And so they told him where there's this 

3344
02:35:10,591 --> 02:35:10,591
guy,
he lopa in this fishing village,

3345
02:35:10,591 --> 02:35:11,460
you can go there and talk to him.
He's a,

3346
02:35:11,461 --> 02:35:14,440
he's an awakened being.
And so he gets there and he like,

3347
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:19,920
as people do you know if this st t dot 
Lopa this enlightened being and they're 

3348
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,900
like,
we know that the filthy homeless guy who

3349
02:35:22,901 --> 02:35:25,390
lives down by the river and eats fish 
scraps,

3350
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:30,420
is that who you want to find any?
And he goes to this guy and the guy 

3351
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:32,950
proceeds to torture him for years,
years and years,

3352
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:35,500
and like finally at the end of this 
whole process,

3353
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:40,501
and there's all these stories about the 
various means that this guy used to 

3354
02:35:40,501 --> 02:35:40,501
teach him the final transmission.

3355
02:35:40,501 --> 02:35:45,360
He slapped him in the face with the 
Sandal and that was like the big 

3356
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:48,781
download that he got.
And so the whole point of it all this 

3357
02:35:48,781 --> 02:35:50,170
mythology or half mythology or whatever 
it is,

3358
02:35:50,171 --> 02:35:55,171
is that if you let your ego decide what 
a teacher is going to look like,

3359
02:35:55,960 --> 02:36:00,960
then you are not going to see a real 
teacher when they cross your path 

3360
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:04,230
because you've already decided they wear
robes or they don't wear robes or 

3361
02:36:04,230 --> 02:36:05,860
they're in shape or they're not in shape
or they're this or they're that.

3362
02:36:06,070 --> 02:36:11,070
The moment you do that,
you've cut out so much in the world and 

3363
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:15,841
that's what's really cool about a 
Buddhism and all these stories is that 

3364
02:36:15,841 --> 02:36:18,160
quite often the teacher was never who 
you expected it to be.

3365
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:22,210
It was always a person who went way,
way against what you thought.

3366
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:27,300
Somebody who was awake in might be like,
and there's something really beautiful 

3367
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:28,540
about that because if you knew what 
awakened beings look like,

3368
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:30,430
then you would be awakened yourself,
wouldn't you?

3369
02:36:30,431 --> 02:36:35,431
And you wouldn't really need anything 
because you already have it all figured 

3370
02:36:35,431 --> 02:36:38,401
out.
So awakened being slapped in the face 

3371
02:36:38,401 --> 02:36:38,401
with the Sandal,
awakened beings,

3372
02:36:38,401 --> 02:36:42,190
awakened beings apparently do whatever 
it takes to,

3373
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:46,330
to wake up the other beings around them.
And that's the essence of a Koan.

3374
02:36:46,331 --> 02:36:46,870
Right?
All this.

3375
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:51,380
What's the hand one answer?
Slapping one sandal.

3376
02:36:51,390 --> 02:36:52,370
Slough it.
So yeah,

3377
02:36:53,050 --> 02:36:55,300
you remind me of this German guy I met 
in India,

3378
02:36:55,380 --> 02:36:56,860
uh,
years ago.

3379
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:02,340
I just met him in a cafe.
Just some guy had been living in India 

3380
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:05,011
for a long time and we were getting 
drunk and he told me this story when he 

3381
02:37:05,011 --> 02:37:09,091
was young and first arrived in India.
He found his teacher who didn't speak 

3382
02:37:09,761 --> 02:37:11,410
any German or English.
Right?

3383
02:37:11,411 --> 02:37:14,030
But he just saw this guy in Varanasi and
he was like,

3384
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:16,400
that's the guy that's the guy who's 
going to teach me.

3385
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:21,670
And he started following this guy and 
the guy for weeks and the guy was just 

3386
02:37:21,670 --> 02:37:22,010
like,
who are you?

3387
02:37:22,011 --> 02:37:23,750
Get away from me,
why are you following me?

3388
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:26,180
And he just followed this guy all 
through India.

3389
02:37:26,450 --> 02:37:31,450
And then finally like he was washing his
robes and he fucked up the robe somehow 

3390
02:37:31,791 --> 02:37:36,791
in the wash.
And so then this guru had like weird 

3391
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:36,791
robes that weren't the right color.

3392
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:41,260
And he then eventually he let this 
German guy wear a robe and the German 

3393
02:37:41,271 --> 02:37:44,810
guys sort of ingratiated just like a 
stray dog won't leave you alone.

3394
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:47,900
And he never understood what the guy was
saying.

3395
02:37:47,901 --> 02:37:51,050
He just felt there was something in his 
eyes that would be transmitted to him if

3396
02:37:51,051 --> 02:37:54,890
he stuck with him.
And eventually because the white guy was

3397
02:37:54,891 --> 02:37:59,891
following him all around,
this guru became really well known in 

3398
02:37:59,891 --> 02:38:00,230
India.
Right?

3399
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:05,590
And he started bringing the white guy up
next to him on the stage when he was 

3400
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:09,671
doing his teachings and stuff,
because everybody knew him is the guru 

3401
02:38:09,671 --> 02:38:09,920
that the white dude follow it all 
around.

3402
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:15,430
And eventually as the German language 
skills got better in Hindi or whatever 

3403
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:16,550
language the,
the guy was speaking,

3404
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:21,940
the German realized that this was 
completely full of shit and he was just 

3405
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:23,180
like using him to car.
So it,

3406
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:26,090
it was what you were saying reminded me 
of it.

3407
02:38:26,091 --> 02:38:30,970
This whole idea of like what a teacher 
looks like and it's A.

3408
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:33,670
Yeah.
The idea is it's like the teacher,

3409
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:37,120
the idea is you already are inside.
You already awake,

3410
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:38,220
you have this,
you're,

3411
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:40,300
you're caught up in your ego,
you're attached to your ego,

3412
02:38:40,301 --> 02:38:42,160
you're already awake.
And so different people,

3413
02:38:42,610 --> 02:38:45,160
they need excuses to wake up.
They need,

3414
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:47,370
they need an excuse,
they need some kind of things.

3415
02:38:47,371 --> 02:38:52,371
Some people need to wear robes or some 
people need some kind of intense 

3416
02:38:52,371 --> 02:38:53,710
meditation practice in some stories and 
Buddhism,

3417
02:38:53,711 --> 02:38:57,880
somebody sees like a drop of a water,
hit a puddle and suddenly they,

3418
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:00,100
they gained the transmission and wake 
up.

3419
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:02,200
But uh,
and I think Chogyam Trungpa,

3420
02:39:02,201 --> 02:39:05,740
he even said this whole process of 
initiation is kind of ridiculous.

3421
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:10,920
It's really more of a thing for you.
It's more of a thing because you need 

3422
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:14,341
the excuse to be a better person.
This is actually not to get too far off 

3423
02:39:14,341 --> 02:39:18,661
track here,
but this is in the brothers Karamazov 

3424
02:39:18,661 --> 02:39:18,661
dust.

3425
02:39:18,661 --> 02:39:19,000
They ask.
He talks about Paul,

3426
02:39:19,001 --> 02:39:21,610
who is the basically the,
the,

3427
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:24,730
the father of Christianity who never 
even met Jesus,

3428
02:39:24,731 --> 02:39:29,731
but he was like walking down the use of 
persecute Christians and his name was 

3429
02:39:29,731 --> 02:39:34,111
Saul and he was walking on the road to 
Damascus and Jesus appears to him and 

3430
02:39:34,111 --> 02:39:34,750
says,
Saul,

3431
02:39:34,751 --> 02:39:36,490
Saul,
why do you persecute me?

3432
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:39,080
And at that moment he like he,
he changed.

3433
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:43,980
He realizes that Jesus is love and he 
becomes like a disciple of Christ and he

3434
02:39:43,981 --> 02:39:46,860
changes and so Dostoevsky and is 
awesome.

3435
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:48,760
I say in the brothers,
Karamazov says,

3436
02:39:48,761 --> 02:39:53,761
okay,
what happened there is Jesus like a 

3437
02:39:53,761 --> 02:39:56,551
magical medicine being that like touched
him and there was some magical thing 

3438
02:39:56,551 --> 02:39:57,550
that went through him were suddenly got 
better.

3439
02:39:57,790 --> 02:40:02,790
If that's the case,
then Jesus has nothing and humans are 

3440
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:03,280
just empty robotic things and there's no
freedom.

3441
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:08,460
All you have to do is come in contact 
with the right person and you're going 

3442
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:09,070
to get better again.
Freedom's gone in that equation.

3443
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:14,250
Or did saul need an excuse to stop being
an asshole and the excuse he used was 

3444
02:40:15,391 --> 02:40:20,391
this hallucination of some magical being
that came to him and he let that be the 

3445
02:40:20,391 --> 02:40:23,520
excuse that let him truly become a a,
a,

3446
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:28,530
an awakened being,
and this is why in so many different 

3447
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:28,530
religions and so many different 
philosophies,

3448
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:33,441
there's the process of initiation which 
is like these series of things that you 

3449
02:40:33,441 --> 02:40:34,270
go through to the martial arts.
Yeah.

3450
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:37,810
It's funny because your,
your thoughts are all the.

3451
02:40:37,811 --> 02:40:40,480
All the things you're saying are all 
very beautiful,

3452
02:40:40,690 --> 02:40:45,690
but they're there.
They're so clearly a work of fiction 

3453
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:46,480
there,
so clearly pros there.

3454
02:40:46,481 --> 02:40:50,500
So clearly a story like all the even 
there like flavored.

3455
02:40:50,501 --> 02:40:55,501
It's like there's truth in them,
but it's truth delivered in the filter 

3456
02:40:55,501 --> 02:40:59,821
of a story.
You know about someone getting slapped 

3457
02:40:59,821 --> 02:41:00,730
in the face of the Sandal and beginning 
enlightened or someone seeing water hit.

3458
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:04,400
It doesn't make it untrue.
No,

3459
02:41:04,401 --> 02:41:05,470
no,
definitely not.

3460
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:07,450
Especially when you consider the age of 
these things,

3461
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,310
right?
The age of these initial thoughts.

3462
02:41:09,311 --> 02:41:14,311
I mean,
how old are the original stories that 

3463
02:41:14,311 --> 02:41:14,311
goddamn ancient knows

3464
02:41:14,311 --> 02:41:18,870
mean?
Isn't that the essence of fiction to 

3465
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:18,870
convey a truth?

3466
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:23,960
I find it fascinating because of the 
fact that when these things were 

3467
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:27,051
originally conveyed and put down onto 
some form of written language or what 

3468
02:41:27,051 --> 02:41:27,080
have you,
the the,

3469
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:30,720
the actual stories still resonate 
through the obvious fiction,

3470
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:36,200
actual truths of what you're saying.
Still resonate through the obvious 

3471
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:40,131
fiction of the work.
Like you can tell me that a guy slapped 

3472
02:41:40,131 --> 02:41:40,230
a guy with a Sandal and he achieved 
enlightenment.

3473
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:41,270
I'm sure he did.
Well,

3474
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:41,610
no,
no,

3475
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:46,640
but I mean,
but what you're saying behind it that 

3476
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:48,570
you know,
what you're doing is exposing someone to

3477
02:41:48,571 --> 02:41:53,571
these various new passive thinking that 
sometimes a simple thing like water 

3478
02:41:53,571 --> 02:41:58,340
splashing into a pond but opens up the 
doors of perception in a strange way 

3479
02:41:58,340 --> 02:42:03,140
that allows this sort of exponentially 
increasing understanding of your reality

3480
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:06,510
and then it is just one event that 
causes this.

3481
02:42:06,511 --> 02:42:08,550
It is really a slap in the face of the 
Sandal,

3482
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,380
but it's still obviously fiction.

3483
02:42:10,430 --> 02:42:15,430
Well,
and it's what we were talking about 

3484
02:42:15,430 --> 02:42:15,430
before we went on air placebo.
Yes,

3485
02:42:15,430 --> 02:42:19,620
right.
The fact that a placebo isn't an actual 

3486
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:21,830
drug doesn't mean it's less real if its 
effects are tangible.

3487
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:22,370
Well,
yeah,

3488
02:42:22,371 --> 02:42:25,580
but it's such a weird fucking thing.
I don't think it's just placebo.

3489
02:42:25,581 --> 02:42:29,390
I think you're talking about a container
to hold a certain type of energy.

3490
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:34,450
That's what a placebo is.
Placebo triggers yourself healing 

3491
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:37,910
potential.
That was always his religion.

3492
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:43,160
Religion gives you a structure within 
which to be the decent person you 

3493
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:43,160
already were.

3494
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:48,400
Yeah.
The one of the most ultimately 

3495
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:48,400
fascinating things about human beings is
the placebo effect.

3496
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:53,230
The idea that there's a tangible,
quantifiable result that comes from a 

3497
02:42:53,241 --> 02:42:57,200
certain type of thinking,
but whether it's positive or negative or

3498
02:42:57,201 --> 02:42:58,310
you know,
or stress,

3499
02:42:58,311 --> 02:43:02,930
just stress like they've shown that 
people that live in big cities or people

3500
02:43:02,931 --> 02:43:07,931
that have high stress jobs,
just much more likely to have a host of 

3501
02:43:07,931 --> 02:43:11,891
different things go wrong with their 
body because they're just fucking red 

3502
02:43:11,891 --> 02:43:11,891
line and get all the

3503
02:43:12,740 --> 02:43:14,770
stressed devastating to your immune 
system.

3504
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:19,360
I spoke at a scientific conference once,
a psycho neuro immunology.

3505
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:21,460
Do you know about that?
It's essentially the,

3506
02:43:21,480 --> 02:43:26,480
the measure of how our mental state or a
psychological state affects our immune 

3507
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:30,010
response.
And one of the guys who was onstage with

3508
02:43:30,011 --> 02:43:32,470
me is Robert Ader who just died 
recently.

3509
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:36,460
He's the first person to ever 
demonstrate in a laboratory that,

3510
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,290
uh,
you,

3511
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:41,230
if you stress out mice,
their immune system drops.

3512
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:43,570
It was very interesting the way he did 
it.

3513
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:47,500
He gave them a,
what's that artificial sweetener?

3514
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:50,410
Aspartame before Xylitol.
Now,

3515
02:43:50,411 --> 02:43:53,320
before the first one,
I'm Saccharin Saccharin.

3516
02:43:53,321 --> 02:43:56,800
Yeah.
So he put Saccharin in the water and let

3517
02:43:56,801 --> 02:44:00,100
them drink the Saccharin.
And as soon as they drank the Saccharin,

3518
02:44:00,101 --> 02:44:04,480
he shocked them and so he paired 
saccharin with an electrical shock,

3519
02:44:04,481 --> 02:44:05,800
right.
And then,

3520
02:44:05,801 --> 02:44:10,801
and every time they were shocked,
they're immune response dropped because 

3521
02:44:10,801 --> 02:44:13,561
they were super stressed and you know,
the release of toxic chemicals and all 

3522
02:44:13,561 --> 02:44:13,561
that.

3523
02:44:13,561 --> 02:44:17,580
And then later,
so he trained them to associate those 

3524
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:20,431
two things.
And then later he only gave them 

3525
02:44:20,431 --> 02:44:20,860
Saccharin and noted that they had the 
same response.

3526
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:25,730
So the immune response had been trained.
Ah,

3527
02:44:25,850 --> 02:44:30,850
that is fucking hard.
It's so hard though to keep your head 

3528
02:44:30,850 --> 02:44:31,960
about you.
It's so hard to stay calm,

3529
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:34,810
to just be cool and chill about things.
And then.

3530
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,470
Sorry to interrupt you,
but just a.

3531
02:44:37,110 --> 02:44:42,110
The really weird thing about this is the
next generation and the third generation

3532
02:44:42,341 --> 02:44:45,880
have the same response woe without ever 
having.

3533
02:44:45,881 --> 02:44:46,630
Exactly.
Exactly.

3534
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:48,970
Wow.
Well that makes sense.

3535
02:44:48,971 --> 02:44:51,670
It's like the same thing of the reason 
why we have this fear of snakes.

3536
02:44:51,910 --> 02:44:54,180
There's a genetic memory that gets 
passed down,

3537
02:44:54,380 --> 02:44:56,620
but see genessee,
this is where it's really interesting.

3538
02:44:56,621 --> 02:45:00,520
This is considered epigenetics because 
it's not actually in the DNA,

3539
02:45:00,521 --> 02:45:05,521
but it somehow the DNA gets trained by 
the experience and that's passed along,

3540
02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:10,890
but it's in the DNA gets in the dammit.

3541
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,610
Yeah.
See,

3542
02:45:12,611 --> 02:45:14,980
that's the thing about DNA.
We've got all these genes,

3543
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:18,190
but it's not if you just have the gene 
for this or that.

3544
02:45:18,191 --> 02:45:23,191
It's if that gene is triggered.
So there are triggering mechanisms that 

3545
02:45:23,591 --> 02:45:25,840
are,
are more easily shifted.

3546
02:45:25,870 --> 02:45:28,900
Then the genetic content itself.
So it's,

3547
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:30,910
it's you know,
it's like there's a gun,

3548
02:45:30,911 --> 02:45:33,700
but that doesn't mean anyone gets shot 
unless somebody pulls the trigger.

3549
02:45:33,701 --> 02:45:36,550
So the genes are all potentially there,
but some get triggered,

3550
02:45:36,551 --> 02:45:41,551
some don't.
And so what seems to happen in this new 

3551
02:45:41,551 --> 02:45:45,061
field of epigenetics is there they're 
noticing that the experience of an 

3552
02:45:45,061 --> 02:45:48,961
organism somehow affects the expression 
of genes in subsequent generations.

3553
02:45:49,030 --> 02:45:52,120
Sheldrake's morphogenetic field 
addresses this because I don't know that

3554
02:45:52,121 --> 02:45:54,060
he believed that it's a genetic 
transmission,

3555
02:45:54,070 --> 02:45:56,590
but he believes that when a thing 
starts,

3556
02:45:56,591 --> 02:46:01,591
a new behavior or learns a new thing,
it creates this like a shift in the 

3557
02:46:01,591 --> 02:46:02,930
morphic field,
some kind of,

3558
02:46:04,030 --> 02:46:08,610
some kind of field that exists outside 
of like a life and they,

3559
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:09,440
they,
the,

3560
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:09,980
the

3561
02:46:10,180 --> 02:46:15,180
uh,
being like genetically like resonates 

3562
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:18,551
with that field.
And so when there is some behavior 

3563
02:46:18,551 --> 02:46:21,191
pattern,
it gets sort of imprinted or it creates 

3564
02:46:21,191 --> 02:46:21,191
like a,
I can't remember the term,

3565
02:46:21,191 --> 02:46:25,401
he is like a Ronnell.
They have some psychedelic language for 

3566
02:46:25,401 --> 02:46:28,361
it,
but a path in this morphic field that 

3567
02:46:28,361 --> 02:46:31,480
then every other thing like it begins to
resonate with this shift that it's in 

3568
02:46:31,731 --> 02:46:32,720
some invisible.

3569
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:35,180
It's like a raindrop going down the 
window.

3570
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:37,880
You ever see how they form a path and 
then the other ones go into the.

3571
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:38,750
Yeah,
yeah,

3572
02:46:38,751 --> 02:46:39,380
that's it.
Yeah,

3573
02:46:39,381 --> 02:46:40,760
exactly.
That's exactly right.

3574
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:41,990
Way To put it.
Yeah.

3575
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:47,060
Yeah.
You brought up earlier that I was 

3576
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:47,060
skeptical sheldrick.
I'm not skeptical sheldrick.

3577
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:51,221
I'm just not.
I'm not convinced that he's right 

3578
02:46:51,221 --> 02:46:51,440
either.
I'm just open to it,

3579
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:56,620
but I'm skeptical of it because I want 
it to be true and usually stuff that I 

3580
02:46:56,620 --> 02:46:56,620
want to be true.
It's like,

3581
02:46:56,620 --> 02:47:01,150
well,
I don't think he's ever proven anything 

3582
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:01,150
to be true.
Like I think his.

3583
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:02,930
His studies on dogs,
no masters or coming home.

3584
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:07,960
How sketchy or those.
I don't think they've been replicated 

3585
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:07,960
anywhere.
Yeah,

3586
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:10,870
I'm in the same boat as Stanley who you 
met and maybe Dunkin's.

3587
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:14,120
Ketamine is an old friend of sheldrake's
and he's where you are.

3588
02:47:14,121 --> 02:47:15,500
He's like,
I don't know.

3589
02:47:15,501 --> 02:47:16,700
Maybe he's right.
Maybe he's wrong,

3590
02:47:16,701 --> 02:47:19,280
but he hasn't proven anything until he 
proves it.

3591
02:47:19,281 --> 02:47:20,480
You have to.
You have to say,

3592
02:47:20,481 --> 02:47:21,780
hey,
you can't keep writing that.

3593
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:23,420
You know,
you can't keep saying that.

3594
02:47:23,421 --> 02:47:24,830
It's A.
It's a fascinating theory,

3595
02:47:24,831 --> 02:47:28,940
but to say that you've actually proven 
in studies not so much,

3596
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:30,980
you know,
because that would be something like,

3597
02:47:30,981 --> 02:47:33,290
look,
they have proven weird shit man.

3598
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:36,890
They've proven that you can teach a rat 
how to get through a maze in one part of

3599
02:47:36,891 --> 02:47:41,891
the world than a rat in another part of 
the world and get through that maze 

3600
02:47:41,891 --> 02:47:41,891
quicker.
That has been proven.

3601
02:47:41,891 --> 02:47:42,700
That's weird.
That's it.

3602
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:43,820
It is.
That's Rupert sheldrake.

3603
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:49,640
Hundreds a month.
Anything that's bullshit that never 

3604
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:50,120
happened.
Yeah.

3605
02:47:51,070 --> 02:47:56,070
Yeah.
One of my placements for people don't 

3606
02:47:56,070 --> 02:47:56,070
know what it is.
The 100th monkey was a,

3607
02:47:56,070 --> 02:47:56,750
what?
There were two islands.

3608
02:47:56,751 --> 02:47:58,880
There are a bunch of monkeys on the two 
islands.

3609
02:47:58,881 --> 02:48:03,881
They had no contact with each other 
because they couldn't swim across the 

3610
02:48:03,881 --> 02:48:03,881
monkeys.
Don't swim by the way,

3611
02:48:03,881 --> 02:48:08,680
but even if they did,
they couldn't have swum across the gulf 

3612
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:10,010
between the two islands and tourists 
started going to one island,

3613
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:15,760
uh,
and they were both islands and they 

3614
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:15,770
throw potatoes this in Japan,
I believe,

3615
02:48:15,771 --> 02:48:20,771
and they threw potatoes and the monkeys 
on one island learn to use the seawater 

3616
02:48:20,810 --> 02:48:23,270
to wipe off the dirt off the potatoes.

3617
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:28,750
And then that trend that sort of got 
transmitted through all the different 

3618
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:32,501
monkeys on the island.
And when the hundredth monkey learned 

3619
02:48:32,501 --> 02:48:34,410
that trick,
suddenly the monkeys on the other island

3620
02:48:34,411 --> 02:48:35,870
started doing it.
It's horseshit.

3621
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:37,070
It jumped.
It's not true.

3622
02:48:37,230 --> 02:48:39,230
Yeah.
It says it online that it's bullshit.

3623
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:41,420
Actually in wikipedia.
It's also,

3624
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:42,550
um,
uh,

3625
02:48:42,750 --> 02:48:47,750
what they would,
they basically broke down was that the 

3626
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:48,350
claim was that it was an observation of 
these Japanese scientists,

3627
02:48:48,590 --> 02:48:53,590
one of the primary factors and spreading
this claim was that many of the authors 

3628
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,930
quote secondary,
tertiary,

3629
02:48:53,931 --> 02:48:58,931
or post tertiary sources who have 
themselves misrepresented the original 

3630
02:48:58,931 --> 02:49:03,491
observations.
So it's one of those things where it 

3631
02:49:03,491 --> 02:49:05,681
just becomes this app,
like how many times have you ever heard 

3632
02:49:05,681 --> 02:49:05,681
people say that?
Um,

3633
02:49:05,681 --> 02:49:06,890
there's killer's sperm that attack other
people.

3634
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:09,860
Baker and bellis research.
Yeah.

3635
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:11,640
Not really.
No.

3636
02:49:11,790 --> 02:49:14,640
There's no proof whatsoever that sperm 
does anything other than sperm stuff.

3637
02:49:14,670 --> 02:49:16,250
I never heard.
Firms aren't murderers,

3638
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:20,250
sperm attack on other people's parents.
There has never been proven to be true,

3639
02:49:20,370 --> 02:49:23,250
but sperm wars.
But I saw someone on like a science show

3640
02:49:23,251 --> 02:49:25,770
the other day quoting that,
that very thing.

3641
02:49:25,771 --> 02:49:27,360
And people were fascinated like,
wow,

3642
02:49:27,361 --> 02:49:28,140
amazing.
Well,

3643
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:29,040
there.
But there is,

3644
02:49:29,041 --> 02:49:34,041
there is some differentiation in semen.
The first spurt of ejaculate is 

3645
02:49:34,291 --> 02:49:38,220
different from the middle spurt and the 
last bird tastes better.

3646
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:40,920
It's true where the tank comes to fruit 
toast,

3647
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:47,510
pineapple,
but you know,

3648
02:49:47,511 --> 02:49:49,500
you were talking earlier about kill 
other sperm,

3649
02:49:49,501 --> 02:49:50,700
right?
Well,

3650
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:52,210
yeah,
I mean it's,

3651
02:49:52,211 --> 02:49:57,211
it's not that there are sperm that are 
killing other sperm that's not the 

3652
02:49:57,211 --> 02:50:01,651
killer sperm thing and the kamikaze 
sperm and all the baker and bellis went 

3653
02:50:01,651 --> 02:50:04,580
way too far.
In fact they split at that point and the

3654
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:08,910
one of them stopped working with the 
other because the one kept saying,

3655
02:50:08,911 --> 02:50:11,190
you know,
attack sperm and all this,

3656
02:50:11,490 --> 02:50:16,490
but it's true that the first part of the
Jack Hewlett has chemicals that kill 

3657
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:22,040
preexisting sperm and the last spurt of 
the ejaculate has chemicals that protect

3658
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:26,130
your sperm from the next guy's first 
spurt.

3659
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:31,700
So it's like a train,
like the first car on the train attacks 

3660
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:35,931
what's already there.
The last car protects what you're 

3661
02:50:35,931 --> 02:50:35,931
putting there.
Okay.

3662
02:50:35,931 --> 02:50:38,890
So he just basically extrapolated way to
is actually interesting.

3663
02:50:38,910 --> 02:50:39,900
Right,
exactly.

3664
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:44,640
It's interesting is actually head of the
penis design to suction out other dudes.

3665
02:50:44,641 --> 02:50:49,641
Just the plunger that the helmet,
the whole idea of the helmet is the 

3666
02:50:49,720 --> 02:50:54,720
pushrod and pulls back.
All the other guys just squirts in your 

3667
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:58,911
own boys.
Give 'em hell sending your own troop.

3668
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:00,480
It's true.
It's true.

3669
02:51:00,481 --> 02:51:05,481
I mean,
we're obviously designed for multiple 

3670
02:51:05,481 --> 02:51:05,481
meeting.
I mean that's.

3671
02:51:05,481 --> 02:51:05,481
You know,
our testicle swell.

3672
02:51:05,481 --> 02:51:06,960
When there's women around that are 
having sex with more than one.

3673
02:51:06,970 --> 02:51:08,880
The fact that they're outside our 
bodies,

3674
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:13,970
right about.
That's about keeping them cooler than 

3675
02:51:13,970 --> 02:51:14,220
body temperature so that they can be out
rubbing them,

3676
02:51:14,221 --> 02:51:19,221
sucking them a lot of the things that 
would be useless if they're inside your 

3677
02:51:19,471 --> 02:51:19,710
body.

3678
02:51:19,710 --> 02:51:24,710
It's a Yin and Yang.
You take the possibility of getting 

3679
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:26,991
kicked in the balls and you bounce it 
against someone's sucking your balls 

3680
02:51:26,991 --> 02:51:26,991
with a jerk.
You off.

3681
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:31,470
Gorillas have their testicles inside 
their body that's also have a little one

3682
02:51:31,471 --> 02:51:32,880
inch Dick.
Little one inch sticks.

3683
02:51:32,881 --> 02:51:37,881
That's right.
Fucking silly with Ted would not let me 

3684
02:51:37,881 --> 02:51:37,881
show.
I did my ted talk.

3685
02:51:38,470 --> 02:51:43,470
They pulled that I've got in my talk.
I've given all over the place.

3686
02:51:43,531 --> 02:51:48,531
There's the sort of last moment,
the pivot of the whole talk is this 

3687
02:51:49,021 --> 02:51:54,021
slide where I've been showing charts of 
testicle size and penis design and all 

3688
02:51:54,021 --> 02:51:58,821
this stuff,
and then I get to this chart and it's 

3689
02:51:58,821 --> 02:51:58,821
got and the.
Let's see in the upper left hand corner,

3690
02:51:58,821 --> 02:52:03,441
it's got a gorilla lying on his back and
there's no balls and in the upper right 

3691
02:52:03,441 --> 02:52:08,361
hand corner it's got a Banaba whose 
balls are like bigger than chicken eggs 

3692
02:52:08,361 --> 02:52:12,630
and in the middle it's got a friend of 
mine in a hammock wearing a speedo and 

3693
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:17,221
it says gorilla Bonobo,
Italian and my friends completely cool 

3694
02:52:19,331 --> 02:52:24,331
with me using the slide and he says,
he saw I did it in Australia and he saw 

3695
02:52:24,331 --> 02:52:24,810
it online and wrote to me.

3696
02:52:24,810 --> 02:52:26,290
It was really fun.
But anyway.

3697
02:52:26,590 --> 02:52:28,510
Oh,
and I did Ted the last rehearsal,

3698
02:52:28,511 --> 02:52:31,210
the day before I go on,
they said,

3699
02:52:31,650 --> 02:52:33,880
ah,
that one slide.

3700
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:36,220
It's a little creepy and they've already
seen it.

3701
02:52:36,221 --> 02:52:37,960
I've already done it in three 
rehearsals.

3702
02:52:37,961 --> 02:52:40,690
They saw before they even invited me and
they're like,

3703
02:52:40,691 --> 02:52:41,590
well,
yeah.

3704
02:52:41,591 --> 02:52:42,940
It goes,
it's an one.

3705
02:52:42,950 --> 02:52:45,790
One of the people said,
I'm afraid of Italians will be offended.

3706
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:51,070
I'm saying Italians have big balls.
That is not an insult.

3707
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:56,100
You know?
Italians think they're going to be 

3708
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:56,100
offended.
What I said.

3709
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:56,100
I said,
have you ever been to New York?

3710
02:52:56,260 --> 02:53:00,490
It's weirdly probably ride noisy 
motorcycles.

3711
02:53:01,130 --> 02:53:06,130
What do you think?
So would they have like a little skull 

3712
02:53:06,130 --> 02:53:06,650
cap on handlebars?
They hold up like this.

3713
02:53:09,810 --> 02:53:10,750
Sorry.
No,

3714
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:13,060
what's the connection?
I didn't get that because they have tiny

3715
02:53:13,061 --> 02:53:18,061
dicks,
crazy loud motorcycles to compensate or 

3716
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:23,790
they're expensive red sports cars or 
they work out a lot.

3717
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:28,450
One of the other.
Well they definitely work out a lot.

3718
02:53:28,451 --> 02:53:30,210
Look at the size of gorillas.
Yeah,

3719
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:35,230
like they're working out animals ever.
They're the biggest muscled ones and 

3720
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:35,630
they also have the littlest Dick's 
there.

3721
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:37,990
Any incidents?
I don't think so.

3722
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:39,620
Well,
Ted,

3723
02:53:40,830 --> 02:53:45,830
I love the Ted talks.
I think they're endlessly educational 

3724
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:49,401
and fascinating and interesting,
but it's because of the vast amount of 

3725
02:53:49,401 --> 02:53:52,200
interesting people that they've 
collected as an organization.

3726
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:54,090
I've heard a lot of weird shit about 
them.

3727
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:55,410
Your thing is one,

3728
02:53:56,050 --> 02:53:58,790
Eddie,
Eddie Hong was there with the same thing

3729
02:53:58,791 --> 02:54:02,610
with me,
part Graham Hancock horror story,

3730
02:54:02,611 --> 02:54:07,611
so they're not infallible and they're 
also probably growing at a fucking 

3731
02:54:07,611 --> 02:54:08,900
staggering Sarah and Sarah Silverman,
Silverman and other things.

3732
02:54:09,050 --> 02:54:14,050
In fact,
when I did that and they made me take 

3733
02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:14,050
the slide,
I went back room to our backstage to the

3734
02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:14,950
technical guys,
right?

3735
02:54:15,020 --> 02:54:16,400
And one of the guys looked at me.
He said,

3736
02:54:16,430 --> 02:54:20,920
you're getting Silverman,
Dick,

3737
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:23,210
you got Silverman.
That's hilarious.

3738
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:26,430
We've got to end this thing.
Fucking pretty goddamn awesome.

3739
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:28,080
Merry Christmas.
Christmas,

3740
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:30,320
Christmas Hagen

3741

You're going to weed out dummies,

you're gonna.
You're not gonna.

3754
