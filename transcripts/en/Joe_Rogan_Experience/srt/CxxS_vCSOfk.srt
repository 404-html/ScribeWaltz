1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,800
Three. Dus. Oh No,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:08,530
we're live ladies and gentlemen.
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

3
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:10,770
Each other in the eye.
Always look in the eye.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,490
We're drinking because any brown was
not here. Let's be honest. I sorry.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,320
Seven Hashtag chem
trails. Um, so we're here.

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,060
This is a fight companion.

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:24,510
If you've never seen a fight or listened
to either one he listened to or heard

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,620
or watched a fight companion. We watched
the fights. We kind of talk about him,

9
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,720
but most of the time now
this is fake. Conor McGregor.
That's selling video games.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,640
See this guy, listen to
turn this up. Vaught Jamie.

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,460
So you could hear the volume on this. He
looks like Connor's Dad. Listen to this.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,103
Listen to this.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,740
He's too old for this. But what they're
doing here, you're definitely right.

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,230
What they're doing is they're
capitalizing on the fucking,

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,080
the I slash o for she had our hearts.
Right.

16
00:00:56,081 --> 00:01:00,610
And did you see commerce commercial
with John Lovitz? No. No.

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,520
They shot a commercial. Have you
seen it Jamie? And he's like,

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,850
I'm one of those horse things going.
How's this? Can Help me win my fight?

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,650
Jon Lovitz is like,
what's that?

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,530
M a a thing and Kinda like throw
something at him. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,170
Bad idea.
Right to a movie's good.

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,880
19 then we've got a problem. We've got
a problem. Well, he's passed on movies,

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,840
which I think is a very, he's a very
wise man. Very wise. Yes, he is.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,700
You ever have a conversation
with him? Oh yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,840
You guys had him on your show, right? Yup.
Pat Him on the show the whole time. I've,

26
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,440
I've, I've had some meals
with a dude. Very smart guy.
He's not fucking around. No,

27
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:35,921
not at all.

28
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:39,880
And he's been offered and I know from my
age and he's been offered some big time

29
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:43,840
movies, like not this
bullshit. Most fighters do
like legit stuff and he's like,

30
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:46,990
Nah man, I can't right now when
you me talking about triple x,

31
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,300
no return of Zen Shit.

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,270
Yeah. He, I mean, he's a, that
triple x movie looks so bad.

33
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,840
They should show it to prisoners.
They should.

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,380
They should play it over and over again.
Those people in Guantanamo Bay,

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,020
they'll give up isis. Don't give
up everybody. Did you see her?

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,580
No eggs,

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,850
no disease under k Vinci's was a hard
sell for me as it will get in bar fights

38
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:18,490
with sunglasses on and those fucking
movies. Why does he have glasses on?

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,940
Why he's in here? Cause he's awesome.
They did. You see him lip singing.

40
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,030
You like use happy cause the deal came
through and he put on Instagram him lip

41
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:29,500
singing, but he was doing a Beyonce
song. Hey Bro, stop being silly though.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,010
He's opening himself up.
Not, not silly. Oh No.

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,730
You got to have irony when he'd do that.
Must have irony. Didn't have irony.

44
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,580
I got to see it for yourself.
How do you know he didn't have irony?

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,460
I'm feeling that I'm
going to say wonderful.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,480
That's not from tripper.
Lax. I don't find them.

47
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,790
I don't mind them in the first one.
I like that jacket on him.

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,080
That's a dope jacket.

49
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,580
I want to make a jacket out of a Muskox
have the furry part on the inside

50
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,190
that'll keep you warm. Fuck yeah,
it would probably be too warm.

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,860
My dentist almost died of a fraud.
Died

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,510
from cold hunting. Muskox you have a
nutty dentist. It's like a crazy big game.

53
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,190
Hunters almost died.

54
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,480
He was hunting muskox and it was the
coldest winter for them up there.

55
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,070
And he almost died. He and his, uh, guide.
Why the fuck isn't he fixing your teeth?

56
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,110
Well, hey does and then, yeah, and
then he goes and shoots animals.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,730
Yeah. These guys get addicted, man.
They get addicted to chase animals.

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,120
And muskox is a crazy one because you've
got to go up to the frozen north and

59
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,090
when you're up there, man, there
ain't shit up there. I mean there's a,

60
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,850
there's this kind of Tom Miranda.
This is actually a very good fight.

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,260
John Moraga versus Sergio Pettis.
Dangerous fucking fight for pedes.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,520
Morocco who went five rounds with mighty
mouse got onboard maybe four rounds.

63
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,150
You had some pretty bad, he got
beat up, but he rocked mighty mouse.

64
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,230
So the straight left. That's true.
Southpaw fighter Benevidez right? He did.

65
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,290
There's an interesting fight though,
cause Pettis is really young.

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,150
It's a big step, big step up. Um,
but anyway, uh, this Guy Tom Miranda,

67
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,410
he's just got this a show, uh, uh,

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,460
adventure bow hunter and this motherfucker
travels all over the world hunting

69
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,510
things and he went to, uh, thank you. Was
Antarctica? Wherever the fuck must have,

70
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,740
where do they live? Somewhere near the
Arctic circle. The roof of the world.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,650
It's just, it's just nothing.
I mean, there's nothing,

72
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,920
it's white and flat and snow
for as long as the eyes can see.

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,680
And occasionally these animals,
I don't know what the fuck they even eat.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,220
I guess they must like
burrow under the sand. Fine.

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,550
Whatever vegetation they eat
that other than shit. Yes.

76
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,270
They eat the grass underneath the, uh,
Tundra. What do they look like? You look,

77
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,860
that's what they look.
There's Tom Miranda right there.

78
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,350
That's him shooting one of those things.
That's this fucking guy.

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,270
He's wearing a moonshot.
Literally a moon.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,290
He's got aware that's camel up there
as dressing all white. But he, uh,

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,310
oh shit. Shut a polar bear. Polar bear.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,610
Look all the dots around he
killed. He shut up. Polar bear.

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,000
Apparently you talked
to the people in Canada,

84
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,070
and polar bears are a lot more common
in Canada than they would have you

85
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,990
believe.
Where they're not common.

86
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:03,980
Where they're endangered is in areas where
the IFE I shelf is melting Greenland.

87
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,910
Right. But it's, they're
not. It's like grizzly bears.

88
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,420
Grizzly bears used to be in California,
but now they're gone. They died.

89
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,610
The last grizzly bear died in
the 18 hundreds in California,

90
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,060
which is weird because grizzly
bears are state mascot. Correct.

91
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,280
If you look at our state flag,
rather,

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,450
the grizzly bears on the state flat
black beer, I'm the state flag. No, no.

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,400
That'd be a Grizzly, grizzly
bear. And, um, you can, you know,

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,160
you can hunt grizzly bears in Alaska.
There's a lot of them.

95
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,070
So they're extinct here. But
there's a lot of, I'm in Alaska.

96
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,020
That's kind of the same
thing with polar bears.

97
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,010
Like people think that polar bears
are extinct or going extinct.

98
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,210
They're not in Canada.

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,150
And my friends in Canada that
live up there that are hunters,

100
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:47,410
they tell me there's a lot of
polar bears and bear, right? Yeah.

101
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,690
It's a terror, terrifying
bear. Polar bears the most
aggressive. Here's the worst.

102
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,520
They are the shot.
This guy is a different guy.

103
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,300
I shot straight out of the fucking age.
Who's like a star wars animal.

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,070
Right. Well, it's got to deal with those
insane winners and he just dropped that.

105
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,430
They supposed to be delicious too.
It's like one giant Ribeye.

106
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,550
A lot of stat. Yeah.
Okay, so Moraga and Pedis.

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,100
It's four minutes and 15 seconds. Then
has the princess Leia horns. Yeah,

108
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,820
look at it, man. Well, you can see. Yeah.
If you're watching this fight at home,

109
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,570
four minutes, eight, four minutes,
seven minutes, six, four minutes.

110
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:28,520
Five more minutes for us to sync it up.
Um, but uh, these guys that go up there,

111
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,170
you know, you're experiencing
30, 50 below zero. Fuck all that.

112
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,090
Can you schedule me that the first
and never, that was never, ever to,

113
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,040
they do an intense, sometimes God
done, they go out there on snowmobiles.

114
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,410
It's the only way to
travel. Yep. No thanks.

115
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,710
Which is also can't deal with that
cold. That's just crazy. I'm a Raga.

116
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,980
I was always, I always thought he was a
south by, I guess he switched it up a bit.

117
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,050
He was going back and forth quite a bit.
Yeah. This is a lot for pedis. Yeah.

118
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:57,320
He's an experienced guy. He's 10
years old or almost nine years older.

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,420
It's been around.
But you know what,

120
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,360
one of the things that happens with those
guys that had been around you always

121
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,720
got to wonder like, have they decided
they can't be champion anymore? You know,

122
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,970
are they still 100% all in living it,

123
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,650
breathing it or have they reached that
point where they've got a few losses

124
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,850
against top flight competition and the
reality of their bills and their life

125
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,660
sets in and you know, you got to
wonder. I think that's more realistic,

126
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,540
especially with a guy like him who knows.
I don't know where his mindset that,

127
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,560
but you know,

128
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:32,060
he got dominated by Joey Benevidez
and he gets smashed by the champ.

129
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,250
It's kind of like God. Yeah, he had a good
fight with mighty mouse, but my decent,

130
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:40,940
just too goddamn fast did work. But
he did crack mighty mouse ran. He, he,

131
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,960
he probably caught mighty mouse the
hardest in a championship fight.

132
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,010
He caught him flush. So we were
talking about this before the fight.

133
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,830
I still haven't seen it.
Let's see if Jamie can co we get cracked.

134
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,470
Who's got cut current. Sergio, Landon
and a nice right hand there. Um,

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,520
someone landed in Ezekiel choke while
mounted earlier in the card that the

136
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,010
heavyweight first ever a Zeke,
you'll choke in the UFC.

137
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,850
And he did it from the bottom. What
isn't Ezekiel? Ezekiel choke is,

138
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,450
it's mostly done with the gate.
You can do it without the gay,

139
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,990
but this one here all the time.
Yeah.

140
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,670
You grab your sleeve like this here and
then you go like that and wrap it like

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,170
across the guy's neck from the
bottom. Look, this is incredible.

142
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,610
He's essentially doing a rear naked
choke almost god from while mounted.

143
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,250
It's a snaky. Oh yeah. Nasty.
He's got so disappointed with him.

144
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,850
Well he's obviously, it's
on Badass. That's what I'm
saying. Now he was mounted,

145
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,790
he was mounted and he caught
that chuck c one more time.

146
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,230
So going to be the most embarrassing
laws to be the heavyweight on top.

147
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,070
I don't know if it's embarrassing man,
because look,

148
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,270
what the fuck do you do when a guy's
got that on you? Good and poke that out

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,560
by any means necessary.
I don't think he expected it.

150
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:55,890
So he thought he was safe because he was
mounted and he just fucking tapped. Wow.

151
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,720
That's amazing. That's a heavy one of the
year. That's a heavier with 50 fights.

152
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,610
Who? His homeboy. What's his, what's
his name? He's a fucking oldest shit.

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,570
The Boa constrictors 50 fights.
Lexi Russian feller.

154
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,300
Interesting.
Awkward.

155
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,300
Just submitted another heavy way
from the bottom wall mounted.

156
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,580
I wonder if we let them mountain.
I would like to see the whole fight.

157
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,400
I didn't see the fire. That's like his
go to move. I didn't see that either.

158
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,580
My brother texted me, said hey this
headway just submitted guy from mount.

159
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,170
So he always does that.
No,

160
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm saying I wonder if he let him get
him out cause that's like maybe as go to,

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,340
I've got that in Nogi from the
mount from an hour's mounting.

162
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:36,560
So I'm on your on top all the time. Not
all I've, it's rare man. Most against it.

163
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,210
Against a high skilled guides can
be tough. What would the Gooey,

164
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,590
I've got it with a g but would never seen
it without a d to be honest. Oh really?

165
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,870
No. I've got hers done it
to me a couple of times,

166
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,420
but I've never done done it to me.
Wow.

167
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,540
Well they have some long ass arms,
man.

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,430
Long skinny arms are so good for those
kinds of moves. I mean it's on her.

169
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,690
I mean that's for sure.

170
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:02,490
The first Nogi this week you'll choke
in the se even crazier than the guy was

171
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,400
mounted and a heavyweight. Yeah. Crazy.

172
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,290
Oh, cracked. They both
cracked the same time. Damn.

173
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,470
Do pedes looks real good. Yeah,
he does. He looks real good.

174
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,770
Moraga swinging for the fence. Oh, we
tagged him again. Pedis. Tag them again.

175
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,820
Catch him on the forehead. Pettis
was looking slag guy. He really is.

176
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,280
So what do you think of his brother is?

177
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:26,100
I thought it was brothers fighting or
mayor back. Tice him off. Wait, is that,

178
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,160
is that his brother Anthony Pettis?
Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. Oh Man.

179
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,620
That's the end of the first round.
Not knowing the surgery look really good.

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,350
Not In this fight and not in
this car. He's not, but uh,

181
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:37,650
I saw that on Instagram and make
sure that's true. Might not be true.

182
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,690
Might be like at 55
though. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

183
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,220
He's going back up to 55 that's the
right choice, man. Yeah, I think so too.

184
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,280
But I think he's got to put some mass on.
I think he's got,

185
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,770
you know when you're dealing
with these Eddie Alvarez Hofeld,

186
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:53,940
those Anjos type guys that are just
mauling him and just staying close to him

187
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:57,650
like glue. I just physically strong
enough. I think it's a physical thing,

188
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:58,770
but it's also a technique thing.

189
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:02,670
Grappling is just not in his wheelhouse
really when he's gotten better.

190
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,160
I'm not saying that it's,
he's not good at it,

191
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,040
but to the level that he Alvarez
and dos Anjos it's tough.

192
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,970
Although he did submit Benson
Henderson, right? Yup, Yup.

193
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,910
He submitted that government guillotine.
Yeah. There's some slick Jujitsu,

194
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,700
but when it comes down like the grind
Charles or transitions and stuff submitted

195
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:25,050
all too. Yeah, I guess. Slick
Jujitsu. Yeah. Whenever,

196
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,620
whenever he fights a bigger dude who can
grapple typically when he loses. Yeah.

197
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Well these fucking guys, man,
they lose a ton of weight.

198
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,670
They come in big and heavy and strong
and they're better wrestlers then mall

199
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,460
nightmare. Yeah. And he's used to getting
mauled in the gym. You know, he, he's uh,

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,220
Ben.
Any screen with Ascar look at that.

201
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,130
He gets cracked and then he
cracks him back. Oh, amazing.

202
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,890
Wow. Pedis looking slick coming
together. He looks amazing.

203
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,680
One 26 small guys fly waits on God.

204
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,470
Flyweight Sun. There you
go. Thanks buddy. Yeah,

205
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,590
it's a tough division to sell right now.
You know what I mean?

206
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,130
Mighty mouse dominate in the division
and they have that ultimate fighter

207
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,610
episode. Tim Elliot wins
the ultimate fighter fights.

208
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,250
Mighty mouse gives them a hell of a fight.
Hardest fight he's ever had.

209
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,920
And then mighty mouse. I
mean, he essentially says,

210
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,320
I can't ever fight this weight
class again. I gave money
mouse a hell of a fight.

211
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,440
But he goes, but he was,
my body was freezing up,

212
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,970
locking up walls inside the occupied.
Yeah. Wow. He's going up to 35.

213
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,800
So that's one more. And of
course a Linacre, uh, was a,

214
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,630
a big guy at 25.

215
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,210
He goes up to 35 and Tj Dillashaw
just fucking ran a train on God.

216
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,830
That was crazy. Ooh, she's yellow junkie.
How good. Teach straight up train.

217
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,030
Now you've got TJ verse Cody.
That's going to be fun. Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:52,180
That's going to be amazing. That
is a tough fight to call it. Okay,

219
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,770
so here's the fight, right? So the dude's
on top of him and he locks it up. Look,

220
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:00,850
he's got the arm he's holding on it.
It looks like a troll in a posture.

221
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,560
Here he has it set up sort of
almost in the dude mountain.

222
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,980
And then he slides in under the neck.
Look at this. He bathed in winter, I feel.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,100
Yeah, I feel like he did
too. And look at that.

224
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,700
Look at how he's like locking
him in place. Wow. He's,

225
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,240
he's holding on in the mount while
he's getting tapped. It's crazy.

226
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,240
He's using the guy on top is using
the, the uh, the grape vine. Look at,

227
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:26,050
look at how he like, this is pretty
slick. It's pretty slowly. This is hard.

228
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,720
Well, you hold onto your arm
the same as a rear naked choke.

229
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,130
It's like a rear naked choke,

230
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,100
but you're doing it in the front of his
neck instead of the face and the face.

231
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:36,400
So he's grabbing, grabbing his own bicep
there. Get a look at the guy on top.

232
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,370
Look how the guy on top is great. Finding
the legs. There you go. That's like,

233
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,970
it's kind of crazy. Yeah. It's
like he's holding him in position.

234
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,650
He's trying to take,
he set them up and gave a mouse.

235
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,750
You see how he leads his hips to the
way to let them slide in the mouse.

236
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,830
Do that all the time.
Hey,

237
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,810
sliding that veterans shit
to give a heavyweight mount
to choke them out. Crazy.

238
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,310
Crazy. That is fucking crazy. One
more time, Jamie. It's pretty cool.

239
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,173
It's that one more time.

240
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,520
I'd like to know what he's doing
with his hand underneath there. Well,

241
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,320
he's doing like a rear naked choke word.
Karate Chop.

242
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,250
Think of rear naked choke
but were nose to nose. Right.

243
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,620
And he's doing this with his hand.
Okay. You know how I'm old school?

244
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:15,480
Rear naked choke was, see it syncs,
set up, you know, old school room.

245
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,170
Naked choke like Ken shamrock style.

246
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,320
They used to grab the
back of the head like yes,

247
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,250
they would palm the back of
the head and just squeeze it,

248
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:25,000
which kind of can work but not on the
best guys. The best guys. You gotta,

249
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,130
you gotta get the karate
chop in the back of the neck.

250
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,140
That's when you get like vicious leverage.

251
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,110
So he's doing a exactly that same move,

252
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,170
but he's doing it on the front of the
neck and the guy on top had no idea what

253
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:38,410
was going on. Otherwise he would
a hand fight. Yeah man. He's like,

254
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,700
he can a hand fight. The F on the
front, push down on his elbow.

255
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,110
That doesn't even have a
chance to get out of it. Look,

256
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,460
he doesn't even try to get his
hands in between. He's new.

257
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
He doesn't know what's going on.
Yeah.

258
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,710
He doesn't know what's going on and all
of a sudden he's getting past amazing.

259
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,070
How's amazing.

260
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,490
It's really get surprised.
Right? Something in the
rare, well think about it.

261
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:58,610
There's only one ever, uh,
Zeke you'll choke. That's it.

262
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,970
And it's from while the guy was
mounting him, which is crazy.

263
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,160
There's only one ever, um, Omoplata that's
Ben Saunders. There's also on this card.

264
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:11,120
Correct. Only ever Omoplata in the UFC,
which is crazy because I have to pull off,

265
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,350
but it happens all the time in the
gym, man. It's tough to pull off.

266
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,960
You know what it is man. Guys usually
rollover they position says submission.

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,090
Yeah. Cause you chance to finish it.
Especially with a really tough guy. Yeah.

268
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,830
Especially if they'll shoulder mobility.

269
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,240
But you've seen how immune Ari finishes
it, right. That I'm amazed that that,

270
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,170
that hasn't been in the UFC because that
is such a good technique because you

271
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:37,220
can get that position because a lot of
times guys will give you like that rubber

272
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,570
guard and mission control position.

273
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,970
Then all you have to do is clear
the neck at that foot across.

274
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,900
Then once you have that foot across and
you just start to set up the Omoplata as

275
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,580
the guys defending the Omoplata,

276
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:51,140
usually they expose their neck because
they're so concentrating on defending the

277
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,080
Omoplata. Have you seen how
Mackenzie dern sets it up yet?

278
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,750
Did you see her last fight? Yes.
Amazing. And she's a diabetes time piece.

279
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:02,300
What is going on in the world?
Jamie pull up Mackenzie dern submission.

280
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,010
A lot of people were saying it's
like submission of the year.

281
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,150
She's a real elite Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu black belt and she's a mega ton.

282
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:13,151
Diaz has daughter and she's adored peers
and she sets up this Alma Plata and

283
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:18,500
then moves from the Alma
Plata to a choke from the bow.

284
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,760
So she has the Omoplata she gets, she
reaches up and grabs the ways she does,

285
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,180
but she rolls and she winds up like
on her back choking the girl from a

286
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,450
Honeywell's unchecked look. It's
beautiful. She's so good. You know it's,

287
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,230
it's so interesting to see like
super high level Jujitsu. Like,

288
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,550
look how she pins down the neck. She goes
with a high guard and she's using the,

289
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:38,720
it's not like rubber guard style.

290
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,760
She's doing it different and she's
setting up the Omoplata. Okay,

291
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:44,120
so she avoids that leg. So that's the
big issue as far as defense is right.

292
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,290
You can't let them roll. Right. So she
sits up, she gets her butt out. Right.

293
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,410
And so the girl keeps trying to do it
and she won't let her. So, but now,

294
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,190
once she gets this position, watch
how she rolls. She rolls on her shoes.

295
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,160
So she pulls her on her back. So look,
look at her. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,140
She sneaks that left arm under the chin.

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,880
Beautiful technique band because
she can't defend with that arm.

298
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,800
The arm up there. It looks, she gives
you the butterfly and the left leg too.

299
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,780
So nasty. Crazy. That's so
nasty. That's so beautiful.

300
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,190
It's so high level. So high level.
And it looks, the way she sets it up.

301
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:22,280
It's so cool too because she
rolls onto her back to like,

302
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,100
you rarely see anyone do this.
Like watch how she does this.

303
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,850
She rolls under her back and pulls her
on top of her. And that girl is like,

304
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,000
what in the fuck is happening?
She's still

305
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,260
holding on the, on the whole key. Bj used
to do it when he would take guys backs.

306
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,290
Bj has had incredible legs.
He would tie up the arms.

307
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,750
So he's up and he's an
octopus. Yes. And so he can uh,

308
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,320
he could defend against the uh,

309
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,260
or he gets stopped the defense with that
leg while she's doing that kind of same

310
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,600
thing.
But she's doing it from an,

311
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,650
I'm a puzzle that we got that
girl's arm is locked the front out.

312
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:58,020
So off that girl,

313
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,170
you know when zebras get attacked by
lions or just that sheer terror on their

314
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:04,950
face, like that girl, she
had no idea what was gone.

315
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,300
Her arm is wrapped up tight.

316
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:11,220
And then on top of that she's using her
butterfly to, to trap the leg. Like, look,

317
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,370
she wraps on left leg over and then she
goes with the butterfly and the left

318
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,960
side. See how she's doing that. God Damn,
that's so much control. So much control.

319
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,920
And English is who gives a fuck.
I am trying to mark it here.

320
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,540
You can talk to her
through one of the maps.

321
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,910
I'm gonna sliding them to
the ends with Portuguese.

322
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:31,110
Just broken Portuguese ese with us.
There's apps that um, it's like,

323
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,680
I think it's called Google Lens of
you. A world blends. I've used it.

324
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,120
It's really cool when
you're in another country,

325
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,740
you hold it up to a sign and it translates
assigned to English. Really? Yeah. Wow.

326
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,300
That's amazing.
Dude.

327
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,900
When I was in Italy I would just hold
it up to signs and it would translate

328
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:48,840
everything into English. So cool.
It's incredible. It's incredible.

329
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:52,710
I mean real time to real time.
No delay. Yeah, it's amazing.

330
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,860
I mean it's a little broken like cause
the translations off the way they use

331
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:59,790
their pronouns in note with your phone.
Yeah. You just hold your phone up. God,

332
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,770
it's so cool. It's crazy.
Fuck a tour guide. No Man.

333
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,360
And apparently they're getting so close
to having something that sits in your

334
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,120
ear. Like when you go on
tour or if you go somewhere,

335
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,350
something that sits in your ear and then
translates what they're saying to you

336
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,530
in real time in your ear.
So we don't need to learn anything.

337
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,320
I don't need to learn shit.
I thank God.

338
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,760
Look at this in ear device that translate
foreign languages in realtime as

339
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,360
stories. Dough. What does this call Jamie?
That's amazing. And your translator?

340
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,480
There's a lot of them. So
many people. There's a jobs,

341
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,420
people losing jobs.
I don't know how good they work,

342
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:36,810
but they're readily available.
So it's already,

343
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,930
you can preorder it. So
maybe it's not, sorry.

344
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,830
Sergio looking for the choke Mirages
all over and we're barely pan pedes.

345
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,950
Got a huge contusion on the inside
of his leg. What are dollars?

346
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,340
I'm fucking in crazy.
That was probably worth,

347
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,860
that'd be $200,000 five years ago.
What's that?

348
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,990
Is it 4,000 oh funds.
Oh 4 million raised. Oh,

349
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:01,290
so it's like a Kickstarter.
Indiegogo flopped out. I'm not.

350
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,660
I want the second generation.
You don't want that first one.

351
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,740
Nobody get you in trouble. Get you in
big trouble. Trouble in South America.

352
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,110
You might talk some shit accidentally
lead you to a whorehouse.

353
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,640
So confused Rog on toughie
figures or rock on top here.

354
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,160
So aggressive

355
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,170
or house email. I don't know. We're
down South American of course.

356
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,020
I'll see you guys. Never been
for God sakes. I hear it. Yeah.

357
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,220
That's legal down there.
If it's legal, it's not.

358
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,870
How about Padis people love to
go to South America to surf. Yes.

359
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,950
Oh look, it's Morocco. Drop it now
for a leg lock holds on. Hold on.

360
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,990
You know what man, this is
changing. Nogi Changing Nogi his

361
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,770
leg locks.
It is a transforming Nogi.

362
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,730
It is all and it's just a matter of
time before these Gary Tone and type

363
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:59,020
characters. He's Eddie Cummings
start getting into MMA.

364
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,120
Guys help tonight. The massing
health, he's a master with leg. He is,

365
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,200
but he's fighting Lozan and
Joe Lowe's on it is a very,

366
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:12,880
very good grappler and certainly good
enough to defend and keep that guy off.

367
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,151
I'm so,

368
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,330
it's going to be real interesting to see
whether or not Marcin can get it to the

369
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:19,390
ground and whether Lozan is
up on all the latest shit.

370
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,140
I hope it goes to the ground. It could
be my relief to those hands. No joke man.

371
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,630
His ground game is super fast too.

372
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,190
He dives on Great Kansas
leg likes changing. No Gate.

373
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,980
Well there's a whole,
there's a whole trans,

374
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,130
a whole a path that took place and one
of the big parts of it was dean lister.

375
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,870
Dean lister was like one of the original
leg lock guys in America and super high

376
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:47,080
level black belt. You know Abu Dhabi
champion. I mean Dean lister is a beast.

377
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,700
Not a stick. A human being is
sticky. Yes. You know, and he's,

378
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,230
you know, he hasn't had the success
lately that he had when he was younger,

379
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,640
but make no mistake about it.
His knowledge of grappling,
super, super high level.

380
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,080
Well he went down to hens.

381
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:05,110
Those who the fuck was fighting that he
went down to hand those to help somebody

382
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:08,980
out. How long ago was, this
was a while ago. A goddamn it,

383
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,530
why don't I know the fucking anyway,

384
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,720
point point being he helps them guys
down at hens o's and showed them some of

385
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,960
his leg lock stuff and uh,

386
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,620
that started with this John,
Donna,

387
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:27,190
her John Danaher who's essentially
one of the smartest guys in Jujitsu.

388
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,200
It might be another prophet. He's
a fucking Silvant, the savant.

389
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,470
He's got a fucking awesome Instagram post
today I think or maybe yesterday about

390
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,590
using the legs while grappling and how
important it is to learn how to use your

391
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:43,450
legs and how much more strength you have,

392
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,950
any legs and Durrance
you're having your legs.

393
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:49,840
And if you get used to using your legs
a lot in grappling how much quicker you

394
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,780
can progress you use
Bj Penn as an example,

395
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:56,160
is also the same guy that will rock an
under Armour fit shirt with jeans at the

396
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,950
rash guard.
Oh,

397
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,490
John John's always in a rash
card. He said, no matter what,

398
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,980
he's an animal does not give a fuck.

399
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,210
And he has like rules like that he'll give
you as to when you should get married.

400
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:14,550
And they're basically never, but he goes
over, all the students were like, yeah,

401
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:19,540
if you're over 50 and she's under 25
and like she's worth millions of dollars

402
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,140
and she makes it so you don't have to
work. And she brings in other women.

403
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,460
She breaks crazy. He's got, he's got a
great sense of humor. He's always calm.

404
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
He's always joking. Like, you know,

405
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:33,590
he's got his phd in
philosophy from [inaudible].

406
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,610
We get started ladies, you know,
I've done it. Her got started. No,

407
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,960
but I was there when John was, you know,
when I was hence us for the year I was,

408
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,700
I'd see John Literally every day.

409
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:47,090
John was a bouncer and he
was a big fucking lifter dude
once, right? That's right.

410
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,211
Yeah.

411
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:50,570
And he wanted to learn how to do martial
arts to protect himself because he's at

412
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,370
work. So he starts doing Jujitsu and
goes, oh look, I found my life's work.

413
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,140
Yes. And then he gets super into, it,

414
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:00,650
becomes a black belt and not just like
one of the most respected black belts,

415
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,930
but starts coaching and teaching people.

416
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,170
Apparently he's got like some
bad joints, man. Like real bad,

417
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,130
like he's got a bad hip and he had
it replaced and he's got a bag.

418
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,300
It's got a bad knee, but he, I think the
need is a genetic defect. There is just,

419
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,800
he's so funny fucking genius guy when it
comes to [inaudible] tied to the Donna,

420
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,760
her death squad,

421
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,190
all those guys that he's got in New
York out of hens owes like Gary, Tony,

422
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,330
like Eddie Commons, all these super
high level leg lock attack guys went,

423
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:28,731
by the way,

424
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:33,170
Gary Tobin's having a submission grappling
match against Hector motherfucking

425
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:38,000
lumbar. What? Yeah, I think
it's flo grappling flow.

426
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,990
Is that what I'm about? See if you could
find that Sony and stuff. I don't know.

427
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't know. It might be, I hope it is.

428
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,450
I hope for children it is because that's
an awesome match up, so that's a great,

429
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,970
and he just got done fighting Tacchino
you know he fought who some are.

430
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,760
Paul highrise went to a draw
with him and Paul Harris was

431
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,230
like Jacqueline Lane, one of those
late night commercials on like Fridays.

432
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,950
Look at that. Okay. What is it? Oh
my gosh. Jeff Glover in this too.

433
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,180
What? Who's Jeff Glover having an
event with submission underground. Oh,

434
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:11,440
submission. Underground. Okay. Is this
chill Sundance thing? I feel like it.

435
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,890
It feels like it is too. Who's
that giant guy? That's Hector.

436
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,930
Hector lumbar. I was going to say,
yeah, the pegs are lumbar. Does.

437
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,700
Is he suspended for a while?
Yeah, Dude. He was in some sweats.

438
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,600
I thought they were spray
painted on when I saw him.

439
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:30,210
Remember that he had the last time.

440
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,480
Sergio Pettis by decision. Best ads I've
ever seen. She scroll up a little there.

441
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,600
Why? What does this Dylan, Dennis
clovers. Chaz mess right here.

442
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,050
What's going on here? Jon Jones. Jon
Jones is taking on Dylan. Dennis.

443
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,770
It's a fan poster,
so I don't know Jesus.

444
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,370
That's boss logic that artists
and I'd be the best in the world.

445
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,220
You've seen his posters he made, he's the
one it, there's all those crazy posters.

446
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:56,690
Dope, dope posters. Jacobs. Is he the one
that did Conor McGregor in an MMA glove?

447
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,520
Punching Floyd and the mount?
Correct.

448
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,610
Here's The New York one with all
the dope stuff. Let me tell you,

449
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,250
here's where I'm kind of a kegger can win.

450
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,350
Here's where Conor McGregor
can win MMA gloves.

451
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,680
Let's have a boxing match with MSA group.

452
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,490
I don't think you need to do that if
Floyd's ha boys had some serious problems

453
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,900
in the past with his hands.
Correct.

454
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,270
And he uses those big ass
pillow gloves because of it.

455
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,330
And he's been known to not really sit
down and he's punching just picks guys

456
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:23,540
apart. He no doubt about it.
Floyd is a masterful boxer,

457
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,560
but that's a big transition for
him to fighting with small gloves.

458
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:31,280
He's never going to go big
is the transition is for
Connor to fight with bigger

459
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,490
gloves. Right. They're
going to do boxing. But I,

460
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,770
I honestly think with how common
moves, it's, don't get me wrong.

461
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,610
Floyd's one of the best of all time,
if not the best,

462
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,520
but it's a lot for him to adapt to.
Connor's big. He, it's fucking hard.

463
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,550
He can go both ways. We'll
see. Yeah, we'll see.

464
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,970
I want to see what all of the
worst he's going to happen. Oh,

465
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:55,971
is he the one who did the fucking Joey
Diaz and me fucking caliber beam has got

466
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:01,290
them Joe Chili with his gum for
bringing him back.

467
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,300
Oh, he's fine. Out of his mouth. Uh,
he's an animal kind of really fight.

468
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:09,330
That's not going to happen. That fight.
Hey Dude, it's a lot of fucking money.

469
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,193
Here's the deal.

470
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,130
14 with this landscape of view made
300,000 by Dana had a real good point.

471
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,060
He goes, Connor's last two paper
views where 1.3 million, 1.5 million,

472
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:23,061
he goes Floyd's was 300,000 and it's a
great point and Floyd's asking for 500

473
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,860
million or 400 million, rather. He goes,
you're out of your fucking mind. He goes,

474
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:28,380
here's a real deal.
I'll give you 25 million.

475
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,470
I'll give Connor 25 billion and then
we'll talk about pay per view after you've

476
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:36,471
written them a thousand from Reebok's
4,000 it's a not a championship fight,

477
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:40,640
but it's a main event. But Oh
look at this. Boom. Hey Be,

478
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,910
this is why it's getting serious.

479
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,360
Cause Dana addresses it made
an offer on national TV.

480
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,300
Floyd was on showtime
last night and they go,

481
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,570
is there any boxer that could bring
you out of retirement? He goes, nope.

482
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,930
The only fight that would get me out of
retirement is Conor Mcgregor's the only

483
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:57,840
fight I want. He knows there's
so much money in that fight.

484
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,370
Conor McGregor is a God damn
fucking happened. But see,

485
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:05,850
the thing is that's a fight that would
transcend into the total casual person

486
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,370
the same way the Ronda Rousey fight to do,

487
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,230
but this soul dump on my concrete million.

488
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,170
This might be like 3 million because it
might be like such a freak show. Three,

489
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,450
four mil?
I think so.

490
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,700
What's that most never be Andrew,
what would you say?

491
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,400
Like the biggest paper you fight ever?
Like what was the number?

492
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,560
Number one of all time. How awesome
is that the biggest of all time,

493
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,920
isn't it? We get red bull before we
look at the numbers. Let's guess.

494
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,820
I'm going to say 2.5 is that
the biggest helper? I'm say

495
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,770
I'm saying almost three two point it
is for that fight. It is for Pacquiao.

496
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,860
Mayweather. It's you're, you're off
on the numbers. What's the number?

497
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,430
I think it's five right? 4.6 mil. Oh,
that's what I'm saying. Common them,

498
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,951
but damn,

499
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:56,430
how much might it may where mother
making that fight revenue of 400 million.

500
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:01,230
Oh my Jesus. So he probably made at
least a hundred plus mom that didn't,

501
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:06,231
they say made 150 160 million and pack
out made like 80 or a hundred but him and

502
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,420
Connor, you're getting,
even if you hate Connor,

503
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,060
you're still getting all those
MMA fans cause he represents us.

504
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,520
Even if you hate Floyd again,
all those boxes and fans,

505
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,430
even if you hate Floyd and then
the two worlds just go good.

506
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,930
Do you think that he can, that they can
make it up to that level that you think,

507
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,800
wow,
I want to know why.

508
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,080
I want to know why Conor or
how Connor isn't concerned.

509
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:30,570
He'll get knocked out in the first round.
Nothing to lose.

510
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,330
He won't get knocked out
in the first round. No,

511
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,320
you won't get knocked down the first time.
It doesn't work that way.

512
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,183
As it bought you mean you,

513
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,610
you can protect yourself against even
somebody that could cause very high level

514
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,130
and quick and,
and also Mayweather doesn't hit that hard.

515
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,530
Con is a lot bigger,
right?

516
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,910
Connor moves different than
a lot of boxers do because
he's so used to leg kicks.

517
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:53,080
He's still used to take downs and he has
a different stance. That alone will be,

518
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,840
we'll take a little bit of time
for me where the, to adjust to,

519
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,560
but may where there has the ability to
be in the right place at the right time

520
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,390
always.
And so deceptive.

521
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,570
It's so deceptive because it doesn't
look like he's doing anything special.

522
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,040
But if you watch the way he's moving,

523
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,370
he's never had a position
and he's always popping.

524
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,790
You went to that jab and he still,

525
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:14,791
even at 37 38 39 or might
be 40 lightning fast.

526
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,210
Especially lately though, he doesn't
take advantage of getting out of the way.

527
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,160
He's kind of,
he's winning rounds with the Jab.

528
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,320
They dicon and dodging get out of
the way. Um, I just don't got it.

529
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,410
I think for comma though,
man, it's a win win for you.

530
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,590
Imagine if Connor lands the left hand.

531
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:37,110
I'm saying it ain't gonna Happen,
man.

532
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,890
Listen, Connor fought. I mean, rather,
I'm Floyd fought Ricardo, my Oregon.

533
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,460
Yeah and no, not ricotta. My [inaudible]
you're thinking of Madonna, Madonna.

534
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,840
Mark was my Donna, right. And my Donna
connected at the end of one of the rounds.

535
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,570
He connected with a big fucking right man.
And they had him,

536
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,000
had him sit down for a second.
Yeah. Did he hit? He's a marsh.

537
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,190
Excuse me. He felt like he still, he's
really hot on one shoulder. You know,

538
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,900
there's really no, no, no.
There's a really only once,
but it was the first fight.

539
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:09,490
The second fight, Floyd boxes,
Jane. And we'll see it here. See?

540
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,550
And my Donna is murderous puncher just,

541
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,940
and he would throw those crazy chocolate,
Dell style overhand rights.

542
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,710
So he's all over Floyd here. And at
the end was one of the rounds. Amazing.

543
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,360
But listen, this guy is way smaller
than Conor. Let's think of this.

544
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,950
We're talking about a guy here
that's fighting one 47 one 54 Connor,

545
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:33,850
although he's made it down to one 45 he's
physically much larger than this guy.

546
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,020
Connor was walking around.
Am I love that you guys aren't gonna.

547
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,790
He won't put a glove on him and, and
he will not hit him. And I think floor,

548
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:44,470
it's going to do whatever you want.
You want to bet every lance one?

549
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:48,190
Sean, you pay none of them
off. It's very strange, Connor.

550
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:52,060
He always loses to say Conor McGregor
is, he won't stand a shot. Now,

551
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,940
can you pour me some one?
Not at night.

552
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:55,960
He's starting something that
Atlanta clean. I went to me and Joe.

553
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,800
No pouring some more. Well, what I do
know is that great fighters have the,

554
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:02,310
haven't done it, haven't we? A, I mean, I
know that he may have no doubt. No doubt.

555
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:07,140
He Pat cow look clumsy. I know that.
So can have one arm. I know that. Yeah,

556
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,370
let's look at this. He's done
it to everybody. Oh, see my dot.

557
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:12,290
I clipped him there with a left
or right uppercut rather. But,

558
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,300
but at the end of it, one of them,
oh dude, it's beautiful box that box.

559
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:17,471
Hey man,

560
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,550
you don't get to be 49 in [inaudible]
without being fucking sensation now.

561
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,920
Just don't, he's the best defensive boxer
of all time. Right? Yeah, I would say.

562
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,890
I would say so. I mean, you know,
pronounced when I was her boss,

563
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,820
Pernell Whitaker lost
later on in his career.

564
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,130
He wasn't able to sustain it as
long as Mayweather has. So what may,

565
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,330
where there's been able to do is sustain
it better than anybody and also keep

566
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,940
improving.
Can mean like when he fought Canelo he,

567
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,850
a lot of people thought Canelo was
going to give him a hard time and young

568
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:47,600
Canelo he's too big for him. Fuck
Canelo up. Okay, look at this.

569
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,890
They're having the ultimate fighter.

570
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:53,660
Haven't Cody and DJ and Tj to coach each
other on the ultimate fighter or the

571
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:57,230
coach that's going to be amazed how much
shit talking is gone and it's going to

572
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:02,231
be team Alpha male versus TJ through the
psychological damage he could take from

573
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:06,920
then and counter. I guess Cody has a
tape of him knocking out Tj and practice.

574
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,860
The other is he keeps saying he wouldn't
be saying it unless it was real.

575
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:10,760
I definitely has it.

576
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,000
Not that that really matters
cause it's practicing and it does.

577
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,860
I mean it's kind of does the day.
Yeah.

578
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:23,310
I mean listen man,
I'm,

579
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:28,190
I'm a huge Floyd Mayweather fan of him
like skill wise as a boxer and I think

580
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:32,420
that he made it through prize fighting
better than anybody ever and that's right.

581
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,640
And he takes top ranked fighters.

582
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:39,640
I mean the best in the world
who are boxers and does
anything he wants and never

583
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:43,670
seen anything like it. Gentleman, he's,
he hasn't fun. Two years and he's 40 now.

584
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,380
He's food shop. I don't
care. I don't care.

585
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,370
Well both right. You're both right. You're
both right. You know, I mean that's what,

586
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,940
what makes it so intriguing. He is 40
look, if he was in his prime and a,

587
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,010
it's not a conversation, it's not
really a conversation and you know,

588
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,970
Connor would most likely get boxed
up. It's just a different thing, man.

589
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,030
The what may, where they can do with
his movement like right there. Oh,

590
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,060
look at that pop up.
I mean it's just a difference in language,

591
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,450
but you know what man?

592
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,430
Look what Joe Smith Junior did to Bernard
Hopkins and Bernard Hopkins was like

593
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,960
the untouchable man forever. Now granted
you're dealing with 11 years old.

594
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,920
He's 51 52 father time.
Like Brendan was saying five times.

595
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,110
It's nice to just go hit this,
tap you on the shoulder and just go.

596
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,390
It's time now when you get knocked out.

597
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,940
Undefeated five time is a motherfucker
and he just waits for now.

598
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,510
I think within our lifetime we're gonna
see father time start to take some else.

599
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,660
Technology takes out.
Father, time to thank Doug.

600
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,900
I think what's going to happen is do
you know that there's a startup now that

601
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:49,430
will fill your body with the blood of
young people like a Goddamn vampire? What?

602
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,690
Give me some of that.

603
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,900
New Research has shown that if you take
old blood from mice and put it in young

604
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:00,620
mice, they slow down and get
tired and they get sicker.

605
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,190
But if you take young blood from
young mice and put it in old mice,

606
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:07,400
they literally go back in time. They
reversed. They get cost through.

607
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:11,120
They have more energy, more better stone
in their bodies. Not just that too.

608
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,540
Not just that like,
yeah,

609
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,050
the age of the blood itself
changes up the mold ass cell.

610
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,070
Hey Bro,
Jamie,

611
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:24,810
eighty thousand eighty thousand eighty
thousand bucks, they start them.

612
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:28,370
Cancel your veins with the blood of
young people. Jamie, book an appointment.

613
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,150
The dude's going in. No, we could
just put a post on Instagram.

614
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:36,650
We get some young broths in La and just
just drain them a hundred bucks for

615
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,420
their blood.
You want a guys blood?

616
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,070
Why did you say that? Doesn't matter.
Like you wouldn't make it the blood.

617
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,740
Seriously though.
Look like sugar hood Bro.

618
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,250
[inaudible] checking blood.
Let's see. Think about that.

619
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,800
They check your blood and they find all
these different things in your blood,

620
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,990
right? They could find steroids in your
blood. They find drugs in your blood.

621
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,170
They also find like what your testosterone
levels are and all sorts of different

622
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,190
hormone levels.
Well,

623
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,120
if that's the case then that means the
blood must vary in its potency and very,

624
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:10,200
and it's what you would do is you hire
someone to live a monastic life of

625
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:15,201
nothing but grass fed Muskox Broccoli
and Rockley and fucking asparagus and

626
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,730
shit. You feed this guy like all
the best supplements and get,

627
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:25,290
get him like super like kid is hormones
just perfect. And Jen, James Brown's no,

628
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,980
you drain them. You take his blood,
you're pumping in to you, you pay him,

629
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,720
you pay him to give up a
gallon of that blood. Yeah.

630
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,600
How much blood is a person keep
on them at any given time, right.

631
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,790
Is that what it is?
Cause you can only donate what,

632
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,230
two or three before you
get all lightheaded.

633
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,950
Have freaking Oj and Shannon
or two maybe one. One.

634
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,290
So if these people are
giving up their blood,

635
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,710
I mean are you getting the blood from
like one guy and then another guy is a

636
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:53,340
fucking don't gamble all day.

637
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,360
Fake Conor McGregor guy again in this app.
God Damn.

638
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,930
Selling video games for the haircut
against, with a Mohawk. Hey,

639
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:04,890
this has to be an la or fucking or
it's like in some dark part of Germany,

640
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,680
San Fran. It's a Monterey.
Oh, the start up there.

641
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:15,330
The first week of fucking shady
book it doctors we're doing,

642
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,600
we're doing cobb's. Hold on. Say that
again. Doctor used to be an Olympic rower.

643
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,560
Yeah. The girl that's running up to
trial, that doesn't mean it a trial.

644
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,920
Do they have any results so far? Have they
done it? Young Plasma. Clinical Child.

645
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:30,200
They're going to post results as they get,
I don't want to be a Guinea pig. Yeah,

646
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,360
I need some legit shit.
We're doing that. Well,

647
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,310
I'm going to do that and then have that
translate in my ear like an asshole.

648
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,610
Jeez. I would normally say there's gotta
be, don't you in the microphone, Brian?

649
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:42,510
Jesus fucking Christ.

650
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,160
I would normally say that there's
probably got to be something to it,

651
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,410
but on the heels of that [inaudible]
thing, do you know about Toronto's?

652
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,810
You don't know about that.
Oh my God.

653
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,070
The says is one of the most fascinating
technology stories of the last year.

654
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,220
Toronto's was this huge startup that was,

655
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,570
they were working with Walgreens and
they had these contracts I think with,

656
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,350
I want to say with Costco too, I don't
know who it was, but there was this woman,

657
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:14,580
she was the, the the biggest
self made billionaire ever.

658
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,230
She was worth at one point in time,

659
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:19,050
some like $30 billion or
something fucking crazy.

660
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,880
She was the female Steve Jobs and she
would dress like Steve jobs down to the

661
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,500
turtleneck sweater.

662
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,100
The whole deal shit worse than that.

663
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,610
It was all fraud.
Her company was bullshit.

664
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,250
The results were like 65% accurate
and they were trying to pass

665
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,250
it off as being like in the high nineties
they hid results is a blood test.

666
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,500
All they would have to do is
take a prick of your blood.

667
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,920
They take a prick of your blood and then
with that blood they can test you for a

668
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:49,120
variety of different diseases.

669
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,480
So people were making critical
health decisions based on this,

670
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,960
this blood test that they had,
proof wasn't working correctly.

671
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,990
So one of the people
that worked at Serrano's,

672
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,880
Toronto's rather became a whistle blower.

673
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,300
She went from being worth billions
of dollars to being worth zero.

674
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
And now there's like no,
because,

675
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,790
because the government stopped
them from doing these tests.

676
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,580
She's getting suits or the ass for
sure she has money in the bank.

677
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:15,010
But that's and go well there's no
money anymore. There's no money.

678
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,440
Like she shouldn't have personal money,
doesn't have stock.

679
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,160
Cause he understands she's worth knew.
It was stalled. God. Not only that,

680
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,240
like hundreds of millions of dollars
in loss. I got a good bullshit.

681
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,630
Let me just explain what's happening.

682
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,860
So what happened was everybody bought
this package of who this person was,

683
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,720
this female Steve jobs and they wanted
to buy into, it's so hard, you know,

684
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:38,800
and it became a marketing thing. She was
wearing black turtlenecks, man. God Damn,

685
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,380
she was literally doing the Steve
Jobs. Look, I will kick the,

686
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,770
he said she a white new balances.
Here's where it all came down to.

687
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:49,771
It all came down to one really fucking
clunky sentence that she said when she

688
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,930
was trying to explain what,
what went wrong.

689
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,360
See if you pull up the
wired magazine article.

690
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,790
She said something and
what she said was like,

691
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,950
they explained like how it
works and she goes, well,

692
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,630
it's a chemistry that takes place and
like use like incorrect terminology.

693
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,610
And so a writer started digging in.

694
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,820
I realized she didn't know
what she was talking about.

695
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,730
I saw a speech that she gave at
this women's conference thing,

696
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:16,090
like in this women's empowerment thing.
And when I was watching her talking like,

697
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,740
God,
her thoughts are so cluttered.

698
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,580
It's like she didn't know she was going
to give a speech and she's given this

699
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:23,740
speech. By the way, this is a fight
as a good fight for two reasons. One,

700
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,010
because Ben Saunders is
fucking wicked on the ground,

701
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:31,870
especially off of his back and to cause
court McGee has incredible stamina.

702
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,670
I mean incredible. He works out at,
um, yeah. And he's at the pit elevated,

703
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:39,010
which is up there in Utah,
high elevation.

704
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:42,130
And the fucking guy is just
relentless with his cardio.

705
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,170
It's like either he's been, it's been,
it's taken a little time off. So Ben,

706
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Ben has had more problems with his stamina
and hope he's corrected that because

707
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:55,090
I think Ben's nasty to the potty.
He is.

708
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:58,240
He's very nasty with knees and
he's super good off of his back.

709
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,930
Like one of the best guys off
of his pieces. Long too, man.

710
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,220
He's got those mountains. You see the
um, the statement Jamie, exact statement.

711
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:08,490
There's an order. First of all,
I came out of the huge ones,

712
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,180
70 hours started at all the whole problem
and then they followed that article.

713
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,370
Oh. If you buy anything from a
lady dressed as a fake Steve jobs,

714
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:22,680
you're flucht already. You can
go would walk in like, Oh shit.

715
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,940
She's dressed like Steve jobs
to see what's the headline?

716
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,260
Pull up the headline of this article so
I could see if that's the right one. No,

717
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:34,220
go to the top. Go to the top.
Everything. No, that's not it.

718
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,830
Let's find during, get her blood. No,

719
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:40,830
her blood filled with debt
fucked. Yeah, she's fun activity.

720
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,100
Hey, think about that phone call when
they called her that she was, they,

721
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,380
it's all out Wall Street Journal did an
article about it exposing it and then

722
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,020
Vanity Fair did an article exposing.
Do you get your news from bro?

723
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,040
That's what she should've said.
Fake News Shit. Hold up. Hung Up.

724
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,900
I already bravo. You see Trump said
that to CNN? He wouldn't answer.

725
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:04,170
CNA said you're fake news in front of
them in front of him. It's like no,

726
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,150
no answering fake news so bad for CNN.
N You know what?

727
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:12,800
In this case he's right. They, they
talked about unsubstantiated reports.

728
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,550
I mean they basically were
spreading propaganda for
whoever the fuck invented it.

729
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:20,840
Whether it's a troll or
whether it's a relation. Yeah,

730
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,510
not good. Not Good. You know,
and try to a really good point.

731
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,890
I kind of liked that. He had a
really good point too. He's like,

732
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,570
everybody knows I'm a Germaphobe.
He goes,

733
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,970
I'm not hiring people to
pee on me or pee on anybody.

734
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:34,490
Like without fuck are you talking
about? Yeah, that was ridiculous. Well,

735
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,560
apparently the golden shower pex ya that
ex British operative wasn't he hired by

736
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,060
uh,

737
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,630
I think certain democratic super pacs or
somebody like that to discredit Trump.

738
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:48,040
I mean it's basically, and he came
up with a golden shower parties.

739
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,310
So uncreative bought that shit.
Did you? I did. I was like, Damn,

740
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:56,140
he likes to party. Sondra is looking
good on the outside, man. Look, we'll do,

741
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,410
I gave it to Rogan. I'm not, I'm
not eating all the podcasts going.

742
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,310
I'm a professional God,
you are a professional.

743
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,860
You're said to some of the C's
you ever tried to work, Bro.

744
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,220
It's gotta be some of the
best cheese, right? Is it raw
milk? Cheese? Sure is. Wow.

745
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,670
You are an artisan.
A cow.

746
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,770
Cow Milk as well as I tolerate goat
milk court has had some serious fucking

747
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:19,130
injuries, man. It's some battles. Didn't
you have like a serious hand injury?

748
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,570
He had something like two
years off. Yeah. I want,

749
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:28,190
I want to say it as a hand injury.
Ben Saunders got cut from the UFC.

750
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,110
This his first fight back,
Huh? No, no, no, no, no. He
said more than one fight back,

751
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,040
I believe.
No,

752
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:37,880
his last fight was in some weird
location unless he went back to yelling.

753
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,210
I'm pretty sure. Why can you confirm
that gym? I'm pretty sure they know what.

754
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,890
I think you're right. He's, this is
his third run with the UFC then. Wow.

755
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:49,220
He's looking good man and courts cut
cords caught over that left. I see.

756
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:53,450
But here's the thing, what's
manner? No fight night.

757
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,700
Fight night at the island is what
it was called. I'm sorry. Yeah,

758
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,370
UFC denim to the earlier
last year we had a fight.

759
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,670
UFC fight night 81 January,

760
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,510
2016 and then September he fought fight
night at the island in Wisconsin though.

761
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:09,570
Yes. Volkman oh, so that would be
go Volkman. Yeah. Jacob Volkmann.

762
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,780
That's outside the UFC. This soda. Yeah.
There's no UFC Highland in Minnesota.

763
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,400
Volkman is a, he's a guy from Minnesota.
He's a chiropractor. Yeah. Good grappler,

764
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,820
man. Real good grappler. He was
like winning fights too. Yeah.

765
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,020
He was one of the guys that called that
Obama after he had been visited by the

766
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:31,920
secret service call that Obama because
he fucking Obamacare basically killed his

767
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,510
business. Damn. Really?

768
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,830
A lot of small doctor's small practices
apparently suffered from Obamacare.

769
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,950
Have you talked to Volkman about
it? He's very, very vocal about it.

770
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,330
Very upset vocals. He can be. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't, you know what man,

771
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,160
there's not enough shit and you
don't have time rather in the world.

772
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,090
Pay attention to everything.
And um,

773
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,390
when you paying attention to
things that like Obamacare,

774
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,210
if you want to really go through how
it affects all these doctors, you'll,

775
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,820
you'll just probably go crazy and start
feeling sad for all these people that

776
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:02,640
got fucked over. Look up how
long, how big the bill was.

777
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:07,410
The initial booking was 2,400 pages.
100 pages. Who's gonna read that?

778
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,590
Nobody. Nobody. Right. Isn't that part
of the problem? I think two people,

779
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:14,610
two journalists read it and they broke
it down and I tried to read that he got

780
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,580
that Gig. Not so fun. No,

781
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:22,290
definitely not like doing a podcast who
they probably didn't get paid much. Yeah,

782
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,660
they probably got on
the secret FBI list too.

783
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,410
They probably didn't smoke weed and drink
with their friends. How they did it,

784
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:31,230
they read the whole thing,
broke it down.

785
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,070
I read that and I read it again and
I still didn't really understand it.

786
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,780
You read their summary. I
read the, how long was their
summary? It was long enough.

787
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,830
No it was, it was long. It was long
enough for me to be terribly bored.

788
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,790
So essentially what,

789
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:50,810
what is like the main beef is that it
makes employers spend more money on

790
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:55,320
insurance for their employees because
you can opt out, like you can get people.

791
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,820
Um, I know that I've talked to
business owners about like, so,

792
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:04,350
so you, you can give them an option, I
guess you can say. You can. Um, it's so,

793
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:06,090
in other words,
if you're a full time employee,

794
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,600
I have to pay all of your
insurance. Okay. So what,

795
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:14,250
what one of the side effects
is that companies will say,

796
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:15,480
well if if it,

797
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,800
if it means I have to hire you for a 40
if 40 hours a week or 30 hours a week is

798
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:20,634
full time,

799
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,930
I'm going to hire you for 18 hours a week
and hire somebody else for nine hours

800
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:26,700
a week. So both of you guys
have to work part time.

801
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,280
So what does that do to the
bus boy or guys like that?

802
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,290
They really need that full time work.

803
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,100
Right now they can only work part time
because company can't afford to hire him

804
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,080
full time cause they need to
have some kind of a mandate.

805
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:42,081
Either he's got to pay a $2,000 something
fine and not paying his healthcare or

806
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:43,950
he's got to pay for his healthcare.

807
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,650
So there are certain mandated
things and the problem,

808
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,360
I don't know enough about it and I
don't want it. I think it has that.

809
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,600
That's right though be cause I know
people who were affected by the, yeah.

810
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,760
And I know people who need it and there
and there are about 20 million people

811
00:46:56,761 --> 00:47:01,290
that are on it now or something crazy.
Uh, and, and they benefit from it. So,

812
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,980
you know, it's a, it's, it's a tough
issue, but so who's benefiting from it?

813
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,550
The people that drafted it,
we're probably not very business savvy.

814
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,770
They were probably bureaucrats
and not necessarily small,

815
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,200
but they didn't realize they were going
to take advantage of some of the rules.

816
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,740
Did some old figured out a loophole.
So who does benefit from it?

817
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,840
People who can't afford healthcare,
people who get a condition for example.

818
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,810
And then the, the insurance
company drops them. You know,

819
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:26,730
there are a lot of people
that had health care,

820
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,030
they get a very serious illness and
they get dropped and then then they say,

821
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:32,290
if you really want healthcare,

822
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,320
now try getting healthcare when you've
got a life threatening disease. So,

823
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,330
so it does help a lot of people.
The problem is once again,

824
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:44,110
who pays for it and um,
oh Ooh,

825
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,890
how do you get doctors to
do it? And there's all kinds
of things. But then again,

826
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,570
you know, the, what do you think is
the solution as a civilized society?

827
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,330
Do you think that everybody should
have healthcare? Personally? I do.

828
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,280
I get more that way as we get older.
However,

829
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,670
I also think one of the culprits is
a lack of competition amongst states.

830
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,070
And the reason for that
is this. So you, you know,

831
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:09,760
you're not really able to shop for
insurance across state lines. Why?

832
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:14,410
Because insurance companies basically
have their territory that they all agree

833
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:18,610
not to encroach upon. Okay. So
that's, that's another part.

834
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:21,690
It's kind of just agree to it. Yeah.
They've taken on hold and go, right,

835
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,880
this is my garbage route.
That's your garbage route.
Don't mess with my business.

836
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,090
I won't mess with Your Business. Well,
we need to do is have competition.

837
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,650
One of the ideas is to have competition
among all the insurance companies and to

838
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,960
the lowest bidder goes the spoils.
You know?

839
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:38,590
So now if I can't get insurance in
California, maybe somebody in Hawaii,

840
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,010
maybe somebody in Tennessee is
offering insurance for less.

841
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,520
Say this fight a, you were missing a
real good fight right here in the UK.

842
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,690
Don't they get free health
insurance? They did. It hurt.

843
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,960
If something goes wrong,

844
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:57,220
they have to wait like for
fucking ever up the innovation,

845
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,120
the innovation in healthcare.
So it'll be new drugs and all that.

846
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:04,450
It was here in this country. It's
the same issue with Canada. You know,

847
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:06,640
some people will tell you it's awesome,
they have free healthcare,

848
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,820
but I've had friends that have had
surgery up there by subpar doctors and

849
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:13,300
they've had to go in second and third
time to fix things. Or they have to wait.

850
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,700
You have nine months before they
get their automatic a long time.

851
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,380
So a lot of them that have money wind
up coming to America to get surgery from

852
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:24,460
American surgeons. But I don't know. It
also the innovation in medical technology,

853
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,740
most of it happens in this country,

854
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,200
and the theory is because there's
more profit to be made. Yeah.

855
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:33,950
Well that's where innovation
gives, gives birth. Yes. I mean,

856
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,240
they have to have incentive in order
to spend money in order to come up with

857
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:41,860
things like this. Whoa, this is a good
fucking fight, man. Real veterans.

858
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,470
I'm amazed at how good she Saunders is.

859
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:47,770
Looking on the outside like able to
slide in and out using his reach.

860
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,550
I'm more impressed with court has just
making a dog fight every fight he fights

861
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:53,110
in his dog fights for guy's a beast.

862
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,310
Didn't do any like die from meth or
some shit and the came back from some

863
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,820
drawing or something like this too.
I think he's a,

864
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:03,970
he's been to to the other side.
He called Matt Brown.

865
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:08,650
Him and Matt Brown both have that similar
quality. I spoke to him for a while,

866
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:12,030
one time and he's such a such a smart,
he's such a sweet guy

867
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,770
dude to struck me as very
intelligent and yeah,

868
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,620
when he gets out of this he's going to
do well for himself in life with whatever

869
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:21,550
he chooses to do.

870
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,510
I hope he doesn't wait too long to do that
and Ben Saunders is a really nice guy.

871
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:26,560
We had dinner with him that time.

872
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,630
Really good guy on the companion and
Eddie's there with them right now.

873
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:31,760
That's why Eddie's not here. Oh,
he's right there in this corner.

874
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:36,620
That's Eddie by below him. He's well
remember tower seven chem trails.

875
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,220
Remember, tell him about
pizza gate right now. He, um,

876
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,710
he's worked with Ben
Extensively, especially on
its guard with Ben's gardens.

877
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,501
Wicked bends,

878
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,580
the only guy to ever get an omen plot
to in the UFC and his guard is fucking

879
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:53,900
super high level and he's also got the
perfect build for it cause he's so long

880
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:56,870
and tall and a,
he spends a lot of time with eddy.

881
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,410
I wonder if seventies too much of a
cup from word of diminishing returns.

882
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,970
He's so fucking no, no, he's okay.
He's okay at 70. You know when we, um,

883
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,120
we joke around but Eddie,
but Eddie is my boy and he's like,

884
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,500
we fucking legitimately one of the very
best Jujitsu instructors on the planet.

885
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,420
He's amazing at anyone gets
that twisted, do they? Well,

886
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,180
they do sometimes because they hear the
conspiracy theory talk and they just

887
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:23,930
sort of dismiss everything. That's
what people love to do that, you know,

888
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,410
like Eddie loves conspiracies.
That's his shit, you know.

889
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,610
But that's what he's into. His
jujitsu. Jujitsu is top notch,

890
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,390
top notch.
Who the best professors in the world is.

891
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,550
Gyms all over is super successful guy.

892
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,770
What's his innovation too? Was
this a hot look? Japanese girl doe.

893
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,320
Was this commercial always
lead? She's leaving. I, oh,
she's on a black guy's house.

894
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:53,510
Hey. Oh, Marvin Eastman's
waiting on the other side.

895
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:59,100
You went old school. Barban he, Paul
Marvin Easton was a tank. He really was.

896
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,710
Maybe Bobby Lashley is
accident right there. My God.

897
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,150
Speaking of tanks, God, he's
Bobby Lashley is ridiculous.

898
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,560
He's just huge. Yeah. You know
who's a ridiculous is fighting soon.

899
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,890
It's Francis and go. No, they
find her lost. You Ready? Yes.

900
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,050
First big test. Where is he fighting
our loft game? Is that Brooke Congo?

901
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,840
That's where the last bottle of malaria
medication in the middle of the Congo.

902
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,330
It's definitely like Congo and it's not
Brooklyn cause that'd be a great fucking

903
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:35,810
card. Where is that? Uh, put them on
there. They should put them on there,

904
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:38,490
but I think they're headlining the card.
It's then it's fine.

905
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,870
I think it's a fight.
It's actually in boats in Denver.

906
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,580
How would they put heavyweights in Denver?
You know Joe Silva's gun?

907
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,720
Cause after Mark Hunt flat, Ben Rothwell
I asked for a fight in Denver goes,

908
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:54,740
we will never let heavyweight fight in
Denver again. Oh guys, guys can't tell.

909
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:57,490
What do you see something
Rothwell Mark Hunt. Yeah. Ooh.

910
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,060
Too exhausted they gas meanwhile than
they have fucking cane versus we're doom

911
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:05,320
in Mexico City, which is 2000 feet
above fucking Denver. Seattle.

912
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,500
Think that's our boy Joe Silva doing that.
He knows better what? Mexico City. Yes.

913
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,310
Our new, the new guys like Dan, they'll
figure it out. No, but Mexico City was,

914
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,190
well Joel silver was there.
Damn Sam. Alvin. I know,

915
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:19,910
but he doesn't make the title
fights. Oh really? What I'm saying?

916
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,780
It's crazy shit. Nate.
Sam. So this is funny.

917
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,300
Nate was Sam's on the ultimate fighter
like they were training partners in this

918
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:32,070
coach. You know guys sleep on Nate.
You know, which is interesting.

919
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:33,950
Like CB Dalloway went chasing after Nate,

920
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,560
like Nate's done and Nate uncorked
one on him and knocked him out cold.

921
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,960
I mean he's on the back nine for sure.
For sure.

922
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,160
We're walking them up to that then,
but you can't fuck around with names.

923
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:47,640
The grade, it's still a powerhouse.
It's still a flowers. Last thing to go.

924
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:52,260
Last thing to go fight. He's a super
vet. He's been fighting since he was 17,

925
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,420
17 years old.
So crazy.

926
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,260
I was just with Eve Edwards who started
fighting when he was 17 he was at a show,

927
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:03,180
right? Yeah. Eve is remarkably
well composed. He's so smart.

928
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,240
He's doing that stance now.
Stunts for movies.

929
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:09,270
That's a dangerous gig per flight.
Yeah.

930
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:13,020
There's someone died on a Steven Seagal
movie dude stunt. So he needs to know.

931
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,880
No stuck being a stunt man.

932
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:19,800
Super dangerous because Angela Karen
bands on the show that you can do TV and

933
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:24,590
you're like, you run into sugar glass and
stuff. Then some of it's cushy, like uh,

934
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,970
the goal versus doesn't have
a lot of big stones. You know,

935
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,300
you have stunt guys on your shot.
Yeah.

936
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,620
Cause the beautiful blackhalls
for wrestling, you know,
all that kind of Schema.

937
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,730
What's going on with your show? Are
you doing a pilot? Are you doing,

938
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,150
you're doing a spin off from the
Goldberg. You want to spin off, uh,

939
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,770
starting in March. I think that's
beautiful. Man. Gets excited about that.

940
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,590
I am excited about it and do table
reads, all that jazz, all that stuff.

941
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,580
It's like how he is. He's just
the best. Let me come on and play.

942
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:51,270
You're retarded brother. I
love it. I want to do. They do.

943
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,570
They'd have you on dude. Come on man.
You would do it Joe. Yeah, I played it.

944
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,430
He played my brother and he's
radio. I own one. I had a blast.

945
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,660
Him and Nick Depalo and
Epstein from welcome back,
Kotter. They were my brothers.

946
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,630
They all beat the fuck out of me.
Threw me through a plate glass window.

947
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,870
I had to throw myself through one of
those. Um, sugar glass windows. Yeah.

948
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,600
It's freaky man. Really? He's, it looks
like a real way. Scared a little bit.

949
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,390
I was a little nervous. Yeah. You
had such a great time on that show.

950
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:17,370
It's so much fun. Yeah. We was just Dave,

951
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,940
mostly Dave Foley, who's Dave and
Steven Rude. If I see him and candy.

952
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:25,140
I've seen candy since, and you know, it's
always great when I run into him. Damn.

953
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,030
Look at all the Phil Hartman and
that's [inaudible] me head on.

954
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:33,540
You there, cal. And he threw me
through a window or didn't. Nick,

955
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,780
why don't you guys talk to her window
was so much fun. You miss acting at all.

956
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:40,500
Joe knew nothing about it.
Nope, not at all. Not a thing.

957
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,800
It's takes too much time. I'm
not into doing it. It's a you.

958
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,420
It do it with the actors,
which just never, never.

959
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,730
The best thing to do the actors on your
show is so good. They were great. More.

960
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:55,230
I even wrote part,

961
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,700
Ben's harness went for that leg,
but he didn't quite get to it quick.

962
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,610
Super Dangerous for court,
even though there's not much time left.

963
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,530
And I feel like he's winning the fight.
I wouldn't mess with it.

964
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,570
I don't know about that.
I think Ben is when the standup,

965
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,480
but he's on top right here. So
let's see. Hello, Casey. Here it is.

966
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,170
Here's the wrap up. Here's the wrap
up. Look at this. Let's see. Oh Wow.

967
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:17,550
Court shook it off quick. Ben.
Uh, went for the transition.

968
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,900
He went for the transition to change the
name chop and a little wine in there.

969
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,570
Hey, how the honey, the honey man
Trump little humming lamb. Cha.

970
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,220
I wonder who winning this fight since
we weren't really paying. Totally. Yeah.

971
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,830
Court winning. Good ground and pound
here. See, Ben had that position,

972
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,230
man for a very sharp. Okay,
now he's wrapping it up again.

973
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:38,740
Let's see what he can do,
but it's not, it's not high
enough. Okay, now it's better.

974
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,110
Oh my gosh. What is that
called? A dead orchard.

975
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,760
Both arms trap long legs.
Both arms trapped inside the triangle.

976
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:48,830
This is named after Nathan Orchard.
This is called the dead org charts,

977
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,060
but the problem is, well,
can he submit from here?

978
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,590
Because a lot of times like he's had guys
stuck in here. Like Kenny Rogers said,

979
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,160
no god, Kenny Roberts, he had him
stuck in here but he couldn't fit them.

980
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,070
Excuse me. You going to be
tough to finish court McGee out.

981
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:05,800
It's not going to finish them now.
No, it's not. He's on the foot.

982
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,870
He's on the toes on the back of the calf.

983
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,860
You really want to get deep in on the
ankle on this and even so it's just,

984
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,130
it's not there for him. He didn't
have much time to work here. He's now,

985
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,440
it's totally gone.
You can do damage there with elbows,

986
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:20,380
but you don't manage the court. Drop
some elbows on him. Court just cut him.

987
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,950
Oh Man. Yeah. Courts on top of him
and he's tired now too. You know,

988
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,740
I think he's going to try to switch
to a leg. He's in half guard here.

989
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,960
He's going to try it.
So courtships drop that elbow on him.

990
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,350
He's kind of tried to go,
oh no,

991
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,910
just going to try to go to the under
hook on that left leg and slide under.

992
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:41,180
But in the meantime he's taken some
shots which trying to Darcy come up.

993
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,830
He is super long. It's easier to get
when they're long. Does that make sense?

994
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,680
So they're really good at
them, but they're also easier
to get caught. Yup. Yup.

995
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,960
Totally right. Damn. And doing work. Yeah.
Big Finish to the fight for court court.

996
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:58,520
The such a warrior man.
Tough. Every fights just, it's
never easy for him. Is it?

997
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:02,390
It's just a scrap. Yeah, that's what
he likes. Yeah. Interesting man.

998
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,800
Very interesting.
I mean he looks like an Islamic cleric.

999
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,560
I wish we were paying more attention
to in the 30 seconds I saw.

1000
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:13,050
I'd probably give it to court
with aggression and then
the take down at the end

1001
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,940
cause I think like Ben was winning
on the outside earlier in the fight.

1002
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,140
Interesting. But that round, that
last round was big for court.

1003
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,450
That was the most we watch.
So I kind of get to court.

1004
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,010
That's kind of what we do. So fucking
terrible or or you, me and Eddie.

1005
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:32,030
You'd be arguing that Brian's watching
the bride a dropped some serious

1006
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:34,550
knowledge.
There's credit.

1007
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,530
Well shut up and he's right.
He's spot on. Nothing.

1008
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:44,050
I'm watching like every beat that my bed
and he likes shot. I've know he did it.

1009
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,030
What do I do?
Oh,

1010
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,500
what the fuck were we just talking
about before that and the idea? Yeah,

1011
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,980
we were talking to, it's tough to get,
we need a court stenographer in here.

1012
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,510
I know.
Pull up records.

1013
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,800
It's true in mill is I want to
start taking that pistol class.

1014
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,300
Fucking do it. Do you want to, do you
want to, oh, we were talking about acting.

1015
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:09,260
I just got ready. I want you to get
back in acting. Well, my spin off,

1016
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:11,480
we were talking about my spinner.
I'll do it. I'll do Brian's show.

1017
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,510
Last thing I did is Kevin James
movie because Kevin's my buddy.

1018
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,720
I heard you are good in that.
It's fun. It's fun. I would
love, I want you to do my,

1019
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,230
it'd be great. You come on my
show, Brandon, let me look here.

1020
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:27,260
Cause I got to work with the
Leslie Bibb from Talladega Nights.

1021
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,540
Which ones that, um, she's uh,
she's, she's, she's the girl.

1022
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,490
They said, can you kind of get
on that car, ride it like a pony.

1023
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:41,030
He's fucking hilarious.
Real life in real life.

1024
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:45,800
Like hanging out and talking to her.
She's hilarious. She's so fucking silly.

1025
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,080
She's really silly.
Really smart.

1026
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,290
You're really getting under the new
show out and he's back to acting like a

1027
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,500
straight up Siri said he did a movie
on Netflix. He did a movie on Netflix.

1028
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:57,590
Right now he's doing a series on CBS
that apparently is doing really well.

1029
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,020
It's an excellent actor, man.
He's really good at that.

1030
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,330
He's really good like
classic Sitcom actor.

1031
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,020
He knows how to do that and that form
he a master. I fucking loved him in. Uh,

1032
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,300
and uh, what's the movie? Will
Smith. Oh, Yay. Yeah, the one, yeah,

1033
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,250
the Will Smith was like
the dating advice guy.

1034
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:21,620
Hitch hitch June one of my favorite
movies. I thought he was great in that.

1035
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,580
How do you spell Leslie's
last name? Bebe. Right. Okay.

1036
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,720
Ben Saunders winter by
decision were wrong. Wow.

1037
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,980
Earned good job back. I
was off. I apologize. Yeah,

1038
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,690
I felt like he was winning the standups,

1039
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:39,050
particularly in the first and second
round and he looked good on the outside.

1040
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:44,210
Swollen about the eyes there.
I heard Kevin James was a
beast of a comic too. Oh,

1041
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,650
he's hilarious. Great. Stand up. Great.
You know, he's just still doing sort of,

1042
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:49,370
he uh,

1043
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,970
takes a lot of time off and then go and
do like theaters tours and does theaters

1044
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:55,910
and shit money.
But since he's a veteran is it,

1045
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,790
he doesn't have to do a lot of spots.
You can just go to those theaters.

1046
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:00,860
Can we get to do those
theories if he wants to,

1047
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:04,670
but honestly in order to
really be on top of your game,

1048
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,360
you gotta do the clubs. It's
like yeah, it's like yeah,

1049
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,200
I mean it's not that he's not going to
be great and he's going to rehearse and

1050
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,020
he's going to go through all of this
stuff and if he does a few of those in a

1051
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:16,730
row he'll get right back into shape again.

1052
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,200
But the thing about standup is in
order to be like you, like your, you,

1053
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:25,940
you go out of shape. If you
take a week off, rhythm timing,

1054
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:26,860
everything from it too.

1055
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,380
And sometimes for me where I get
scrambled is I'll do a UFC on the weekend,

1056
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:33,980
then I'll work on Sunday night or you
know like work the night after the UFC,

1057
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:38,140
whatever it is. And I'm scrambled cause
my brain is still in MMA mode. Yeah,

1058
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:43,310
it's like commentary mode take. So like,
like in order like to be in the groove,

1059
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,380
like if you're doing a big
show on Saturday night,

1060
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:50,360
ideally you want to work like Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, maybe Friday too.

1061
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:54,050
And then gear up for Saturday.
You know, it's like you a tune up,

1062
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,830
you gotta you gotta keep, keep
sharp. And when I do a lot of sets,

1063
01:01:57,831 --> 01:02:00,800
like I'll do like three sets on Wednesday,
three sets on a Thursday,

1064
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,650
I come into Friday, I'm
just loose. It's all,

1065
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:08,210
it's all in the groove and you feel it.
You feel like efficient.

1066
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,150
Like on a Thursday when they haven't
done standing monologue Thursday on the

1067
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:16,090
road and by, by Saturday you've done
five shows, five hours of comedy or just,

1068
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,920
yeah, we'll be told me to
start doing some stamp because

1069
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,830
I would, we would do a lifeline.
The kid at theaters, right.

1070
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,080
We'd start with 10 minutes of stand up
and like, Dad, I can't go one month there,

1071
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:31,490
take three months off and go in from this
theater. I got start doing something.

1072
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:33,670
Yeah. And in between. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1073
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,380
There's no substitute for actually
going on stage. And for you.

1074
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:38,430
Would it be fun anyway,
man,

1075
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:42,980
just do open mic nights and
all these bullshit spots
and did split seven minutes.

1076
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,590
What I'm encouraged with Brandon is
that he just changes it every time.

1077
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:50,040
Like he's always writing. He's
always, he's always carving it,

1078
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:53,070
changing and taking out words, adding
things because that's sexy. Bitch.

1079
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,870
This a fight right here. I was talking
about me by like track that be so rude.

1080
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,710
Would be so rude. Was talking about
myself. This is a weird fight man.

1081
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,310
Or there was no one to sell this
right now. Well, yeah, I mean it's,

1082
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:06,840
it's one of those things, there's
literally no one's talking about it.

1083
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:07,801
I mean it's,

1084
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:12,690
this is like maybe one of the least hyped
up world championship fights in recent

1085
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:15,960
memory. I feel like maybe Dana was
on vacation and came back to like,

1086
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:19,650
you booked what? Well, I just
don't know what else they can do.

1087
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,910
I mean you have this fight at one
45 you're trying to book Cyborg.

1088
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:27,270
Cyborg keeps canceling. Then
they test her. She pisses hot.

1089
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,030
Now you're fucked because
now she's out forever.

1090
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,030
Then you stack the rest of the card and
they didn't have the fights. They did.

1091
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,260
They literally didn't have the fights
and then now the fighters available,

1092
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,370
they didn't know what to do.

1093
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:42,780
And this is a fucking not like if you
want her to make a star at a Holly Holm

1094
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,270
wrong fight,
wrong fight.

1095
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:50,540
Cause Germain de Randamie is a fucking
nasty kickboxer and a real legit multiple

1096
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:53,970
time world Moy Thai champion.

1097
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,510
And when she's presented with
someone like home who is uh,

1098
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,490
an excellent Stryker,
you know,

1099
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,760
I think 18 time world boxing champion
or something crazy like that,

1100
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,290
you know that Holly Holm is
going to be striking with her.

1101
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,390
Well Dan is where Germane to random.

1102
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,680
He shines her number one issue in MMA.

1103
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,640
Just been girls holding onto her, taking
her down. You know, you seen grappling.

1104
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:21,420
It's not Holly. Holly stopped
me. Holly, Ken do that to girls.

1105
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,280
But that's also how she lost her title.

1106
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:25,460
She got choked out thing
you this honor thing. Yeah.

1107
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:30,070
So like when you saw in the Valentina
Shevchenko fight was when Holly fights a

1108
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:34,140
nut. Like Valentino is one
of the best super high level,

1109
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:37,170
most technical strikers,
uh, in women's MMA.

1110
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,010
And she kept using that check ride
hook and she was kicking her a lot,

1111
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,120
like working the legs a lot. And she is
bitter by a clear cut, unanimous decision.

1112
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:49,080
So I feel like this is a super
dangerous fight for home.

1113
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:51,930
She's lost two and a foe, two in a
row for the first time in her career.

1114
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:56,130
She gets choked out by me, Hsa and
then she loses her next fight, um,

1115
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,440
against Valentina Shevchenko. So I feel
like this is a real dangerous fight.

1116
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,201
Tufts sell,

1117
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:05,100
she loses this one super tough center
in a row and she's the girl knocked out

1118
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,060
Ronda Rousey.
I mean that's,

1119
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:10,180
that's her main claim to fame is
that highlight reel left high care.

1120
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,580
The first one to do it. And it's pretty
well she was the strange because she,

1121
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,920
yeah, she outclassed or how
crazy are these fights? Look
at me. Look, you have here,

1122
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:22,030
you have eaten shock ray versus
Tim Bolts. Like what? Who saw that?

1123
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:27,190
How weird. Yeah. I mean, Tim boats just
knocks out. Um, uh, what's his face?

1124
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:31,960
I'm hopping on the towel. That's right.
Yeah. I mean, huge fight for him. I mean,

1125
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,830
hot on a towel I think was number six
and Boesch knocked him out. So look,

1126
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,370
Boesch jumps into the top 10 with
that boasts just will not go away.

1127
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,540
But just for shock array,

1128
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:43,450
it's gotta be pissing him off because
he's been knocking at the fucking door for

1129
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,810
a title forever. Craze and, and
now and then. Yeah, that's true.

1130
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,010
Well he's just waiting marrow
beats him by a small amount,

1131
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,200
but then pisses hot.
Remember?

1132
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:56,230
So this is Ben Yoel
Romero Romero comes back,

1133
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:01,510
smashes Chris Weidman. She smashes Chris
Weidman, so he gets the title shot.

1134
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:05,260
Meanwhile, Jack always got to
be like, what in the fuck man,

1135
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,590
you just sit sitting there while
Bisbing fights Henderson, you know,

1136
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:11,800
I thought I was going to be next pice.
Pin Gets Henderson. He beat Tennessee now.

1137
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,520
Bisbee he's got to fight Yo.
Well,

1138
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:18,430
which gray zone is dangerous besides
low vol is the second most dangerous.

1139
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,120
I mean, you know, I think
that'd be phenomenal. I think.

1140
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:24,640
I think he'd beats almost any of
the porch. Well, he's really good,

1141
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:28,210
but you know what, Yo el caught him
with that wicked spinning back fist.

1142
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,770
I want to see it as a fight.
Luke Rockhold again.

1143
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:36,910
Want to see what happens. They almost
did, but Luke fucked his knee up. Yeah,

1144
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,960
they are supposed to fight in Australia.
I think Luke had, did he have surgery?

1145
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,980
Did you just do like PRP injections
or some shit? I'm not sure. Yeah,

1146
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:44,890
he's setting again.

1147
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:47,860
I think he's done a serious
seriously fucked up knee for a while.

1148
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:51,040
Even though he's training now.
It keeps kicking with his right knee only.

1149
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,750
I see about 58 yeah,
he's about 58 no,

1150
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:56,830
it's a weathered 58 til, well, listen,

1151
01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:00,530
no one's had more fucking miles on
their body then our boy in that e and T.

1152
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,050
Mccall can't even make a fist.

1153
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,420
He can't make it a fight when
you can't make it fit. Dude, he,

1154
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,590
if you haven't seen him,
Brian,

1155
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,490
he makes a fist is his index finger
on his right hand is like that. Oh,

1156
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,800
I could never, and what I'm doing for
people that are listening here is, uh,

1157
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,640
like if I was playing pool and I had a,

1158
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:17,830
a queue where she tucked under my
finger yet, like I'm pulling a trigger,

1159
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,630
like he can't make a full fist is
his hands been broken so many times.

1160
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:27,070
He's such a little monster to the Travis
Brown and I'm Derrick Lewis is on that

1161
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:31,520
string fight for Travis. Ooh, Dustin
Poirier. Jim Miller's on that card. Ooh,

1162
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,240
it's Travis.
Is Travis Eve,

1163
01:07:34,241 --> 01:07:36,610
is that actually down there getting
Dustin ready for that fight?

1164
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:41,900
Is Travis Brown still and Edmonds Camp?
I don't know.

1165
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:44,220
I don't know. I assume so.
Yeah, I assume so. Because I,

1166
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,690
we heard from Rhonda or she's still
been radio silent. She posted a pay,

1167
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,780
a inspirational quote on
Instagram. Yeah. Which is awesome.

1168
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:56,230
Was it a Harry Potter called J K
Rawlings? Is that what it was? Yeah.

1169
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,250
At JK Rawlings quote, which is, uh,

1170
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:04,570
even rock bottom has the wiggle room.
That's a quote from,

1171
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:07,190
what's his name? What's our
boy? That's a great, um,

1172
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,740
even rock bottom has wiggle room. That's
hilarious. What's our boy? Ah, Don.

1173
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,410
Dot. Merera. Yes. Yeah, he's, he
said, he said we had dinner then

1174
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,190
he said even rock bottom has
we'll call room sign and went,

1175
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,890
that's fucking hilarious.
Hilarious.

1176
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,890
I'm going out to dinner we were at and
the best restaurant on the planet goes

1177
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:29,090
there every night they'll come. It's the
best restaurant. Wait, listen. I go home,

1178
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,953
I get some sleep.

1179
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,610
I mean you can come hang and have an
amazing meal for an hour with Joe on this

1180
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:38,690
one. Go home, go to sleep.
Tumbling. If you're going out
on a Thursday night at mid.

1181
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:42,070
So what? I wasn't, my dad was
out of the 11 every night.

1182
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:46,130
I was doing sets every night I
get up in the morning buddy. Yeah.

1183
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,720
I don't like my mornings
to be fucked a man.

1184
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:51,770
Yo come out to dinner once in a while.
I actually do go to yoga.

1185
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,880
I know you say you do, but
I really do. You do? Well, I
really, I see, I see. Yeah.

1186
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:57,830
Your girl posts on the yoga teacher,

1187
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,400
he has to take pictures and shit
with your shirt off. Right, because

1188
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,070
she looks like a super flexible.

1189
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:08,780
So I think that yoga is one of the most
important things I've done over the past

1190
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,880
few years. I really do. It's
making a giant difference.

1191
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:15,500
I try to do it three times a week
now. Giant difference. The way I feel.

1192
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,770
Relaxation, flexibility. I'm down.

1193
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,180
I mean I'm a back to a
full split with no like uh,

1194
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:26,210
no strain at all. I could just
drop right down. Hot Yoga. Yes.

1195
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,870
That's shit stresses me out man. They're
relaxing. It's not, it's not relaxing.

1196
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,720
It's brutal. Yeah, it's brewed
when you're done, you feel great.

1197
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:36,860
My favorite thing right now is to
fucking torture myself for 90 minutes.

1198
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,930
Hot Yoga and then go
right into a cold shower.

1199
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,170
Cause right now it's January so
the water's really fucking cold.

1200
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,251
So you're going there,

1201
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:47,480
you're hurting like barely getting
through like the last 10 minutes of a hot

1202
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:51,420
yoga class. Yeah. Like you
barely can make it through tax.

1203
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:56,000
You're fucked up and thought it was 60
booze 90 it'll ruin your fucking week.

1204
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,240
Yeah, I have it where you're like,
know what you mean? 45 minutes.

1205
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:04,220
Let's go 15 oh dude. Wow. That's
another half an hour. Yeah, I took some,

1206
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,170
I love it at La. What does this Cody
Garbrandt it's, it's the snakes. Oh Wow.

1207
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,210
Who made that?
Oh,

1208
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,350
he should sell those for shirts
on black money. Sell posters,

1209
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,920
shirts. Do you know who that's
signifying? You know what, God, everybody,

1210
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:24,410
come on guys. I'm gonna
do so right. Medusa.

1211
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,440
[inaudible] and she turned to just don't,
what's fucked up man is that

1212
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:34,130
Conor McGregor called him a snake
and it's never let off. Never.

1213
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,430
Connor says he's a fucking snake.
And everybody was like,

1214
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:42,070
why stamp stamped his forehead with it?

1215
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,160
There's nothing about Tj. Why they
didn't make no sense what I heard.

1216
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:48,860
And he left the can allow team Alpha
male was his brothers and he left that

1217
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:52,280
Catherine went with Duane Ludwig and he
went to muscle farm and they were like,

1218
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:57,200
fuck you. You know what they
needed like knew at that point.

1219
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,640
Well, it's not, listen,

1220
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:04,090
his loyalty was to his own future and he
felt like his best chance to get better

1221
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,980
was not with team Alpha male.

1222
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:11,240
And he was clearly the right choice
champion when he felt like he, yeah,

1223
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:16,050
and he felt like his choice was to go
with Duane Ludwig cause he felt like Duane

1224
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:20,160
Ludwig had some, a bond
with him and a deep, deep,

1225
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:23,970
deep pool of knowledge and together
they jelled well. It was the right move,

1226
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:25,530
but it was the right move for him maybe.

1227
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,430
What do you mean it's became world champ,

1228
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,130
but how close was he really to those
guys? See, here's the thing man.

1229
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:33,870
It's like how you can't work this out.

1230
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,570
There's not a way to work it out
where you're still with Tina trial.

1231
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,270
I don't know. Listen, I'm just being,
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

1232
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:43,050
I'm a huge file. He would go back
to Alpha male and then go to,

1233
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,440
I'm a huge Duane fan and I'm a,
I'm a huge Tj Fan,

1234
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,920
but I'm also a huge Alpha male fan, you
know, and I'm also a huge fan of loyalty.

1235
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,730
It's also a team sport does not a team
sport and that's where it gets weird,

1236
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,220
super weird, super weird.
You know what I mean?

1237
01:11:56,221 --> 01:12:00,630
If there's another guy that's in one 35,
like Cody who's coming up, coming up hot,

1238
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:04,140
clearly coming up, coming up, hot,
knocking, everybody dead, you know,

1239
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,210
smashing Thomas Almeda,
you know,

1240
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:09,390
knocking on the door and then wants up
winning the title in his first attempt,

1241
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,690
the first guy to fucking beat the shit
out of Dominick Cruz like that. I mean,

1242
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,110
the only guy that beat Dominick Cruz
before was your riot and Uriah economy and

1243
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:20,340
a gay teen beat the shit caught.
I would say it that way,

1244
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:23,490
class it was m and a being, you
know, with the margin for error.

1245
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,960
If your priority is loyalty,
which I'm a huge fan of loyalty over,

1246
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,700
uh, improve, that could improve and
change your style, then you're gonna get,

1247
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:36,810
you're gonna get left behind. There's no,
there's no mercy in this. You're right.

1248
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:39,900
No, you're right. No mercy. You're right.
You're right. I'm not arguing with you.

1249
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:44,520
And they say no mercy, no mercy.
He said, I'm moving. So true.

1250
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:49,350
There is no,
there is no 100% but there's also,

1251
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:54,060
there's also like brotherhood and
friendship and I feel like there's almost,

1252
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,300
there's almost always a way to do
things different. And I don't know.

1253
01:12:57,301 --> 01:13:00,480
I don't know if they did the right thing.
I don't know what happened. I don't,

1254
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:04,620
I wasn't there, but it's what
the, here's my point results.

1255
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:09,180
Fascinating in terms of the matchup
now and now that they're going,

1256
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,720
I think it's a giant move to do
that on the ultimate fighter.

1257
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:17,580
It's fucking huge because it might be
the one thing that gets a lot of fans,

1258
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:20,190
even though the cutting the budget,
are they cutting the budget?

1259
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:24,720
How do you know this? A deep inside
on the ultimate fighter there. Yeah,

1260
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:27,990
they're cutting the budget. How so?
Who are they not paying as much?

1261
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,470
There's the whole production thing.
Cause the UFC used to do it.

1262
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,840
Now they're going to outsource.
Mm hmm. Well it might be better.

1263
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,260
It could be better. Get people who are
trying to make a name for themselves.

1264
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,650
You fucker never, no ma'am.
All I know is lately those,

1265
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:44,360
when they do the match ups from the
ultimate fighter, it usually it does.

1266
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:48,180
It doesn't build it from me as much.
Tell you what men,

1267
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,780
not a whole lot of shit makes me feel bad.
These goddamn poverty commercials,

1268
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,480
they make me feel worse than anything.
Maintain the world. You know what?

1269
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,220
You see people like little kids.

1270
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,640
We know it fucked him up
even more when the show,

1271
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:03,150
the animals for whatever reason,
tucked up my heart more than humans.

1272
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,250
You got a problem,
you should go to a doctor

1273
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:12,010
and the Kabam above
animals hate the see that.

1274
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:12,641
I hate to see that,

1275
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:17,230
but I hate more to see little kids
who don't have any singing behind it.

1276
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:22,050
Yeah. Yeah, and I just start dishing.

1277
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:27,870
Same Shit guys. Guys, listen more. I said,

1278
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:32,990
well, it's, it's girls. Great.

1279
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,970
Callan would fuck I put
him in that category.

1280
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:39,720
Girls who were just really Carlson,

1281
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:43,570
Brian Callen would have like a six month
intense relationship with before she

1282
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:47,740
fucking change your number.
Earth and mothers who are really crowded.

1283
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:52,880
Mother's earth mothers, women. You're
saying Sarah McLaughlin scenes that right?

1284
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:59,450
Like little beads around her
ankle with luck, some strings,

1285
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:03,340
wines from hemp twine. I was
driving down. Good red flags.

1286
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:06,970
Good red flags for sure.
Marcin Hell Joe Lozan him.

1287
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:11,020
He's young about a shit load of fired up.
Yeah man. He now, he came from Beltour,

1288
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,800
correct? Correct. A
lot of fights with door

1289
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:20,720
built tour. Is that right Jamie?
Only 24 show Lowe's on his head.

1290
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:23,950
Some motherfucking battles said
he's got a nice body out loud.

1291
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,800
So he lost a dear you.
When was the last fight before that?

1292
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:31,420
He doesn't have a wave and Justin and
Bella tour, but he lost a we'll Brooks.

1293
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:32,740
Okay,
so he lost the title.

1294
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:37,741
We'll books lost a title fight rather to
we'll Brooks five round fight this bell

1295
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:40,270
tour. Have any other five round
fights other than title fights.

1296
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,590
They don't write ever.

1297
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:46,770
So that was his first loss since way
back in 2013 when you fought Dave Jensen

1298
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:51,010
and he'd be so beat Dave Jensen and
his last belt or fights or lost to him.

1299
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,130
And then he beat him his last fight,

1300
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:58,120
one fight against Willowbrook that he
didn't get little books. And little horse.

1301
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:02,880
He's tough guy. Who stopped.
Well Brooks, somebody's laughing.

1302
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:07,900
He hears I'm rib. Right? Who
did, he was looking good.

1303
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,030
Who beat him? Someone big cowboy
Oliveira. Yes, and he missed wages.

1304
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,570
I'll tell me a little bit,
but he missed weight pounds.

1305
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,690
It was like fuck it and really get all
mad. He like grabbed the mic, got mad.

1306
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,770
He's like, he was talking shit at Wayne.
It's like Bro, you missed it by 40 pounds.

1307
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,350
Should even be allowed to fight
with like talking about, yeah,

1308
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:30,160
he missed weight by, it might have
been like eight pounds a mountain.

1309
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:33,100
He just said fuck it. Miss Weight by
Jamie. Want to say it was like 12 okay.

1310
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:35,650
Here's Joe Lozan powerful Boston.

1311
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,400
He's got a lot of savage in him and
Marcin held real interesting fight.

1312
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,020
Let's see how this goes. Just
jumped a guard, both of you.

1313
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,220
Here's the thing about health.

1314
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,760
I don't think held has the same
kind of boxing that Lozan has.

1315
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,570
Lozan very sharp with a standout.

1316
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,310
I wouldn't call it sharp because he
does that shell up and I feel like

1317
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:59,160
especially elite out I his
fight and then before that,

1318
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,620
remember that Melvin Gallard Fight Cracked
Melvin with a jab and then choked him

1319
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:04,850
the fuck out.
Cause Melvin got a little,

1320
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:09,870
well Malvin was fucking people up back
then in Melbourne whilst wild wild card.

1321
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,800
Wild cat. Yeah. Who
knows? Like with Melvin,

1322
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,280
he was one of the first guys
to test positive for cocaine.
I was like [inaudible]

1323
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,570
here's the thing about cocaine
that she's also like, you know,

1324
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,700
Shim for like two days. He's also
like no shit. And it was a PPO.

1325
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,260
It was post UFC fight
five point fives over.

1326
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:31,130
That's what Oliveira was 5.5 pounds over
when he fought wheel Brooks and he came

1327
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,790
in. Ooh. Wow. That should help you get
tore up in some states they wouldn't load.

1328
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,631
Wouldn't allow that.

1329
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:38,070
Like I don't think New York would
have allowed that New York stroller,

1330
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,560
hard elbows by Lozan. These are fucking
nasty elbows by Lowe's on Marcy Helton.

1331
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:46,970
Big trouble. Mt. Sion pig.
Oh, when he went for it,

1332
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:50,390
he went for a Greg still God, he's still
got the army still at the arm. Oh Wow.

1333
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:53,630
Now helds got the leg. Oh Damn.
Lozan with a fucking vicious,

1334
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:56,150
he's trying to hit that performance
on the night bonus and be the all time

1335
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,520
leader. Those are the
Travis Brown elbows, man.

1336
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:01,940
Those elbows from that single Tom
about that old Travis. Yes ma'am. Mass,

1337
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,620
not the single rather, but the wide
stance to take down defense. Josh,

1338
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,930
Josh Barnett,
Gonzaga man,

1339
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,650
Travis Brown man, you still fuck
people up. But those elbows,

1340
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,720
he changed that position
for a lot of people.

1341
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:19,660
And Joe Lozan just took a page out of
his book. It's still illegal to go from,

1342
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:24,140
from 12 to six, right? Yeah. I don't
understand how that didn't get changed.

1343
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,460
I really don't understand it.

1344
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,630
I understand that they wanted to change
a bunch of shit and I think they did a

1345
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:34,460
good job with most of it. Someone made
a real good point though about um, the,

1346
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,030
uh, the new rules about, uh,

1347
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:41,300
how many points of contact you have
on the ground three now. Yeah. Yeah.

1348
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,990
So if you have three,
it's legal.

1349
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,740
So if you have two feet on the ground
and the hand on the ground, it's legal.

1350
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,200
But here's the thing, man. Did you see
that? You saw the Tim means fight with um,

1351
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,680
uh, all of, so that guy over here who
came in overweight, that's just Karma. God

1352
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,810
enjoy the,
he had one knee down,

1353
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:06,800
one knee down and only one knee down.
Beautiful takedown down by Marcin.

1354
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,530
Strong grappling by Marcy.
Nice.

1355
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,570
Marson but Joe [inaudible] very good
at getting back up. Two minutes.

1356
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:13,730
Could be interesting turns in Mersey Week.

1357
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:17,450
Definitely more debt or decorated when
it comes to Jujitsu. Oh yeah, for sure.

1358
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,530
For sure. But again, Emma
made just a little different
and those hands a monster.

1359
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,290
Right. And Lozan has already
cracked him with a few elbows.

1360
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:27,860
So we'll see like where Marcin his
head's at now, you know, I mean,

1361
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:31,640
who knows where he's at right now. He
might be on, you know, they've also given,

1362
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:35,270
my team sent no Gimmie's they said, oh,
you're from Bella tour. That's cool.

1363
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,110
You're going to get first. Who? They give
him a Diego Sanchez and lost to Diego.

1364
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:42,410
And then in Lozan his last fight,
he stopped Diego.

1365
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,020
Um, what we're just talking about,
we're just talking about, oh,

1366
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:52,850
we're talking about 10 means and
so the knee on the ground,

1367
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,140
it was owned only the knee,

1368
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,230
even its foot was off the ground
and the knee was still illegal.

1369
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:59,900
So you can't have,
it's not points of contact,

1370
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:02,030
even though we always refer
to it as points of contact.

1371
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,460
John McCarthy told me
that's a bad terminology.

1372
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:07,160
He said you should really
think of it as anything other.

1373
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,080
The bottom of the foot is illegal.

1374
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,800
Hmm.

1375
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,950
So that, I don't know about that though.
Like what about the top of the foot?

1376
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:17,230
Like what if you only have
the top of the foot down,

1377
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,620
it's coming out.

1378
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:24,220
I think they're saying though that
anything other than the the bottom of the

1379
01:20:24,221 --> 01:20:25,900
foot.
So the thing is,

1380
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:30,901
what if a guy is shooting in a takedown
like cyborg versus Michael Page and

1381
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:35,560
someone catches you with a knee coming
in while you have one knee down,

1382
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:39,310
you know you're sliding in and you
get thumped in the face and knocked

1383
01:20:39,311 --> 01:20:42,490
unconscious. Well that's the same
as this be hit punched my life.

1384
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:44,860
You get wheel kicked behind the air,
right? You're moving right into it.

1385
01:20:44,861 --> 01:20:48,940
Which just shame. Maybe
it's a shit happens. Rule
transition. Right, right, right,

1386
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:51,610
right. Like don't be an idiot
and cut with a flying knee.

1387
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,670
Good defense right there by Lowe's on
the brake. Knew that Hook was coming.

1388
01:20:54,671 --> 01:20:56,980
The right hand was coming rather,
and guy that left hand up.

1389
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,780
I loved when they were grappling. Yeah.
High Level Shit. Real interesting.

1390
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:03,250
I don't wanna see a,
he'll throw jabs.

1391
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,773
Hmm.

1392
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,110
It's called a fag with a left guys.

1393
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,330
And then he came in with a
right to one of my favorite.

1394
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:13,830
What are you talking about? Something
I do on the street fighter I go to,

1395
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,610
I go 12 to six in the street fighting.
Just so you guys know, what do you think?

1396
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,790
How much different would Emma May
be if they had three minute rounds?

1397
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,460
Do you think you'd get a,
uh, a watered down product?

1398
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,900
Do you get a watered down product?

1399
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:34,140
Do you get more explosive and faster
paced, faster pace? Worst technique?

1400
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:38,850
Is that true? What about five? Three
minute rounds. Oh, he fell down. Oh Shit.

1401
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:42,300
What happened there? We'll get that
going for an arm bar. Ou on the break.

1402
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:45,400
That was weird. What happened?
[inaudible] just thinking, yeah,

1403
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,820
five three minute rounds instead of three,
five minute rounds.

1404
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:52,830
Do you think that that would be better
for like [inaudible] said it best.

1405
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:56,610
He said it's just too much time for
people to fight. It's like five,

1406
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,310
five minute rounds. He goes,
no, one 25 yeah, he goes,

1407
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:02,340
no one will really fight five five.
And from a guy who lost,

1408
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:06,560
answered and civil with two minutes
left and surely three minutes to go time

1409
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,610
fought a bunch of five
minute five round fights.

1410
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,590
You know he fought against Paula Filo,
right?

1411
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:12,460
Didn't he fight twice as
of five minutes where they,

1412
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,030
you see the trail at least
then you've got on one,

1413
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,380
the first one he got arm barred. Yeah.
The second one. And he wanted decision,

1414
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:22,660
but Filo didn't make weight so he
never got the belt. Yeah, that's right.

1415
01:22:22,661 --> 01:22:23,940
Cause so he knows what's
going on the line. Yeah.

1416
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:28,941
So was like the uncrowned champ at one
85 in the WEC really got fucked because

1417
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:31,860
he won that fight. Pretty
clear. That was awesome.

1418
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:35,350
One Paulo Filio was kind of going
a little kooks going cray cray,

1419
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,690
cray cray cray cray went missing Brazil.
Some shut that Tyson Tattoo on his face.

1420
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:43,210
I never found them with like amongst the
sheep or some shit. And Brazil, you know,

1421
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:48,180
choking cheap. I'm sorry, I was just
weird. I just had this thought. Um,

1422
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,100
and maybe your brother know,
uh,

1423
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:53,730
I was thinking about what Floyd
did to Canelo Alvarez. Yeah.

1424
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,070
And think about what Floyd,
oh, you're going back to this.

1425
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,700
My brother texts you this. Yeah. And he's
a shock. Just sent you this. I just said,

1426
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,020
might be your brother. Uh, remember that.

1427
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,250
I just remembered the Hail Chavez Jr

1428
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:12,040
and I'm Mexican. Cinco de
Mayo weekend, baby. Two years.

1429
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:15,120
Way tougher than he should be. He's a
tough dude. Tougher than he should be.

1430
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,700
In other words, you [inaudible] his dad's
fucking, he grew up wealthy with it.

1431
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:21,520
I mean like kids like that,
but his dad is Julio Cesar Chavez.

1432
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:24,240
Cholos ongoing for the gear teeth.
Guess what you're saying,

1433
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,730
but didn't work out Marcy
and he slept in satin sheets.

1434
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,790
It's rare to see his father in his fights.

1435
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:34,300
His father's like Bj Penn's
family's rich as far PJ pants,

1436
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,560
families wealthy to
look at this Joe Lozan.

1437
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:39,880
It's going for the fucking leg
arm and then there's, oh my God,

1438
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:43,720
he gave up the back. Ooh. Held
is so high level. High level.

1439
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:46,390
What is a helds?
A jujitsu credentials.

1440
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,210
He didn't win a Nogi gold title.

1441
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,170
He won gold in a super high
level. Oh, look at this man.

1442
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:56,620
He's wrapping up Cholos on a match to
keep that left arm on the outside though.

1443
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,390
That's critical. I think
you've been doing git, Cynthia.

1444
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:03,210
Cynthia's 12 to good moving here by Joe
Lowe's on. I like it. He's posturing op.

1445
01:24:03,211 --> 01:24:06,340
He's if Marcy, because if you're
going away from that left hand,

1446
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,640
he's essentially free. He's essentially
free here if he just keeps going. Yup.

1447
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,110
Oh No. Marcy and pulls him down. Oh, such
a strong move pulling them down there.

1448
01:24:14,111 --> 01:24:15,310
Joe was almost out.

1449
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,030
A lot of people like Joe Lowe's on
would've been out the door right there.

1450
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:20,200
He's almost choked here.

1451
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:24,100
He's in a real bad spot here because
in order to advance in this position,

1452
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,080
he's got to move and if he's got to move,

1453
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:29,320
he's got to make sure he moves his
chin tightly pressed to his neck here.

1454
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,550
Damn fucking sent Mike
Goldberg and the crowd. Wow.

1455
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:39,490
The crowd. That's kind of weird going
nuts. Who's his replacement again?

1456
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:44,050
Um, I don't know man. I don't
know cause I thought someone, Oh,

1457
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:49,190
nicely done. Thought they used that
grill. Grissom. Yeah. Is that true though?

1458
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:54,010
But he was on the, he was doing the pre
show like with the in in the UFC tonight.

1459
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:58,760
Yeah. I sturdy it was going to do this,
but Anik cause on this, so he's not ready.

1460
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,670
He's not doing that. Maybe
he's, maybe they're wrong.

1461
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:03,960
Maybe they just hired him for more that
pre show stuff like more analysts work

1462
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:08,110
instead of play by play and color. I
mean p people. Oh slows. Oh fuck it.

1463
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:12,640
I'm trying to fight God. Oh, Lowe's are
attacking man. I love that about him.

1464
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:16,210
Even though he's fighting a real elite
grappler. He's not afraid to dive.

1465
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:20,440
I showed my face, the watchmen
getting cutoff at the checkmate door,

1466
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:22,900
you know he gets to the door and check me.
He's getting cut off.

1467
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:27,660
It's a long career in some wars he da
highs but I mean also the difference is

1468
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:28,990
Marcin held is a really,

1469
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:32,890
really high level grappler and although
Lozan is taking some chances like when

1470
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:35,980
he's going for that arm bar, he gets
blocked on the way up and at it. Yeah.

1471
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:38,343
Pain.

1472
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:42,790
So they're keeping that skip guy on the
air even after he got caught tweeting to

1473
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:47,710
himself, Huh? Yeah. How embarrassing.
It said, didn't he say he's like,

1474
01:25:47,711 --> 01:25:51,250
you're the man. Skip, skip. You're,
you're a fucking genius. Shit.

1475
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:57,850
Tastes like a candy cane, but
didn't. He's rich as fuck man.

1476
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,850
He say somebody else was doing it for him,

1477
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,780
like he has somebody hired and I'll
give him nothing. He was just like, ah,

1478
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:07,250
I don't know. I don't know what he said
and I don't give a fuck what he said.

1479
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:11,750
The fact that it can, can, it can
ever happen. It can't ever happen.

1480
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,880
That guy gets fucking criminalized
online. Does he? All the time, does he?

1481
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:21,160
Oh, that's why he was like, great.

1482
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,940
Some catfish account. We need some super
positive energy. I'm sorry, just from me.

1483
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:30,690
That was all dudes, man, that just talk
sports. Fuck man. That, that Gig is hard,

1484
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:33,980
right? Sports writer. But
it's just talking sports,

1485
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:37,460
whether he's writing about it or not.
It's just Talk Baltimore, Dallas cowboys,

1486
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:40,400
you know, it's, there's a big
difference between a guy like, you know,

1487
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:44,980
a fucking Michael Ervin who is a
world class player who wants to talk,

1488
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,760
oh, look at this, look at me.

1489
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,920
Try to snatch up an arm
bar from the fucking guard

1490
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:54,890
and controlling the leg so
he can't step out. Oh Dude,

1491
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:59,110
this is fucking dangerous. If he submitted
him, oh, he's lost it now. He's lost it.

1492
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,990
He's lost it.
He doesn't,

1493
01:27:01,991 --> 01:27:05,620
he's not nearly as close as he was just
a few minutes ago. Oh my God. No, no, no.

1494
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:09,460
He's out now. He's out, dude.
He's out now. He's at home.
A black dot. No, no, no, no.

1495
01:27:09,461 --> 01:27:12,370
It's nowhere near. No
apologize. Oh, how dare you.

1496
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:16,660
You know is like a blue belt attempt.
Well, he got real close in the beginning,

1497
01:27:16,661 --> 01:27:19,440
but then you see this shift from the
guard. That's when you know you can relax.

1498
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:23,290
They're both outstanding.
He was at nine.

1499
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,510
He was at like nine out of 10
and then he went back to eight.

1500
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:28,750
And when you go from nine to eight
usually the other guy at this level,

1501
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,370
easily the the guy gets out of,
I'm so envious.

1502
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:36,040
Usually guys is such a knowledge
of Jujitsu. So, well listen man.

1503
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,340
Anthony Bordain didn't start training
two is 58 that could be you, Brian.

1504
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,000
You know what dude? Fuck it. The spinning
right now. I put my money on him.

1505
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:46,180
I think you would tap you. Do you think
Anthony Word didn't cause a purple belt?

1506
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:48,220
Yeah, he got a promo. I
thought he's a purple belt.

1507
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:51,900
I know he's a blue a and I never do.

1508
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,430
I don't think he's a purple belt.
I think he's still a blue belt,

1509
01:27:54,431 --> 01:27:57,640
but he trains regularly like,
I mean almost every day.
You know he's got tricks.

1510
01:27:57,641 --> 01:28:00,550
You know what they'll bluebell blue belt
and he's always traveling and he looks

1511
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:03,250
a little weathered. I'll take my
boy callin him. Maybe hung over.

1512
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:06,310
Callen scrappy though. Scrapping
and shape. I don't know.

1513
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:09,890
I mean essentially how much sand is
this motherfucker have lesson his hours.

1514
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,820
He's 60 years old. He hits
the booze. Hard count.

1515
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,360
Let's set this shit up on the under
card of soldier boy Chris Brown. Okay,

1516
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,720
I'm ready. You know what's
interesting about him in the 14 sport,

1517
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,120
Dane is essentially like,
um,

1518
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:26,190
he's a guy who has had numerous substance
problems in the past to heroin again.

1519
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:30,970
Exactly. But how alcoholic, you know,
he doesn't drink when he's at home.

1520
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,580
I mean he's not an alcoholic
and he's aware. Look,

1521
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:37,070
91 a fucking Ibj F J J f New York Open,

1522
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:41,770
he's every bit of six for everyone that
flows are there. 89 year old people.

1523
01:28:41,771 --> 01:28:43,630
He's choking, choking out. That's awesome.

1524
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:47,890
[inaudible] on top at one guy's got
an inch past the guard that age.

1525
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,220
He's awesome, pastor, broken hill. Um,

1526
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:56,390
but the point is so fucked up
went bad on him because me too.

1527
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,220
I love him too.

1528
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:01,800
But the thing is it's like he has taken
all those problems that he like his

1529
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,380
addictive tendencies and now
he's using him for Jujitsu.

1530
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:09,300
He's like addicted to Jujitsu. It's all
those like triathlons and shit. Right.

1531
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:12,600
You could be at least as
the same endorphins. Yeah.
That guy from the Cro mags.

1532
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:16,170
What's his name? John Joseph has
a best friend. Is that his name?

1533
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,320
I've known John since literally I
was 21 of your best friends. Yeah.

1534
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:23,300
I don't think he's one of your best
friends. My Chapter John. Johnny.

1535
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,500
Your best friends. I am. Are
you serious with the cause?

1536
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,340
I will fucking find him and I'll
bring him in here. No jobs. What am I?

1537
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:34,020
John's literally I've known John. Your
oldest runoff, you say no, no, no.

1538
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:37,740
One more time. Fuck No. John
and I are old. Let's go.

1539
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:42,250
If you ask John, I promise you, he
would say you're his best friend you in.

1540
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:45,030
Is he in your will? We spend a lot of
time together. We wrote a script together,

1541
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:45,650
man.

1542
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:50,650
John 74 and John Joseph wrote a script
together and in fact back I'll say how

1543
01:29:51,121 --> 01:29:52,230
far go back we go.

1544
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,160
John used to live on Ludlow in Remington
and Johnny's to have to meet me on

1545
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,350
which is what's expensive
real estate in New York.

1546
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:02,410
You and I've been there and Johnny's dad
to meet me on Houseton Street and walk

1547
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:05,190
me to his apartment or I would get
jumped because nobody knew me in that

1548
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,750
neighborhood.
That was how far back we went.

1549
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,120
We wrote a script together and I'll
tell you a crazy story doesn't mean he's

1550
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,170
your best friend getting jumped.
Why would you get jumped?

1551
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:14,560
Because no one knew you
in that neighborhood.

1552
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:16,610
That's how dangerous
jumped on Houseton stats,

1553
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:21,611
how games that neighborhood was in 19
I'll tell exactly when in 1990 1991 it was

1554
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:25,170
that bad dude.
You have no idea.

1555
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,240
So just applaud at Bronxdale
walkthrough and square.

1556
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,270
In 19 I met John in 1987 okay.
And John,

1557
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,830
when I was with John the
first time I met him,

1558
01:30:34,831 --> 01:30:39,750
it was 1987 and we walked through
Tompkins Square park and it was so fucking

1559
01:30:39,751 --> 01:30:41,040
dangerous.
I was just,

1560
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:45,240
I couldn't believe how James and
John John was very much feared.

1561
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:49,860
They called John and jail. Mighty Whitey.
John was a really suggest for a well.

1562
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,560
He did a lot of stuff.
John grew up in abandoned buildings.

1563
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,940
They don't be general bro. What do you
go to prison John to rob? I don't yeah,

1564
01:30:56,941 --> 01:30:58,970
talk about it. But Anyway, point is he,

1565
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:03,990
he had a problem with substances now and
now he's like this radical plant based

1566
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,040
triathlete guy. He's in the best
shape in the world. Eats Vegan food.

1567
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:12,630
He's in his 50s he does iron man. It's
fucking, he looks amazing. It's great.

1568
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:16,350
It's so fucking animal when it comes to
like conditioning and and workouts and

1569
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:18,680
rides his bike over night.
Sounds awesome. Sounds like,

1570
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,100
cause she also be used to give me that.
No,

1571
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:24,330
you dismissed him core and I know best
friends. I look, I mean, I said no,

1572
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:29,280
no gun for 70 years. 10 no longer, and
I've known John. I knew John Ferry.

1573
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:31,550
When's the last time you talked
to him? Uh, who do you know him?

1574
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:35,820
A text from Jay or John. Who Do you
know better? You? Hmm. Interesting.

1575
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,760
That's just because I spent time, but I,
I know general, how are we best friends?

1576
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:40,620
If this is my space is in your top 10.

1577
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,580
I tell you something even more important
about John [inaudible] nine isn't there.

1578
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,710
That's the last time I texted him. It
says, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

1579
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:50,150
He says,

1580
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:53,460
show why did he call you fag fog when
he's talking and he's watching the,

1581
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:57,610
I just watched a club song. Swanson don't
do who? Troy fire. Holy Shit. Amazing.

1582
01:31:57,611 --> 01:32:00,160
In front of the year. It's a while
ago. He and Mary Chris Essentially

1583
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,060
to my mom. I'm going a
little too hard. Yeah. No,

1584
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,610
but the point I'm making is
that we tell you something.

1585
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,750
If I explain to people that
you're one of my best friends,

1586
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:11,750
I don't have to go all through all
this. Zero. Everybody knows I've spent,

1587
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:14,680
I know Brian counts one of your best
friends because you're with them all the

1588
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:18,940
time. No, John, very everybody knows.
I talked to John. John did my podcast.

1589
01:32:18,941 --> 01:32:20,410
I know John Barry. Someone says, Hey,

1590
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:23,380
is Eddie Bravo a friend of yours or
any brown was one of my best friends.

1591
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,130
I don't have to say Eddie Bro.
No.

1592
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:27,850
To chose what's used to hope me
and walk me through the true cause.

1593
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:30,180
People are going to drop me
and go, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1594
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:33,700
Texted me and said Merry Christmas.
John and I were trying to show people,

1595
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,710
look at texts from Eddie.
We're very close.

1596
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,890
I've got eight gigs of texts
from Eddie and they're all memes.

1597
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,790
He always sends me fucking Hilarious,
hilarious.

1598
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:45,820
Eddie Bravo has some fucking
hilarious memes in his,

1599
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:47,690
in his chambers and there's savage

1600
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,940
savage means today.

1601
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:55,840
It's a totally whole new element
when it comes to losing fights.

1602
01:32:56,450 --> 01:33:00,760
Did when I was fight, who's wearing this
fight? Listen to something really weird.

1603
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:05,200
I think it might be Lozan it is lives
on but but Marcin it's gotten some real

1604
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:07,930
good positions where I have to tell
you the story about John Jones. You No,

1605
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:10,330
you definitely don't. You can
stop now. No, I know each.

1606
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,520
What you're trying to do can let it go.
I don't care about that.

1607
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,790
You believe that or not. But listen,
listen, I've got a great story.

1608
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:18,490
I'm still waiting for the lower east side.
It listened lower east side.

1609
01:33:18,491 --> 01:33:20,830
They were used to be a
guy who used to rap it.

1610
01:33:20,831 --> 01:33:24,400
He'd be naked and he used to wrap himself
in a smokey work movie. No, listen,

1611
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:28,460
listen, God dammit. Fuck.

1612
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:31,350
There is various,
I ave a,

1613
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:34,810
there was a guy used to roll himself in
a carpet and he was naked and he would

1614
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:35,710
want people to,
he would,

1615
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,570
he would ask you to step on
him cause he would be trekking.

1616
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,330
Finish on your podcast,
episode seven he was on your pump.

1617
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,940
How many upset they'd be done.
I've seen John Do. I've seen John.

1618
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:52,030
I saw John Give when John had no money.
John is the most generous person.

1619
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:55,720
While I saw him give this homeless dude
who he knew had nowhere to stay for the,

1620
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:59,950
for the night. I saw him going,
oh, you can't do that. Whoa.

1621
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:03,760
He did like a wheel kick to the head
on the ground striving to go for it,

1622
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:06,430
whatever. I know, well he was trying
to step over and do a triangle,

1623
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:09,850
but it looked like it was almost
going for a wheel kick on the ground.

1624
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:12,670
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe he was trying to set up a triangle.

1625
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:16,050
You really paid much attention at all
know you're just trying to defend John Doe

1626
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:21,560
watching it. Watching John John's
one of the best people on it.

1627
01:34:21,561 --> 01:34:23,560
I believe you.
I believe it seems like it.

1628
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:27,310
And I saw this documentary where they
followed him around and they followed him

1629
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:30,880
on his bike riding and and is
a food preparation. You know,

1630
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:34,860
he's really into eating real foods.
This is the work loads on fucked up you,

1631
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:38,590
you can't just jump guard on
a guy like held like that.

1632
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,050
Judges Eyes you lose too. Well especially
because he never had it. You know?

1633
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,420
I mean as soon as held.
Feels like he's got guillotine on him.

1634
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:50,860
He goes to side control. He passed in
the transition in the take down. Yeah,

1635
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:51,521
exactly.

1636
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:54,910
So that's the difference between a super
high level guy that's used to avoiding

1637
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:57,650
that stuff all the time. He's
thinking two, three ahead.

1638
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:02,250
Whereas maybe Lowe's ons only thinking
maybe two or one, you know, I mean he,

1639
01:35:02,251 --> 01:35:03,440
he saw it,
he went for it.

1640
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,980
I admire that Lowe's on went for a bunch
of shit there me to try that arm bar

1641
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:07,491
and the ground.

1642
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:11,840
But I feel like that transition where
he had Marcin hurt like you know,

1643
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:15,160
and then he dove on him on the
ground if he had just separated.

1644
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:16,491
If you just separate,

1645
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,180
I mean smashing with those elbows if
he had just created them subspace and

1646
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:21,670
avoided the collision strike.
Yeah.

1647
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:26,540
Especially when a guy of that high
caliber grappling, his default is Jujitsu,

1648
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:29,300
don't you feel like by himself?
It's his natural reaction to defense.

1649
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:32,220
Sometimes like scrappy
dude's like Lowe's on,

1650
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,600
they want to prove a point maybe
and try to submit a guy like held,

1651
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:39,410
which would be, oh, that makes sense. Cap
kind of an ego thing. So he decides, look,

1652
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:40,970
I'm not scared to grapple with this Kyle,

1653
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:44,240
do everything with this guy instead of
like sticking to a very calculated game

1654
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:44,700
plan.
Yeah.

1655
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:48,170
Alan Belcher did that with the Paul
Harris went buckling grab that leg.

1656
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:53,940
Beautiful Defense on the ground to do.
He's one of the only fun and I saw him at,

1657
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:56,330
we had an appearance together with,
for the FCF though.

1658
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,730
And I went do I just got to,
I've never done this.

1659
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:00,650
I just got to give you a fucking hug.
I was like,

1660
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:05,270
I was so scared for any man who cause he
had a leg like master come in with him

1661
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:08,430
to a, might've been lister who
came on Benlysta. It might've been,

1662
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,890
he's also high level black belt.

1663
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:14,840
Find out how to train to Alan Belcher
for the WHO Samar Paul Howard has fight.

1664
01:36:14,841 --> 01:36:19,150
Who Smart. This was spelled with an r
Paul hurray. See it be a top nine. Uh,

1665
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:22,520
my space for it and fill that up. Let
me open another bottle guys. Why we,

1666
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:26,510
why worry. Hey, am I in your top
nine? If it's my space, you are buddy.

1667
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,180
I'm about seven or eight. Are
you, are you both from my staff?

1668
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,910
Get the random New York
guy is two or three

1669
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:38,060
big in from New York. Defended you
from the bumps sucking your Dick Three.

1670
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:43,310
Where am I? Is that dude? I got to tell
you. I'll tell you a story about John Doe.

1671
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:48,260
No, no, no, no stories about him. Please.
No mom. He was a tough guy to get tattoos.

1672
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:52,370
I remember. I just shut the fuck
bro. You fucking this guy. Hey.

1673
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:59,540
Oh No, no, no, no decision. Decision
securities on Marcin tiny cut.

1674
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:04,030
All those kids who wins this decision? I
was on stage with them. Joe. Joe Lozan.

1675
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:05,013
Ah,

1676
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:09,500
oh it's but decision low first
one for held second one for Lozan

1677
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:10,763
what?

1678
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,850
But this isn't Joe Loza.

1679
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:18,180
Joe on Marcin held feeling kind
of fucking salty. Wow. Walks away.

1680
01:37:18,181 --> 01:37:23,130
Motherfucker can't buy a winning the UFC
two two down two down was good though

1681
01:37:23,131 --> 01:37:25,770
that Jon Anik. No, they're
throwing them to the dogs.

1682
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:33,430
Powerful Joe Lozan. Congratulations.
Awesome. As giant for him.

1683
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:38,770
Powerful gray hair by a friend Anik.
Yeah. Looks like John. Go by Dean lister.

1684
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:41,980
Yeah. So Dean No. Who said
yes? That is what he said.

1685
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,740
So Dean is the guy that helped out John.
Donna,

1686
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:49,180
her initially and dean is also
the guy that helped out um,

1687
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:54,040
uh, Alan Belcher for the who smart
Paul Harris fight. And then of course,

1688
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,920
like we said,
Donna train

1689
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,030
tonin who went toe to toe cookie.
This like this position here. Matt,

1690
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,170
when he had held Foxville there,
he had held and all sorts of trouble.

1691
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:07,800
Classic Travis Browne move. Yeah. I
just feel like he should have separated,

1692
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:12,000
maybe just struck and not go to Jitsu.
That's his wheelhouse.

1693
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:13,163
You know what it's like.

1694
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:17,160
It's like when Nogueira had fucking
frank Mir against remarried blast on that

1695
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:19,290
right hand and then shoots for the guilty.

1696
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,510
Frank Mir is a black belt through
and through them was a cold.

1697
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,520
Let me figure this shit out.

1698
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,310
Instead he could just pull it back and
knock them out. Yup. Different story.

1699
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:29,220
Tell the story about John Joseph.
Shut

1700
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:34,620
ass. If I could just get
one more judge as a story.

1701
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:36,960
And do you remember early on at Frank Mir,
his career,

1702
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:38,850
his first fight ever in the UFC?

1703
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,510
He won Roberto [inaudible].

1704
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,360
He caught him in a fucking arm
bar and snapped his arm. God.

1705
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:48,570
So traveling was a world Jujitsu champion.

1706
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:52,560
He was a black belt and I think Frank
Mir was a purple belt and Frank Mir just

1707
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:54,630
jumped on him.
He cracked him with the shot,

1708
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,040
took his arm and snapped it and tapped
him. You know, frank is asking the,

1709
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:00,630
you'll see like, please
just let me go. He goes,

1710
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:02,220
I won't even fight in the UFC and compete.

1711
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,920
I'll fighting like Russia or some shit.
He just wants to fight.

1712
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:08,090
He just wants to fight for what's
going on with the UFC isn't one that

1713
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,730
suspension. Yeah, but if he has a
suspension, he can't fight anywhere else.

1714
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,990
Brushes like,
oh right.

1715
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:18,360
How about the lizard suit?
How about when he said

1716
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:24,000
fucking inject your asshole.
Fuck you want. When he said,

1717
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:26,730
he said when he used
to first be in the UFC,

1718
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,390
he wouldn't warm up before we'd go
out to a fight. He said, yeah. I said,

1719
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:33,270
what do you mean? He goes, well, to me
it's a fight. If I get in a real fight,

1720
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,810
I'm not warmed up.
If I'm stepping in the octagon,

1721
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:39,000
I'm not going to warm up for a sec.
It was like a mental thing for him.

1722
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:42,480
It just makes no sense. That's not
smart. I need to talk to him. Yeah.

1723
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:46,140
Well I think now he's doing it
though. Yeah, no, you get old. Well,

1724
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:50,130
Valentino Shift Chenko and Julianna Pena.
Interesting fight man.

1725
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:51,520
Interesting fight pinion.

1726
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:55,470
You got to get that fight to the ground
yet verse Nunez is a flood fight. Well,

1727
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,300
I mean this has got to happen first.
And then when Shevchenko um, and,

1728
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:02,520
and Juliet opinion fight,

1729
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:06,210
we're gonna find out a lot about how she
shove Chanko can deal with relentless

1730
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:11,190
ground and pound and take downs.
Pena is fucking strong for one 35.

1731
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:15,980
She malls girls got wind straight to like
a crazy, she's very tough. Yeah. Well,

1732
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,600
she just beat cat but it
was cats comeback fight.

1733
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:22,050
Cat had been out for a long time.
Huge wins. Good fight. The good fight,

1734
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,660
a good fight for her.
And this is a big fight for her.

1735
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:29,550
This is like really all the marbles,
you know that was seen as a game changer.

1736
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:33,360
Valentine is fucking cheese. No
joke man. She's fucking scary.

1737
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,810
Beat Holly on the Chicago
Card. Right. And she,

1738
01:40:35,811 --> 01:40:40,170
she shows that nasty fucking
right hook man where she,

1739
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:44,340
she stands that southpaw stance and she
slides back and just catches you with

1740
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:48,270
that check. Yeah, it's
fucking interesting fight man.

1741
01:40:48,271 --> 01:40:51,630
Cause this girl is as game as they come.
Pena is Super Fun.

1742
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,440
There's some good prospects in Invicta,
US catching some of the highlights,

1743
01:40:56,441 --> 01:40:58,090
I think it was last
night or two nights ago.

1744
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:01,510
You see that one fight where the
girl choked a girl to sleep, find,

1745
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:03,370
find out what that is. It's
on, it's on the underground.

1746
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,700
Jamie and choke the girls sleep in lost,

1747
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:11,140
put her to sleep at the end of the
third round and she was out cold at the

1748
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:14,530
buzzer. So it should have been end of the
fight and then they fucking went to the

1749
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:16,240
judges' scorecards and the
court that the decision,

1750
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:20,800
but it violates everything about
fighting that violates everything about

1751
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:25,510
fighting Donald Roni Jorge Mas I'm excited
about. That's in Denver. Yeah. Good,

1752
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:30,490
good. Fox Card. Serone Denver crowd.
Jorge Mosfet. It looks so damn good.

1753
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:34,000
But he's, I think Donald's got,
they're both very good. Hurry.

1754
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,940
Mosfets I'll just be up. Jake Ellenberger
and his last fight, he's a big,

1755
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:40,690
big victory for him and Mazda
doll was super sneaky. Real.

1756
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:44,500
That's such a good matchup when boxer.
Excellent boxer. Not just a great boxer.

1757
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:47,590
Very good. Take down defense. Very
good submissions. You get everything.

1758
01:41:47,591 --> 01:41:49,620
You remember.
He's the original backyard brawler too.

1759
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:52,900
And he's fighting Donald though.
He was in the Kimbo slice backyard balls.

1760
01:41:52,901 --> 01:41:56,380
We fought bare knuckle in Miami. Yeah.
One of my favorite days on Youtube,

1761
01:41:56,381 --> 01:42:00,400
man fight you bare knuckle. And
He, he's a schooled boxer though.

1762
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:03,370
He'd seemed to educate and get it
everything very good at everything.

1763
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:07,990
He's a legit 100% mixed martial
artists. Hey, did you see, uh,

1764
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:13,150
Robbie Lawler left? Att said, deuces. Why?

1765
01:42:13,151 --> 01:42:18,070
Where does he's just inject themselves
that new young blood and fucking get it.

1766
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:21,760
Go to Mancini's fucking ways that
legal, that would be legal. Right?

1767
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:25,720
They can't Sanaa, they just
gonna stop you. They won't
even know you did it. Yeah.

1768
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:29,700
Or you get somebody who can get the
young guy even allowed to do an ivy blown

1769
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,860
blood dope with a young fucking upon.
Is this John Wick two,

1770
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:33,723
cause I might be all in.

1771
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:40,290
He drives Holy Shit.
Shit.

1772
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:45,640
Deep vineyards. Those mouth.
John Wick. Not only does he
drive a muscle car, he uh,

1773
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:46,121
he,
he,

1774
01:42:46,121 --> 01:42:50,080
oh look at this in the motorcycle and
they killed his dog and that's why you had

1775
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:53,710
to fuck everybody up. John. My
first John Wick. So underrated. Oh,

1776
01:42:53,711 --> 01:42:57,340
it's a great fucking time. I saw him
at Starbucks. I'm gonna Shit my pants.

1777
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:01,310
He's tall, isn't he? He's a
lot taller. Jumped on a Harley.

1778
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:05,830
Do you know what his national joint, you
know what? He's half Japanese. No Korean.

1779
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:08,050
No Gay.
I like your attitude so far.

1780
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,320
More guesses but not Filipino either.

1781
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:17,470
Keep, keep guessing what he's half because
one side's white and the other side,

1782
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:20,320
if I go James Kelly or John
[inaudible] not rushing,

1783
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:22,540
I'm going to have to have you keep
guessing. I don't give a fuck.

1784
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,030
It's come up with, it's important
just to come up. Hold on. Hold on.

1785
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:29,140
Let me look at his face. Look
Chinese. Okay. No, just say Asia.

1786
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:33,140
These guys sat and chat. Tell me
Shit you're telling microphone off.

1787
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:36,640
That's what it is. That's what
it is. What? And after this,

1788
01:43:36,641 --> 01:43:40,280
I got to John Justice story,
but listen to this one more real quick.

1789
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:43,240
Can you believe it?
He's half Samoan.

1790
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:47,560
I can't believe you even bothered
his fucking waste our time shuffling.

1791
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:51,040
It's a tough one. But he's big. He's
so big. He's tall. He's six, two

1792
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:55,670
easy. Hey, how much excited about just
getting money. Did he make off Matrix? Uh,

1793
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:59,840
hundreds. Hundreds of millions. Darlene.
He bought like all the stunt guys.

1794
01:43:59,841 --> 01:44:04,650
Harley's, I think that don't mean
shit. Wow. He's so rich. Yeah.

1795
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,110
I just loved that movie,
man.

1796
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:09,110
I look at the stupid movie and it's
ridiculous and it's unrealistic,

1797
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:11,910
but I like a guy who drives a muscle
car and fucks everybody. I miss,

1798
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:16,600
I never saw any solo. There's no
sidekick. He cough. No. Hell Yeah,

1799
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:21,010
I'm Cobra with some esters.
Bet your sweet ass this.

1800
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:25,610
And he comes out and he's got a match
in his mouth. He drove the old car.

1801
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:29,870
That cool old car was it? What was it
up? Okay, here's the, what is the fight?

1802
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:32,960
What is the fight, Jamie? What does
it say? He where she gets, okay,

1803
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:36,380
well we'll find out who it was, but
check this out. Watch the transition.

1804
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,720
This is the end of the fight.
Check it out.

1805
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:42,410
So there's a scramble and in the
scramble, okay, well this is way later,

1806
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,290
but the girl catches like a room naked,

1807
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:47,720
choke from the side and puts the
girls asleep. She's hanging out.

1808
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:48,920
Buzzer watch gets up.

1809
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:53,030
Girls out cold fights over
game over game over 100% kill.

1810
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,800
That girl is out too fucking cold.
Like [inaudible] seconds.

1811
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:00,150
Powerful Gracie Baha on the booty right
in front of you as you cannot have good

1812
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:06,440
representation. Find out who it
was. Young Jamie. It's his hog.

1813
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,920
Haga well just find out who it was.
If I just find out who was hug up,

1814
01:45:09,921 --> 01:45:13,700
put him on an actual names. Well it,
let's find the actual names of both girls.

1815
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:16,670
Tell me what's happening. They've to
last night, so see if you could find it.

1816
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:20,120
But anyway, point being it's terrible
officiating when someone's asleep,

1817
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:22,340
the fights over period.
End of discussion.

1818
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:26,450
She's like getting knocked out with one
second ago. It doesn't just because, oh,

1819
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:28,010
you're out cold,
but Dang,

1820
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:31,960
there's the bell out girls trying
to fight in UFC too. Right.

1821
01:45:31,961 --> 01:45:34,010
Then she got on the mic. I was like,
put me in the fucking, you'll see it.

1822
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:37,460
It's just one. Let me see what she goes
in the UFC and I didn't see her fight.

1823
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:40,630
That's Kinda hot. I saw a few
seconds of her fight, but I had it.

1824
01:45:40,631 --> 01:45:43,940
I was running after this one girl on this
card that will knock your dick in the

1825
01:45:43,941 --> 01:45:47,180
dirt. Hold on Jamie. Say it
again. Jamie. Amy Montenegro.

1826
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:51,830
It's if she defeated Celine Haiga v
Vienna unanimous decision while being

1827
01:45:51,831 --> 01:45:55,910
unconscious type moved. Girl.
Fuck that. So in my world,

1828
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:00,590
Celine Haiga wins, but we don't
live in the mountains. No, no, they,

1829
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:03,860
they change that.
They really weren't stats that fight can,

1830
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:07,610
there's no way that stays. They reversed
that. They reversed that. You can't,

1831
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,860
you can't have that. You can't
have that. That, that, that,

1832
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,720
that's an offense to find a j pal.
Hey,

1833
01:46:11,721 --> 01:46:14,490
let's go ahead and call it the
girl at one. At one 45 though. Huh?

1834
01:46:14,491 --> 01:46:17,070
I'm kind of neat.
Some fucking contenders up there.

1835
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:20,030
It says was at the Buzzer and she lost.
She put her asleep.

1836
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:24,790
Still loses on scorecards. So what?
That's that's bad officiating. Cause yeah,

1837
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:29,450
she was all before the bell rang. Exactly.
The swings over in fights over ref air.

1838
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:33,080
Yeah. The ref made a huge mistake.
He fucked up. They should appeal.

1839
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:36,810
They'll which state is that in? If they
don't win? It's a huge injustice. No.

1840
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:40,670
When I will fly out there and
piss on you say Kansas City,

1841
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:45,350
Missouri, get your shit together.
Your chiefs already fucking lost.

1842
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:48,020
Figured this guy's taekwondo
reminds me of me when I was young.

1843
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:50,060
Shut your fucking mouth.
Yes.

1844
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:55,030
All right. Don't wait before you even
get to the be putting babies in it.

1845
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,310
I'm like, all right, I'll replay the video
of your sidekick lesson guys, my wheels,

1846
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,680
I'll just sit at a recording.
Gold things.

1847
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:04,830
Glad there's no video of my wheel
kick in the air. I've seen it. Dammit.

1848
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,350
These worth every live show.
If they ask for it,

1849
01:47:07,351 --> 01:47:10,580
B o two is Austin and I'm
in jeans. I'm like, Nah, eh.

1850
01:47:10,581 --> 01:47:13,450
You wear athletic shoes cause you
know they're going to ask Brendan Cha.

1851
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:17,340
I forgot that Sean sherk
knockout. That's Shawn shirt. Oh,

1852
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:20,570
back in the day to remember Pete.

1853
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,620
I was texting this the other day at
a random thought about Sean shirt.

1854
01:47:23,621 --> 01:47:26,850
Cause my brain is very strange. He was
a beast. He's a piece. It was a beast.

1855
01:47:26,851 --> 01:47:29,280
You know I remember for it though.
Shitty shitty teeth though.

1856
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,110
They were like a real, like a real
maaco shark's teeth. Very sharp teeth.

1857
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:37,370
I don't remember that at all.
I know superficial.

1858
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:41,670
I keep checking it all text.
Joe Remembers Diego. Not at all.

1859
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:47,010
My picture from structured smiling. I
know Brendan, I'll pick up some stuff.

1860
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,880
There's this teeth looks totally
normal. Handsome guy, good clean,

1861
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:54,000
its bottom teeth, teeth, get it. All
those teeth. Small guy. I don't see,

1862
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:58,920
I don't get it looks like a jigsaw puzzle.
You're so weird.

1863
01:47:58,921 --> 01:48:00,540
Would you get your teeth
fixed if you were him?

1864
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:03,770
Would that be before or after
you got your fake Tan? Like if

1865
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:10,490
he's all natural? Oh yeah. Videos.

1866
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:14,130
They show him with like white
weighted vest and climbing up stairs.

1867
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:18,360
Just this little fucking get some of the
most insane strength and conditioning

1868
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:18,841
workouts.

1869
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:23,841
He was Jack Shark and you ever fucking
forget it and he had a tunnel under his

1870
01:48:24,451 --> 01:48:29,451
house and went straight to Mexico
and that's what all of his vitamins,

1871
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,550
all his fucking shark blood,
all his bull shark blood,

1872
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:36,970
just pull it right out of was shark.

1873
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:39,120
They would grind up great white sharks,

1874
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:41,970
dicks and put it in a protein
shake for him every morning.

1875
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,820
He was such a savage for a while.
Oh Man.

1876
01:48:45,821 --> 01:48:49,740
We lost a Bj and then ran out of the
arena. They found him underneath the car.

1877
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:53,580
Well, he's trying to hide chewing on the
muffler test. Right. That's not true.

1878
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:55,240
They're trying to test him.
No,

1879
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:58,830
he was fucking Bob because Bj through
a flying knee and knocked him out.

1880
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:02,640
Bj beat the shit out of him and then he
ran under MGM. It was under a van. Look,

1881
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,270
he looks very fine man. I love
that. This goes one of two ways.

1882
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:10,260
Either we feel really bad for beach and
he gets just outclassed by young line or

1883
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:13,270
I think it's a fucking five rounds scrap.
Well this,

1884
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:17,310
it's not going to be five round.
Look how fucking intense Bj looks,

1885
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:21,390
man say he's never fought anybody
with this kind of style. Yeah,

1886
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:22,280
no one has a style,

1887
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,670
can't mimic is very good at
scrambling off of his back too.

1888
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,350
He's really good from the bottom,

1889
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:33,150
and that's going to be really interesting
because Bj has a fucking crushing top

1890
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:38,151
game and he had a crushing top game at
55 and above at one 45 which is where

1891
01:49:38,521 --> 01:49:42,240
he's at. And apparently he's
been making 45 easy and you know,

1892
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:46,350
he just is super focused on cardio's but
train at Jackson's for a long time now

1893
01:49:46,351 --> 01:49:48,160
because he's had two cancellations,

1894
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:51,370
one injury cancellation,
one ivy cancellation.

1895
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:55,920
He took an ivy out of competition
because he was dehydrated, hard,

1896
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:58,930
hard training session and was honest
about it. Just said, yeah, you know,

1897
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:02,290
I took an ivy, I just had some water
putting in his body. It's nothing.

1898
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,250
It really is nothing.

1899
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,090
This was in the La cartoon and they
pulled him from the card because of that.

1900
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,280
So he's had a ton of time.

1901
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:12,550
The positive is he's at a ton
of time and he's never wavered.

1902
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,890
He's been at Jackson's a whole time.
How old is he now?

1903
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:18,190
BJ's 38 it's not any as Carrillo.

1904
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,810
He has Winkeljohn his corner
and Jackson coach's corner,

1905
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:26,830
man pearls and excellent boxing
coach. Excellent. Excellent box.

1906
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:28,370
Perillo let's chase him.

1907
01:50:28,371 --> 01:50:32,670
Pro x only works with the best of the
best creme de la creme. He's, he's very,

1908
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:36,190
very, and he's what Bj for a long
fucking time. Well, you know,

1909
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:41,290
Bj just felt real bad about how his
fight with Frankie Edgar went and he just

1910
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:44,860
just really just felt like that wasn't
him. It was a strange style. His,

1911
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:48,910
he was up on his toes. He was almost
in that boxing style, which was crazy.

1912
01:50:48,911 --> 01:50:52,030
It wasn't even like a boxing style.
It's like his legs are so close together.

1913
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,313
He dancing,

1914
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:58,340
he thought that he thought it'd be more
efficient and it'd be used less energy.

1915
01:50:58,751 --> 01:50:59,830
That was the idea behind it.

1916
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:03,850
And he apparently had been doing it and
camp and had been working not against

1917
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:07,120
frank Yeager who didn't exist. And that
double leg. Well, it's also, you know,

1918
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:11,620
you're going right in against
Frankie Edgar. This boy,
he's a young fucking lying,

1919
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:12,910
so athletic.

1920
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,890
He's so like kicking with
those crazy taekwondo kicks
and well, here's the thing.

1921
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:22,350
I mean, Jay might have the best chin
in the history of fighting at this age.

1922
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:24,520
You might have the best chance
still has not been knocked out.

1923
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:28,720
His name's been knocking up.
He's been stopped. He got
stopped by Frankie on cuts.

1924
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:31,810
You know, Frankie got on top of him and
beat the shit off. I stopped working.

1925
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:34,240
Didn't knock them out, didn't
knock him out. He took shots,

1926
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:39,040
got beat up by Rory McDonald when Roy
was a legit one 70 top of the food chain.

1927
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:42,220
One 70 Roy beat the shit out
of him and he didn't stop him.

1928
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,980
Nick Diaz beat the fuck out
of him when he didn't stop.

1929
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:47,410
Another one has never been
knocked out. Uh, Nick Diaz,

1930
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:51,150
but George Saint Pierre
stopped him. George Saint
Pierre kept him on his corner.

1931
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:54,580
He kept him on a stool in between
the corner, but just overwhelmed him,

1932
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:59,200
beat him up and just Malden.
When George was at the top of his game,

1933
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:01,030
they stopped that fight early.
Yes.

1934
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:06,940
I never root against,
I'm not rooting for anybody in this fight.

1935
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:11,530
This fight for me is like Ken,
the legend comeback. I mean,

1936
01:52:11,531 --> 01:52:14,770
does he have it in his shell? Does you
have it in his body? Is the evidence will,

1937
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:18,190
how has he been treating his body?
How has he been taking care of himself?

1938
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:19,780
Where's his motivation?
You know,

1939
01:52:19,781 --> 01:52:24,100
does he look at this as one last shot
at redemption and then this fucking kid

1940
01:52:24,101 --> 01:52:26,830
who is just a assassin,

1941
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:32,310
he's so good and so hungry and he's
coming up and he's so dynamic and he shows

1942
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:36,730
all of this massive potential.
He has incredible creativity.

1943
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:40,720
He has unbelievable dexterity
in his legs. That, uh,

1944
01:52:40,721 --> 01:52:42,030
Andrew feely knockout.

1945
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:46,040
We're hitting with that flying
switch round kick dude. He's

1946
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,360
no joke. He can do things that no one
else can. So like what? He's like,

1947
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:55,010
he's like a top level taekwondo fighter
who also knows how to fight on the

1948
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:56,300
ground.
Who also knows how to box.

1949
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:01,100
He brought into host Josie Algos camp to
get them ready for, no, that wasn't him.

1950
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:04,910
That was the,
the jungle.

1951
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:09,020
The jungle or something like that. He's
in jungle fights. He's a different cat.

1952
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:12,740
That guy's a killer too. I don't
know. Yes, he is. God dammit.

1953
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:17,410
Why am I blanking on his name?
Jonas Jonas speed.

1954
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:21,710
God dammit. What is his last
name? Chimp jungle fight. Champ,

1955
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:25,850
Jonah speed brought in to help Josie,
Josie Aldo.

1956
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:31,070
And he looks at us like Jamie, we'll
find bill or you know. Yeah, Bill Marino.

1957
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:35,630
Bill Reno's a pad. Motherfucker.
But you know he's, he will.

1958
01:53:35,631 --> 01:53:36,890
He'll come over eventually,
I'm sure.

1959
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:41,980
But he's a fight in jungle fight and he
put up a highlight reel of Jonah's Bill

1960
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:44,720
Marino. Man, it's some crazy shit, but he,

1961
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:47,810
that's one of the reasons why they
brought him in for Connor. Didn't work.

1962
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:53,420
Didn't help. Thanks for all the
18 second bill reno doesn't have,

1963
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:55,190
is that fucking pissed?

1964
01:53:55,191 --> 01:53:59,800
And on the left hand that contradicts
with the Irish x back then. Well,

1965
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,210
he's also got a fucking
Iron Chin and he's a sad,

1966
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,390
I get that nasty with his kicks man.

1967
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:10,220
Testy leans way back. You can't punch him.
That was around kicked butt. Thanks. No,

1968
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:14,180
I'm saying before that a switch
switch hands switch. High kick. Yeah,

1969
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:17,330
he's nasty. Well, you know
what, man, there's a ton,

1970
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:20,570
a ton of those guys now
all over the world. Yes.

1971
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:23,900
There's a ton of those guys who are
traditional kill Kachin fighters,

1972
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:26,900
traditional Moy Thai fighters,
and they're getting an MMA now.

1973
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:31,180
Gaston Bolanos is making his
fucking MMA debut in [inaudible].

1974
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,560
Is He everybody be working
on your takedowns skills?

1975
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,650
You best work on those takedowns Kilstein
funds the standard.

1976
01:54:38,930 --> 01:54:42,800
You're standing with a legit moy time
master. I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

1977
01:54:42,801 --> 01:54:47,150
Randy couture, James, Tony Guy. Look at
how hard this guy has to hit. Look at us.

1978
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:50,780
Yeah, he's, he's nasty. And then
again, then again, it's not the to say,

1979
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:53,760
but he's beautiful from that
southpaw stance and he show,

1980
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:58,460
he throws that nasty leg kick or a nasty
left kick rather to the body. Holy Shit.

1981
01:54:58,461 --> 01:55:02,450
We're about to watch BJ Penn. Fuck. Fuck
that guy. Yeah. Put Bill Marino off.

1982
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:06,740
Let's focus. Let's focus
focusing guys for Brendan Shop.

1983
01:55:06,741 --> 01:55:10,580
How are you feeling right
now? I'm a little nervous. I
just, Bj is one of my faves.

1984
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,260
Bryan county paying attention. This are
you thinking of John Joseph Stories?

1985
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:18,150
I got a lot. I got a bunch. I
tell him and be like, you know,

1986
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:21,430
last thing about John Jackson,
one more thing. If I could just,

1987
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:24,260
there's this time we juiced and then we
fucked each other and then we went and

1988
01:55:24,261 --> 01:55:26,830
ate vegan food. I don't know. I
almost turned me into a Greek.

1989
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,620
I dove into a crowd off of his
stage when he was in the Cro mags,

1990
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:34,820
we shut the fuck up.
I was choking her story.

1991
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:39,500
It was the scariest time for me
because I'm a radical, excuse me.

1992
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:44,910
Come on, be Jay. It's time.
Nothing worse than seeing a legend.

1993
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:49,530
Just give her a murderer.
He's finding out like the new blood.

1994
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:49,981
By the way,

1995
01:55:49,981 --> 01:55:53,280
Bruce buffer has a blown ACL while we
screaming and jumping around up there.

1996
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:56,550
Yeah. He has not had the surgery because
he does not want to take the time off of

1997
01:55:56,551 --> 01:56:01,410
announcing that bumper. A God damn
savage. I don't want to see the UFC,

1998
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:04,950
but I Bruce buffer, he's a savage. He's
just, he's amazing. This is a proper,

1999
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:09,951
is the greatest ring announcer in
the world ever crack going virtually

2000
01:56:10,951 --> 01:56:14,990
identical. Oh, how dare you. He's,

2001
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:19,650
he's yelling out for Bj to embrace the
grind. Bj, the brace and the grind.

2002
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:24,210
But this is in Mike's Mike's hometown.
Mike. Mike fucking loves him. I'm a man.

2003
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,280
Oh yeah, he does PJ's girl. Miss Mike.

2004
01:56:26,281 --> 01:56:29,580
I'm sure I will stay in contact
with Mike to the day I die. Yeah.

2005
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,920
Mike is my friend. And um, you know,

2006
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:35,070
the UFC was sold to WME.

2007
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:38,290
They have their own thoughts
on what they want to do and uh,

2008
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:41,790
I will be friends with my Gober till the
day I die. I love that guy to sign off.

2009
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:46,030
Shit. I'm so good. I didn't know what
to do. And one of those old weird,

2010
01:56:46,031 --> 01:56:49,410
I know videos. They didn't want to
man, you know, I don't, I don't know.

2011
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,350
I don't know what's going on.
You said terms. I know. Well,

2012
01:56:52,351 --> 01:56:56,740
I don't know what's going on in terms of
organizations, you know, I don't either.

2013
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,510
I don't know. I literally know Dana and
Dana is a reason why I'm still there.

2014
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:04,020
I mean, I've met Ari. He's a very
nice guy. He's a very smart guy.

2015
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:06,870
He's a very successful guy.
I wished them all the best.

2016
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:10,050
I'm rooting for them 100% obviously I'm
still with the company. I love them.

2017
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:14,790
I'm a, it's an honor to work for
the UFC, but I have, I'm you know,

2018
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,860
but if you're out. Oh yes. Oh,
he's the only reason why I'm there.

2019
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:23,730
If Dana trophies there, but he's
like on the, I lie all the time.

2020
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:34,020
I'm going to be 50 in August. I like
staying home. I like playing with my kids.

2021
01:57:34,021 --> 01:57:37,980
I like doing Jujitsu. I like
playing pool. I like doing yoga.

2022
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:42,690
I've been rolling again. Loving it.
We're at John Shock. Machado's nice.

2023
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,170
I've been doing a little gay role
and get less of that shit right away.

2024
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:48,690
Kick to the body. Kick to the
body. Keep forehand. The three,

2025
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:53,691
four 52 first round if you want to sync
is going to get no advice to Bj Penn and

2026
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:58,150
I know, I know. Please shut the fuck
up. You've never had a fight in Japan.

2027
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:02,430
I was in taekwondo. Master
roaster. Bj. We can take down. Oh,

2028
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:05,280
he's got the clench. He
kept, he caught the kick.

2029
01:58:05,281 --> 01:58:09,590
Good job of stepping inside there too.
That's one thing I can,

2030
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:12,090
you might want to stay offline,
Brian,

2031
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:15,030
for a few days after this one to lay low
for me to talk to you. Definitely don't.

2032
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:17,860
Don't look at those Facebook comments.
All right, here we go. Look, yeah,

2033
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:21,060
you're trying to take BJ
down. Interesting. We'll he
ties up with that over hook.

2034
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:25,770
Do you, do you ever hit that? You
know that a judo throw it gnome.

2035
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:29,310
Oh look, yeah, you're on the
outside. Super Dangerous. Now Bj,

2036
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:33,040
Bj is also moving to his right, which
I don't like when, yeah, your throat.

2037
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:36,270
That horrible left kick. I
know, but you know what, it's,

2038
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:39,810
it's weird for guys who are right
handed to move to their left.

2039
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:40,800
Like you got to train it.

2040
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:44,350
It's a natural reaction for whatever
reason for guys to want to move to there.

2041
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:47,770
Right? So when you're fighting a guy who
is a southpaw, who was a nasty kicker,

2042
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:50,380
so you have distance,
you have a distance issue to deal with,

2043
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:53,530
and then you also have to mitigate the
fact that you're walking into his power

2044
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:56,740
kick and yet, but remember,
you're switching constantly. Yep.

2045
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:00,030
Constantly pick your poisons.
Yeah, constantly kinda get,

2046
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:03,340
just got to do your thing if you're Bj.
I mean, but that's that taekwondo style.

2047
01:59:03,341 --> 01:59:06,370
He can fight off of either
way left or right forward.

2048
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:11,890
So BJ is more of a boxing
oriented Stryker's only bucks.

2049
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:15,100
He throws leg kicks and may remember he
a fucked up Diego Sanchez with a head

2050
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:18,250
kick. Remember? Remember that kid's
a while ago? He has a long while ago.

2051
01:59:18,251 --> 01:59:22,060
But that kick to the head was what?
Uh, opened up that giant Gash. Ooh.

2052
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:25,340
Nice job there by beach and relax
just a little bit and pick a shot.

2053
01:59:25,341 --> 01:59:29,220
Then he can get them out of, Oh, don't
say that ever. No, it's fucked up.

2054
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:32,800
I don't know why you said that. I know.
Oh right. Right hand by Y'all here. See,

2055
01:59:32,801 --> 01:59:36,460
the thing is Bj looks in
shape and Bj looks fit.

2056
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,360
It's just a matter of whether or not he
can get this to the ground or he can get

2057
01:59:40,361 --> 01:59:43,150
something going and try to SAP something.
How this young kid,

2058
01:59:43,151 --> 01:59:47,650
I don't know if Rodriguez fast.
Oh, you guys done with that kick?

2059
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:49,570
He got stung or Bj Penn slows.

2060
01:59:49,571 --> 01:59:53,150
Fuck that left kick went through
the guard and it caught carrying.

2061
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:57,160
Please keep your hand up and again,
he's moving to his right. See it.

2062
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:01,060
I know and yeah, your is. Oh Shit.

2063
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:05,140
Catch Bj in the head with the
wheel kick please. Oh my God.

2064
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:10,000
Beachae speech Ariel. Oh Wow. Barely.

2065
02:00:10,001 --> 02:00:11,500
Barely avoided that high kick.

2066
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:15,830
So what Bj's got to do is move on
the outside and then figure out the,

2067
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:21,310
Oh, look at this. Oh yeah, you're
so strong. Knee to the body.

2068
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:26,440
No. Has a police. This is so interesting.

2069
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:30,960
This is so interesting. Hard to
find him. He's still in there.

2070
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:35,020
But here's the thing. You know,
a fight can change at any moment.

2071
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:36,130
So right now you got ya.

2072
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:40,690
You're walking him down looking for that
big kick and you look like Bj's in a

2073
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:43,030
bit of trouble.
But let's see if Bj can recover.

2074
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:46,000
You got to remember Bj's been
around for a long fucking time.

2075
02:00:46,001 --> 02:00:49,810
He's fought a lot of tough guys. Here's,
but here's the thing. I was going to say,

2076
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:51,550
here's what we haven't seen from Bj.

2077
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:54,370
I don't remember Bj ever coming
back in a fight and winning.

2078
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:59,530
Do you kicks? Just, I remember Bj winning,

2079
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,780
he beat a lot of fucking guys,

2080
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:04,840
but if you ever seen Bj get beat
up and just come back, Claude,

2081
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:07,480
he was just looking at the class a
long time and was like, Holy Fuck,

2082
02:01:07,481 --> 02:01:09,820
this is not Matt Hughes.
Just the kicks man.

2083
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:14,470
The kicks and from the outside from like
sidekick can't get in and either not

2084
02:01:14,471 --> 02:01:19,100
doing everything from a farther
distance than Bj can hit him. Yes.

2085
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,990
Everything is like, oh,
it's 60 round kick Bach.

2086
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:27,340
He's hitting him with some job jumping
front kick to the face, right hand.

2087
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,480
Oh man, he's, he's the
high kick is there man.

2088
02:01:31,481 --> 02:01:33,760
He's gotta be careful cause
oh two with the right hand.

2089
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:37,420
He's gotta be careful because he's
backing up. He's dropping that right hand.

2090
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,920
Oh my God. He's getting lit up. Who's

2091
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,160
what I didn't want to see and he's got
his back to the cage and he catches the

2092
02:01:43,161 --> 02:01:46,490
kick again. Oh again to
the walking it again. Yeah,

2093
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:49,070
but he's taking it all in.

2094
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:53,240
Then it goes onto the body to the head.
Just switch,

2095
02:01:53,241 --> 02:01:57,890
kick Christ. Jesus Christ ugly. It's
a switch kick in. I used to lock off.

2096
02:01:57,891 --> 02:02:02,120
He's doing that slide in with the right
leg looking to switch with the left in

2097
02:02:02,121 --> 02:02:05,830
the air. Oh, inside their
head to my, his chewing.

2098
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:10,220
Bj got you so fast.
Young.

2099
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:11,750
Oh Man.

2100
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:16,900
But it's a guy that's a dynamic kicker
who can also box a suction advantage.

2101
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:20,780
Oh, look at that low round. How
dare you kick him in the ankle.

2102
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,560
Show a little respect.
He has such an advantage and distance.

2103
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:27,830
It's almost like having a reach advantage.
Almost like being a taller fighter.

2104
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,380
Is he kicking him with it the top
of his foot or where? The Shin?

2105
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:32,480
Both and it's mixing it up.
He's mixing it up.

2106
02:02:32,481 --> 02:02:36,060
He's throwing taekwondo schools throwing.
Fuck. You always showing Moitai style.

2107
02:02:36,061 --> 02:02:38,420
It's so risky. If you hit somebody,
his elbow with the top of your foot.

2108
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:41,330
What's risky? If you hit him with the
Shin, you ever hit someone's up? What?

2109
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:45,260
Your shins when they check it two or
if they check with their knee. Oh Shit.

2110
02:02:45,261 --> 02:02:49,370
What around a big John is talking
to Bj. Bj, his corner man.

2111
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,830
Oh Jesus Christ. Look at him. Look up at
the air. Well that ain't good for ice.

2112
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:57,460
Stetting good. When you look
up at the sky, when you get
kicked also, he's 60 song.

2113
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:02,480
Fuck. So what people don't
realize is when he blocked eyes,

2114
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:07,070
just one hand. [inaudible] tough. Bj
has to take these shots though. Oh,

2115
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:09,260
I'm telling you,
Bj might have the best chin ever.

2116
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:12,980
Maybe even better than Mark Hunt.
Crazy Roy. Yeah, he's fucking up there.

2117
02:03:12,981 --> 02:03:15,560
When he think about the shots he's eating.
Well Roy has been knocked out.

2118
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:18,770
Remember like stocks last fight
against Mark Hunt. Well, not yet. Yeah,

2119
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:21,140
but he would walk away.

2120
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:26,150
K Odom mean he's able to take heavyweight
underspend those are crazy shovel.

2121
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:30,410
Unbelievable. Unbelievable head
getting rocked back. God, Bj King,

2122
02:03:30,411 --> 02:03:32,510
his ass whipped just makes me
want to eat some taco bell.

2123
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:38,150
I look any excuse to hate
yourself to eat that Taco bell.

2124
02:03:38,151 --> 02:03:41,120
Do you want some more wine? I never
hate myself that much to have taco bell.

2125
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:44,690
Have you ever had Chick-Filet though?
Cause you should celebrate that.

2126
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:50,630
I fucking chick flay or Taco Bell.
Chick-Filet no, fuck Taco Bell.

2127
02:03:50,631 --> 02:03:54,990
That shit's for the chick fil a is
fucking. It doesn't ever eat those Sunday

2128
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:58,830
Muslim Jon Jones.
Jon Jones

2129
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:07,070
passed for me. That wine.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

2130
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:09,580
Big John Stepping in here
fucking cow and told him

2131
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:14,490
he's still moving.
God.

2132
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:21,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not yet. Not
yet. You guys. The legend. The legend.

2133
02:04:21,081 --> 02:04:25,910
He's not going to save him. Save him.
God Damn Yahya Rodriguez is good.

2134
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:30,500
That was just like Jurassic Park.
The little who's go the base coat,

2135
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,720
they're little goat and then everyone's
like, what's going to happen?

2136
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:38,610
He was hitting on him, man. Oh Man.
Look at Bj's. Dj said I had that.

2137
02:04:38,690 --> 02:04:42,610
I don't know if he's pissed. I mean,
he's upset over Bj right now. They'd go,

2138
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:47,440
Jurassic Park is the fucking philosophers
thought. How dare you have that? I go,

2139
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:52,690
how dare you get that fucking bribed.
It's true though.

2140
02:04:52,730 --> 02:04:55,340
That picture above it when you
see the velocity or with the goat.

2141
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:02,670
Jesus. God Damn it. So let's
take a look at the replay, man.

2142
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,500
Hey, Bj, this go ahead and just what is,

2143
02:05:04,501 --> 02:05:08,520
what do you think Greg Jackson's telling
them? That's a wrap. Just saying, hey,

2144
02:05:08,521 --> 02:05:09,820
you got to get everything.

2145
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,490
Could do hardest shows you the limitations
of having our boxing only style.

2146
02:05:14,491 --> 02:05:17,640
When you're fighting a kicker, I
go get it. Let's check it again.

2147
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:19,770
I think it's that,

2148
02:05:19,771 --> 02:05:22,740
but look at this front kick to the face
and then a right hand behind it really

2149
02:05:22,741 --> 02:05:23,400
stuns him.

2150
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:28,400
It's also 2017 it shows you how advanced
he kicked him on the front foot.

2151
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:29,780
It was a front foot.

2152
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:34,290
There's a front kick to the face
back and then a right hand behind it.

2153
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:37,770
It's just his range is
different because he's kicking.

2154
02:05:37,771 --> 02:05:40,920
His ability is different. Everything's
different. Everything's different.

2155
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:45,480
It get when you were, you're
fighting and you only have BJ. Yeah.

2156
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:49,740
When you only have boxing and you're
fighting a guy who can box and also is a

2157
02:05:49,741 --> 02:05:53,520
dynamic kicker. You're in
such a disadvantage. Also
doesn't play the boxing game.

2158
02:05:53,521 --> 02:05:57,150
He's not, he doesn't do the boxing range,
which is what you're seeing in practice.

2159
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:59,400
You get out there, you're
like, what the fuck is this?

2160
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:04,380
2017 he's also not doing a Moitai range.
He's doing like a sport karate,

2161
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,600
but he's also mix it up,
going to clench,

2162
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:10,440
then doing crazy kicks and all this shit.
So good. He'd be GM find a little while.

2163
02:06:10,441 --> 02:06:12,810
Here's the most, the Guy
Amic, there's Todd Grisham.

2164
02:06:12,811 --> 02:06:14,400
So this is the new guy that they hired.

2165
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:17,940
So this is what they hired him for
to work the desk for a while. Brian,

2166
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:21,780
I think she's still can take a hit. Hit,
hit, hit the showers. I don't think so.

2167
02:06:21,781 --> 02:06:25,050
I think just, I think she still does. I
think they just hired this guy as well.

2168
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:28,320
This guy's pretty cool cause we were
making fun of, not in a mean way,

2169
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:32,120
but roast him pretty bad on the show.
And He, and he says the because what?

2170
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:35,250
What'd he say? He said you and
I have the same haircut man.

2171
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:38,250
And we were saying he looks like a guy
he'd rent a car from. He goes, hey,

2172
02:06:38,251 --> 02:06:42,540
I heard Hertz has an opening to for y'all.
Ask him if he's really, it was funny.

2173
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:46,980
I love the show. Yeah. That's funny.
He's a good dude. Well, hey man,

2174
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:51,180
it's maybe one of the hardest gigs to
step into at this stage of the game.

2175
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:53,830
Everyone's gonna hate on you no
matter what. No matter what. Yeah.

2176
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:57,490
And my stepfather was really fucking,
he's not replacing Mike.

2177
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:02,040
He's not the replacement for Mike.
Like he's liking me next to Joe.

2178
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:04,530
That's not so who's going to be one
thinks just because he got announced.

2179
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:09,440
I think it's going to be Jon
Anik. Anik, Anik. Yeah. Yeah.

2180
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:12,780
It's weird man. You know, it's like
whenever you change something, it's weird.

2181
02:07:12,781 --> 02:07:15,600
And what's really weird is that Goldberg's
last show was like one of our best

2182
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:20,390
ever. We're laughing, flowing together.
I've known him forever. I mean,

2183
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:24,030
I've known him since 1997 wow.
Yeah. Can Penn and teller?

2184
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:28,320
He has been doing it forever,
man. Wow. Since 1997 hey man,

2185
02:07:28,321 --> 02:07:32,370
when you know you spent four fucking
billion dollars on something,

2186
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,050
you just want to just
do whatever you want.

2187
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:38,180
You want some chair on kitchen and
replaced the shower head and yeah, put,

2188
02:07:38,181 --> 02:07:41,620
put a fucking new staircase in.
Do you get whacked by all the made fire?

2189
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:46,150
Everybody wearing Reebok? Yeah.
Fire everybody. Alright. Cream.

2190
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:49,690
The Reebok deal stick during
the transition. How's that work?

2191
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:52,900
I mean they have to honor all the
contracts. I can't be as soon as it's up.

2192
02:07:52,901 --> 02:07:56,900
W means can be like, could do
douche doubled birds, double thrown.

2193
02:07:56,910 --> 02:08:00,940
Double versus double birds. Now how many
more years did they have? Seven. Seven.

2194
02:08:00,941 --> 02:08:03,610
The signed a lifetime. No, I'm
just joking. No, I'm just joking.

2195
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:08,080
I think it's up in to, um, I'm pretty
sure Reebok's like, get us the fuck out.

2196
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:09,040
Hey Jamie,

2197
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:12,220
crank the volume up on this because I
guarantee you they're gonna interview Bj.

2198
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:15,610
If they don't,
this is a goddamn disservice.

2199
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:19,840
And since he didn't go out cold,
I'd probably interview him too.

2200
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:22,810
If they don't get a deal. Mike Gilbert
should jump into the Kanye West.

2201
02:08:22,811 --> 02:08:26,050
Taylor swift thing.
That'd be sick.

2202
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,060
Let's see what happens here.

2203
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:30,420
Well,
it's truly special athletes and night,

2204
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:33,140
the featherweight contender right here,
man.

2205
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:36,840
I'm not sure you could have gone any
more with the showcase and I congratulate

2206
02:08:36,841 --> 02:08:40,970
you. Been any worse of a mattress,
Spanish and then English.

2207
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,300
Who's the guy in the tie? You didn't meet
it back off off your ear to translate.

2208
02:08:47,010 --> 02:08:48,570
You don't have to.
He speaks perfect English.

2209
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,760
How about we just find that he threw
up on my feet once. Yeah, he did. Yeah.

2210
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:56,430
He want to fight and then threw up on
me. Well, he threw up on the ground.

2211
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:59,580
He like try to throw up under his
shirt and he like it landed on my feet.

2212
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:02,840
You were in your nice shoes. Some proud,
some shitty wearing those workouts.

2213
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:06,600
I wear some shoes that I wear
that a comfortable for the UFC.

2214
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:10,050
They a fairly soft bottoms.

2215
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:12,913
Nope.

2216
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:18,440
I've got a fanny pack on on stage
pocket. No, he didn't tell the,

2217
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:19,680
not yet a bunch of shit the other night,

2218
02:09:19,681 --> 02:09:23,180
but the night before that I had a fanny
pack on what I'm wearing. I was like,

2219
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:27,930
here's a bunch of shoes or wear a
fanny pack number. Oh, good for you.

2220
02:09:27,990 --> 02:09:32,340
Because I wait to fucking, I need a way
to vain. I'm macho. I'm vain. Cro, cop,

2221
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:37,560
Cro, cop and one Chuck Norris.
Procop cop wears one all the time.

2222
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:39,480
And John Hopkins guys,
he, I'm easily influenced.

2223
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:44,230
Take it easy and dice clay and your
boy who's Vegan and John Joseph. Yeah.

2224
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:47,990
Where's that at? A leather. So was
around his nose. No leather, no

2225
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:54,090
nylon. Nylon whole. He is a
hard Christian, right? Legit.

2226
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,500
What's shoes does he wear?
A BJ stepped up, stepped up.

2227
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,960
Anything that wasn't at the comedy store.

2228
02:10:00,961 --> 02:10:02,160
That's not the ice house the other night.

2229
02:10:02,161 --> 02:10:07,020
Look at that strong fanny pack plus a Cool
Jack and son. No, no, no. That's cool.

2230
02:10:07,021 --> 02:10:09,710
You not sting ray.
I'll see flashing this.

2231
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:14,550
This is this texting rate with
diamonds. You're incorrect. Oh Man.

2232
02:10:14,551 --> 02:10:16,560
Look at that. That front kit
that makes me want to go hunting.

2233
02:10:16,561 --> 02:10:19,100
When I see that right there,
I should.

2234
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:24,350
The three 60 round kick man goes to
the body to whatever you want on it.

2235
02:10:24,471 --> 02:10:27,300
Was a domination like a
total complete domination

2236
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:32,880
was a strong favorite in this
fight. Max Holloway. Well,

2237
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:34,040
although he's number 10 what's

2238
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,410
up? So let's build the guy
up. That's what I think. This

2239
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:40,880
guy's a killer someday in the future.

2240
02:10:40,881 --> 02:10:43,970
I think that's a legit fight and I
think that's an interesting fight.

2241
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:49,730
The way he is. A bad motherfucker.
Max Holloway is a bad motherfucker.

2242
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,140
It's a really interesting fight.
I agree with you. Okay. Hey,

2243
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:56,360
they made Ferguson could be beneficial

2244
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:02,350
for interim title. Everybody getting
tunnels. Take Pat to look at guys.

2245
02:11:02,351 --> 02:11:06,680
Every Revit now from now on will be an
interim title. Damn it. That'd be nice.

2246
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:10,280
Wait Cubby, I'm sorry. They
made what? Tony Ferguson. Yeah,

2247
02:11:10,281 --> 02:11:13,180
but they made it as more true title,
which I don't understand. Wow,

2248
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:17,570
that's super confusing.
It's very confusing because
Connor just won the title.

2249
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:18,021
I see.

2250
02:11:18,021 --> 02:11:21,860
I think this is more of a sign that comes
is going to fight Floyd next cause is

2251
02:11:21,861 --> 02:11:26,240
probably talking to Dana like you ain't
see me anytime soon son or it's more of

2252
02:11:26,241 --> 02:11:30,350
a sign that they wanted to have a pay
per view card that was stacked with

2253
02:11:30,351 --> 02:11:34,460
championship fights. But if you keep
doing interim titles, people were like,

2254
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:35,330
all right,
we get it.

2255
02:11:35,331 --> 02:11:37,910
Everyone's a fucking world champion
in Congress about to have a baby.

2256
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:39,080
His wife's about to have a baby,

2257
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:43,040
so that's going to be something
it's going to take some time. Well,

2258
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:47,320
maybe he's not. I mean, he's richer
than lots of guys. That's true. I mean,

2259
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:47,901
he's like,
listen,

2260
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:51,050
I don't want to go through training camp
right now and experience this first kid

2261
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:55,750
had a baby. Don't get some training
camp. Yeah. I mean it's a fucking man.

2262
02:11:55,780 --> 02:12:00,200
How bad ass is Yahya Rodriguez?
Unbelievable. That's the
coming out party folks.

2263
02:12:00,201 --> 02:12:01,970
Bj had on his back though.

2264
02:12:01,971 --> 02:12:05,630
Or is it a product of Bj being basically
a heavy bag in there and I love Bj.

2265
02:12:05,631 --> 02:12:09,680
It's that, but it's also, look, I
think Bj, when he was 10 years younger,

2266
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:12,260
it would have been a tougher fight
for ya here. For sure. What's,

2267
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:14,750
what's interesting for sure.
Way Tougher fight.

2268
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:19,010
Who fucking knows this
is the problem though,

2269
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:23,330
is that it's not just a matter of Bj
being a legend and Bj being an all time

2270
02:12:23,331 --> 02:12:26,270
great to division world champion.
Bad motherfucker without a doubt.

2271
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:31,720
But his style is a boxing based attack
and then a vicious ground and pound and

2272
02:12:32,001 --> 02:12:35,810
vicious, a top game submission game.
Bj is not a guy, looks submits,

2273
02:12:35,811 --> 02:12:40,811
guy's off his back and Bj is not
necessarily a guy who kicks that much,

2274
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:44,750
but so yeah. Here, who's an
outstanding kicker, best kickers.

2275
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:49,790
He has just this huge advantage. Do you
know what it's like if you check window,

2276
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:53,240
if you had a guy who said you
know you and you box a little bit,

2277
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:57,140
if you had a guy that said, hey, let's
spar, you can kick and I'll just box.

2278
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:00,170
You'd be like, well good luck with
all that. Can I kick your legs?

2279
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,660
And he'd be like, yeah. I'd be
like, Oh, well, well you just,

2280
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:05,630
you're going to have a terrible afternoon.
Yeah. Terrible. Came over, right? Yeah.

2281
02:13:05,631 --> 02:13:10,100
You're fucked because didn't Bj fight
didn't, am I crazy or did he fight?

2282
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:13,530
I'm a cheetah. Cheetah. So
Christ as a heavyweight on the,

2283
02:13:13,550 --> 02:13:18,460
it's called the Rock and the Rock
and the Rock and Hawaii. No, no.

2284
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:23,900
He fought [inaudible] in Japan and rumble
on the rock. He fought Carlos Con. No,

2285
02:13:23,901 --> 02:13:27,620
he didn't fight calls, condoms,
Lialda and rumble on the rock.

2286
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:32,150
He fought go me. He beat the fuck
out of gummy memory. Brought Gomi

2287
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:36,180
over to rumble on the rock. Beat the
shit out of him and strangle them.

2288
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,500
He fought somebody out.
I think you find in a,

2289
02:13:39,501 --> 02:13:44,350
I want to say k one because he fought
Duane Ludwig and k one as well. I have,

2290
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:49,170
I, yeah, I thought he fought
in rumble. The Rock. That's
crazy. You might be right.

2291
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,910
I don't know that.
Jamie.

2292
02:13:50,911 --> 02:13:55,911
How powerful fucking tie and pocket
handkerchief for Tyron Woodley.

2293
02:13:57,860 --> 02:14:00,310
I like him.
Verse one boy he liked to draw.

2294
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:02,950
I kind of feel like you're half,

2295
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:07,800
unless George Saint Pierre comes out of
retirement, then you make an exception.

2296
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:10,740
But since George Oh look at this,
just as horrible to watch man.

2297
02:14:10,741 --> 02:14:13,950
He's just taking that left kick
to the head. Oh, the wheel kick.

2298
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:16,860
I mean this is like right away early
in a fight. He's getting staggered.

2299
02:14:16,861 --> 02:14:20,430
He's getting his legs kicked out for
like those WME boys made this macho man

2300
02:14:20,431 --> 02:14:25,290
that three 60 round kick to
than jumping front kick shit.

2301
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:29,670
Oh my God. To what yard?
[inaudible] Rodriguez First
Brian or take is a fun one.

2302
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:34,050
Look Yahya Rodriguez versus anyone as a
front one. I mean the kids 24 years old.

2303
02:14:34,051 --> 02:14:36,050
Who the fuck knows what
happens with the, I hear, yeah.

2304
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:40,050
You're might not even stay at 45 he might
be stepping up to 55 of the next few

2305
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:42,900
years. Might be the Mexican economy.
He might be the motherfucker.

2306
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:48,570
Boom are take us 45 right number. He's,
he's right. The head of [inaudible].

2307
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:53,520
He's number nine. Dude. When you say Bj
Penn get rocked like that. He sees a legs.

2308
02:14:53,521 --> 02:14:56,370
Give out k one heroes for me.
Where's that at?

2309
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:59,640
Longest active wind streaks
in the featherweight division.

2310
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:04,220
Max Holloway Gi and Joe, you're right.
Yeah, I think it was k one right? Yeah.

2311
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,990
And before that it was
a rumble on the rocks.

2312
02:15:07,230 --> 02:15:10,640
And who do you find rumble on the rocks?
Back up a little bit there.

2313
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:14,400
UFC go down. Way down. Keep going.

2314
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:15,900
[inaudible] going me.

2315
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:21,190
He fought tagging and fight someone
else and he fought Gracie. Rodrigo.

2316
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:25,200
Rodrigo, Gracie. That's right.
And that was a decision, right?

2317
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:28,970
That was kind of a boring fight. If I
remember correctly. Powerful Larry Land,

2318
02:15:28,971 --> 02:15:33,030
this referee having seen what kind of did
two, uh, any hours. What, what is your,

2319
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:34,560
what is your take on Alvarez?

2320
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:38,180
I mean that Connor could be that
same pattern that does that.

2321
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:40,440
He has to fight Tony.
He's got to fight town.

2322
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:45,920
You can't just dismiss now one like
go Khabib guts this fucking right.

2323
02:15:46,561 --> 02:15:49,650
You're right. I forgot about that. That's
very, and you can't ever use MMA math.

2324
02:15:49,651 --> 02:15:52,140
Here's why.
Rhonda Rousey submit some uh,

2325
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:54,780
cat Zingano in 14 seconds.

2326
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:59,880
Cats Ganos stops Amanda Nunez and the
third round Amanda Nunez Destroys Ronda

2327
02:15:59,881 --> 02:16:00,880
Rousey and 48 seconds.

2328
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:05,640
Never ever wasn't worth based
on what that matchup styles.

2329
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,360
It's one on one.

2330
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:08,880
It's like when are you using
that translator thing that
I told you about and you

2331
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:11,340
read things correctly. But
Ferguson, is that something

2332
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:16,410
that where the floors and
this and he's such a bad ass,

2333
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:19,740
but what a great picture man. That guy
is awesome, is so fucking good, man.

2334
02:16:19,741 --> 02:16:23,460
He's the best boss logic to that guy.

2335
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:25,930
I liked Solartis.
Jon Jones.

2336
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:30,520
Dylan Dannis is interesting because Dylan
dances are way smaller than John John.

2337
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,840
Oh, John [inaudible] gym or wellness
stuff. That really does happen,

2338
02:16:34,841 --> 02:16:37,870
but I think that's like a
suggestion more than a sign fight.

2339
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:42,910
Does Jon Jones have a grappling match?
Jamie Dennis joking around says,

2340
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:45,920
excuse me. That was a fit, that
Dannis thing. It was a fan. Oh,

2341
02:16:45,921 --> 02:16:48,670
it was fan made by Boston logic though.
Wasn't it made by boss logic,

2342
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,950
but people were just talking about
that potential matchup online. Dan.

2343
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:54,670
I said he would have, doesn't
understand. I would play with him. What?

2344
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:58,330
[inaudible] said that. Yeah. Oh
Jesus. You see what Jon Jones said?

2345
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:01,990
It's kind of a Douche bag. He said
that about Dennis. It looks like it.

2346
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:03,420
They'd go like bag.

2347
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:08,460
See what Twitter understanding
that grappling match
listeners is a far cry from.

2348
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:13,990
Oh yeah. Well Dillon's also 60 Dylan
Dannis is pretty elite there for a pace.

2349
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,560
Pretty Lean. But Gary Tonin worked
him. He received the Gary Tarone.

2350
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:21,850
Dylan Dennis match. Yes. You know, Tony,
Tony is one of the best in the world.

2351
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:24,640
If not, yeah, he's like, he's up there.

2352
02:17:24,641 --> 02:17:29,260
He's in like the handful of guys
in the world right now. Chrome,

2353
02:17:29,261 --> 02:17:34,150
Gracie, him, you know the Eddie,
there's a few guys and John Jay,

2354
02:17:34,151 --> 02:17:36,640
any comments in him?
Those guys,

2355
02:17:36,641 --> 02:17:40,630
both of them have really revolutionized
the ground game with the leg lock attack

2356
02:17:40,631 --> 02:17:42,120
like we were talking about earlier.
The uh,

2357
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:44,320
John Danner look at that
was that there was a,

2358
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:49,330
that transition again by held would
submit Jon Jones and under eight minutes,

2359
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,470
he doesn't understand
how much bigger John is.

2360
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:58,560
John [inaudible] the shop shut down
and crush his face in publish a chance.

2361
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:01,180
I just use myself though
you would not use,

2362
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:04,080
you have a chance to get ahold
of his ankles are ain't nothing.

2363
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:09,220
She gotta be real careful talking
shit to John. To John. Yeah, Dude.

2364
02:18:09,221 --> 02:18:12,970
He will run into a bitch breaker
on runaway and then fuck you up.

2365
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,250
It's Jon Jones.

2366
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,800
He's so much that as men on the planet
38 when you fought Henderson and

2367
02:18:20,591 --> 02:18:21,430
grappling match,

2368
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:25,840
he submitted v Tour
Belfour with a broken arm.

2369
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:30,610
He hit his elbow capsule popped dude
in an armed barge the round before.

2370
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:35,440
He will take Dick Pills all night. Stay
up to six 8:00 AM and fuck your world up.

2371
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,600
It's Jon Jones,
man.

2372
02:18:38,770 --> 02:18:41,890
I don't think he understands how good
John is on the ground and I don't think he

2373
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:44,850
understands how strong John,
I think John will get ahold of him.

2374
02:18:45,470 --> 02:18:48,430
He ever see like a cow. Like one of
those praying mantis pick things up.

2375
02:18:48,431 --> 02:18:53,350
You're like, oh fuck is this shit. He
cradled. He liked the radio room fly.

2376
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:58,840
Have you ever seen a praying mantis
kill a hummingbird? No. No. Leave it.

2377
02:18:58,870 --> 02:19:02,070
They kill hummingbirds. Oh, shut your
mouth. Why do you think I would say that?

2378
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,750
I guess I knew. I bring
it up. Is he rip its face.

2379
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:09,520
I don't talk about things unless
I'm absolutely sure I pull up.

2380
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:14,150
I was saying no. Hold on.
Vermont. Drat drama. Drama.
She premier from hanging out,

2381
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:18,280
right? Praying mantis kills. Oh my God.
Pray that. Push. Pull that back again.

2382
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:21,110
Pull that back again, dude. You got to
be sure to kill. It just shows them it.

2383
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,170
Oh really? All they caught it. But there
are ones that show the kill for sure.

2384
02:19:25,171 --> 02:19:28,160
So this praying Mantis,
fucking watch this. Watch

2385
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:31,230
this. Oh, look at him hanging out
right there. Go ahead and sip on it.

2386
02:19:31,231 --> 02:19:34,910
And Budding Sis, the Hummingbird,
he just waits to the right time.

2387
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:38,930
That's crazy shit. It's, it's, it's, it's
so much smaller than a hummingbird too,

2388
02:19:38,931 --> 02:19:43,190
which is really fucked up about it.
But insects. What? Their exoskeleton.

2389
02:19:43,191 --> 02:19:45,650
It's so scary. Like Lou, those little
skinny arms. He was like, well,

2390
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:49,130
how has that skinny or I'm going
to fuck up a bird. Well, very well.

2391
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:53,410
Here's how many pull ups I can do.
Um, you're pulling up 18 pounds,

2392
02:19:53,730 --> 02:19:56,030
less things,
catching hummingbirds.

2393
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:58,000
So is this hummingbird trying
to fuck with a praying man?

2394
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:01,050
Now he's trying to get some nectar. He
doesn't know the praying mantises there.

2395
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:03,440
He knows. He knows her. They, they,

2396
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:06,350
they're very aware that the threat
that of praying mantis causes.

2397
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:10,520
What will Jamie, you'll find
one Jamie. If I don't see a ton,

2398
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:16,020
I'm the front of Hummingbird feeders.
They sit on Hummingbird feeders. Snipers.

2399
02:20:16,030 --> 02:20:19,880
It's smart. Well, the hummingbirds or
she fucking stupid. If they don't move,

2400
02:20:19,881 --> 02:20:23,840
the hummingbirds don't see them cause
a lot of these animals that are prey

2401
02:20:23,841 --> 02:20:26,060
animals like deer in particular,
their,

2402
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:29,990
their vision is what's called
edge detection vision. Like
they, they see movement.

2403
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:32,900
You don't really see things
that well but they see movement.

2404
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:37,520
That's why if you send that asap
pattern asa pattern for Cammo that like

2405
02:20:37,521 --> 02:20:42,521
firstlight has one of the reasons why
this camp firstlight f I r s D Delta

2406
02:20:43,070 --> 02:20:44,830
veteran hunters. I'm shy. I'm firstlight.

2407
02:20:44,831 --> 02:20:47,800
It's one of the reasons why their
pattern is so effective is like a zebras

2408
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,110
pattern. Although that is disputed
though. Like a zebra pattern.

2409
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:53,600
They think it's camouflage
white and black.

2410
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:58,660
Well this is why the idea is that the
lines break up the pattern of the body and

2411
02:20:59,121 --> 02:21:02,060
it confuses predators when they're in.
Is that it?

2412
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:04,560
Is it attacking a cat due
to pay me at the CAC on,

2413
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:08,870
it's a Caltrain mantis does my
fucking hair Fenning itself.

2414
02:21:09,700 --> 02:21:13,940
There's so gangster man, look at it. It
just going after the cat. The cat's like,

2415
02:21:13,941 --> 02:21:18,010
what the fuck Jesus is it stuck on a cat?
Yeah. I grabbed it and hung onto him.

2416
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:21,250
Get the fuck out and wouldn't mind seeing
that killed his cat. No, it's not man,

2417
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:24,140
but how about Coyote Peterson talking
about Santa [inaudible] and what that

2418
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:26,900
venom does like the one guy has
been bit by everything. He said,

2419
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:30,380
look trashed a lot. Bullet ant, don't
do the centipede paid. Look at me.

2420
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:35,030
What kind of stuff? Don't do it. It's the
one actually in Arizona, 13 inch legs.

2421
02:21:35,031 --> 02:21:36,970
He says, don't let it bite you. Yeah. Why?

2422
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:40,220
What does it to those kelp
birds to no said no. He said,

2423
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:43,520
he said the hardest bites the Gila monster
at the most painful because it was a

2424
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:47,530
toxin that you have to say,
this car gets attacked by praying mantis.

2425
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:51,680
Did I do find crack Tansen y'all dude,
they're so ferocious. We're so lucky.

2426
02:21:51,681 --> 02:21:56,390
Their little. Yup. I put a whole post
today of these ants dragon away this worm,

2427
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:01,310
there's 10,000 trillion ants in the world
and they represent approximately the

2428
02:22:01,311 --> 02:22:03,650
same bio mass as all the humans.

2429
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:07,190
There's 7 billion people in the
world and there's 10 trillion,

2430
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:11,330
10,000 trillion ants, but here
it goes. Look at this. Look, see,

2431
02:22:11,331 --> 02:22:15,420
this is like a common tactic that hung
that, that praying Mantis dually. Oh,

2432
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:19,730
oh damn grand by the faith.
But Dude,

2433
02:22:19,731 --> 02:22:23,820
how strong are those little fuckers? He
closed his beak like get over here, bitch.

2434
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:26,250
He just clamped his fucking Moy Thai

2435
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:31,190
clinch on that hummingbirds head.
Who? Who just pause, let them go.

2436
02:22:31,191 --> 02:22:33,810
So who did that? Oh, some
fuck with the gloves on.

2437
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:36,000
Who's jacking off the hummingbird person?

2438
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:41,001
Look at this thing was why did someone
film this and then [inaudible] you

2439
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:46,350
fucking pussy. This is nature. Why are
you interfering with the natural part?

2440
02:22:46,351 --> 02:22:49,320
I heard the praying mantis when he did
that shit. Probably know the pray man.

2441
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:53,520
It's starving now. Probably dies. Yeah,
look at this. He's got a clamp down.

2442
02:22:53,521 --> 02:22:56,700
I mean this is an awesome catch.
You've got to let that play hard.

2443
02:22:56,701 --> 02:22:59,370
That is for the premiums.
Get Ahold of a fucking hummingbird.

2444
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:04,140
Got In there and so we need to
find that guy and piss on him.

2445
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,490
You know what that's like?

2446
02:23:05,491 --> 02:23:08,100
That's like when you boys getting his
ass kicked and you jump in and start

2447
02:23:08,101 --> 02:23:11,130
throwing kicks to the head. It really
is. The guys on top, it's dirty.

2448
02:23:11,131 --> 02:23:15,990
He's got your boy dirty.
It's the ultimate cock block.

2449
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:17,690
God Damn it.

2450
02:23:17,691 --> 02:23:20,750
It's isn't it crazy that praying
mantis like weight on these bad days?

2451
02:23:21,250 --> 02:23:22,920
There's another one.
I just thought they look gangster.

2452
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:25,680
He's just sitting there and
it's hummingbird feeder.
Hey, don't they have sex?

2453
02:23:25,681 --> 02:23:29,280
Then rip the other one's heads off
to the HMI. Yeah. A praying mantis.

2454
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,370
The female rips. The males had,
oh, watch how he gets him told up.

2455
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:38,700
It's so crazy how they're so much
smaller than these hummingbirds. Oh,

2456
02:23:38,701 --> 02:23:41,400
he's getting handed on him.
No, no, no. He does that once,

2457
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:46,020
but watch the second time the hummingbird
comes close and he's like, Nah,

2458
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:49,890
not to days said, yeah,
try that again bitch.

2459
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:52,930
Watch.
Get that gets close to Riga as man.

2460
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:55,920
They know that the praying
mantis is a threat,

2461
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:59,250
so the praying mantis is kind of
laying low. He, come on, give me,

2462
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:02,760
the job was just so scary and freeze tag
right there. He's playing freeze tag.

2463
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:06,310
Yeah. Look, he comes back and he's
like, well, I took care of that problem.

2464
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:10,840
I like killed. Take your eyes
off down the hill. Attention.

2465
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:15,220
Be careful of that ass first sand eat that

2466
02:24:17,050 --> 02:24:18,660
takes them over the edge.

2467
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:24,000
What a creepy animal bite
her favorite animal. Hold on.

2468
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:28,950
Is that a black widow and a going
war? Full screen please. Uh,

2469
02:24:28,951 --> 02:24:32,800
yes. Please. Look at that fucking
monster. Look at what a praying mantis.

2470
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:37,290
Look at this. That things
are bad ass. Dude. Don't fuck
around. I've told you that.

2471
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:39,650
But he's got to be
careful to black widows.

2472
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:43,590
You gotta be careful there because
burst his abdomen. But here's the thing.

2473
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:46,260
A black widow is not a fucking weekend.
I'm will either

2474
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:52,800
pop his abdomen, one of them, one of
them might have a good moitai clinch,

2475
02:24:52,801 --> 02:24:55,000
but the other one has
venom. It's like, yeah,

2476
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:58,320
it's like Bj Bji or like if you get
bit by a black widow, you're fucked.

2477
02:24:58,321 --> 02:25:02,850
Imagine if a praying mantis does game
over sadistic. Fuck with this camera. Oh,

2478
02:25:02,851 --> 02:25:06,380
first of all, this sadistic fuck.
Set this up like a psycho for sure.

2479
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:09,630
There's a fight.
He set it up like a psycho.

2480
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:14,360
I'm trying to see it in their natural
habitat. Well, what's this? Oh,

2481
02:25:14,361 --> 02:25:16,710
that's a hissing code. What happens
to the fucking praying mantis?

2482
02:25:16,930 --> 02:25:21,050
Why would this is like the guys waiting
on deck? Let's see the fucking pray.

2483
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:25,660
Oh Shit. I'm out of here. Yo. Bug fights.
The spiders trying to climb the wall.

2484
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:28,180
Let's see if they let them, they might've
grease up the wall with Vaseline.

2485
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,910
It's dirty. Well, that's
what I would do. Yeah.

2486
02:25:30,911 --> 02:25:34,780
If I want to set up a fight to the gel
ones. No part of that. Hey, wide jelly.

2487
02:25:34,781 --> 02:25:38,640
The entire wall. This is good. Good. No,

2488
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:41,630
I have youtube hits to get,
you're forced to fight.

2489
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:46,330
Do you remember your Paramus step on
every and all these piranhas and the

2490
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:49,880
goldfish.
He had his golf fishing feed gold.

2491
02:25:50,090 --> 02:25:53,140
I had a goldfish tank that was right next
to the [inaudible] attack and I would

2492
02:25:53,141 --> 02:25:56,990
scoop Goldfish, the goldfish tank and
drop into the prong. Attack the prompt.

2493
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:04,630
Yeah. If you wait a couple of days, just
fly. Here's the thing, you can't wait.

2494
02:26:04,690 --> 02:26:08,770
You gotta wait two days, not four. They
die. No, no, no. They eat each other.

2495
02:26:09,100 --> 02:26:12,140
The brown is eat each other. Yes,
they do. Yes you do. You remember too,

2496
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:13,270
you gotta well,
you,

2497
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:16,450
I don't remember the exact days cause
this is a long ass time ago that I had

2498
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:18,760
them before I, that it was illegal. Um,

2499
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:23,390
I mean this is all theoretical.
I don't even know if I really heard them,

2500
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:26,620
but I don't think so man.

2501
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:29,830
You know what's really actually way
better than Paranas. That's totally legal.

2502
02:26:29,831 --> 02:26:33,940
It's barracudas. Um, I
know a dude. Oh Dude,

2503
02:26:33,941 --> 02:26:36,040
they have little barracudas
and people feed them.

2504
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:39,970
Fish and barracudas are four
approaches. Little motherfuckers. Yeah.

2505
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:43,030
And here's the thing about them.
Do you know what island dwarfism is?

2506
02:26:43,210 --> 02:26:45,760
It's like if you have an elephant
that it lives on an island there,

2507
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:49,060
there'll be really small elephants.
It's really interesting to get huge.

2508
02:26:49,090 --> 02:26:52,300
But lizards on the other hand,
grow giant on islands.

2509
02:26:52,301 --> 02:26:55,990
That's why Komodo dragons are so big.
Komodo dragons are the largest.

2510
02:26:55,991 --> 02:27:00,850
Reptiles are the largest lizards. Crop
Crocodiles, the largest reptiles. Right.

2511
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:05,440
I always fucked that up. But the
um, when they take these, uh,

2512
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,630
these, um, uh, barracudas and
they put him in a smallish,

2513
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:14,890
like a 500 gallon plus saltwater
tank, they'd stay, don't get that big,

2514
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:18,790
but they stay ferocious. They stay
meaning mother fuckers. Yeah. See,

2515
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:23,260
look at this guys got their photos. I
like when they're all big incorrect watch.

2516
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:27,100
Watch when these motherfuckers decided
to feed, is there, are they feeding?

2517
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:33,020
They're going to jack these minnows.
Here's a bunch of cool fucking like sick.

2518
02:27:33,021 --> 02:27:37,510
Let's, Oh, here he goes. He's moving in.
Don't boom, boom. Look at that speed.

2519
02:27:37,511 --> 02:27:40,130
He picks up how quickly just
jumps on that minnow and just,

2520
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:44,190
I heard the roominess fucking the ocean.
You gotta Watch out.

2521
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:47,570
They'll bite your Dick. Like he
just ate that minnow. I wonder.

2522
02:27:47,571 --> 02:27:51,240
It feels minerals are freshwater minnows
or salt water. Minnows could or water.

2523
02:27:51,370 --> 02:27:52,390
Yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

2524
02:27:52,391 --> 02:27:55,060
Do you think they threw some freshwater
minnows in it? Like deal with it, but it,

2525
02:27:55,061 --> 02:27:57,850
sure they're super lazy.
Well, they're super fucked.

2526
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:02,350
Like you're not going to let him breathe,
Huh? Ooh. Quicker. The jacket fast.

2527
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:06,140
All Muslim. They Jack them so fast.
She say all muscle nursing, a fat fish,

2528
02:28:06,930 --> 02:28:10,400
dolphin swims 40 miles an hour through
the week. You never seen a fat fish.

2529
02:28:10,401 --> 02:28:13,620
Do you ever ordered Toro?
Toro is fatty tuna. Yeah,

2530
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:18,550
but you ever seen him in the water then
I'll look out a shift. Fat As fuck. No,

2531
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:23,690
no, no, they do. They have flip
flops on and beer in there.

2532
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:28,640
Eating cake and ice cream.
I love me some fatty tour.

2533
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:31,260
I'm just saying you look at and they look
pretty fucking in shape in the water.

2534
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:34,580
It makes me want to do that
right now is out of shape. Fish.

2535
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:37,650
That's a fat fuck fish.
I'll come off. Yeah.

2536
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:41,390
Motherfuckers Twinkies eating Twinkies.

2537
02:28:41,391 --> 02:28:45,660
Lazy waiting for government housing.
Look at that.

2538
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:50,630
That's a fat fucking tuna. That's a nice
looking too. Do you ever catch tuna? Me?

2539
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:53,790
Yeah. You ever catch fish? No,
I was doing a, when I was young,

2540
02:28:53,791 --> 02:28:58,670
I used to fish all the time. Why Denver?
So we caught tuna in Hawaii. And then, um,

2541
02:28:58,940 --> 02:29:01,640
what kind of tutor with
very skipjack tuna. Yeah.

2542
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:06,330
And then brought it back to the
hotel and the chef at the hotel, uh,

2543
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:11,300
cooked them up or like with no fast. Oh my
gosh. So good. We h the, she me from it.

2544
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:15,980
I want to go there, right. So let's get
a time share in. Hello. Hi. You guys

2545
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:21,830
bring your Vegan friend John, a buddy of
mine. That guy who was your best friend.

2546
02:29:22,850 --> 02:29:24,440
I had a buddy of mine who bought a house.

2547
02:29:24,441 --> 02:29:26,960
He bought a vacation house and then
he said if I had to do it over again,

2548
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:30,170
I wouldn't do it over again. He goes,
uh, just get a fucking airbnb. Yes,

2549
02:29:30,210 --> 02:29:32,960
you could rent a dope house
whenever you want to see. He goes,

2550
02:29:32,990 --> 02:29:35,540
if you have a house out there,
you feel like obligated to go there.

2551
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:38,900
And he goes to the toilet breaks.
You got to hire somebody.

2552
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:42,230
The sprinkler fucks up. You've
got to hire somebody. You own it.

2553
02:29:42,231 --> 02:29:45,380
And then you airbnb that bitch
out and make paints. But yeah,

2554
02:29:45,381 --> 02:29:47,720
but then she took a bunch of
people farting in your house,

2555
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:51,710
but jacking off office your fucking
garbage chute. Well, I'm not renting out.

2556
02:29:51,711 --> 02:29:54,550
The booger knows kids taking high jumps,
high class old,

2557
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:58,800
boiling their ass hole right over your
kitchen sink it just unload your buying

2558
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:00,170
shit and they clean it.

2559
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:04,640
You don't even know like you're in there
and I'm so glad we're making additional

2560
02:30:04,641 --> 02:30:06,800
income here.
You fucking

2561
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:14,350
your day. Meanwhile they're
fucking boot cocky. And my dude,

2562
02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:18,200
did I interrupt someone? You're
basically saying I'm more important.

2563
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:22,370
That's what I'm saying. I'm shitting
in a, in a, in a, in a sink.

2564
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:25,730
There was a gym at Marina del Rey. Got
You. I tell you the story about the guy.

2565
02:30:25,731 --> 02:30:28,710
He's John Joseph there. Nope. Nope,
nope. The Gym, I wouldn't be there.

2566
02:30:28,711 --> 02:30:30,880
He's your best friend. Yes. In Marina
del Rey. You remember that one?

2567
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:34,790
I tore my place. I told him there
was a guy used to shit and no,

2568
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:36,140
it was right off of via marina.

2569
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:40,820
So this guy used to shit in the shower
and he would take a shit in the shower

2570
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:45,800
and they knew it was him, but because
they can't have cameras in the house,

2571
02:30:45,860 --> 02:30:49,010
in the gym. So it was like
going to gym, a strange city,

2572
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:53,720
marina city and, and how they
know, and he would look at the guy,

2573
02:30:53,721 --> 02:30:57,200
he would look at the main guy who was
always trying to catch her and freaking

2574
02:30:57,201 --> 02:30:58,280
out and he would,

2575
02:30:58,310 --> 02:31:02,210
he would go have a good day and wink,

2576
02:31:02,350 --> 02:31:06,830
apparently I might log in.
They're like cheese grader.

2577
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:11,150
Did he ask him if he shit in the sink?
Oh, and the guy would lose his mind,

2578
02:31:11,151 --> 02:31:13,520
but they could never prove it.
Right. So we'll just hanging around.

2579
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:15,860
Why would he think that that guy did it?
Well,

2580
02:31:15,861 --> 02:31:20,861
because they 100% knew that the guy did
because every time he'd be in there,

2581
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:23,130
he would disappear. And they started
putting two and two together.

2582
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:26,640
And not only that, not only
that, he would leave a huge log,

2583
02:31:26,641 --> 02:31:31,641
but more importantly he would go have a
nice day and wink every time he did it

2584
02:31:33,580 --> 02:31:36,870
that you can't prove it. But he got
off on the fact. And at one point,

2585
02:31:36,871 --> 02:31:40,230
the main guy who was the one of the main,
the manager of the gym,

2586
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:42,330
they had to hold him back,
loop her autumn.

2587
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,860
The Guy I used to work out
with told me this story,

2588
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:47,280
they had to hold him back because he
just is like, I'm fucking fuck it.

2589
02:31:47,281 --> 02:31:48,031
I don't care.
It was a customer.

2590
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:50,400
I want to beat the shit out of him
because somebody had to clean up.

2591
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:55,230
He got off on taking a shit in that shower
with just leave and never seen that.

2592
02:31:55,850 --> 02:31:57,100
I've never seen anyone take a share.

2593
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,490
A lot of people that like
to do weird shit like that,

2594
02:31:59,491 --> 02:32:01,860
leave their mark somewhere and be like,
see Ya.

2595
02:32:02,290 --> 02:32:07,170
It's like borderline fucking
serial killer. Oh yeah. Real close.

2596
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:10,380
Like then you start torturing
cats. Yes. Well it's,

2597
02:32:10,390 --> 02:32:12,520
it's the idea I might get caught.
So it's yet, and you know,

2598
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:17,600
another profession is people breaking
in other people's houses and jerking off

2599
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:22,180
in their house or in their
closet. Yes. And yes.

2600
02:32:22,181 --> 02:32:26,070
And so running off. Yes. And the
reason they're so disrespectful,

2601
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:29,470
but that's when you know you're
not a winner. [inaudible] man,

2602
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:30,930
you're not saving the world.

2603
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:33,690
You're not going to be the
president of superpower or you are,

2604
02:32:33,691 --> 02:32:38,100
or you're like a high
functioning executive and you
get off on the fact that you

2605
02:32:38,101 --> 02:32:41,610
might get caught. Wait a minute.
High functioning executives,

2606
02:32:41,611 --> 02:32:44,750
do you know that breaking in people's
houses and jerk off on their shoes and

2607
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:46,110
none.
However,

2608
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:49,800
apparently it is a perversion
that affects a lot of people.

2609
02:32:49,801 --> 02:32:53,370
So you can be a lawyer or whatever and
you get off on the fact that you bring in

2610
02:32:53,380 --> 02:32:56,640
somebody house, you're jerking off in the
closet, you might get caught. Who knows?

2611
02:32:56,641 --> 02:32:59,460
If somebody comes home and you're come
to you, leave, you run out. That's,

2612
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,790
that's something that affects no
matter what your socioeconomic status,

2613
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:07,230
see the results and lets you set up a
camera and just assume that the idea you

2614
02:33:07,231 --> 02:33:12,060
might get caught. So taking a shit. So
signing people admit that they do this,

2615
02:33:12,061 --> 02:33:14,050
is that or they find out about
this or they catch them? No.

2616
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:17,550
So in a book called a billion
wicked thoughts. These guys who,

2617
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:20,280
neuroscience who studies
sexual perversion and stuff,

2618
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:23,880
this is a something that a lot of
psychiatrists would deal with, right?

2619
02:33:23,881 --> 02:33:26,850
So you or in in in people
who have sexual perversions,

2620
02:33:26,851 --> 02:33:28,950
it's a recognized thing where danger,

2621
02:33:28,951 --> 02:33:32,820
where the ID you might get caught and
doing something behind closed doors doing

2622
02:33:32,821 --> 02:33:36,130
something, you know, which
would be outrageous, right?

2623
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:37,440
Is something that's oppression.

2624
02:33:37,690 --> 02:33:40,020
He only can me say like high
high powered executives.

2625
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:42,630
I always think of people that are in a
position where they're being forced to

2626
02:33:42,631 --> 02:33:47,631
behave in an unnatural way
and that bottles up that's
jacking off to do a weird

2627
02:33:49,141 --> 02:33:50,440
shit.
I mean that's like that's,

2628
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:54,240
that's a big issue with businessmen
that are like really a powerful guys.

2629
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:58,820
They like to have like women's shit on
them and do crazy things or dominatrix

2630
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:04,030
and Jamie still jacked up when your
Yeezys well I was a dominatrix that met me

2631
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:07,530
and Jim Norton in Austin.

2632
02:34:07,531 --> 02:34:10,920
We were eating dinner after a show
and we're hanging out. And this girl,

2633
02:34:10,921 --> 02:34:14,990
cause she knew that Jimmy Norton who's
a fucking pervert and a half is into

2634
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,160
dominatrix is so she came over.
You see Dominatrix

2635
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:18,993
is

2636
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:25,240
terminated and he likes to do you
say is Jesus? He's in a dominatrix.

2637
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:29,110
What'd you say? A of a bunch of
dominatrix. Sandy [inaudible] dear.

2638
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:33,580
You can say he's into Dominic
tricks is dominate. He's into,

2639
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:35,920
he's into being dominated and,
okay,

2640
02:34:35,921 --> 02:34:38,290
but if you have a room full of
women that work as a Dominatrix,

2641
02:34:38,291 --> 02:34:42,400
would he have a room full
of, did you have, you have,

2642
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:44,900
it's called dominate tree? No, no.

2643
02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:48,610
I mean has it eliminated the
plural or is there a hurry?

2644
02:34:48,611 --> 02:34:53,280
So rare that never in a room. We dominate
trusses. Dominique Dominique's tricks.

2645
02:34:53,281 --> 02:34:56,650
So you were saying Jim
Norton likes this girl? Uh,

2646
02:34:58,090 --> 02:35:01,220
no, not, not. He doesn't go that deep,
but he's just a freak. Let's see. Okay,

2647
02:35:01,221 --> 02:35:04,330
so when he's the best, so anyway,
this girl comes over and she says,

2648
02:35:04,331 --> 02:35:07,210
I just want to introduce myself. My name
is, you know, madam crush, your balls,

2649
02:35:07,211 --> 02:35:09,400
whatever the fuck her name
is. And then she, you know,

2650
02:35:09,401 --> 02:35:12,820
we say come on and sit down with us,
tell stories. So she sits down with us,

2651
02:35:12,821 --> 02:35:13,880
you know,
she doesn't name any name,

2652
02:35:13,881 --> 02:35:17,350
she's an actual real pro and she starts
telling us about all these different

2653
02:35:17,351 --> 02:35:21,790
guys that she shits on. No, no, no, no.

2654
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:24,860
Mostly wealthy businessmen,
lawyers,

2655
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,570
people that have a lot of people that
work under them. They have their,

2656
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:31,630
they have power and they're also like,
like bent.

2657
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:36,630
They're all fucking pressured.
And I stone strong ass might have to act.

2658
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:39,430
I dated these girls who had a chair.

2659
02:35:39,431 --> 02:35:42,850
She took me into our dungeon and she
had a steel chair. When you say dated,

2660
02:35:42,851 --> 02:35:47,350
is it like you say John Joseph's your best
friend? Ah, yes. That's a very good, I,

2661
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:49,280
we had sex and she's,

2662
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:53,680
she brought me to the steel chair and you
sit in this steel chair and your balls,

2663
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:58,600
your balls go through the chair. When you
say you don't say you, they say the guy.

2664
02:35:58,660 --> 02:36:02,800
Well the Guy May, I was just observing.
I'm not into being dominated, but so,

2665
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:06,910
so she, she was a tidy
up all your balls. Yes.

2666
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:08,590
And so you tie your balls,

2667
02:36:08,710 --> 02:36:12,010
you take a string wrapping around
your balls and tie it to a chain,

2668
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,920
to a link on the bottom of the floor.
Now you came back,

2669
02:36:14,921 --> 02:36:18,820
you're not going anywhere. Your
balls are our tie off to that. Well,

2670
02:36:18,821 --> 02:36:21,600
and then you get peed on know.
Hey,

2671
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:23,950
do you want to hear Yahya Rodriguez
talk about this? Grant this,

2672
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:28,960
crank this volume up. What's, I want to
hear this. I already talked about it,

2673
02:36:29,050 --> 02:36:29,641
but I want to hear,

2674
02:36:29,641 --> 02:36:32,410
I want to hear what he's saying now
because he's getting interviewed by Kenny

2675
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:35,780
Florian. Let's talk about
shit. We will, we will. Shit,

2676
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:41,320
uh, ideal pleaser. He wasn't on
the cake, but uh, you know, I,

2677
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:44,520
I uh,
so we kinda started get to them.

2678
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:46,620
I went up stretching the strategy to him.

2679
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,100
They should have stopped
the fight a time in early.

2680
02:36:49,101 --> 02:36:51,680
It looked like you laid it
a lot of unanswered stripes.

2681
02:36:52,110 --> 02:36:53,880
Tyron Woodley making controversy.
Yes.

2682
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:59,020
Uh, I actually feel like if I stopped
once she came to you on a stand up,

2683
02:36:59,021 --> 02:37:02,940
so I better keep a bunching I, you want
to use, they're trying to go on that.

2684
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:04,570
I couldn't, you know, and uh,

2685
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:08,220
look how quickly he steps to the side
too. Once a PJ goes down, wash steps,

2686
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:13,030
look looking, look at that sidestep
step to get to side control and Hammer,

2687
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:13,530
Hammer, Hammer, hammer

2688
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:14,940
clean as possible to fight the top

2689
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:18,530
for a slow build rental guy.

2690
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:21,360
Try and get him.

2691
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:29,400
Do you know why I got Brian?
Get his balls?

2692
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:33,800
Do you know where most of the shit
videos come at Germany and Japan?

2693
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:37,900
And do you know why? War and then they
filled, it goes back. She was saying,

2694
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:40,730
it goes back to what you were saying.
They're very, very suppressed culture.

2695
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:43,190
There's a very,
very disciplined and rigid.

2696
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:47,390
Have you ever gotten done that buddy hall?
Oh Bro. They have mask. I can't do it.

2697
02:37:47,391 --> 02:37:50,270
And then they shit into the
mask but just can't do it.

2698
02:37:50,650 --> 02:37:54,530
One of my favorite pictures in the
Internet ever was from the 90s and it was

2699
02:37:54,531 --> 02:37:57,800
that girl, it's called, uh, it's
usually Japanese bathtub girl.

2700
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:01,070
The girl's in the bathtub and she's
got her hole straight up in the air and

2701
02:38:01,071 --> 02:38:05,180
she's shooting a fountain of
yellow diarrhea out of her ass.

2702
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:09,320
That's landing in her talking about life,

2703
02:38:09,350 --> 02:38:11,260
seeing that all of its various forms.

2704
02:38:11,770 --> 02:38:16,370
I I know as super wealthy man,
super wealthy,

2705
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:20,420
don't say his name on the air, but write
it down on a piece of paper. We know.

2706
02:38:20,421 --> 02:38:25,310
And B, you don't know him, you know,
you know, you know somebody who knows.

2707
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:26,600
Look at that,
look at that picture.

2708
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:29,480
That's one of the greatest pictures
in the history. And, and, and just him

2709
02:38:31,630 --> 02:38:32,730
as a mascot.

2710
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,600
That's what bouillons Sasso said,
whatever you do,

2711
02:38:38,601 --> 02:38:41,370
don't open my laptop and he's late. And
he put it on my trust to them and I go,

2712
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:45,260
don't do that. He goes, whatever you
do, don't open my laptop and look at it.

2713
02:38:45,650 --> 02:38:48,500
And I was, he was right in front of
my dressing room and I had to look.

2714
02:38:48,501 --> 02:38:51,770
And that's what I fucking saw. And I
saw it again. I love about that picture.

2715
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:54,400
She has her socks on and she's,

2716
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:57,890
and she's holding her toes cause she
doesn't want to slip. Good for him.

2717
02:38:57,891 --> 02:38:58,810
I feel like you know you do.

2718
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:01,770
I was going to say to him about
the fire that was backwards.

2719
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:07,100
God dammit will Sasso diarrhea,

2720
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:11,720
diarrhea on my laptop now without
that either. Why do they do that?

2721
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:15,850
Why don't they do that? Do they shit on
each other? Well, the whole idea. Wow.

2722
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:19,760
Look at that champion Josie Aldo.
That seems weird to me. It make sense.

2723
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:23,630
It seems weird to me.
And then Max Holloway interim champion,

2724
02:39:23,631 --> 02:39:28,580
like what is going on when you have a
champion who didn't win the title in a

2725
02:39:28,581 --> 02:39:30,860
fight in the,
in the octagon,

2726
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:34,640
he was awarded it after he won an
interim title against Frankie Edgar,

2727
02:39:34,641 --> 02:39:37,910
which is a beautiful performance
on his part. And then Max Holloway.

2728
02:39:37,911 --> 02:39:41,270
Where's an interim like who's within?
Think about how Max Holloway gotta.

2729
02:39:41,271 --> 02:39:43,610
I love Max Holloway.
He has nine fights in a row that he won,

2730
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:48,200
but then he beats Anthony Pettis who's
never fun at that weight once before.

2731
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:53,450
But really not a top contender,
really. Not Realistically not.

2732
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:57,320
And then leaves the weight class and I
was up 55 and then you won your belt off

2733
02:39:57,321 --> 02:40:01,880
that, you know, it's so fucking strange.
It's weird how everyone has belts.

2734
02:40:02,030 --> 02:40:02,360
Well,

2735
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:07,360
do you think that this is just a part of
the transition between Zuka and WME and

2736
02:40:08,221 --> 02:40:11,690
that is going to be like
this transitionary period
where everything powerful.

2737
02:40:11,690 --> 02:40:15,390
Watch Tyron Woodley Champs got good
taste and Washington, it was a Rolex.

2738
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:16,980
It's a fat one. Whatever
it is, it looks good.

2739
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:20,700
But the thing being leave that bad boy,
it could be an Invicta,

2740
02:40:20,970 --> 02:40:23,820
but the thing is it's like,
do you,

2741
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:26,400
do you know there's obviously some
sort of a transition going on.

2742
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:29,630
80 people have been fired, including
Goldberg, right? Yeah. It's a,

2743
02:40:29,631 --> 02:40:30,780
it's a crazy time.

2744
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:36,080
So I think they're scrambling for stars
and I think belts brings along some sort

2745
02:40:36,181 --> 02:40:38,340
of ratings. I just think they're
in this feeling out peer,

2746
02:40:38,341 --> 02:40:41,730
this transition period that they're,
they're just trying to figure it out.

2747
02:40:41,731 --> 02:40:46,020
And I think that's why Dana's entertaining
this Conor McGregor fight because

2748
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:47,850
what else would we talk about?

2749
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:52,020
Names named something else big going
on in the UFC right now. Interesting.

2750
02:40:52,021 --> 02:40:56,340
Is his design, does Debbie Emmy, are they
really, or you know, this organization,

2751
02:40:56,370 --> 02:41:00,300
have they really been involved in
anything where the outcome is totally

2752
02:41:00,301 --> 02:41:02,400
unpredictable,
like combat sports?

2753
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:06,090
Because like the promotion for
the Holly, uh, or excuse me,

2754
02:41:06,091 --> 02:41:09,420
the Rhonda fight was a perfect
example of something like,

2755
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:11,400
well we really hadn't
seen it that way before.

2756
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:16,140
We're really hadn't seen it go 100%
heavy towards the superstar. Right?

2757
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:20,520
Hundred percent heavy. Usually it's like,
you know, you would see a promo piece,

2758
02:41:20,521 --> 02:41:22,830
like say if it's like
Woodley versus Wonderboy,

2759
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:26,280
you would see Wonderboy highlights,
you would see Woodley highlights,

2760
02:41:26,281 --> 02:41:29,700
you would see ass kicking on both sides.
You'll be like, holy shit, what a fight.

2761
02:41:29,701 --> 02:41:31,830
I can't wait.
They didn't do that at all.

2762
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:34,080
They get is the way they would do a movie.

2763
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:36,300
They did it the way they
are promoted TV show.

2764
02:41:36,301 --> 02:41:39,900
They did it the way they would promote a
new Kiefer Sutherland series on Netflix.

2765
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:43,320
You know what I'm saying? Only the star,
but, but that shouldn't say Netflix,

2766
02:41:43,321 --> 02:41:44,220
I should say like Fox.

2767
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:50,160
That's what scares me because Dana
white when it comes to this is a genius.

2768
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:50,910
He would never,

2769
02:41:50,910 --> 02:41:54,480
I don't think you would allow that to
happen so I'm just wondering how involved

2770
02:41:54,481 --> 02:41:58,230
he is cause without Dane, if you
just have WME running it, fuck,

2771
02:41:58,231 --> 02:42:00,120
what's it look dope though.
I'll tell you what.

2772
02:42:00,121 --> 02:42:03,030
I don't agree with the fact
that they ignore it. I'm a,

2773
02:42:03,270 --> 02:42:06,450
I'm a purist in a lot of ways when it
comes to combat sports and I think you

2774
02:42:06,451 --> 02:42:08,730
have to respect the
hierarchy of the champion.

2775
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:10,530
I don't give a fuck who
was the famous person.

2776
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:14,460
This championship thing is so
important when you have that,

2777
02:42:14,461 --> 02:42:15,630
if you're going to have champions,

2778
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,870
you got to respect the champion
like whoever the fuck it is. It's,

2779
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:22,770
it's super important to make a big
deal out of the fact that that person's

2780
02:42:22,771 --> 02:42:25,830
champion and they made like almost no
deal out of the fact that she was a

2781
02:42:25,831 --> 02:42:26,220
champion.

2782
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:30,600
It was just weird situation but it was
really well done in terms of like getting

2783
02:42:30,601 --> 02:42:35,340
me amped. Does it though? I
disagree, but for me it was for me.

2784
02:42:35,341 --> 02:42:40,110
Look, I you're the one doing the fucking
no, no, no, no. Most of that was not me.

2785
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:43,500
Most of that was like you open up
the fucking curtain, the garage door,

2786
02:42:43,501 --> 02:42:46,890
and you see her tech hitting the pads.
I had almost nothing in that.

2787
02:42:47,070 --> 02:42:50,010
The only thing that I said is I can't
imagine she's not going to come back and,

2788
02:42:50,011 --> 02:42:54,390
and be a, you know, what are motivated
or pumped up or whatever. By the way,

2789
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:57,840
a lot of the stuff they use in those
promos. Totally out of context.

2790
02:42:58,110 --> 02:43:00,660
Like when I was saying that she's the
best ever, there's no one even close.

2791
02:43:00,661 --> 02:43:04,140
There's hurt and there's everybody
else. Yeah. You a long time ago,

2792
02:43:04,380 --> 02:43:08,700
that was a long time. Correct. I
did not say that for this fight. No,

2793
02:43:08,701 --> 02:43:09,860
it didn't say this for this place.

2794
02:43:09,890 --> 02:43:12,100
But you said that for the
think you said that for the

2795
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:15,790
batch go. Hey, a fight. But yeah, so see
like when they're making these promos,

2796
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:20,380
patching stuff they're taking,
so for me,

2797
02:43:20,381 --> 02:43:23,500
I have a problem with that because this
is not what I would say. Yeah. So you're,

2798
02:43:23,501 --> 02:43:28,501
you're using like an old quote when
she was dominating people versus a new

2799
02:43:28,841 --> 02:43:29,350
quote,

2800
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:34,300
post head kick knockout post the emergence
of Amanda Nunez after she stopped

2801
02:43:34,301 --> 02:43:39,130
staring McMahon you versus a, you know
what you're seeing now in this division,

2802
02:43:39,131 --> 02:43:41,800
which is all this new blood coming up.

2803
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:46,980
You're seeing this division percolate
and change and evolve and you're seeing

2804
02:43:47,411 --> 02:43:52,060
like higher level fighters come in like
Valentino Shift Chanko like Amanda Nunez,

2805
02:43:52,061 --> 02:43:52,821
like Holly Home.

2806
02:43:52,821 --> 02:43:56,740
Like you're seeing all this stuff take
place in front of you seeing this change

2807
02:43:56,770 --> 02:44:01,030
in the women's division the same way you
saw a change in the men's division from

2808
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:06,031
97 to 2017 you're seeing that now take
place at an accelerated pace and the

2809
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:11,140
women in the women's division,
so who is dominant two years ago,

2810
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:15,130
like to use a quote from two years
ago, it's really not fair. I agree.

2811
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:19,540
That's really not fair characterization.
Yeah, but it, but it builds the fight up,

2812
02:44:19,541 --> 02:44:22,300
right? It builds the fight up, but
it's not the way to do it. No, I agree.

2813
02:44:22,301 --> 02:44:26,710
I'm appears to. But the thing is is if
you understand this sport and you look at,

2814
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:28,180
let's say you want a copy of the NFL,

2815
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:32,230
the NFL would never just focus on Tom
Brady because there's a good fucking

2816
02:44:32,231 --> 02:44:34,690
chance Roth Lisberger wins next week.

2817
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:37,690
Now imagine if they just did all promos
on New England. People were like,

2818
02:44:37,691 --> 02:44:39,600
what the fuck is this?
Exactly.

2819
02:44:39,601 --> 02:44:43,690
It's just some bullshit fucking good.
Worse than that,

2820
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:48,490
what you're talking about, all promos
that aren't the champion. Yeah.

2821
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:50,500
Which is worse than that.
Right?

2822
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:52,900
Because you're talking about someone
who just lost by brutal knockout.

2823
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:56,380
They're getting a shot right away at the
title and the idea is that even though

2824
02:44:56,381 --> 02:44:58,840
they lost, they lost,
but it was some bullshit.

2825
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:03,110
She's now she's back back now
she's Bafta for elimination bats.

2826
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:07,060
Fucking 411 just a bad.
It was a lot of bad business plan.

2827
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:09,640
There was a lot of talk by
people that I don't know,

2828
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:12,550
but I was listening to people talk
about it like I don't know who they are,

2829
02:45:12,610 --> 02:45:14,650
executive type people and I was like,
wow,

2830
02:45:14,651 --> 02:45:18,700
you guys have an idea of how this is
going to go down. Like they, they,

2831
02:45:18,701 --> 02:45:23,650
they were just super, super connected to
this idea. I don't know who they were.

2832
02:45:23,651 --> 02:45:25,090
I don't know if they're friends,
I don't know.

2833
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:28,270
But there was a lot of people that we're
talking and then had this idea that she

2834
02:45:28,271 --> 02:45:31,800
was just going to go in and storm the
castle and take back with her like this.

2835
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:36,900
I had a conversation with a high up exec
that a big time corporation and we're

2836
02:45:37,121 --> 02:45:41,360
talking to him and I'm like,
oh my, you have no idea. What
did he say to you? He, he,

2837
02:45:41,370 --> 02:45:41,800
he,

2838
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:45,130
we were talking about Connor and Rhonda
and he was neither one you lesson none

2839
02:45:45,131 --> 02:45:47,990
had that one hiccup. She will never
lose again. And like that's not true.

2840
02:45:48,030 --> 02:45:50,980
What is a good deals is no, no
did, she would never lose getting.

2841
02:45:50,981 --> 02:45:53,680
She goes and he goes and
Conner, not a chance. I'm like,

2842
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:56,650
what are you talking about two at
these people were talking backstage,

2843
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:59,200
gods are like cues me.

2844
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:01,750
These people were talking about stage and
one of them didn't know Newton and his

2845
02:46:01,751 --> 02:46:02,750
name.
Yeah,

2846
02:46:03,450 --> 02:46:07,760
and they were calling her cannon
fodder boy and I was like,

2847
02:46:08,070 --> 02:46:10,040
they don't know anything.
Who knows who these people

2848
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,510
are? They could be, I mean, I don't
know who they were. Yeah, they might be.

2849
02:46:12,511 --> 02:46:17,510
They could be people who are friends of
people who know some people that work at

2850
02:46:17,511 --> 02:46:20,630
William Morris and they're backstage
dressed in fucking $2,000 suits and they

2851
02:46:20,631 --> 02:46:23,360
look classy. Who knows? I
don't know Willie Moore.

2852
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:26,690
They shouldn't be doing anything
without going through Dana light first.

2853
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:30,350
They should not be doing anything.
Yeah.

2854
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:33,710
Mean the game way too long for you guys
to make any decisions without having

2855
02:46:34,310 --> 02:46:38,450
some sort of influence from a guy who's
come from the ground up from it going,

2856
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:42,080
you can't do that. Listen, our fan base
is going to yell bullshit on this man.

2857
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:46,160
And if we, if, if Rhonda doesn't win,
we are going to get fucking rain.

2858
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:49,060
Connor cannon fodder. Huh?
Do you think? Yeah. Yeah.

2859
02:46:49,250 --> 02:46:50,420
That was the word that someone used.

2860
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:55,720
Do you think that at this stage that
there should be some sort of clearly

2861
02:46:56,601 --> 02:47:01,370
established protocol as far as who
fights who and why you have to,

2862
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:03,680
otherwise you're no different
than the WWE. Right.

2863
02:47:03,710 --> 02:47:08,110
Then people won't take a lot of the
interim titles and the championship fights

2864
02:47:08,111 --> 02:47:12,170
serious. Here's my argument against
that. Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping,

2865
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:16,580
I bought it to see that fight. It was Jack
Damn tough. Cause we love Dan. I agree.

2866
02:47:16,581 --> 02:47:19,790
I love Dan and I love Mike and I love,
I know Mike wanted it back.

2867
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:24,740
He finally got the title and he's
like, fuck this guy knocked me out.

2868
02:47:24,830 --> 02:47:28,250
He's got his fucking picture of him
flying through the air touching me in the

2869
02:47:28,251 --> 02:47:32,090
head out cold that everybody
knows what that logo is. Yeah.

2870
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:36,170
He's like fuck him. He landed it twice.
Then I'm in the fight. No don't me wrong.

2871
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:37,850
Matt might be fine.
It's up there.

2872
02:47:37,851 --> 02:47:41,780
But I think you have to have some sort
of structure where people can see what's

2873
02:47:41,781 --> 02:47:46,040
going on. It's just like maybe it's
like a Usada exemption exemption.

2874
02:47:46,041 --> 02:47:49,790
Brock Lesnar, he got away with that for
a month. You promise if you do that,

2875
02:47:49,791 --> 02:47:54,550
you're right. You miss out on this really
fun kind of revenge pass. Yes. The,

2876
02:47:54,710 --> 02:47:58,100
but then you can't say, oh, we want to be
in the next NFL. Let me ask you, the NBA,

2877
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:01,490
do you think, I mean outside
of like promote, see,

2878
02:48:01,491 --> 02:48:04,520
you see the thing is he can't
deny. It's weird. It's like,

2879
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:09,020
are you a sport where someone has
a very clear, you know like the,

2880
02:48:09,021 --> 02:48:10,670
like the world series.
Like you can't,

2881
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:13,760
like someone can't lose a game and then
all of a sudden be in the world series.

2882
02:48:13,761 --> 02:48:16,100
Right, right. It's just like
there's a, there's a protocol,

2883
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:17,540
like you have to go through that protocol,

2884
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:22,160
but do you think that there's
a possibility you could
have something like that

2885
02:48:22,161 --> 02:48:26,750
some established set up but then they
could throw it to the Internet for like a

2886
02:48:26,751 --> 02:48:30,020
wild card can have that cannot have that.

2887
02:48:30,050 --> 02:48:35,050
My question now and that maybe the
UFC gets three wild cards a year.

2888
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:38,330
Oh God. Oh my God. Is the people
who have an answer to that thing.

2889
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:41,640
But here's the other thing. I wonder if
this an MNA young Jamie shaking his head

2890
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:45,560
for the all star teams and shit,

2891
02:48:45,561 --> 02:48:49,030
and that's how y'all Ming is the
number one a year every year, year.

2892
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:52,460
But why is it because Chinese people
is more of them? Well, technically yes,

2893
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:55,370
but let me ask you, what does he
do it online? The Guy Right now,

2894
02:48:55,371 --> 02:48:57,500
that's the number one
forward for the warriors,

2895
02:48:57,501 --> 02:49:00,560
but like no one knows even not to
say his name. Is he from China? No,

2896
02:49:00,561 --> 02:49:02,320
his name is Josh shop with Trulia,
but he's going to,

2897
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:06,680
he's the leading vote getter. Jeremy Lin
to, where's he from? I have no idea. Yeah,

2898
02:49:06,940 --> 02:49:08,380
Shaw's up. I don't know. Lithuanian.

2899
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:10,650
Maybe. Let me ask you this question
about him and match your own.

2900
02:49:11,250 --> 02:49:14,820
Here's a question. Do you
think, I wonder about MMA,

2901
02:49:14,821 --> 02:49:19,380
whether it being champion in most of the
divisions is even that important to the

2902
02:49:19,381 --> 02:49:23,880
fans? In other words, what's important
to people is Conor Mcgregor, right?

2903
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:27,150
Rhonda Rousey, the people that have the
co, there's something colorful about them.

2904
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:30,630
Complicated people. Somebody who speaks
well. So we, we watched those guys,

2905
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:35,010
but I'm not so sure that because
Michael Bisbing is champion,

2906
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:39,730
that his viewership goes up as a result.
Sure. Does your mom clinically proven it?

2907
02:49:39,970 --> 02:49:43,380
It Championship. Terrible point.
Terrible point. And you know what?

2908
02:49:43,470 --> 02:49:46,230
I need you to take a break after
that. But to your point, yeah,

2909
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:48,870
you can say Rhonda was the bigger stuff,

2910
02:49:48,871 --> 02:49:52,740
but Ronda was a different force and
reason she got so big is because she was

2911
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:54,630
champion for, Rhonda was never
champion. We're not even,

2912
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:58,140
but also like what she was just,
she was winning one, losing one.

2913
02:49:58,141 --> 02:50:02,850
It doesn't matter what she did to indulge
that whole popularity thing was very

2914
02:50:02,851 --> 02:50:05,730
different than Connor's approach of
Connor decided to take that exact same

2915
02:50:05,731 --> 02:50:09,570
approach and go do a ton of movies and
go do a ton of talk shows and go do a ton

2916
02:50:09,571 --> 02:50:14,010
of, do one commercial Budweisers and
entourage and all this different shit.

2917
02:50:14,270 --> 02:50:16,200
If he started doing that same shit,

2918
02:50:16,201 --> 02:50:21,201
his star would rise proportionately to
weigh her star rose and his performances

2919
02:50:21,590 --> 02:50:24,180
inside of the octagon with
suffer proportionately to wear.

2920
02:50:24,181 --> 02:50:26,850
Hers did and he didn't do
it and he's still bigger.

2921
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:28,860
We were talking about that
guy that did that interview.

2922
02:50:28,861 --> 02:50:32,280
He's a sports guy and he was
talking about none of the other guy,

2923
02:50:32,281 --> 02:50:34,880
the black guy who was with them
sharp. Is that his name? Yeah,

2924
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:38,340
and he had a great point. Shannon
Sharpe had a great point and he said,

2925
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,770
Rhonda cheated on MMA.
He said,

2926
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:44,880
you gotta be all in and says you can't
go and do a bunch of other shit and think

2927
02:50:44,881 --> 02:50:47,600
you're just so much better than everybody
else that it's never going to catch up.

2928
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:52,350
It comes from another 1% or athlete
who knows exactly had all this kind of

2929
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:55,870
tempting. Shannon Sharpe stuck
to the game. She didn't witness,

2930
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:58,110
said it when he said it. I was
like, this guy's dead. Right.

2931
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,490
I think this business model though,

2932
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:03,480
the only problem with the business model
is that with MMA it's really hard to

2933
02:51:03,481 --> 02:51:07,050
invest in the champion because
of the nature of the sport.

2934
02:51:07,410 --> 02:51:12,240
The the belt, we'll chant like especially
on your investing for one fights, right?

2935
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:17,130
But still you, but you're investing,
you're not investing for in the champion.

2936
02:51:17,131 --> 02:51:19,740
You're investing in the organization
and the fact that they have the best

2937
02:51:19,741 --> 02:51:23,250
fighters in the world, what you're doing
with each fight is promoting a fight.

2938
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:27,390
What I'm saying is that you have to
respect the hierarchy of the championship.

2939
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:28,350
Above all,

2940
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:32,220
the champion is the champion and if
you don't respect the hierarchy of the

2941
02:51:32,221 --> 02:51:36,180
champion of you're somehow or another
sang that this champion ain't shit unless

2942
02:51:36,181 --> 02:51:38,190
this champion is fighting
Mike fucking Tyson.

2943
02:51:38,191 --> 02:51:41,760
When Tyson was 20 years old and just
smashed and everybody and you knew all my

2944
02:51:41,761 --> 02:51:43,770
God, this is going to be the
youngest ever heavyweight champion,

2945
02:51:43,950 --> 02:51:48,150
then you focus on that guy with the same
amount of fervor that it demands. Right?

2946
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:50,340
But that's not the case here.
You know,

2947
02:51:50,341 --> 02:51:54,100
you're talking about an insanely like
in that particular Ronda Rousey fight it

2948
02:51:54,110 --> 02:51:58,140
insanely dangerous champion. Yeah.
Who just smashed me. So Tate and,

2949
02:51:58,150 --> 02:52:00,180
and you're talking about an x factor.
We're like,

2950
02:52:00,181 --> 02:52:02,990
we really don't know what we're
going to get exactly. With Ron Bass,

2951
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:06,350
we put all the money in. Yeah.
Right. So you got fucking insane

2952
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:10,600
you've got, but also you have an insanely
marketable champion. First of all,

2953
02:52:10,601 --> 02:52:14,550
the first ever openly gay
women's MMA champion and man's,

2954
02:52:14,730 --> 02:52:17,350
it should be never been an
openly gay MMA champion. Right.

2955
02:52:17,351 --> 02:52:20,980
So you have the whole Lgbtq,
whatever they are now a,

2956
02:52:20,981 --> 02:52:25,580
is there a name that has about a plot, but
it is, you have a bunch of people that,

2957
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:28,840
but you have also a bunch of people that
respect that in a progressive people

2958
02:52:28,841 --> 02:52:32,220
that say, hey, this is great. Like look,
it shows how diverse the UFC is. Sure.

2959
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:36,040
He's amazing. Yeah. And the stupid shit
that Meryl Streep said the other day,

2960
02:52:36,041 --> 02:52:39,490
like one of the reasons why she probably
said it is because she's seeing Ronda

2961
02:52:39,490 --> 02:52:42,850
Rousey's face plastered all
over the place, the face,
the place. And she's saying,

2962
02:52:42,851 --> 02:52:45,610
Hey, you know, you take women,
foreigners out of Hollywood,

2963
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:47,290
you're going to be left
with football and MMA.

2964
02:52:47,590 --> 02:52:50,440
She doesn't understand the full
MMA like you saw tonight with Yair.

2965
02:52:50,470 --> 02:52:55,030
Rodriguez is 80% foreigners. It's so
wrong about that. And that's also art.

2966
02:52:55,060 --> 02:52:58,030
That's that jumping, spinning
back kick would be ARD. Oh,

2967
02:52:58,031 --> 02:53:01,070
come on that you tell me
that three 60 round kick.

2968
02:53:01,080 --> 02:53:05,280
Just like dancing the dance but
harder cheese it. Yes. It's,

2969
02:53:05,290 --> 02:53:09,310
it's just like rhythmic gymnastics.
She just doesn't know she's on educated.

2970
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:13,600
I mean if dance is an art than gymnastics
and competition is also an art because

2971
02:53:13,601 --> 02:53:16,300
it's very similar. It's just
under more pressure. Right.

2972
02:53:16,301 --> 02:53:17,650
So if gymnastics is an art,

2973
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:22,300
how the fuck is how our three
60 round kicks not, oh shit.

2974
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:27,400
That guy on the ground is, it was a
bad motherfucker. Hey, it's weird.

2975
02:53:27,401 --> 02:53:32,210
She used her lifetime achievement award
to talk shit about MMA and football.

2976
02:53:32,310 --> 02:53:36,010
I think she was making a
clumsy larger point. But yes.

2977
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:41,980
Oh, it was Nina and saw often.
No, and he didn't start off one.

2978
02:53:42,190 --> 02:53:45,220
Whoa.
Rear naked around three.

2979
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:48,850
That's a Amanda Nunez girlfriend.
Holla. Holla, get some,

2980
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:52,570
get some red penny nights sauce,

2981
02:53:52,990 --> 02:53:56,260
then it's an awesome
story. Huh? Listen man,

2982
02:53:56,320 --> 02:54:00,070
she's a bad motherfucker,
motherfucker. Yeah, she,

2983
02:54:00,071 --> 02:54:03,730
I guess she has a mother Fucker fucker.
Shit motherfucker a motherfucker. She's,

2984
02:54:03,731 --> 02:54:07,640
she's, she's a fucking world champion
man. A legit champion. Who's your,

2985
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:09,600
who's your biggest challenge do you think?
Right.

2986
02:54:09,610 --> 02:54:12,020
A lot of big challenges shift
Chanko is a good challenge.

2987
02:54:12,021 --> 02:54:15,890
It's so as Julianna Pena,
whoever wins that fight steps up and says,

2988
02:54:16,810 --> 02:54:18,570
well listen to Holly and uh,

2989
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:22,600
whoever the fuck wins that fight
versus Holly and Germain de Randamie.

2990
02:54:22,601 --> 02:54:27,230
It's a very interesting fight
because if chip Chenko and we'll see,

2991
02:54:27,231 --> 02:54:30,520
you got shift Chanko, you've got your
main to random me and you get Holly Holm.

2992
02:54:30,521 --> 02:54:35,521
Those are three super advanced strikers
that could wind up facing Amanda Nunez.

2993
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:41,510
Nunez can jump to 45 right now and vacate.
Yes,

2994
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:46,270
she can do whatever the fuck you want to
do. Just pure chaos. Can I got an idea?

2995
02:54:47,020 --> 02:54:51,640
What the fuck is? Here's the dark
horse cat Zingano cuts and gone. Oh,

2996
02:54:51,641 --> 02:54:54,550
beat Amanda Nunez and she stopped her.
She knows she's not active,

2997
02:54:54,551 --> 02:54:58,930
but he's not active in the
company. She ran back. She
ramps it up. She ramps it up.

2998
02:54:58,931 --> 02:55:03,530
She's still in the heat. Let's get
ramped up the fuck the fuck up.

2999
02:55:03,531 --> 02:55:04,130
That is bad

3000
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:08,150
ass. I agree. I like it. There's
a lot going on. So then Amanda,

3001
02:55:08,151 --> 02:55:12,200
just vacate that belt or two time champ.
Champ champ.

3002
02:55:12,201 --> 02:55:16,310
She comes champ champ,
female champ. Champ.

3003
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:21,320
First female checks a punks headline of
fucking paper view and I don't know man.

3004
02:55:21,381 --> 02:55:25,730
I think Amanda has the one quality that
everybody wants to see and she has the

3005
02:55:25,731 --> 02:55:29,120
ability to stop women.
I mean fucking stop them.

3006
02:55:29,121 --> 02:55:32,290
The way she stopped Sarah the,
when she stopped me, she ah,

3007
02:55:32,350 --> 02:55:36,110
she smashes two lectures.
She's murked two leg.

3008
02:55:36,111 --> 02:55:39,860
She feels like she
seems like a s s faster.

3009
02:55:39,890 --> 02:55:43,020
She seems just generally more
explosive than every female by far.

3010
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:47,880
She's very long. Some drawers, a
hundred pounds heavier sideboards.

3011
02:55:48,010 --> 02:55:49,420
So pitch cyber,
it's not,

3012
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:54,370
it's two 35 she's a building with feet.
She's,

3013
02:55:54,371 --> 02:55:55,660
she hired the same lawyer.

3014
02:55:56,050 --> 02:56:00,250
John Jones in a lesbian or you
see that I'm gonna fuck is nasty.

3015
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:04,430
Who was the lawyer? Whoever got
Oj off? No, no, I don't know.

3016
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:10,400
They got excited. Sent the Dream
Team. Johnnie Cochran, he's dead.

3017
02:56:10,940 --> 02:56:15,380
I think that, you know, look, she's
obviously, she's got a real problem,

3018
02:56:15,381 --> 02:56:19,400
but I don't even think she really is a
one 45 or I think sidewalks at one 55 I

3019
02:56:19,410 --> 02:56:23,030
wouldn't say one 85 I mean that's
what she's walking around that,

3020
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:27,110
but if she white now decided to
fight whatever her natural weight is,

3021
02:56:27,111 --> 02:56:29,180
we've been pushing this for a while.
I think that's the future.

3022
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:33,920
I think the future is you show up,
you show up at people's camps randomly,

3023
02:56:33,921 --> 02:56:37,190
just same way you're do. When you saw the
test, you do it for fucking six months.

3024
02:56:37,490 --> 02:56:40,250
You'd test them. You find out what the
actually fucking way, what do you weigh?

3025
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:42,380
What do you win when you train and
you never know when they're coming.

3026
02:56:42,380 --> 02:56:44,540
So you got to stay light and
you have to find out, oh look,

3027
02:56:44,541 --> 02:56:46,640
Brian Callen you one
75 that's what you way,

3028
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:49,690
not one 45 one 75 that's
what you fight that.

3029
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:53,390
And so you have an obligation to get to
your lowest body fat and you know that

3030
02:56:53,391 --> 02:56:55,820
the UFC has coming
knocking on your door with,

3031
02:56:55,821 --> 02:57:00,140
with weight tests to answer anyway.
Classes. Well, no one's gonna know.

3032
02:57:00,290 --> 02:57:01,730
No one's gonna know when this happens.

3033
02:57:01,850 --> 02:57:04,630
And then you sit it down and you
blow up the fucking champions.

3034
02:57:04,631 --> 02:57:07,950
You blow up the whole thing and you
start from scratch. 37 champion,

3035
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:12,770
a world series of champions,
everyone to chase every 10 pounds,

3036
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:16,360
every 10 pounds, you have the
opportunity to lose some body fat.

3037
02:57:16,610 --> 02:57:18,920
That's what they're doing now though.
Look at all these interim belts.

3038
02:57:18,950 --> 02:57:21,500
They might as well do it. No,
no, no. This is different. No,

3039
02:57:21,501 --> 02:57:23,180
I'm just saying everyone's
getting a belt and I was,

3040
02:57:23,181 --> 02:57:26,150
we'll fucking have not and belt,
this is a couple of belts thrown around.

3041
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:29,780
It's just Tony Ferguson,
Tony Henderson and Kala beep.

3042
02:57:30,830 --> 02:57:35,830
I think a Ferguson and Henderson is
such a Ferguson and Habib is such a good

3043
02:57:36,621 --> 02:57:40,220
fight. Spice here so far. I don't
care. I need it five rounds.

3044
02:57:40,221 --> 02:57:42,710
I don't give a fuck how many
belts. Yeah. Oh he fucked up.

3045
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:46,430
He fucked up Victor [inaudible].
He was doing it from a standing position.

3046
02:57:46,450 --> 02:57:48,920
Oh and they let her,
oh look at that.

3047
02:57:48,921 --> 02:57:53,921
So he went for it earlier and then Pascoe
gets on top and so he wraps his arm

3048
02:57:54,531 --> 02:57:56,860
around and then he lets
pesky amount to me.

3049
02:57:56,870 --> 02:58:00,320
Doesn't even try to stop the Mount and
he just sinks it in from the bottom

3050
02:58:00,321 --> 02:58:04,020
putting a karate. His hand is in a karate
chop like that. Wow. Very interesting.

3051
02:58:04,470 --> 02:58:08,220
First Eagle choke finish in UFC
history and he did it from the,

3052
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:12,510
from being mounted hard looking man,
that is so incredible.

3053
02:58:13,020 --> 02:58:16,380
I feel like otherwise you just going to
keep doing the same thing over there.

3054
02:58:16,410 --> 02:58:19,260
How much does tire in order the way
right now? Tell you what it's not.

3055
02:58:19,261 --> 02:58:23,820
What 70 fuck no. What's he the every
bit of 200 and shredded. He's huge.

3056
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:27,980
He's good. He's not tall but may
real quick. I'll talk with them.

3057
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:32,370
Said me and him have the same haircut. I
beg to differ sir. I it doesn't matter.

3058
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:34,670
It is not the same.
I that's first on the scene.

3059
02:58:35,130 --> 02:58:37,620
They're going over the submission.
Really fascinating.

3060
02:58:37,621 --> 02:58:41,220
I wonder if other people are going to
try to pull this off. Oh the pull off.

3061
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,900
Obviously he's got it down pat.

3062
02:58:43,170 --> 02:58:48,170
So he gets this at some Russian shit and
the other and the other guy is fucking

3063
02:58:48,241 --> 02:58:51,790
punch him in the head here and he lets
them pass. They forces them to stay there.

3064
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:56,160
Incredible Grapevine. His legs
from the outside. Yup. Yup. Crazy.

3065
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:59,430
He's like kind of holding onto him like
trying to like create space or something.

3066
02:58:59,431 --> 02:59:03,030
So I wonder, it's interesting he
doesn't get his, he doesn't get this in.

3067
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:05,550
He doesn't you to kind of ask what would,

3068
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:09,570
if we don't have to
fuck with it after this.

3069
02:59:09,630 --> 02:59:13,020
Well you'd have to go like need a
belly maybe and her shirt. Yeah,

3070
02:59:14,370 --> 02:59:17,050
we'll need a belly if you go
need a belly from there. I see.

3071
02:59:17,170 --> 02:59:21,030
Say if you pass instead of mount and stay,
if you like go to one side,

3072
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:23,580
you know any bravo doesn't mount anymore.

3073
02:59:23,900 --> 02:59:25,470
We were having this discussion about this,

3074
02:59:25,471 --> 02:59:28,170
I think it was on the podcast here
you're saying cause he got submitted from

3075
02:59:28,171 --> 02:59:29,700
this and it just does need a belly.

3076
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:32,940
Well so many people are so good at that
now guys with a lot of leg dexterity and

3077
02:59:32,941 --> 02:59:36,420
flexibility and they throw those legs
up on the top and that but they also go

3078
02:59:36,421 --> 02:59:38,370
for the ankle,
lock them in there so tight with that.

3079
02:59:38,370 --> 02:59:42,570
Especially like you know Eddie roles a
lot of times with either g pants on or

3080
02:59:42,571 --> 02:59:47,220
with tights with spats and so if you got
those a rash guards on man it creates a

3081
02:59:47,221 --> 02:59:48,990
lot of friction. Different game. Yeah.

3082
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:52,760
It's one of the reasons why a lot of the
real high level leg lock eyes you see

3083
02:59:52,770 --> 02:59:56,610
Gary Tonin, you see Eddie comments,
they wear shorts now, right? Yeah.

3084
02:59:57,050 --> 02:59:58,490
Which is really even more impressive.

3085
02:59:58,500 --> 03:00:02,130
They can catch those things cause that
was part of the reasons why a lot of guys

3086
03:00:02,250 --> 03:00:06,210
like Aoki would wear those crazy
tights was for that extra traction.

3087
03:00:06,370 --> 03:00:09,000
Who's dome for him too? Yeah, it
was awesome. Then we took them off.

3088
03:00:09,001 --> 03:00:13,470
It wasn't shit I can think of that.
He took them off, got his ass.

3089
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:16,260
Once she got his ass whooped,

3090
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:20,610
he had to deal with the elbows to right.
Either way it goes, got a spot somewhere.

3091
03:00:20,670 --> 03:00:24,010
I'm going to have to go home. See
my wife. Oh wait. Don't yet reasons.

3092
03:00:24,860 --> 03:00:25,970
Just trying to watch the slang,

3093
03:00:25,980 --> 03:00:30,620
some Dick gift amount and a
gift to my piece. Wow. Right.

3094
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:34,260
Well we go honey, you just earned
this. I'm 49 we wrap this up.

3095
03:00:34,290 --> 03:00:39,000
It's a 10 past 10 it was a fun,
fun podcast. Stuck some fighting.

3096
03:00:39,300 --> 03:00:39,691
We did.

3097
03:00:39,691 --> 03:00:42,930
We definitely can't get the main fight
and I want you guys to keep this image in

3098
03:00:42,931 --> 03:00:45,960
mind. The rich guy was talking
about with getting a canister.

3099
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:50,900
I big fucking like
canister and have girls,

3100
03:00:52,970 --> 03:00:57,750
these guys and make sure you
shit on Brian about John Joseph.

3101
03:00:59,350 --> 03:01:00,610
John Tweet

3102
03:01:01,450 --> 03:01:05,500
tweet for me. John, I'm sure you know
him. I'm sure. Goodbye. You fucks.

3103
03:01:12,350 --> 03:01:12,420
Okay.
