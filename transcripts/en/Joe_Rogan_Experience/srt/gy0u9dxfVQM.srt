1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,060
Well,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,890
the Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by ting.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,040
If you go to Rogan dot [inaudible] dot
com you can save yourself 25 bucks off of

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,110
either their cell phone service or
one of their bad ass android phones.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,330
The idea behind ting is a company that
is essentially trying to conduct business

6
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,310
in an ethical way instead
of trying to rip you off.

7
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,890
Instead of trying to charge
a ridiculous amount of money,

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,000
they charge less.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,810
They try not to rip you off and they
can still make money and you can do

10
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:33,490
business and not feel bad about it.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,830
And that's sort of the idea behind tank.

12
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:39,010
Provide you great cell phone
service on a reputable network.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,630
They're on the sprint network,

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,900
so it's not like some rinky dink
network that they made themselves.

15
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,660
It's a big national
network and it works great.

16
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:47,980
And they have the best android phones.

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,490
You can get.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,440
The Samsung Galaxy s three,

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:50,661
the,

20
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,251
the note,

21
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,570
that big giant fucking thing.

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,643
They're amazing.

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,430
Um,

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,510
it's great service.

25
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,111
It's a,

26
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:58,090
the idea behind it is
there's no contracts.

27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,290
You cancel whenever you want to.

28
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,350
You could put more than
one person on an account.

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,080
Like you can have like a little
family account and all share minutes.

30
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,060
There's a lot of great things about it.

31
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:07,391
If you,

32
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,650
if you don't use minutes,

33
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:08,980
they were,

34
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,170
they make it up to you in the next bill.

35
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,740
It's like,

36
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,120
it's a super cool company.

37
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,860
No one's trying to rip you off.

38
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,210
I've had direct communication with the
people behind it and they're just really

39
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:19,571
nice.

40
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:20,021
It's cool.

41
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,460
It's a great company and uh,

42
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,260
we're happy to be in involved with them.

43
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,340
If you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible]
dot com you can save yourself 25 bucks.

44
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,940
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com it's o,

45
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:31,211
n,

46
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:31,480
n.

47
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,631
I,

48
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,290
t.

49
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,520
If you've heard this podcast,

50
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:37,750
you've heard us talk a million times about
all the different supplements and all

51
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,860
the different Shit we sell as far as
like strength and fitness and health

52
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:42,694
products.

53
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,380
But make no mistake about it.

54
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,690
Everything we sell it,

55
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,790
shit that I use is things that
I would recommend you try.

56
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,880
And it's things that
have shown benefit to me,

57
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,360
uh,

58
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,940
for health and for
wellness and for fitness.

59
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:58,600
And I think that's a really
overlooked part of people's lives.

60
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,230
You know,

61
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,970
eat some fucking healthy food.

62
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,050
Take some vitamins,

63
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,180
get a workout in,

64
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:03,581
and man,

65
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,391
you will feel better.

66
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,980
I know it's hard to do.

67
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,530
It's super hard to just get started.

68
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,790
That's what's really hard.

69
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,930
It's hard to just get your fucking
lazy ass up and actually do it,

70
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,910
but you've got to decide to do things.

71
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:19,390
You've got to write shit down right
down that you're going to do it and be

72
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,130
completely dissatisfied with yourself.

73
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,380
If you don't hit every checklist,

74
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,450
hit every point on that thing
that you've written down.

75
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:25,751
You can,

76
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,280
you can get things done in your life.

77
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,930
You can get moving and you'll feel better.

78
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,130
That's what's most important.

79
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:30,964
If you're healthier,

80
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,450
you're,

81
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,610
you're actually gonna feel better.

82
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,551
Actually.

83
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,200
Gonna feel like a better person.

84
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,030
It's going to work better anyway,

85
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,250

92
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:48,620
stupid commercial.

93
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,870
So it's over.

94
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,891

well,

99
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,290
good experience.

100
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,800
[inaudible]

101
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,930
ladies and gentlemen,

102
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,920
Melissa average.

103
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,143
Thank you so much.

104
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,360
Pleasure to be here.

105
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,911
I've got to tell you,

106
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,290
when I got a message saying,

107
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,670
Melissa Etheridge wants
to do your podcast.

108
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:11,960
So I had to think,

109
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,660
did I ever talk shit about me?

110
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,720
I just had,

111
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,340
I had a really cute cause that's

112
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,640
easy.

113
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,040
Well,

114
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,060
everyone's easy.

115
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:21,850
I'm easy to,

116
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,683
it's,

117
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,221
you know,

118
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,240
it's like you want to,

119
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,930
if you ever did and I didn't
ever did make fun of something,

120
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:28,351
would you like,

121
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:28,531
look,

122
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:28,951
I wasn't,

123
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:29,784
I didn't mean it.

124
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,420
Of course.

125
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,080
I completely understand the common yet
I'm actually someone that knows that if

126
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:34,891
you're making fun of me,

127
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,350
that means that I must be
doing something successful.

128
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,460
So I'm all good.

129
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,310
Yeah.

130
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,641
You know?

131
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,780
And even if I'm accusing someone
of being pretentious or whatever,

132
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,350
we've all been guilty of being stupid,

133
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,323
you know?

134
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,390
So just a joke.

135
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:46,961
I have to do it.

136
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,320
I can't,

137
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,430
I can't just let it sit there.

138
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,170
It's in the middle of the world.

139
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:50,591
And,

140
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:50,671
uh,

141
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,504
I can't point out

142
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,920
jump does comedy is sacred.

143
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,700
Believe me.

144
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,301
You believe that.

145
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,170
I totally believe that comedy is that
part of truth and it's people like you.

146
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,100
It's why you resonate so well with all
what you're doing right now is because

147
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:08,101
you comedy pushes when you stand up
in front of people and say this is the

148
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,270
truth.

149
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,000
And then they ha they laugh
and laughter is that release,

150
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,620
right?

151
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,453
Beautiful.

152
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,690
I think that release,

153
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,370
whatever that feeling
is that when you laugh,

154
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,800
but whatever that thing
that makes you laugh.

155
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,540
I think if that was a drug,

156
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,520
if you could buy that like at seven 11,

157
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,510
like you buy a coffee

158
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,700
because when I go to see like uh,

159
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,500
I worked this weekend with a couple of
really funny guys with Brian Callen and

160
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,490
Ari Shaffir and,

161
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,580
and Brian Redman here and we worked in um,

162
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,340
uh,

163
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,960
Vegas.

164
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,950
We had the show.

165
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:42,090
And one of the things I love about
like working like a really funny guys,

166
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,920
it's like actually getting to laugh,

167
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,810
actually getting to be an audience member.

168
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,060
Cause like a lot of Brian
counts stuff was new.

169
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,930
I hadn't heard it before and
I was just how then laugh at,

170
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,410
it's such a good feeling.

171
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,550
It's so,

172
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,241
and you know,

173
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,870
and very similar in a lot of ways to the,

174
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:59,730
the feeling that a great song can hit you.

175
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,371
Well,

176
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:00,971
it's what we do.

177
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,350
We do very similar things.

178
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,580
We take human emotion,

179
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,720
human experience,

180
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,290
and organize it in a way that it
gets past all the normal barriers.

181
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,281
You know,

182
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:12,940
I can,

183
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
I hopefully can tap into a feeling that
a person has that goes beyond their

184
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,050
head,

185
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,840
but they go straight into their heart and,

186
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,640
and then they get to release
it because you know those,

187
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,503
those will be,

188
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,870
that'll cause you sickness too if
you keep doing emotions inside.

189
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,770
So comedy is the same.

190
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,670
It's all about letting it,

191
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,504
so

192
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,250
the difference with comedy is the,

193
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,400
your stuff gets better the more hear it.

194
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Like if I hear even like the greats,

195
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,470
like Richard Pryor,

196
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,000
I can only listen to like one of his bits,

197
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,834
like once,

198
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,980
not twice in a row,

199
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,120
not three times in a week.

200
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,520
I could take one of your
songs and just slap it on,

201
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:48,100
repeat and enjoy it more.

202
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,000
I've come to your windows,

203
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,140
it's so high.

204
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,980
Just that to scares me now.

205
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,641
Yeah.

206
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:53,120
That.

207
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm very lucky that my,

208
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,530
my art form is more like I get to,

209
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,370
I can

210
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,121
write a song,

211
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,450
I can record it and in that moment
I can put it there and they're like,

212
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:01,581
like,

213
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,181
bring me some water.

214
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:02,930
There you go.

215
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,190
And then you know what?

216
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,024
20 years later,

217
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,481
oh my gosh,

218
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,670
I get to sing and again and I
can put all kinds of new stuff.

219
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,110
I can do whatever I want with it.

220
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,250
And people want to hear it like Yay,

221
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,410
they pay money.

222
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,630
It's just kind of it.

223
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,880
It's like with comedy,

224
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,980
you have to always keep
coming up with new shit.

225
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,761
Be Funny.

226
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,271
Be Funny,

227
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,460
dude does it last.

228
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
You got to keep the,

229
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,990
you can't like re Redo
bits from decades past,

230
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,210
but a great song that comes out,

231
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:29,541
man,

232
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,450
that's permanently great
and better with time.

233
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,403
You know,

234
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,820
it's a weird feeling to be a person
who knows nothing about music.

235
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,200
That's,

236
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,050
that's who I am.

237
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,590
I really no zero nothing.

238
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,840
Don't even play any instrument.

239
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,650
Nope.

240
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,860
Can't play anything that when
I looked at music written down,

241
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,430
I've never,

242
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,250
never investigated it even for a second.

243
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,810
But I love music.

244
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,070
I love to listen to it.

245
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,200
So I'd look at people
like you is almost like,

246
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,200
like what you do is it's like
a form of magic or something.

247
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,230
Like the ability to make awesome noise
used to be out chemical in that it was,

248
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,100
it was sacred music was because if you
look at the nature of the universe and

249
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:09,740
reality and you break it
down into quantum physics,

250
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,700
it is a reality that is based
on octaves and dimension.

251
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,280
So if you understand music,

252
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,570
you can understand.

253
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,160
It's one of the reasons why I understand
the nature of reality so much that this

254
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,981
is what happened like eight,

255
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:22,814
nine years ago.

256
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,750
And once you get to understand that we,

257
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,160
that we are all octaves,

258
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,060
we are all instruments,

259
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,790
we're all vibrational beings,

260
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,990
then you understand,

261
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,081
oh,

262
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:33,470
music.

263
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,060
That's why music will never ever go away.

264
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:36,440
That's why it resonates so much.

265
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:36,921
Yeah.

266
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,840
For a lot of people to hear
that kind of talk and like,

267
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:39,860
Oh God dammit,

268
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,660
you just hit my hippie bullshit button.

269
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,220
I know you're a resident.

270
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:43,610
What do Ya,

271
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,141
what are you,

272
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:46,870
you're resonating and being great.

273
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,320
What the hell does that mean?

274
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,040
You know what?

275
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,280
And,

276
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,930
and they absolutely,

277
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:51,740
they lived there.

278
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,573
I,

279
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,570
I have an understanding and a belief and
we're all just made up of our beliefs

280
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,100
and I walk with my hippie
understanding belief and go on with it.

281
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,150
I think there's,

282
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,590
there's obviously,

283
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,010
uh,

284
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,811
it's,

285
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:05,421
it's a in a,

286
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:08,360
a beautiful and imaginative concept,

287
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,560
but there's just sort of clear evidence
that there's something there when like

288
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:17,030
say if you're in your car and like that
riff of back in black comes on the radio

289
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,410
and it was just the perfect
sound and the perfect time,

290
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,711
you know,

291
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,660
maybe your board of whatever,

292
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:24,021
you know,

293
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:28,610
you'd be annoyed by something and
that that data like your whole body,

294
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,170
like it's just like,

295
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,430
that song is so good,

296
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,540
it fires you up,

297
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:32,811
you know,

298
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,070
there's certain things that,

299
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,970
there's a certain feeling that it does
to your body that if you could just buy

300
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,481
that man,

301
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,171
it'd be very,

302
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:39,531
very,

303
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,640
very valuable.

304
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,690
Or looking for that,

305
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,140
aren't you?

306
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,420
I think everybody is.

307
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,300
If you could,

308
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,571
I mean,

309
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:44,781
I'm,

310
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm super inspired by music and
I think one of the reasons being,

311
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,570
because I don't understand it and because,

312
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,620
um,

313
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,580
I don't play it,

314
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,810
I can't create it.

315
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,870
So when I see someone that can can,

316
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,381
to me,

317
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:57,160
it's like,

318
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,551
wow,

319
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,460
it's like this totally
different thing than what I do.

320
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:05,461
But I get to see the same sort of energy
that makes anyone great at any art.

321
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,530
I love seeing express through
different mediums that,

322
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,470
that pure resident,

323
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:11,681
I mean,

324
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,550
I hate using that word again,

325
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:12,970
but that,

326
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,610
that residents of expression,

327
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,061
you know,

328
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,910
whatever it comes with that
burst and it shows the world,

329
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:19,600
whatever it is,

330
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,120
whether it's in a song or
whether it's in a sculpture,

331
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,920
I love seeing it.

332
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,521
You know,

333
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,960
I love seeing it in all forms.

334
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,800
You can,

335
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,250
uh,

336
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,290
you can go look at this.

337
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,620
He can look at it scientifically and I'm,

338
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,850
I'm just gonna use the word
vibrational because we,

339
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,440
if you study scientifically,

340
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,310
not even Hippie wise,

341
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,930
and he'd study quantum physics,

342
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:42,931
you will understand the
vibrational nature of the universe.

343
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,140
And so art gives off a vibration.

344
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,621
Absolutely.

345
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,180
You can break it down.

346
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,261
They,

347
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,030
they have,

348
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,030
they have little machines that can show
if someone's looking at a picture and

349
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:59,980
they have a feeling you have a vibrational
energetic change inside of you as a

350
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,030
reaction to that.

351
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,200
Wow,

352
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,910
that's amazing.

353
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,640
They actually just had something the other
day I think yesterday where they have

354
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,180
the,

355
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,070
they showed the first thought,

356
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,430
uh,

357
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,590
like where uh,

358
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,800
the brain of a,

359
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,340
I think it was a rat and it,

360
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:12,771
it they,

361
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:12,970
they,

362
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,160
because they could see it,

363
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,760
uh,

364
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,010
like visually see a thought.

365
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,881
I'll try to find it.

366
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,130
But it was really bad as it was just,

367
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:19,571
well,

368
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:24,300
I know they've been able to figure
out how to take an image of what you,

369
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,660
what you can see.

370
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,600
They'd be able to like simple shapes.

371
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,000
I go a simple triangle and simple squares.

372
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,200
They've been able to take images like
they've somehow or another that's reading

373
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:35,981
your mind essentially.

374
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:36,820
And that's a beginning,

375
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,683
right?

376
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,400
I believe it's the whole experience of
all of us understanding that thought

377
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,460
creates in that and that's
what all of this is made up.

378
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,030
Yeah.

379
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,480
He's thought that's a weird thing
for people to wrap their head around.

380
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,230
And what I always try to say is like,

381
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,711
you know,

382
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,860
everybody looks at the imagination as
if almost as if it's not necessary,

383
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,593
but you know what I mean?

384
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,840
He's a childish one with
his wild imagination,

385
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,470
you know?

386
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,660
And that that sort of term,

387
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,020
what what people don't understand
is that's what created everything.

388
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,950
Everything hard,

389
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:06,251
everything.

390
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:06,851
You can touch,

391
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:10,120
everything you get in and fly
everything you drive around in.

392
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,310
That's all coming from imagination.

393
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,240
It started with,

394
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:13,960
yes,

395
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,620
all of it.

396
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,880
Everything that we've created,

397
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:16,780
good or bad,

398
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,930
it's coming from an imagination like the
idea that we don't put a lot of respect

399
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,490
in in that and that we don't look at that.

400
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:28,810
It's like being this and that's the real
sort of sacred creator of the universe.

401
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,321
Absolutely.

402
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:29,861
Creation.

403
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:30,400
Absolutely.

404
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,220
And it starts with our own responsibility,

405
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,010
what we create for ourselves every day.

406
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,700
And that's difficult because
people want to blame.

407
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,691
They want to say,

408
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:37,841
oh,

409
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,510
this happened to me
because of that person,

410
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,620
because I don't have enough money or I
don't have enough love or whatever it is

411
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,860
that blame and it's hard to look at
your own creation of what you created

412
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,460
everyday.

413
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,470
We're so malleable,

414
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,011
you know,

415
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,440
and if I think we grow up
in the wrong environments,

416
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,780
it's very easy to also raise children
in the same environment and repeat this

417
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,430
really fucked up pattern where no one
has ever stopped the train and said,

418
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:03,791
okay,

419
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,760
let's look at the patterns that we
operate under and how many of these are

420
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,594
beneficial?

421
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,560
What are we doing?

422
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,870
Like why are we living
in the same goddamn way?

423
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:11,900
And everybody's miserable?

424
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,780
Let's just stop and think this through.

425
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,411
And No,

426
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,550
let's not yell at each other.

427
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,570
I don't want to be yelled at.

428
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,370
You don't want to yell at me
and I don't want to yell at you.

429
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:18,880
Great.

430
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,121
Okay.

431
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:19,781
We agreed to that.

432
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,620
Will that we told him we won't.

433
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:21,190
Yeah.

434
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,350
Now let's think things through what?

435
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,920
We know what,

436
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,311
you know,

437
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,530
what the fuck are we doing on this planet?

438
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,950
We're enjoying our company and we can
do that or we can just create chaos and

439
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,540
create problems everywhere we go.

440
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,830
If we repeat the same patterns,

441
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,630
which were like to do,

442
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,700
if somehow or another,

443
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:40,780
it doesn't reset itself.

444
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,733
Exactly.

445
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,030
I actually feel like we're
in a big resetting right now.

446
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,900
Like I can feel it.

447
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:48,820
I can start to see it
in the people around me.

448
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And just that there's a way that you can
reach anybody who would like to listen

449
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:54,461
to you can,

450
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:55,090
you can,

451
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,050
you can do that right now.

452
00:12:56,051 --> 00:13:00,010
That is different that 10 years ago
you weren't no available like this.

453
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,431
Yeah.

454
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:00,731
No.

455
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:02,260
10 years ago there was nothing like this.

456
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,720
No.

457
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,840
You would have to put it on a radio show.

458
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,400
They would put you in jail to crazy job,

459
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,623
lost it all.

460
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,521
They would tell you,

461
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,690
you're out of your mind for every,

462
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,150
almost everything you're
talking about illegal drugs.

463
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,760
But I was listening the other day,

464
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,160
um,

465
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,720
uh,

466
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,080
are,

467
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,320
um,

468
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,690
was reading rather about
the Hollywood sign.

469
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:19,931
You know,

470
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,730
the Hollywood sign used
to be Hollywood land.

471
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah.

472
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
And at one point in [inaudible]
76 somebody got up there
and made it Hollyweed

473
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,220
because they passed some decriminalization
law in California close to being

474
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,430
legal nationally during
Carter's administration.

475
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,030
Wow.

476
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,030
So close.

477
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,541
So yeah,

478
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:38,701
it's,

479
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,160
it's,

480
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,750
if you really look into the,

481
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,640
the journey of cannabis,

482
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:42,960
you know,

483
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,171
it's,

484
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:44,004
it's,

485
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,400
it's criminal and it's,

486
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:45,790
you know,

487
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,320
what they've done to this,

488
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,270
this natural product.

489
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,540
It's ridiculous.

490
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,060
It's really bad.

491
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,240
And the people that are
trying to keep it illegal,

492
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,340
or the people who could
benefit from it the most,

493
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:57,880
oh,

494
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,410
he's,

495
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,020
oh,

496
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,320
those people all need to get onto it.

497
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,510
That's what I love when,

498
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,830
when Colorado and Denver and
Colorado is doing that thing there,

499
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,560
you know,

500
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,161
making it legal,

501
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:06,551
they're saying,

502
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,240
look,

503
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
it's just better than you.

504
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:08,600
No,

505
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:08,860
no.

506
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,060
You're not going to get in a fight.

507
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,470
You go to the barn,

508
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:11,621
you,

509
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:11,920
you know,

510
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,760
have a smoke,

511
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,600
you're going to be chilled.

512
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,380
You know,

513
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,760
you're not going to cause damage.

514
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,241
Yeah.

515
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,570
You're not going to just become a
crazy person who can't even drive.

516
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,030
You know,

517
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,030
that's unbelievable that almost everywhere
in America are these spots where you

518
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:29,740
can get fueled up with a drug that
makes your body not work so well.

519
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,290
And we're fine with that
car getting your car.

520
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,890
And of course we don't want you to
drunk drive and we pray take cabs and we

521
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:36,724
always say that.

522
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,920
However the possibility is always there.

523
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,030
You're talking about a drug that massively
inhibits your thinking process and

524
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:47,560
makes you do really irrational shit and
you're combining it with the access to a

525
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:47,951
car.

526
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,870
I mean the idea that people see through
that our society was built on that.

527
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:52,080
All

528
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,913
the,

529
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,690
it's that worker society.

530
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:58,170
Keep them on the caffeine and
the sugar and the alcohol.

531
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,650
Oh and do you think it's a self
fulfilling sort of a thing?

532
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,000
Cause those things are all awesome.

533
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,873
That's

534
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
caffeine is awesome.

535
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,050
Sugars.

536
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,640
Awesome.

537
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,410
The alcoholism,

538
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,200
the shit.

539
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,140
It's all good stuff.

540
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,690
So I mean is it possible
that we just like it,

541
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,103
you know,

542
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,810
instead of caffeine changed
the world and sugar too.

543
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,120
Yes,

544
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,570
it was what brought industry too,

545
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,080
you know,

546
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,160
Britain and that's why colonialism happen.

547
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:26,520
That's why they conquered the world so
they could bring spice and taste and

548
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,354
sugar.

549
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,460
And in the 18 hundreds of the,

550
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,030
uh,

551
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,770
the British doctors were like,

552
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,111
Whoa,

553
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:32,611
wait a minute.

554
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:34,590
We're seeing all these new
diseases now because of sugar.

555
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:34,750
It's,

556
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,251
it's a drug,

557
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:35,551
it's a drug.

558
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:35,871
And they were like,

559
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:36,030
no,

560
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,863
too late.

561
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,180
Once they had figured out how to
extract sugar from natural products,

562
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:46,610
and then you can get these massive
doses of it right into your bloodstream,

563
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,050
eat spoons of sugar kids.

564
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,340
Do you see the,

565
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,240
they get a little,

566
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,451
oh,

567
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,440
we got a cupcake at school
and they lose their mind.

568
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,181
Yeah.

569
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:56,430
I gave my little one
cotton candy yesterday.

570
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,130
She went off.

571
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,251
She went off.

572
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,360
She only weighs like 30 pounds.

573
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,194
You're like a pounding.

574
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,100
Say It's,

575
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,933
it's tough.

576
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,750
It's tough.

577
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,583
It's a drug.

578
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,910
And for drug wrecks,

579
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,060
our immune system sugar just
totally wrecks our immune system.

580
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,950
And that's why a lot of us are so sick.

581
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,570
Yeah,

582
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,820
it's really close to like a toxin.

583
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,301
I mean,

584
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,400
there's a lot of people that
are trying to say it's a car.

585
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,950
So I felt fed my baby a delicious toxin.

586
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,050
But it's fine.

587
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,010
They're so available.

588
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:25,070
And they do have kids going to want it.

589
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,750
Can't have it every day.

590
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,350
No,

591
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,370
every day you'd healthy.

592
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,260
But if you're at Disneyland,

593
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:30,561
fuck,

594
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,060
it's time to go off and go.

595
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,030
They sell cotton candy machines
at target for the kids.

596
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,030
These little machines,

597
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,160
they're like 50 bucks.

598
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,790
You make your own cotton candy.

599
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,380
That's so wrong.

600
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,050
That's just pure sugar.

601
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,750
And then put them in
front of TV and you'd,

602
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,420
you've got,

603
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,620
we've brainwashed him
and then it's all good.

604
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,663
Yeah.

605
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,260
And then they're ready to be plugged in,

606
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,730
unfortunately,

607
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,890
but is awesome too.

608
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,230
That's also probably exactly.

609
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,790
I am not a,

610
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,330
I don't,

611
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,163
I'm a not a,

612
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm not going to do any of this.

613
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:02,910
Right.

614
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,040
I believe in all of these
things in moderation.

615
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,500
It's all about balance because I
don't want to be the other way.

616
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,340
I don't want to be,

617
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,020
I'm not going to do this
and this and this and that,

618
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:13,610
because those things are fun and they're
beautiful in the ad tastes and spice to

619
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,220
life.

620
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,140
And I want that balance.

621
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:17,640
And it's just about balance.

622
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,181
Yeah.

623
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:19,290
It's a moderation thing,

624
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:19,501
right?

625
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:24,060
It's like figuring out how to ride
the waves of not be addicted to it,

626
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:25,500
not victim to it,

627
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,270
but also enjoy a little
TV every now and again.

628
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:28,491
Yes.

629
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:28,800
Ham,

630
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,890
some good shows off.

631
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm like,

632
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,060
what's wrong with you?

633
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,610
It doesn't mean the
shutting off the world.

634
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,010
I think that it's not
an either or situation.

635
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,370
I think if you know what,

636
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,280
what you're being manipulated by,

637
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,260
when you see like an advertisement of,

638
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,620
you understand the manipulation behind it,

639
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:44,861
the,

640
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:45,430
the,

641
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,270
the,

642
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,030
you know what they are intending.

643
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,251
If you know that,

644
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,360
then you can be safe and go in,

645
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,880
but if you go in and just
watch mindlessly and more,

646
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,890
you will be swept away in it.

647
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,460
Yeah.

648
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,570
It's like a balance issue,

649
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:57,900
right?

650
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,530
Yeah.

651
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,170
I think there's just
got to figure out how,

652
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,433
how do you do it?

653
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,303
How do I do it?

654
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,630
It's a constant practice every single day.

655
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,790
It started when I went
through breast cancer.

656
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,320
It's that sort of,

657
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,150
Oh fuck,

658
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,180
I could die in.

659
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:12,500
All right.

660
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,990
Oh,

661
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,411
wait a minute.

662
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:13,581
This,

663
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,414
this is serious.

664
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,490
And I,

665
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,170
I,

666
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,003
I had this,

667
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,230
I actually ate,

668
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,640
it was one of those senior,

669
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,474
you're talking about we,

670
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,321
before we went over,

671
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,850
you're talking about cannabis and actually
the difference between smoking in an

672
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,590
eating it.

673
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,710
And I eaten a couple of cookies
and they were of course delicious.

674
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,720
I had a bit more than I should.

675
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,400
And I had one of those
really severe trips.

676
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,850
And in that came a very clear
understanding of the nature of life,

677
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,470
of,

678
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,280
of,

679
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,540
of balance of,

680
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,230
and I came back,

681
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,820
went through breast cancer,

682
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,283
went through the,

683
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,580
the system.

684
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,540
I did the chemo,

685
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:51,721
you know,

686
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,140
I was on bald and I did all that
and I gotta have it and going,

687
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:55,530
wait a minute,

688
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,730
while I'm in this,

689
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
every doctor I had kept saying,

690
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,420
cancer starts when sales go bad.

691
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,681
And I go,

692
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,040
okay,

693
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,120
well why do cells go bad?

694
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,320
And none of them would answer me.

695
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,680
None of them had that answer because
that's the way our medical system is set

696
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,070
up.

697
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,430
And this has been a journey of
finding out why did my cells go bad?

698
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,480
Why did they go back?

699
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,313
It was the,

700
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,370
it was my nutrition,

701
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,540
it was my stress.

702
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,441
It was,

703
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,011
I didn't drink enough.

704
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:21,630
Water is very simple stuff and
it's about an emotional imbalance.

705
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,600
We got to bring emotion back
into balance in the body.

706
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:25,940
Yeah.

707
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,241
It's,

708
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:30,210
it's as much of a factor I believe
as all the other things in your body,

709
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:30,841
your blood,

710
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:31,591
your tissues,

711
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,281
your bone.

712
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,240
I think your,

713
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:37,140
your emotional health
is as important as your,

714
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,640
your biological health,

715
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,050
health of your actual body.

716
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:40,920
If they're connected.

717
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,460
Yes,

718
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,881
it was.

719
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,714
The um,

720
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,050
unfortunately was the Catholic church in
400 and when day they cart decided that

721
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:48,911
he,

722
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:49,560
he was like,

723
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,900
I went to the church and he
said I want to study medicine.

724
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,940
I want to study the human body.

725
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:54,361
And they said,

726
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:54,631
okay,

727
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,380
you can study.

728
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,280
It wasn't medicine yet.

729
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,420
He invented medicine.

730
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,471
They said okay,

731
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:03,330
you can study the body but the emotion
and soul that stays with the church and

732
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:08,331
that's one of the reasons why this break
happened and all of our great thought

733
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,760
and intention and the smartest of us for
hundreds of years have only developed

734
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,800
the body separate from emotion.

735
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,830
And we are now seeing that break down
the whole system or whole healthcare,

736
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,270
everything because it,

737
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,750
it,

738
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,770
it's just not true anymore.

739
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,460
Emotion plays I,

740
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,150
my belief is it plays
almost all the part of,

741
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,830
of disease dis ease.

742
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,343
Wow.

743
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,380
But what about like little
children with horrible disorders?

744
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,550
I should.

745
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,380
Well then you have to get into,

746
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,000
and this is where it gets it.

747
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,690
This is where it talks about.

748
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,100
We are here to create,

749
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,250
this is where we talk
about we're here to create.

750
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,990
We are here to work through
whatever we've decided.

751
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:54,171
I mean,

752
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:54,400
you know,

753
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,060
this gets in a real spiritual stuff.

754
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:56,900
The stuff before,

755
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:57,221
you know,

756
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:57,350
and,

757
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,610
and,

758
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,990
and it all depends on your basic belief.

759
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,390
My belief is all of us have,

760
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,840
all of us create what we need to work
through to create and learn what we need

761
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,111
to in this world.

762
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:11,480
And so I can't look at anyone as a victim.

763
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,420
I can't even a child.

764
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,400
I don't blame them.

765
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,960
I don't say this is your fault.

766
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,933
I say,

767
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,960
you made an agreement in this place to
do this and I am sending you all my love.

768
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,980
And I believe in you and
I believe that you will,

769
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,810
you can be a miracle

770
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,651
when you,

771
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:36,550
when you say that like,

772
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,080
but do you mean that like when you
see someone who has a disability,

773
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:42,580
you don't see it as a disability.

774
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:46,720
You just see that they're just another
entity in this life and just go forward

775
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,540
with love and it all
works out in the long run.

776
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,650
It all works out great anyway.

777
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,543
Is that what you mean?

778
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,110
What sort of,

779
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,500
and it's what you,

780
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,460
it's what you deem works out in the end
because a lot of people have different

781
00:21:58,461 --> 00:21:59,750
ideas of what that is.

782
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,260
I have tons of people that come to me
who are stage four cancer and the doctors

783
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:06,780
have said there's nothing we can do.

784
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:07,970
You're going to die in a few weeks.

785
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,720
And they,

786
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,720
they come to me all the time in cities
all over the world and I want to,

787
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,970
and I try and sometimes it works.

788
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:21,971
Sometimes their belief is I just give
them another way of looking at it.

789
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,680
If you have another perception other than
cancer is something that that happens

790
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,400
to me and oops,

791
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,233
I got it.

792
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,200
If you understand it is my body is on
this journey and my emotion and you're

793
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:39,200
willing to to dissect and and break apart.

794
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:39,560
You know,

795
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,221
what am I eating?

796
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,300
What am I feeling?

797
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:42,200
What am I doing?

798
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,220
Where am I?

799
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,540
What do I need to change?

800
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,200
You can control cancer
because it is a symptom.

801
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,250
It is not something that happens.

802
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:54,251
It is your own cells that have
been so taxed by your [inaudible],

803
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,481
your immune system,

804
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:59,610
which has been taxed by sugar or motion
or any of that stress that is sick

805
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,530
stress.

806
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,310
It's so taxed that then
those cells go bad.

807
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,170
Is it all environmental though?

808
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,940
I mean is it all emotional?

809
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,380
It's some Arthur,

810
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:10,910
some random genetic rolls.

811
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:14,820
The dice like kids that are born with
massive birth defects and along those,

812
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,300
well this is the lie,

813
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:16,631
this,

814
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,464
this,

815
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,461
it's,

816
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:21,220
it's how you hold reality and creation.

817
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,700
I believe that this
reality is one of thought.

818
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,310
So whatever you are creating,

819
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,640
whatever that know that
that massive deformity,

820
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,600
that massive thing,

821
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,000
it comes from it.

822
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,940
It's theirs.

823
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,021
It is theirs too.

824
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm not judging it.

825
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,390
I'm loving it.

826
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm not seeing them as a victim.

827
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,250
I don't believe something
unjust happened to them.

828
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:50,140
And I don't believe something
just happened to them.

829
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,940
I believe that this is the balance of
life and we are all here to walk through

830
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,110
it and make our choices.

831
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,120
Wow.

832
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,260
That's heavy duty stuff.

833
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,891
I mean,

834
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:03,310
um,

835
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,310
I think there's something to a person
that has gone through what you've gone

836
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:12,250
through physically or you get
to a real point where you're,

837
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,581
you know,

838
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,590
you're worrying about your body ending,

839
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:16,390
you worrying about your trip being over.

840
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,820
And I think the insight that people that
have been through those situations and

841
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,450
they,

842
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:22,710
it's,

843
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,460
it's really remarkable and it always makes
me wonder why we can't wrap our heads

844
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:29,470
around that without a crisis.

845
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,890
You know?

846
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,590
That's what,

847
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,760
that's one of the reasons why
I love to come talk to you.

848
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,400
It's why I want to talk,

849
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,880
because I would love to just have
one person not have to get to crisis,

850
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,990
but to go,

851
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,381
wait a minute.

852
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,910
That might be the path that I'm,

853
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,020
I'm on.

854
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
Maybe this can help me.

855
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,691
Maybe it can,

856
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:49,830
because when I was in it,

857
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,790
I saw what the fear of death can do.

858
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,743
It it,

859
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,950
it holds everyone.

860
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,031
It cancer.

861
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:57,271
I mean,

862
00:24:57,271 --> 00:24:59,400
I still see people and it's been eight,

863
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:02,940
nine years now since I was diagnosed and
went through all that and people still

864
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:03,774
look at me like,

865
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,153
are you dying?

866
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:05,880
You know,

867
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,300
they,

868
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,410
they still hold.

869
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:08,820
It's a powerful energy.

870
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,310
Yeah.

871
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,721
It's,

872
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:11,554
it's um,

873
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,190
it's a weird part of our life
and weird part of our journey.

874
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:21,191
The body just sort of failing prematurely
in some strange way where it's growing

875
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,820
its own problem.

876
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,040
Well that's,

877
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,520
or there is something,

878
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,800
there is some choice that I'm making.

879
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,720
My body is perfect.

880
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:33,820
Every single human body is amazing.

881
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,401
Perfect.

882
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:34,701
Right?

883
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,451
But what about people?

884
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,100
That's what environmental factors,

885
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:37,401
you know,

886
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,720
exposure to radiation.

887
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,550
Why are you there?

888
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,710
You are there because you,

889
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,000
you major in again is not about blame,

890
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,360
right.

891
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,290
It's this is,

892
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,880
you chose this when,

893
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,540
when you were just an angel or a spirit
of what everyone calls you believe they

894
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,050
chose,

895
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,750
chose this life when?

896
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,050
From another dimension.

897
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,923
Yeah.

898
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,843
When you've been there.

899
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,670
I wash,

900
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,680
I wonder.

901
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,813
Yeah,

902
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,990
I have and I haven't,

903
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,853
you know what I'm saying?

904
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,341
It's like,

905
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:01,670
uh,

906
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,420
the,

907
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,810
the ideas from the psychedelic experience.

908
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,103
Yeah.

909
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,290
The ideas are very intoxicating.

910
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,453
But,

911
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,613
uh,

912
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,460
I wonder how much of it is correct when
it comes to things along those lines.

913
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:18,200
Like you choosing your own destiny,

914
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,480
try letting go of the fear,

915
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,310
try believing it.

916
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,380
Tribal leaving it just once for one day.

917
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:25,591
Yeah.

918
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:26,430
I couldn't believe it,

919
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,221
but,

920
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,054
um,

921
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,370
I mean I could discipline leave it to,

922
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,761
you know,

923
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,200
I could do it.

924
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,840
So it can be whatever.

925
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,340
Yeah.

926
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
I mean you can,

927
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,260
in that sense,

928
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,880
if you believe something like that,

929
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:39,230
I really can sort of
create a reality for you.

930
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,430
Absolute powering that.

931
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,370
That's the,

932
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,203
and that was my,

933
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm going to choose

934
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,300
to walk like this ever.

935
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,041
And it's not easy.

936
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:47,431
Believe me.

937
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,500
Everything in a real
reality you want to say.

938
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:49,800
Okay.

939
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,581
Well except for that,

940
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,620
cause that just happened to
me and I'm just blaming that.

941
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,170
Yeah,

942
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:53,560
I would,

943
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:53,980
I would,

944
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I would really look at it that way if
it wasn't for a massive environmental

945
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:57,814
issues,

946
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,640
you know,

947
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:58,990
um,

948
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,100
toxic issues,

949
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:04,150
things along those lines where people
clearly like a whole town gets cancer

950
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,760
because it was a fucking factor in your
bar and they're throwing some shit in a

951
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:08,080
lake and people don't know about it.

952
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,610
Now go beyond that story,

953
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,330
go there and 10 years and find
out whose life was made better,

954
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,710
whose life was changed,

955
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,880
what happened.

956
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,610
There's everything happens for a reason.

957
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,730
So you think you like a deterministic,

958
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,290
deterministic person.

959
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,150
What you believe that the world is
moves in a way that you cannot control?

960
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,810
No,

961
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,110
no.

962
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,943
Again,

963
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,581
again,

964
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:31,761
it's,

965
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,380
it's slippery because no,

966
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:34,760
I don't believe I'm not a fatalist.

967
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,330
I believe each and every one of us
controls our own reality every single day

968
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,600
through every choice
we make the choice of,

969
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,200
of what?

970
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,500
Eat,

971
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,820
what to think,

972
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,673
how to feel.

973
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,960
A lot of us think we don't
have a choice in how to feel.

974
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,760
Well,

975
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,880
you hurt me so I'm angry.

976
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,121
What do you,

977
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:56,954
I don't have a choice.

978
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,980
You do.

979
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,210
Everything is choice.

980
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,493
And then,

981
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,010
you know,

982
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,930
throw some spirituality
on it and you get the,

983
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,790
everything's a choice just
between love and fear.

984
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,120
And if you break it down
that small into every breath,

985
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,230
it's like a practice.

986
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:14,231
That's why the monks go live on the hill
and all alone so that they can get to

987
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:17,000
this perfect place of nut.

988
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:17,834
Neither blame.

989
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,400
You're not a judge and
you're not a victim,

990
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,600
you're just right in there.

991
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:21,434
In the middle.

992
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:21,961
Yeah.

993
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,840
The monks essentially
give up all civilization,

994
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,790
give up life entirely.

995
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,653
No sex,

996
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,763
no.

997
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,420
I would not want to do that at all.

998
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,350
And I believe you can do that in this
life as you were referring to earlier.

999
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,040
Balance.

1000
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,560
Yeah.

1001
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:35,770
To,

1002
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,960
to joy at all.

1003
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,440
Yeah.

1004
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,910
I've always felt like monks are pussies.

1005
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,040
You can't handle it really.

1006
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,130
I know relationships are tough
but wasn't relationships.

1007
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,680
All of the best music
comes from relationships.

1008
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,131
Hey,

1009
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:47,480
I'm,

1010
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm living proof.

1011
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,691
Yeah,

1012
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:49,021
Moss.

1013
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,510
Right.

1014
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,840
So go back and listen to like
the greatest songs of all time.

1015
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,250
It's always a guy and a girl,

1016
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,450
like talking about some shit.

1017
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,260
We thought we'd be together forever.

1018
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,880
Those,

1019
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,121
yeah.

1020
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:00,331
I mean,

1021
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:01,081
if it wasn't for that,

1022
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,670
where would the other
beautiful art come from?

1023
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,130
There's a yin and a
Yang to this crazy life.

1024
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,001
Absolutely.

1025
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,620
And when you can hold on to that,

1026
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,250
they neither going into all
the fear nor all the love.

1027
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm not all airy fairy.

1028
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,130
If you can hold that middle
life gets really cool.

1029
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,241
Yeah.

1030
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,470
If you can hold that metal,

1031
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,620
how do you go about holding that metal?

1032
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,280
Do you every single day he just,

1033
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,001
it's a practice.

1034
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,690
It's a practice.

1035
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,200
You don't,

1036
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,830
you just,

1037
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,461
you stay in the,

1038
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:30,210
now did your personality
change when this happened?

1039
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,860
Uh,

1040
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,220
in a way I let go a lot
of personality reactions.

1041
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:38,640
I believe that you call up who,

1042
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,240
who,

1043
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,073
who is going to be,

1044
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,690
who's sitting here today
across the table at you.

1045
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm choosing who gets to answer this.

1046
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,230
I would like a 51 year
old Melissa to answer you.

1047
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,550
Not 14 year old,

1048
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:51,750
14 year old has answered,

1049
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,230
you know,

1050
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,280
in my relationships,

1051
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,091
14 year old Melissa,

1052
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:58,890
she comes out and she said some pretty
naughty things and that's who I can

1053
00:29:58,891 --> 00:30:00,570
choose how to do it.

1054
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:00,841
So it's,

1055
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,960
it's this choice every day how I do it.

1056
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,221
Yeah.

1057
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,520
That's a weird thing where we sort
of get stuck in those young patterns.

1058
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,331
The patterns are,

1059
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:09,571
I mean,

1060
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:10,680
a lot of people do though.

1061
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:11,080
It's,

1062
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,641
it's really,

1063
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:12,231
really common.

1064
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:12,310
Yeah.

1065
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,120
Every day I do,

1066
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,953
every day,

1067
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
I'm looking at it right now.

1068
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,553
Oh No.

1069
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,740
That's how he always does it.

1070
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,510
Oh,

1071
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,343
you got to,

1072
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,240
it's finding out how to manage your life
is probably one of the most difficult

1073
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:30,241
things that the person can accomplish
in their life or attempt to accomplish,

1074
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:30,880
I should say.

1075
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,920
Isn't that what it's all about?

1076
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:33,280
That's,

1077
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,120
that's where I want to,

1078
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,931
I want to come to you.

1079
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,160
I want to come to listeners.

1080
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,190
Everyone as a person
who I achieve my goal.

1081
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,941
I said,

1082
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,420
I was born,

1083
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,260
I set out,

1084
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,550
I was in born in Leavenworth,

1085
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,384
Kansas.

1086
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,620
I wanted to be a rockstar.

1087
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,080
I ought to be rockstar.

1088
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,680
I wanted to meet Bruce Springsteen.

1089
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,860
I got to meet Bruce based.

1090
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:49,640
And you know,

1091
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,510
it's like those dreams came true.

1092
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,811
Well,

1093
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,260
there's something that happens
after those dreams come true.

1094
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,190
You realize,

1095
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,023
Oh,

1096
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,901
I'm still me.

1097
00:30:58,901 --> 00:30:59,950
I still have all my problems.

1098
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:04,951
I'm still so where someone who
might hold that big dream and think,

1099
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:06,851
well,

1100
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,511
I'll never get it.

1101
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:11,200
And so they just hold it out there
and then they have lots of excuses.

1102
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:11,561
Well,

1103
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:12,520
if I got that,

1104
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,181
then I'd be there,

1105
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,020
but I'm not,

1106
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,411
you know,

1107
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:14,521
I,

1108
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:15,400
I'd have enough money.

1109
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,870
I'd have enough this or that.

1110
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,150
Then you can get caught in the,

1111
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,780
the turmoil of life and
always believed that,

1112
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:22,961
well,

1113
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,390
if I was famous or if I had more money,

1114
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,850
I'd be better while I'm here to
tell you that the fame of the money,

1115
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,630
it's nice.

1116
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,351
I'll absolutely,

1117
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,710
I love not having to wait in line.

1118
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,071
You know,

1119
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:33,904
it's right.

1120
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,700
Yet it does not solve all my

1121
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,890
problems and it can cloud you
in a little bit of confusion.

1122
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,131
Oh,

1123
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:40,980
we see that every day.

1124
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:46,010
We've all met famous people or seeing
people wig out up in certain ways.

1125
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:46,431
We are like,

1126
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:46,791
okay,

1127
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,170
you're,

1128
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,240
you're being like a child
throwing like a child's Tantrum.

1129
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:50,780
Yeah.

1130
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,750
Because they're making choices
to let the child still do that.

1131
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,350
Yeah.

1132
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,880
And there's a weird imbalance.

1133
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,020
There's a certain type,

1134
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,520
there's a one type of celebrity.

1135
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,271
The I told you,

1136
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:00,980
so celebrity and the reason why,

1137
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:01,730
I mean,

1138
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,180
why,

1139
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,871
why call it that?

1140
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:06,110
It's like they're the type
that once they get famous,

1141
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,610
like they feel like the whole
world fucked them up until now.

1142
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,270
And now that they've got the world
by the balls because they're famous,

1143
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,120
they just really act shitty to be evil.

1144
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,740
And I've seen that,

1145
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,960
that one that's a really shocking one.

1146
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,140
And you put that out and what
you put out comes back and yeah,

1147
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,481
just,

1148
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:26,100
just sit back and watch their,

1149
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,833
their world.

1150
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,290
Yeah,

1151
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,123
come down.

1152
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah.

1153
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,900
It's hard enough getting through this
life without acting like the world owes

1154
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,291
you something.

1155
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:38,700
And that's that sort of delusional
thinking among successful famous people.

1156
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,610
It's very,

1157
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,450
very odd

1158
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,770
because that's like the furthest from
the vulnerability of the reality of our

1159
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:45,760
biological life.

1160
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,270
Right.

1161
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,760
But it was the dream that we were fed.

1162
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:51,760
I grew up in the 60s and
the 70s you want to be,

1163
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,200
you want to do better
than your parents did.

1164
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:55,570
You want to make more
money and buy thanks.

1165
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:57,550
Because that's the meaning of life.

1166
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,230
That's how you show your successful.

1167
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,083
Yeah.

1168
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,270
Not Management.

1169
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,410
Not like health,

1170
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:03,880
not no happiness,

1171
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,714
smile.

1172
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,730
Oh No.

1173
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,381
All those things.

1174
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:06,591
Yeah.

1175
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:06,771
No,

1176
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:06,861
no,

1177
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,010
no,

1178
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,080
no,

1179
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,680
no.

1180
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,041
Yes.

1181
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,990
Miles per hour is probably very important.

1182
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,490
I never thought of it like that,

1183
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,340
but that phrase,

1184
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:13,290
smiles per hour,

1185
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,030
like you should probably
have a lot of that.

1186
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,070
A lot of smiles per hour.

1187
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,290
You'd probably get off way better in life.

1188
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,431
A fence.

1189
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,190
So huge like laughter and having fun,

1190
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,810
so God damn huge.

1191
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,700
People that don't laugh about things,

1192
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,110
I just don't understand.

1193
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,280
Yeah.

1194
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,810
There's this is emotional
stunting sort of a thing to that,

1195
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:34,380
right?

1196
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,213
Yeah.

1197
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:36,780
Yeah.

1198
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,740
How do you fix that?

1199
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,491
You again,

1200
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:42,420
take care of yourself.

1201
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,100
You have to,

1202
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,480
you can fix yourself.

1203
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,730
You cannot fix anyone else.

1204
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,280
That's funny how people
who can't fix themselves.

1205
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,550
Oh yeah.

1206
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,900
There's a lot of those.

1207
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,240
There's a whole lot of that
and married to view those.

1208
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,520
Those people are crazy.

1209
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,150
They'll tell you what
to do and you're like,

1210
00:33:59,151 --> 00:33:59,361
look,

1211
00:33:59,361 --> 00:33:59,931
your own life,

1212
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:00,280
bitch,

1213
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,113
you're

1214
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,470
not happy and you're giving advice.

1215
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,310
Once I realized I cannot fix anybody else,

1216
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,150
no one else.

1217
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,983
Right.

1218
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,900
I became much happier person myself.

1219
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,130
You can't fix them,

1220
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:21,131
but you can rock their world with a song
that changes the way they feel about

1221
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:26,750
life and if even if only like
for a three or four minute song,

1222
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:28,340
even if it's only for the
three or four minutes,

1223
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,130
but the positive reaction that someone
can get for something like that,

1224
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,460
is that going to affect their choices?

1225
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,481
Absolutely.

1226
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:36,710
Then you start seeing how it,

1227
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,680
yeah.

1228
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,800
If it like w w when you had jobs.

1229
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:40,320
If I don't,

1230
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,920
do you ever have jobs like
regular jobs back in the day,

1231
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,630
back in the day,

1232
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,440
had a couple,

1233
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,530
if you listened to a bad ass song before
you went in for an audition or for an

1234
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:49,100
interview,

1235
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,240
like you'd be in a better way,

1236
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,821
Maria,

1237
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:51,090
you,

1238
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,970
you'd have a little pep
to you and they'd be like,

1239
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:55,350
I like this average girl.

1240
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:57,760
She's got Muxy energy.

1241
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:58,950
Yeah,

1242
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,250
because you had heard some,

1243
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:00,581
you know,

1244
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:03,190
some fucking Badass music in
your car on the way over there.

1245
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,083
It's vibrational.

1246
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:04,930
Yeah.

1247
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:04,970
Yeah,

1248
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,800
but that's hippy shit
that balanced the hippie.

1249
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,690
Bring your inner hippie out.

1250
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,970
But the regular hippies are so annoying.

1251
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,430
They've ruined it for the hippie.

1252
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,510
Ideal about Doty lazy motherfuckers.

1253
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,740
You guys,

1254
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,603
ew,

1255
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,181
stinky,

1256
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:24,050
lazy hippies.

1257
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,760
They have ruined the hippie culture,

1258
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,390
but not a bounce of Petrolia and not
even a little bit of petroleum you don't

1259
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:29,650
like,

1260
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,483
but truly at all.

1261
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,100
But if you met the most wonderful woman,

1262
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:34,934
she smell,

1263
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,890
smell it virtually Pachulia would give
you would I could get into rosewater

1264
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,071
right?

1265
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:41,580
I can't do it.

1266
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,413
Rose water is nice.

1267
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,810
It's this smelly Hippie is a problem.

1268
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,630
It's cause the smelly humans a problem.

1269
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,430
Ridiculous.

1270
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,780
Silly Bitch.

1271
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,310
What are you covering up?

1272
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,530
Why are you putting
rocks under your armpits?

1273
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,730
Get some deodorants.

1274
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,210
Aluminum Hammer is a natural
deodorants like herbs and shit.

1275
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,270
But don't put the aluminum.

1276
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,520
Not Aluminum is bad.

1277
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:09,354
It's really bad yet.

1278
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,110
Chlorhydrate and why
were they putting it in?

1279
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,220
Why are they putting in Deodorant?

1280
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,980
Because the aluminum

1281
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,270
industry 100 years ago,

1282
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:22,290
when it first started,

1283
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,100
had a lot of waste that
they needed to get rid of.

1284
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,093
Wow.

1285
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,220
So this aluminum waste
became sodium fluoride.

1286
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,560
Which was put in our water and um,

1287
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,010
it was thought to use.

1288
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:38,131
Oh,

1289
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,300
it'll keep us from sweating,

1290
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
which I'm sorry.

1291
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,401
You're supposed to sweat.

1292
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,150
There's a reason.

1293
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,331
Oh,

1294
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,590
so it's only antiperspirant,

1295
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,221
not deodorant.

1296
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:45,080
Right.

1297
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,660
I don't mind sweating.

1298
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,260
I just want to smell nice smell.

1299
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,030
Nice smelling lady.

1300
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,740
He smells very nice girls.

1301
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:53,574
If there's any,

1302
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,380
thank you very much.

1303
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,010
Um,

1304
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,210
but stinky people,

1305
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,440
you should know your stinky,

1306
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,020
stinky hippies.

1307
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,100
You fucking lazy.

1308
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:02,551
Bitches.

1309
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,384
Get up,

1310
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:03,811
get up,

1311
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,460
go run water.

1312
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,370
Water is everywhere and
soap is not expensive.

1313
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,263
Okay.

1314
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,030
Go get craft and you can use defense soap.

1315
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,930
It's natural.

1316
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,470
Okay.

1317
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,470
So it's a great soap that has like
tea tree oil in it and eucalyptus oil.

1318
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,411
It's all natural.

1319
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:19,961
It's good.

1320
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:20,970
It's good for the skin.

1321
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,990
Keeps good.

1322
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,940
It keeps you from getting like
ringworm and stuff like that.

1323
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,760
Are you talking to someone specifically?

1324
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,091
Yeah,

1325
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:27,924
unfortunately.

1326
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,990
Grapplers anyone who practices Jujitsu
has to deal with ringworm whirl.

1327
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,520
Wow.

1328
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:34,740
Yeah,

1329
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,191
it's really,

1330
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:36,090
really common as well.

1331
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,820
Staff,

1332
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,420
you can get staph infections too.

1333
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,220
I've had ringworm a couple of times.

1334
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,850
I've had staff twice.

1335
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,810
Jeez.

1336
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,643
Yeah.

1337
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,200
Once I caught it really early.

1338
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,430
So I didn't have to get about x.

1339
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
It took like a

1340
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,041
topical,

1341
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,510
but once it got pretty bad,

1342
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,003
it was weird.

1343
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,040
I had to take these super
strong antibiotics like
careful cause that if you look

1344
00:37:58,561 --> 00:37:59,310
at people's,

1345
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,810
I believe my cancer started with,

1346
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,850
I took these super duper antibiotics.

1347
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,140
It's actually the stuff,

1348
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,443
accutane.

1349
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I had really bad acne because I was out
of balance in the beginning and then I

1350
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,740
took a whole bunch of like
the super duper antibiotics.

1351
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,970
Those also are killing everything good
inside of you still don't understand

1352
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:18,151
that.

1353
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:18,440
Right?

1354
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,111
Or people have,

1355
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,180
when you do rounds and
rounds of antibiotics,

1356
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,620
you are really knocking yourself down.

1357
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,050
If you have a diagnosis of cancer.

1358
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,630
Look in your past,

1359
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,983
was there a time,

1360
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,170
did you do the antibiotics
right for it right before it,

1361
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,800
because it compromises the immune system.

1362
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,330
But you have a big infection like a staff.

1363
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,021
Absolutely.

1364
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,080
Kind of have to do kind of.

1365
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:39,430
Yeah,

1366
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,971
absolutely.

1367
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:44,620
So now it's a matter that you do have
to get the antibiotics great for.

1368
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,210
Then you have to put
probiotics back in here.

1369
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:51,211
So hoadly and you have to really be
aware of your acid and alkaline balance

1370
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,720
inside of you because that's what keeps
your immune system so a lot of green

1371
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:59,230
leafy vegetables and fruits
that acid off the list.

1372
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,190
Things along those lines.

1373
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:00,850
No gluten,

1374
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,683
no sugar.

1375
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,583
Yeah.

1376
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,011
Yeah.

1377
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:03,821
That gluten free.

1378
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:08,590
Where the hell was that 10 years ago
when I was there any gluten free food 20

1379
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:08,981
years ago?

1380
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:09,580
Was there any?

1381
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,910
No,

1382
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,743
hardly any.

1383
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,021
Well,

1384
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:16,021
because in the last 20 years what has
genetically modified our wheat and it's

1385
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:19,810
become just this an edible food.

1386
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,540
The real problem with that is that
Lasagna is delicious and you gave some,

1387
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,470
there are some good I can.

1388
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,490
I can bring you a gluten free Lasagna.

1389
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,353
I can do it.

1390
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,080
I'm going to,

1391
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,790
I had some Sunday for Superbowl.

1392
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,291
I did.

1393
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:32,710
I did.

1394
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,251
Don't make me go.

1395
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:36,120
Joey d is how you guys see paltry gluten.

1396
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,830
What are you talking about people?

1397
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,540
Gluten free.

1398
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,340
Lasagna just seems like a mess.

1399
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,430
I don't want,

1400
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,410
I don't want no part of that.

1401
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,990
I don't want to be pretending
that I'm enjoying it.

1402
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,890
I'm going to bring you some pot.

1403
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,990
I'm just going to bring you some pos.

1404
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,460
Isn't it a balanced I like,

1405
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,930
I like regular pasta though.

1406
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:53,621
Unfortunately.

1407
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:57,830
I've tried eight Ezekiel Pasta and I
use it because it's healthy for you.

1408
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,920
A sprouted grain posts.

1409
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,560
No one.

1410
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,240
It is,

1411
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,781
but again,

1412
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:02,201
the taste,

1413
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:02,500
it's like,

1414
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,830
Ooh,

1415
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,663
wow.

1416
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,180
You can find the balance.

1417
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,313
There are,

1418
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,340
they're spelt,

1419
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,100
spelt is like a lesser wheat.

1420
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:14,350
It's still a wheat and
it still will fluff up.

1421
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,190
You can get spelt bread.

1422
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,270
That's it's pretty good.

1423
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,613
I don't believe you.

1424
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,180
I'm going to show up him
and bring up pretty good.

1425
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,023
I'm like,

1426
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,121
why would I do that?

1427
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:25,241
What?

1428
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,590
I can get awesome delicious bread.

1429
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,701
I can make a sandwich.

1430
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,050
I like fat Italian bread.

1431
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,460
Oh,

1432
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,121
be yummy.

1433
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:30,954
Yummy.

1434
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,680
I just feel like if you love it,

1435
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,250
yes.

1436
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,150
If you're getting other people,

1437
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:34,580
I don't need it.

1438
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,500
A lot doesn't.

1439
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:35,830
Yeah.

1440
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,340
Good.

1441
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,030
I'm pretty bad.

1442
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,863
It's absolutely,

1443
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,520
but I like when it's there.

1444
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,031
I love it.

1445
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:40,660
Yeah.

1446
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,830
Linguine with clams.

1447
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,140
You have that like real and Queenie.

1448
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,160
Not some funky with Holy Pasta Shit.

1449
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,310
How was the whole week still bad,

1450
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:48,680
right?

1451
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,990
Is that always?

1452
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,833
Yeah,

1453
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,630
you too hardcore for a whole week.

1454
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,320
I know.

1455
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,190
Can just start selling t shirts
too hardcore for a whole week.

1456
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,610
So you're,

1457
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,870
you're like USB,

1458
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,070
like super organic thing.

1459
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,330
You see again,

1460
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:04,870
it's balanced.

1461
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,140
You would,

1462
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,973
you would think,

1463
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:06,821
but you know what?

1464
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,410
I have kids and they would run me.

1465
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,250
I have teenagers.

1466
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,770
They look at me like really
going to serve this for dinner.

1467
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,910
So it's about finding that in between,

1468
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,570
you know what?

1469
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,590
I searched and searched and I did find
good gluten free pasta that my kids don't

1470
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:21,580
even know that it's gluten free.

1471
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,660
Oh now they do.

1472
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,711
Oh yeah.

1473
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:25,180
Cause they're listening to your podcast.

1474
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,510
They're going to be in
trouble if they know.

1475
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,040
I thought this is real spaghetti,

1476
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:30,874
right?

1477
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,193
Hippy bullshit.

1478
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,250
Yeah.

1479
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,130
So I do try to,

1480
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:35,881
it's about a balance.

1481
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:36,780
It's about doing it seven,

1482
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:41,520
at least 70% alkaline or that the
whole foods and 30% you know what?

1483
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:41,790
Yeah,

1484
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,960
I had a pizza Sunday.

1485
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,770
It was super bowl football.

1486
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,643
We'll have a pizza.

1487
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,860
Pizza's delicious.

1488
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,090
You have a diet.

1489
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,360
It doesn't include PC or
something wrong with you.

1490
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,873
That's,

1491
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,281
that's dumb.

1492
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,050
You have one day a week,

1493
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,160
one day a week,

1494
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,000
absolutely.

1495
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,410
Dab Salumi.

1496
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,951
Do you know,

1497
00:41:58,951 --> 00:41:59,784
um,

1498
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,410
a lot of athletes,

1499
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,740
they,

1500
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,950
they eat clean everyday of the week
except one day and they'll have one day

1501
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:08,070
where they go bananas because it helps
you because otherwise you don't go,

1502
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:08,550
you know,

1503
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,970
start,

1504
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,660
oh I need,

1505
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,051
I need this.

1506
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,040
I'll never have this again in my life.

1507
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,810
And then you're up in
the middle of the night.

1508
00:42:12,811 --> 00:42:13,351
I haven't done that.

1509
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:13,951
So you know,

1510
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,240
who has amazing cheat days?

1511
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,650
I just started following him on Twitter,

1512
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,513
the Rock,

1513
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,530
if you ever ever seen with that guy,

1514
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:23,880
ain't dude pull up some photos of what
this guy eats his cheat days or as it

1515
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:24,070
were.

1516
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,200
He's a massive,

1517
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:28,830
massive human being and he works
out like two or three times a day.

1518
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,581
Two it's crazy.

1519
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,980
Like he's very inspirational
of a year in the exercise.

1520
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,560
If you go to his tweets like the guys
up at three 30 in the morning and doing

1521
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:36,250
cardio because he's got
to be on a movie set.

1522
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,084
It's six.

1523
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,411
Yeah,

1524
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:38,244
he's nuts.

1525
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,180
He's super,

1526
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:39,481
super,

1527
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:40,350
super dedicated,

1528
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,070
but he eats like really clean and healthy
and it takes pictures of his food.

1529
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,020
And then on one day a week he goes off
and I'm talking like giant stacks of

1530
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:50,340
brownies and like,

1531
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:51,174
uh,

1532
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,710
like a gallon of milk.

1533
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:53,790
That dude had like a mug.

1534
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:54,300
No.

1535
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,511
Yeah.

1536
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:54,781
Look,

1537
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,261
look at his,

1538
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:55,530
uh,

1539
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,460
his cheat days.

1540
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,110
It goes pink.

1541
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,130
Look at those pancakes.

1542
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,551
Look at,

1543
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:01,740
he's got four giant pizzas.

1544
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,570
It dude goes off.

1545
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,670
Look at the brownies and that Mug of milk,

1546
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,440
that is fucking insane.

1547
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,020
Fucking shredded.

1548
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,210
It guy's got no body fat.

1549
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,470
It's because all throughout the
rest of the week he goes bananas.

1550
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,880
He's at the gym all day,

1551
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:17,550
practically does movies and hits the gym.

1552
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,470
I do it backwards.

1553
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,011
Yeah,

1554
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:20,490
you do it.

1555
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:20,700
Yeah.

1556
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,840
I don't even do it backwards,

1557
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:22,674
bitch.

1558
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,980
There's not a moment in your life you
live as much intensity is that guy.

1559
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,371
Not,

1560
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,210
not even when you eat shit for

1561
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,531
doing it,

1562
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:32,364
but doing it that way.

1563
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:32,920
He's,

1564
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,290
he's just must be like a,

1565
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,310
a battery,

1566
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,350
just like constantly going like

1567
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,850
this shirt and people that like,

1568
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,140
you got to go wow.

1569
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:43,890
Like what's good,

1570
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,450
what gets you going like this?

1571
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,650
Three 30 in the morning,

1572
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:47,760
you're doing fucking cardio.

1573
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,760
I had six o'clock time
where had to be at work.

1574
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,990
I would get up at five 58
put my shoes on and show up.

1575
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:58,380
I'm not going to get up
at three 30 and do cardio.

1576
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,670
Indeed.

1577
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,510
I've never done anything.

1578
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:01,490
It's intense is that

1579
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,900
he works so much though.

1580
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,810
Maybe it doesn't have like
relationships so he has to do something.

1581
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:09,210
So like working out you only thing
cause he works in like nonstop.

1582
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,830
He's on a movie set for like seven
months and then to the next movie to say,

1583
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,161
yeah,

1584
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:14,960
well everything I've read about him,

1585
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,620
um,

1586
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:15,981
everything,

1587
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:16,850
every interview,

1588
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,140
every like tweety does.

1589
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,490
He seems like really thankful for all the
good things that have happened to him.

1590
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,420
And he works like if he's
got this attitude work hard
to get their work harder

1591
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:27,254
to stay there.

1592
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,550
So that's what I think it is.

1593
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:30,370
I think he's just obsessed with gratitude.

1594
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,300
Gratitude.

1595
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,961
Amazing.

1596
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:32,410
Gratitude

1597
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,040
is a medicine.

1598
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,420
You can change your life with gratitude.

1599
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,650
You really can write him.

1600
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:36,041
And we,

1601
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,670
and as we were saying before about
people who've had sort of near death

1602
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:42,640
experiences and became like very
spiritual afterwards and really sort of

1603
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,210
understood life in a,

1604
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:44,500
in a,

1605
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,840
in a broader perspective like
that you are choosing to,

1606
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,690
to look at life that way.

1607
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,260
It's kind of difficult for
people to visualize without the,

1608
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:54,940
the real life changing experience.

1609
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:55,774
But if you could,

1610
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,630
you would see so many
amazing things about life.

1611
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,850
It's the whole thing is a,

1612
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,470
a beautiful mystery.

1613
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,140
Yes.

1614
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:03,411
The whole,

1615
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:07,750
to hold it with less fear than you have
a less fearful life and realize that

1616
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:10,540
that energy that you're expressing unfair,

1617
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,640
you could be expressing on positive things
and advancing your position in life.

1618
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,930
Think your dancing.

1619
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,500
Yeah.

1620
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,310
Advancing you the way you interact with
people and enhancing your relationships

1621
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,630
and advancing the way you approach
whatever you do for a living and enhancing

1622
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,410
your creativity.

1623
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,260
Think of how you think about your
boss or someone that you work with,

1624
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:30,520
the energy that you spend going,

1625
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:30,821
oh,

1626
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:32,030
they're such a bad,

1627
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,370
remember that next time that
thought pops in your head go,

1628
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,001
okay,

1629
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:37,241
okay.

1630
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:37,511
I know.

1631
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:38,121
I don't feel that way,

1632
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:40,840
but I am grateful for
that job because blah,

1633
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:41,100
blah blah,

1634
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,460
or just I'm grateful.

1635
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,920
If you can find something to
be grateful about your boss,

1636
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:49,720
that's even better because then you can
kill that fear and turn it into love and

1637
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:50,860
I know it's all hippy dippy,

1638
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,070
but that's what creates more of that
positive vibration in your life.

1639
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,240
You know?

1640
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,130
You could also do,

1641
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,750
and this is very practical,

1642
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,410
if you have someone in your life that
you don't like and you have to work with

1643
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:04,040
them,

1644
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,590
use them as an exercise,

1645
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,410
an exercise in your own patients,

1646
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,710
an exercise in your own
ability to actually be kind
to someone that is not being

1647
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,930
kind to you because it gets
really weird when you do that.

1648
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,140
When you're kind to someone and
they're not being kind to you,

1649
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,070
they like,

1650
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,030
they get even more aggressive
sometimes and they,

1651
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,700
they like,

1652
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,980
they're almost like
they're stuck in there,

1653
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,970
they can't swim.

1654
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,510
It's like it becomes this
weird sort of situation.

1655
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,130
Fear and pain is is an energy that
people want to hook into you to release.

1656
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,400
Yeah.

1657
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,911
There's actually,

1658
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:37,211
again,

1659
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:41,250
you can look at it energetically
that I've got this little going on.

1660
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:41,381
Oh,

1661
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:41,860
there's somebody,

1662
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,191
oh,

1663
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:42,651
I can be,

1664
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:43,391
I can give it to you.

1665
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:44,980
And if you react,

1666
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:47,500
if you re act what I gave you,

1667
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:48,730
then,

1668
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:48,911
Oh,

1669
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:49,600
you've got it now.

1670
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,433
I don't have it anymore.

1671
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:51,580
I'm good.

1672
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,290
So break that chain,

1673
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,250
don't react,

1674
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,073
respond,

1675
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,191
look at them and go,

1676
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:57,520
okay,

1677
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,050
where can I find gratitude and love here?

1678
00:46:59,051 --> 00:46:59,681
All right,

1679
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:00,430
I'm just going to,

1680
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:00,731
you know what?

1681
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,650
You've got a lovely tie and just move on.

1682
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:03,250
Yeah.

1683
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,150
For some people though,

1684
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:08,320
they're always at like a seven or an
eight on a scale of one to 10 with being

1685
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:09,960
upset at things cause they,

1686
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,960
they're sort of this,

1687
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,680
this almost momentum of chaos in their
life from jobs to relationship to this,

1688
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:17,940
to that they,

1689
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,680
they never have this
moment where they can just

1690
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,583
stop.

1691
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:22,461
Well,

1692
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:23,294
here's one.

1693
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:29,740
When you start practicing living your
life intentionally understanding that it

1694
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:33,610
is all vibrational,

1695
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,300
then you start understanding that the
people that come into your life are all

1696
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:40,750
part of your vibration.

1697
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,680
So if there's someone in your life who
is always on to seven and eight and

1698
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,330
bringing it and losing it and all that,

1699
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,660
that's part of you and
the only thing you can do,

1700
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:50,471
you can't change them,

1701
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:51,760
but you can go inside yourself and go,

1702
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:51,941
okay,

1703
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,000
where's the part of me
that's afraid of that?

1704
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:58,210
I'm over the top and then I'm losing it
and then I end and you go in and heal

1705
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:03,040
that and then that person will
disappear or they will change,

1706
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,360
and I've done this for eight years now
and I can say that that is exactly what

1707
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:07,660
happens.

1708
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,830
How do you explain stalkers?

1709
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,563
I don't have any.

1710
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,820
You don't have any,

1711
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,350
but other people do because it's a sphere.

1712
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,270
You manifest it as a fear.

1713
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,000
It is.

1714
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,670
You are afraid that as as sexual as
you're being in a photograph or in a movie

1715
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:22,390
or something,

1716
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,760
that someone's going to take
that and that's going to end,

1717
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,310
take it wrong and come back and hurt you.

1718
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,173
It's a fear

1719
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,363
that's,

1720
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:34,080
that becomes very hippy dippy when
you're dealing with the reality of actual

1721
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,730
people actually being victimized.

1722
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,930
Just depends on what your
definition of reality is.

1723
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,183
Wow.

1724
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,120
You're really putting yourself out
there and I know I can only do it here.

1725
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,040
It's,

1726
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,900
it's such a weird way of looking at the
world and a lot of people think that

1727
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:50,490
that strange,

1728
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,990
although nonjudgmental,

1729
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,970
very non judgemental way of,

1730
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,170
of looking at the world,

1731
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,900
it's almost akin to like the secret

1732
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,100
like that kind of thinking.

1733
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,040
The secret is like the
Mcdonald's of this movement.

1734
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,520
I would say I feel that a lot of people
are starting to understand this on a,

1735
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,750
on a very basic level.

1736
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:09,080
Like,

1737
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,441
okay,

1738
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:11,600
if I just eat better,

1739
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:12,261
I'm going to feel better.

1740
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:12,471
Okay.

1741
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:14,270
Food must have some sort of
energy that makes me feel,

1742
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,770
and you start with that and then you
realize the things that do make you feel

1743
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:19,580
better,

1744
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,490
make your day better.

1745
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:20,630
And,

1746
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,960
and it,

1747
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,320
it's,

1748
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,153
it's,

1749
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:22,461
again,

1750
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,140
it's not going to happen all in one day,

1751
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:29,830
but it is something that is happening
on a very wide scale and the,

1752
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,390
it is the tipping point right now.

1753
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:33,710
I think there's more people who,

1754
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,780
I think there's people at home going home.

1755
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:35,601
That's what I always thought,

1756
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:37,450
but I was just too afraid to say yes,

1757
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,290
I have a model of the world.

1758
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,960
I think that comes from
more from the media,

1759
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,550
from books and movies and TV shows.

1760
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:51,290
That's sort of our model of how life
goes because we see that almost more than

1761
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,610
we see our neighbors lives.

1762
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,590
We see that almost more than,

1763
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:54,800
you know,

1764
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,230
we see other people interact with each
other and you think about how many hours

1765
00:49:57,231 --> 00:50:01,010
people in from the television watching
on television shows and it's almost,

1766
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,350
it becomes this very strange thing where
fiction becomes almost the framework

1767
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,810
for the culture and it also,

1768
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:10,070
it's sort of like,

1769
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,120
it becomes a strange issue
where everyone has to wonder,

1770
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:14,381
where's the,

1771
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,060
what are the roots of
all this coming from?

1772
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,520
Where,

1773
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,410
where's the roots of
all this crazy behavior?

1774
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,030
Or are we creating this ourselves?

1775
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:20,720
Is it,

1776
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,720
is our media creating this world that we
can't live up to that we can't keep up

1777
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:26,720
with and we don't?

1778
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,980
The unnatural

1779
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,130
interactions with each other
always perfect endings.

1780
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,620
The people that you're following
through the whole movie never die.

1781
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:34,140
Like,

1782
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,870
what are you showing me here,

1783
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,704
man?

1784
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,900
What are you showing me
that's so influential?

1785
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,360
And it's they're showing it to themselves,

1786
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,970
as we said about the people who
were in the movies themselves.

1787
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:45,470
It gets so crazy and delusional,

1788
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,280
like they are obviously caught up in
whatever the fuck that is as well.

1789
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,763
Yes.

1790
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,240
And there's a lot of,

1791
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:53,850
you can,

1792
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,280
there's a lot of different

1793
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,540
roads of thought and you can,

1794
00:50:59,541 --> 00:50:59,840
I've,

1795
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,830
I've been down the,

1796
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:01,071
you know,

1797
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:01,904
the David Eick,

1798
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,420
I've read all that I've gotten.

1799
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,323
What do you think of that guy?

1800
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,300
What's interesting is I started reading
him f eight years ago and I read all

1801
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,134
this stuff.

1802
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,063
You read all of it.

1803
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,371
I know.

1804
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:10,911
Can you believe that I,

1805
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,690
I was realizing I needed to understand
if I was going to change my life and I

1806
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:15,501
wanted to live too.

1807
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:16,610
I wanted to understand,

1808
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,450
to really understand this on
a very like a molecular level.

1809
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:21,350
I want to get this.

1810
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,770
So I started him and
the beautiful thing was,

1811
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:25,200
is he,

1812
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,320
he deconstructed everything,

1813
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,600
but doesn't he also
believe in the Reptilians?

1814
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,753
Yes.

1815
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,633
Okay.

1816
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:33,120
Okay.

1817
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,490
Part of this part of it.

1818
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:34,800
Yes,

1819
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,460
indeed.

1820
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:40,460
Part of this whole thing is each of us
is entitled to our belief and that's what

1821
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:43,314
his belief is.

1822
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,490
And that's what his belief is,

1823
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,860
that they're all reptiles though.

1824
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,760
But it doesn't mean he liked,

1825
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:48,090
he's like lectures on this.

1826
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,391
Oh yeah.

1827
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:50,010
But he also goes past it.

1828
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,650
He also goes past it and
he starts talking about,

1829
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:57,830
but in the end I understand that I am
living an intentional reality and that I

1830
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:04,431
create my reality and I have to go into
an only take care of myself because the

1831
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,470
enemy and he even goes hippy
dippy and he gets to love.

1832
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,760
He does at read his last book.

1833
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:09,151
Well,

1834
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:13,620
I believe that a lot of people that
have wacky ideas also can have very good

1835
00:52:13,621 --> 00:52:14,310
ideas.

1836
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:14,610
Yeah.

1837
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:14,821
I mean,

1838
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:16,020
I think the idea that you can,

1839
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,980
I mean that's what,

1840
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,490
that's the idea of taking someone's oh
good work and connecting it to some bad

1841
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:25,620
work as if it negates the good work.

1842
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,760
It doesn't really,

1843
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,780
I look at the world again in balance
and you can't have all good and the the,

1844
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,100
the issue comes when you start labeling
and judging what's bad and what is evil

1845
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:44,640
and then that's a whole nother homeboy
does think that the ruling elites are

1846
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:45,600
lizard people.

1847
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,370
That is an issue.

1848
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,560
That's an issue with thinking.

1849
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,450
That's an issue where you got to,

1850
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,280
you know what he will present you with.

1851
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,800
Probably won't I Betty.

1852
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,310
Whoa.

1853
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,050
I wouldn't that.

1854
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,110
Wouldn't you love to get David I to
sit down with Neil degrasse Tyson.

1855
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,880
I'll have him tell him why there
are not reptiles running this world.

1856
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,970
He would,

1857
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,220
it would it be hilarious and fascinating,

1858
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,530
but that's how that's is.

1859
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,220
That is a fucking crazy belief that
there's all kinds of ways to look at it.

1860
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,113
I believe in bigfoot.

1861
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,433
Okay.

1862
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,910
Not a hundred percent
you can break it down.

1863
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:25,770
You can say the reptilian ancestors
of ours are actually this,

1864
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,850
the whole darker side,

1865
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:27,211
the whole,

1866
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,490
we've got our it scientifically
or Reptilian brain.

1867
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,570
That's part of us.

1868
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,190
That's the part of us that if we can
imagine these horrible things that,

1869
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:35,123
that they have done,

1870
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,080
each of us has that inside of us.

1871
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,320
We're actually way worse than reptiles
because roadhouses kill things and eat

1872
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:40,441
them.

1873
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:44,220
They don't torture them and time to
trucks and pull them apart from each other

1874
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,690
and do all sorts of shit that you
could find everyday on the Internet.

1875
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:47,420
Yeah,

1876
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,420
the reptiles onto that,

1877
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,260
so to call us reptilian and a lot of
ways we are way cooler than reptiles.

1878
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,183
First off,

1879
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,670
we're capable of amazing shit the
reptiles can't even fuck with.

1880
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,010
But if you get past that,

1881
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,910
I mean w reptiles are actually less cruel
than us cause reptiles don't kill for

1882
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:03,480
fun.

1883
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,380
They kill the EU,

1884
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,191
you know what I mean?

1885
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:05,640
That's the,

1886
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,070
they're there just to try
to get by in life and their,

1887
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,470
their program to not be
emotional and think about things.

1888
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:13,890
But if your program to be emotional and
think about things and you still don't

1889
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,240
to act that way,

1890
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,630
that's way worse than being a reptile
and then horrible things are going to

1891
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,464
happen to you.

1892
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,730
I still hate reptiles.

1893
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,110
I do not like them.

1894
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,343
They're not my friends.

1895
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,760
I don't trust anything that
you can't train even a little.

1896
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,650
He never fucking train
a crocodile monitor.

1897
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,251
You know?

1898
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:33,600
You just keep feeding it until it's,

1899
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,590
you know,

1900
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,510
to stuff so it doesn't want to bite you.

1901
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,280
And they get used to handling them,

1902
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,270
but they never your buddy,

1903
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:41,760
they don't care if you fell
down right in front of them.

1904
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:46,761
They just start eating you right then
don't give a fuck a monitor lizard.

1905
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,281
I believe some.

1906
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:48,480
Okay.

1907
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,340
Some of the reptilians are humans.

1908
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,031
Oh,

1909
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:51,864
they came back.

1910
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,071
You think?

1911
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:58,071
So tell species sort of a reincarnation
you to the wind in the willows.

1912
00:54:58,531 --> 00:54:59,364
What are you doing about it?

1913
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,150
So cute.

1914
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,400
When you're talking
about making the choice,

1915
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,870
like in another dimension,

1916
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:05,010
like a psychedelic dimension,

1917
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:09,600
making the choice to to resist in this
life and that you create your reality.

1918
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,381
Do you,

1919
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:13,620
do you think that that
people can be other animals?

1920
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,550
Do you think that a life form
is just a life form of humans?

1921
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,420
The only one with a soul?

1922
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,480
What do you think you
want to know to know?

1923
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:20,191
I think that this,

1924
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:25,191
I think that this earth is a place of
biological life and that it is a special

1925
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,580
place that,

1926
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,420
that um,

1927
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,080
all the other dimensional spirits
can come and work through Karma.

1928
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,510
It's one of the only thing places
where you can get through Karma.

1929
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,720
That's why I don't blame anybody for
anything that is quote unquote wrong with

1930
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:39,240
them.

1931
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,010
So you think this is like a waystation?

1932
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:41,410
Yeah,

1933
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,243
I think this is,

1934
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,253
I think this is,

1935
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,010
yeah,

1936
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,210
this is a waystation
station where you learn,

1937
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,680
I think this is a life school.

1938
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,420
This is a school.

1939
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,350
Yeah.

1940
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,183
Wow.

1941
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,683
There you go.

1942
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,823
That's fascinating.

1943
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:53,923
Um,

1944
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,571
it's,

1945
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:59,550
what's really fascinating also is how
different people come to it at different

1946
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:03,030
levels that come to it from different
starting points economically and

1947
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,980
physically and geographically.

1948
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,270
It's all about what,

1949
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,690
what you need to ascend.

1950
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,770
We are all ascending and last.

1951
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:11,750
You're stuck in Africa.

1952
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:12,680
And when those shitty towns,

1953
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:17,420
it doesn't even have water
now or they're so close to,

1954
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,810
or they so close to nature,

1955
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,090
they,

1956
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,510
that's the cradle of civilization.

1957
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:21,780
They,

1958
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,910
they've existed for of years.

1959
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:24,451
Yeah.

1960
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:25,830
But they get eaten by lions.

1961
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,460
It's true.

1962
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,000
That's not,

1963
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,301
that's not,

1964
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,430
I'm not saying it's good or right.

1965
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,240
I'm saying there's always a different
way to look at everything I guess.

1966
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,340
I guess every day that you
don't get eaten by lions,

1967
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:36,174
just you saying,

1968
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:36,651
there you go.

1969
00:56:36,651 --> 00:56:36,960
Yeah.

1970
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,310
And you get that gratitude,

1971
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,890
but then they eat like fly hamburgers.

1972
00:56:40,891 --> 00:56:41,724
You ever seen that?

1973
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,253
Have you seen that?

1974
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,180
See I choose not to.

1975
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,260
It's the craziest thing ever.

1976
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:46,690
The,

1977
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,570
the d like mosquitoes,

1978
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,291
mosquitoes,

1979
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:53,160
they make like a cheeseburger
with mosquitoes and they
take them and they use a

1980
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:57,510
pan and the mosquitoes are so thick
around them that they take these pants,

1981
00:56:57,511 --> 00:57:01,140
like it's a giant like cooking pot and
they throw it through the air and as

1982
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,820
they're like swinging it through the air,

1983
00:57:02,821 --> 00:57:06,210
it's killing these mosquitoes because
they're hitting the back metal and they

1984
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:07,410
keep doing this over and over again.

1985
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,550
It's sticks to the bottom and they scrape
it up and then they fry it and make

1986
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:14,850
like a sad face off and all the
flies fallen to the mosquitoes.

1987
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,750
I know,

1988
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,583
I guess.

1989
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,900
I guess that's better than
getting eaten by a lion,

1990
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,973
but I dunno.

1991
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,570
No,

1992
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,040
it's yet,

1993
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:27,240
none of us can understand what
that person is even going through.

1994
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:31,140
When you look at all the poverty and
all the terrible places on earth and the

1995
00:57:31,141 --> 00:57:33,060
war and all the strife and all the thing,

1996
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,560
and then you look at the good
aspects of life and you know,

1997
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:41,340
and when people were cool
to each other and kind,

1998
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:42,960
and when you look at this,

1999
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,490
this big balance,

2000
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,031
you know,

2001
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:45,361
what do you,

2002
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,051
what do you see?

2003
00:57:46,051 --> 00:57:47,730
Do you see like a work in progress?

2004
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,110
I see like a gym.

2005
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,400
I see a beautiful

2006
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,470
creation that works so perfectly.

2007
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,500
This whole reality is like a super mega
bio computer that is so brilliantly

2008
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,190
engineered that we can't even see it,

2009
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,210
that we don't even know we're in it.

2010
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:09,190
We come here and we forget about it and
when I look at the bad and the good,

2011
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:10,360
I'm,

2012
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,890
I'm grateful for the whole experience.

2013
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,740
I'm grateful for everything this is,

2014
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,790
I'm learning,

2015
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,301
I'm growing,

2016
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,134
I'm creating.

2017
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,790
That's all I can't do.

2018
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,680
I can't feel their pain for them.

2019
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:21,820
I can't take their pain away.

2020
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:22,130
They,

2021
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:26,200
they are here to work through
that and make their choices.

2022
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,560
The,

2023
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:27,940
the,

2024
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,940
the issue also comes down to a sort of
educating more people to the idea that

2025
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:38,760
the reality that you choose
to accept the way your,

2026
00:58:38,761 --> 00:58:41,460
your reality is in front
of you at this very moment.

2027
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:41,601
What,

2028
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,350
what you can write on paper
and take pictures of that.

2029
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,690
That is your life.

2030
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:46,883
It's not,

2031
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,600
this is just where you are right now.

2032
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,160
Yeah.

2033
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,580
This is what you're doing right now.

2034
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:55,810
We are only aware of 4% of the
whole energetic spectrum of,

2035
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:58,690
of energy that that may,

2036
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,091
again,

2037
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:00,080
I'm talking physics,

2038
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,800
only 4% of it can we see there's 96%
of a whole energetic world that we are

2039
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:10,394
unaware of.

2040
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,110
So it's kind of silly that,

2041
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:12,620
I mean,

2042
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,341
and this is again,

2043
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,310
science that we think that
that 4% is everything.

2044
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:17,390
Okay?

2045
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,223
Yeah.

2046
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,310
Well this still has,

2047
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:20,091
how many isn't there?

2048
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:22,040
Like a massive of the university

2049
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,420
they believe is dark matter.

2050
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,150
And they don't even know
exactly what that is.

2051
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,900
Because what's happening is
I think in the next 10 years,

2052
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,340
our own scientist,

2053
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,240
and it's already begun,

2054
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,110
they're starting to say,

2055
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,693
okay,

2056
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,660
we are seeing that our universe
is constantly expanding.

2057
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:39,201
You've heard that,

2058
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:39,381
right?

2059
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:40,161
The constant expanding.

2060
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:44,600
Well that expansion is the creation
is us creating an intending.

2061
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:46,640
That's the nature of our universe.

2062
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:47,151
And as above,

2063
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:47,870
so below.

2064
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,850
So are we constantly expanding.

2065
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:50,750
We are this great,

2066
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:53,120
huge Mandela where this,

2067
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:53,954
uh,

2068
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:54,853
um,

2069
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:55,720
uh,

2070
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,530
I forget what owl there goes my brain.

2071
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:58,900
See I smoke too much saying

2072
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,370
no,

2073
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,001
it's this.

2074
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:02,360
Um,

2075
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,500
it's the thing that Hologram,

2076
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:04,334
that's it.

2077
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:04,640
And,

2078
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,280
and when you understand a Hologram,

2079
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,260
a piece of a hologram
contains the whole thing.

2080
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,500
And that's how we are as human beings.

2081
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:17,150
We are in this hologram and each of
us have a hologram was like a fractal.

2082
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,571
Yes.

2083
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:18,404
Is a fractal.

2084
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:18,921
Really?

2085
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:19,700
I didn't know that.

2086
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,360
Yeah.

2087
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,020
And we are,

2088
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,980
and when you understand
Hologram and what it is,

2089
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:27,170
you'll understand that we live
in a holographic universe.

2090
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,610
So the only way somebody wrote a book,

2091
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,953
Holographic Universe,

2092
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,761
I started reading it,

2093
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,594
but I don't know what happened.

2094
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:33,830
Kids,

2095
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,321
they can be,

2096
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:34,640
it can,

2097
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,420
it's a big,

2098
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,900
you know,

2099
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,760
piece of steak to digest.

2100
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:42,290
The idea though is becoming more and
more mainstream that the reality that we

2101
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:45,380
see in front of us might
not be the entire picture.

2102
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,060
That's let's just start there.

2103
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,051
Let's start start there.

2104
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:48,884
Yeah.

2105
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,101
Yeah.

2106
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,750
But the issue comes when,

2107
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:55,680
when people get all either
incredulous or hippy dippy,

2108
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,810
you know either or.

2109
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,010
You have to stay in the middle of,

2110
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,950
that's what's gonna save us
is that people in the middle.

2111
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,420
That's why I've said button like gays,

2112
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:03,530
I was out in the straights and gays,

2113
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:05,870
but it's the bisexuals that are going
to save us because they're going to go,

2114
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,200
you know what?

2115
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,033
I just want to choice.

2116
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,040
Or they're just greedy or agree.

2117
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:10,780
Yes.

2118
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,680
Did the double your
numbers are my numbers.

2119
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:13,514
I don't know.

2120
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Have you paid any attention to these
recent ideas of a computer simulation

2121
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:25,160
theory that the earth is some or
the universe itself as a simulation?

2122
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,091
Well,

2123
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:27,110
it depends on how you look at it.

2124
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:27,860
I do.

2125
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,910
When you see,

2126
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,290
when you as I have just
just studied the fractal,

2127
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,730
that nature,

2128
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,480
the,

2129
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,190
the nature of the universe,

2130
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,720
the quantum physics,

2131
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,290
it's the perfection is astounding.

2132
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,150
And then you start to think,

2133
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:44,571
well,

2134
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:45,440
we as a,

2135
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:49,160
as a human race are just trying
to replicate what we see.

2136
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:51,500
And so we've made
computers and we are like,

2137
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:52,040
okay,

2138
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,690
this brain can't think that fast,

2139
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:56,690
but I can get this computer to think
that fast and all of a sudden these

2140
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,040
computers are starting
to look like reality.

2141
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:01,581
Wait a minute,

2142
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:02,930
maybe our reality is,

2143
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,430
and then you,

2144
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:05,330
you walk away with,

2145
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:05,601
okay,

2146
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:08,270
it's just intelligent design and I,

2147
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:08,990
you know,

2148
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,750
I'm not going to get outside of the game
right now so I might as well play the

2149
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:12,584
game and I might as well,

2150
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,090
I understand the rules now.

2151
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,711
The what,

2152
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:15,861
what,

2153
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:17,420
whatever the design is.

2154
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:20,070
It seems pretty clear that there's

2155
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,260
no question about it.

2156
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,000
There's some sort of a progression going
on and this is a progression going on

2157
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:28,350
with human consciousness,

2158
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,790
with human innovation.

2159
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,550
But there also is a progression
going on constantly,

2160
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,240
and the universe,

2161
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,470
new galaxies are for me.

2162
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:34,770
Oh,

2163
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,720
he knew new stars are forming.

2164
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,530
It's,

2165
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,251
it's very,

2166
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:38,641
very,

2167
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:42,480
very strange because to think
that somehow or another,

2168
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:43,620
it's all just happening.

2169
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:44,270
Oh,

2170
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,040
why?

2171
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,050
What's going on?

2172
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:47,610
What's causing it to happen?

2173
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:48,240
Is it just,

2174
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,650
it just is okay.

2175
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:53,160
But even it just is
unbelievably fascinating.

2176
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,490
Yes.

2177
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,121
It just,

2178
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:55,080
is it good?

2179
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:56,160
Don't you don't have to call it God,

2180
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:01,190
but it just is the force behind hyper
Novas the force behind black holes and the

2181
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:04,070
idea of fractal universes.

2182
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,760
It's the force behind the
idea that inside every galaxy,

2183
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,330
a supermassive black hole with one half
of 1% of the mass of the galaxy and

2184
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:17,331
inside that galaxy may very well be a
whole nother universe with hundreds of

2185
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:21,120
billions of black holes and hundreds
of billions of galaxies around them.

2186
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,170
Yes.

2187
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:22,891
And each one of them,

2188
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:23,730
another universe,

2189
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,480
and it's,

2190
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,190
and you can go the other
way and go inside your body.

2191
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:26,390
Yeah.

2192
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:31,390
You can look at yourselves and you can
find exactly the same wonderment when

2193
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:33,000
they get to that string theory shit.

2194
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:38,100
And they start talking about everything
being strings that are vibrating and

2195
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,010
it's all in how much hair there is.

2196
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,530
Even in live oak tree,

2197
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:44,670
this is all space.

2198
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:44,851
Yeah.

2199
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:46,620
That space is the 96%.

2200
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:48,030
The 4% is what our,

2201
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,170
our,

2202
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:53,160
our in our brains hold together in front
of us so we can have this experience

2203
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,580
and create the idea that
a rock is all space.

2204
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,270
That's what it is.

2205
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:58,380
Good.

2206
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,460
Put it under a microscope.

2207
01:03:59,480 --> 01:03:59,760
Yeah.

2208
01:03:59,760 --> 01:03:59,941
You'll,

2209
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:00,810
you'll see it immediately.

2210
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:00,961
Yeah.

2211
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:01,661
If you go deep,

2212
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:01,970
deep,

2213
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:02,221
deep,

2214
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:02,521
deep,

2215
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:03,270
deep,

2216
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,710
you see that most of it is just,

2217
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:05,760
what is this?

2218
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:06,810
Just the way it vibrates.

2219
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:07,950
This crazy shit.

2220
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,020
That's just the way it's vibrating.

2221
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,550
I never thought I was never a school.

2222
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:12,480
I was always just music,

2223
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:12,631
you know,

2224
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,081
hanging out,

2225
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:13,890
whatever.

2226
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,710
When I started actually
reading about quantum physics,

2227
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:17,683
Ken,

2228
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,893
Ken Wilber,

2229
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,741
really great.

2230
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:20,130
He's,

2231
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:20,963
he's,

2232
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:21,870
you know,

2233
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,980
based in science.

2234
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,490
Yeah.

2235
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,070
Bill Lipton,

2236
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,390
they're all,

2237
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,160
they're based in science
and they're saying,

2238
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:26,401
look,

2239
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:29,460
this is the wonderment we found
and we think it means more.

2240
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:36,130
There's a gentleman who recently did an
interview with Neil degrasse Tyson who,

2241
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:36,970
um,

2242
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,680
I should give them credit so
people could look this up.

2243
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,190
It's,

2244
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,700
it's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my life.

2245
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,460
Coming from a scientist when his lid,

2246
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,760
he essentially said was that in the
inner workings of quantum physics,

2247
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,000
when they get to these
bad ass crazy equations,

2248
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:57,740
one of the things they found is self
correcting computer code and this self

2249
01:04:57,741 --> 01:05:02,730
correct and computer code was a type of
code that was invented they thought in

2250
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,800
the 1940s.

2251
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,113
And uh,

2252
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,043
it's,

2253
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:06,620
it's,

2254
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:06,921
they,

2255
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:10,950
they found this very code in
the theories bond and the,

2256
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:12,410
the calculations of quantum physics.

2257
01:05:12,411 --> 01:05:13,370
I don't know what the fuck,

2258
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:15,321
well,

2259
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:16,190
it sounds like,

2260
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,053
yeah.

2261
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,053
Clearly

2262
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,050
we are discovering ourselves and
we're discovering the great code,

2263
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:23,400
the gigantic,

2264
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:23,911
you know,

2265
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:26,610
computer that is this
beautiful earth and is us.

2266
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,780
Yeah,

2267
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,650
I guess,

2268
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,250
but it just seems like
even putting a label on it.

2269
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:32,910
Yeah.

2270
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,830
It's one of the things
that I've always felt like,

2271
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,693
um,

2272
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,930
is the gentleman's name is James Gates
and he's the one who discovered this

2273
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:40,764
computer code.

2274
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,850
So it's she just go check it out and
read it online cause it's so crazy.

2275
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:49,940
You wrap your head around this doubly
even self dual linear binary error

2276
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:55,791
correcting block code first invented
in the 1940s has been discovered.

2277
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,320
I mean it literally is like
the Matrix if this guy's right.

2278
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:01,980
Yes.

2279
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,510
It literally is like the Matrix.

2280
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,853
Yes,

2281
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,183
come on.

2282
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:06,720
Yeah.

2283
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,720
Well the idea is that if they were able
to create a simulation that it would be

2284
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:17,020
indiscernible from reality and that
what we might've already done this,

2285
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:22,030
we might have already transgressed from
the biological life into this symbiotic

2286
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:23,070
sort of computer life.

2287
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,000
We just don't,

2288
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,390
we don't,

2289
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,410
we don't recognize it yet.

2290
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:30,390
I think a lot of it is when you realize
that you are creating what's in front of

2291
01:06:30,391 --> 01:06:31,224
you,

2292
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,870
then you can get out of that game.

2293
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,840
That's fucking ridiculous.

2294
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,910
Try it I guess,

2295
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,120
but the problem is does it only work?

2296
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:43,170
It looks like that's what
how I felt about the secret.

2297
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,940
I'm like they're only
interviewing winners.

2298
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:45,840
I don't lose her.

2299
01:06:45,841 --> 01:06:46,890
Sort of tried the secret.

2300
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,560
There was like a young lady
who's a very nice person.

2301
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:50,640
She's a friend of,

2302
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:51,474
um,

2303
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,291
the flux,

2304
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:52,980
her name Bro,

2305
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:53,221
Kelly,

2306
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:54,210
Kirsten friendly,

2307
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:54,751
Kelly Kirsten.

2308
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:58,130
She used to always come down
to the comedy store and a,

2309
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,420
she was a super positive and she,

2310
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,620
I remember she came down,

2311
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:02,940
she's telling us about the secret,

2312
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:03,631
you know,

2313
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,580
she just started doing the secret,

2314
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:09,480
living a lie by the secret
and everything's amazing
now and I can see how I'm

2315
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:12,690
going to totally manufacturer
a completely new life.

2316
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,471
And,

2317
01:07:13,471 --> 01:07:14,010
um,

2318
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,060
then I met them.

2319
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:17,910
I didn't see her again
for about two years.

2320
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:18,601
And then,

2321
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:18,781
uh,

2322
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:21,900
I met them again at another
comedy club and I'm like,

2323
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,051
it,

2324
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:24,000
she was all bummed out and I go,

2325
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:24,271
uh,

2326
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:24,571
I go,

2327
01:07:24,571 --> 01:07:25,220
how you been?

2328
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:25,680
What's going on?

2329
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,480
You still do the end of that secret thing?

2330
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,673
And she goes,

2331
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,400
yeah,

2332
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,380
I really wanted to see if this makes
sense to anyone else because I've been

2333
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:37,740
doing everything they said and
my life is a fucking wreck.

2334
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:38,551
And she's like,

2335
01:07:38,551 --> 01:07:39,930
and I have all these people in my life,

2336
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,690
I can't get rid of them and I can't
get them to straighten their life out.

2337
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,680
And I'm always dragged into this bad
relationship over and over and over again

2338
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:47,520
and job socks,

2339
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,001
work socks.

2340
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:48,241
I'm like,

2341
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:49,050
wow,

2342
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,970
absolutely be in the secret to,

2343
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:51,883
yeah,

2344
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:56,220
you need to like let people know you
can't just think things and all of sudden

2345
01:07:56,221 --> 01:07:57,054
the world.

2346
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,520
That's why I call the
secret to Mcdonald's.

2347
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:00,301
You can,

2348
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:00,590
it's,

2349
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:01,423
it's a process.

2350
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,660
It's,

2351
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,550
it's the idea,

2352
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:03,330
which is great.

2353
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,280
I love that they got the idea in there.

2354
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,310
It takes practice because it is belief.

2355
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:09,960
If you look at your life and you believe,

2356
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:10,411
oh,

2357
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:12,420
I don't have enough and I want this,

2358
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,920
you are coming from lack.

2359
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,860
So you are creating lack.

2360
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,580
It's a,

2361
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,900
it's a crazy,

2362
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,463
uh,

2363
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,010
formula and how you think
it's very hippy dippy.

2364
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,840
People must get upset.

2365
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:27,740
That kind of thinking.

2366
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:28,251
Do you ever have,

2367
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:30,260
I don't come them around me to know.

2368
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,320
Well,

2369
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,320
what they would go after is they would
go after the idea of children with a

2370
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,580
terrible diseases is their choice.

2371
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,110
That's what they would go after.

2372
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,410
After that is where it breaks
down because people don't,

2373
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,910
people want to hold on to the thought
that it is possible for something.

2374
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:51,140
Just to happen to you

2375
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:53,750
with no reason.

2376
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:57,860
So do you believe that this
life leads into another one?

2377
01:08:57,861 --> 01:08:58,261
And you,

2378
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:02,360
you do this life the best you can and
then reap the bounty in the next life.

2379
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,620
My belief now,

2380
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:03,831
now,

2381
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:04,320
cause that's,

2382
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,570
that's my belief is this is a school,

2383
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,200
like I said,

2384
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:14,090
and that we are all ascending and there
are those who've gone before us who have

2385
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:17,210
figured it out and overcame death,

2386
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,680
which is pretty intense.

2387
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,610
That's a lot of work.

2388
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,333
Um,

2389
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:26,570
there are those who understand that death
is a transition and they are done here

2390
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:26,751
with,

2391
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:27,081
okay,

2392
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,840
I've learned every day
I'm ready to move on.

2393
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,500
And there are those who choose death
game over because you know what,

2394
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,670
I can't quite figure it out
and I'm gonna try it again.

2395
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:37,881
Let me,

2396
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:38,714
let me do it again.

2397
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:39,981
Yeah.

2398
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:40,430
The,

2399
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:40,880
um,

2400
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,880
the transitionary phase for a lot of
people was made easier by psychedelics.

2401
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,450
Larry Hagman,

2402
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,230
uh,

2403
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,420
was doing an interview on CNN.

2404
01:09:50,421 --> 01:09:50,651
It was,

2405
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:50,741
so,

2406
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:52,970
it's really fascinating
to see him talk about it.

2407
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:55,970
And he was talking about
how when he did acid,

2408
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,190
it released him from fear of death.

2409
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,431
Yeah,

2410
01:09:58,431 --> 01:09:59,300
poorly released it.

2411
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,270
So like knowing that and
knowing that he died recently,

2412
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,133
it was like,

2413
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:07,550
it was comforting knowing that that
guy had that experience and had this

2414
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:08,361
different perception,

2415
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,900
which really mellowed him out and made
them kinder and gentler and sort of he

2416
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:14,320
saw saw it for what it really is.

2417
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,310
It's supposedly really is.

2418
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:16,581
I mean,

2419
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:17,414
maybe he's just dead.

2420
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,560
I don't know.

2421
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,970
That's what a lot of people
would like you to thank.

2422
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:20,960
His body is dead.

2423
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:21,801
His spear,

2424
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,150
all spirits totally live on.

2425
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:23,331
I mean,

2426
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:25,480
that's just silly to not think that,

2427
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,980
but why would you choose?

2428
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:30,770
Why would you choose to believe that
this is it and when the lights go out,

2429
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:31,131
that's it.

2430
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,330
And it's over forever.

2431
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:32,900
Never.

2432
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,330
Why would you choose to
believe that it's not though?

2433
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,560
Because why would you
choose to believe that?

2434
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:37,860
When I go to sleep train,

2435
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,940
when you take a nap,

2436
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,640
you assume you're going to wake up,

2437
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,890
but you're not afraid to just shut off.

2438
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:43,970
Right?

2439
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,300
Right.

2440
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,380
Why be afraid anyway?

2441
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:45,950
Right.

2442
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,270
Why be afraid to just shut off.

2443
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:48,350
It don't have to live forever.

2444
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,790
You can just shut off too.

2445
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,350
That's what I really know.

2446
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:51,651
When you,

2447
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:53,210
when you overcome the fear of death,

2448
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,560
you really free yourself up.

2449
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:56,021
Well,

2450
01:10:56,021 --> 01:10:57,790
you've got to realize
that it's gonna suck.

2451
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,213
Okay,

2452
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,930
are we going to die screaming
and a you buy is going to fail,

2453
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,190
but then the next things happen.

2454
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:07,400
Well,

2455
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,510
if you're in a plane crash,

2456
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:09,350
did you manifest?

2457
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,940
You manifest that?

2458
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,170
You think so?

2459
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:12,960
Absolutely.

2460
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,010
Whoa.

2461
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,903
I know.

2462
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,750
Again,

2463
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,740
not blame.

2464
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,251
Okay.

2465
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:20,760
Not blame mamasans since one
asshole in the plane that manifests.

2466
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,361
No,

2467
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,194
no.

2468
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,570
What if he's the shoe bomber?

2469
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,490
If there's a shoe bomber on your plane,

2470
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:27,480
did you manifest that?

2471
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,580
Yes.

2472
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,413
Wow.

2473
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,320
Wow.

2474
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,670
You really sure of this.

2475
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,880
You accessed Joe.

2476
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,970
My belief,

2477
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,230
I do believe and then I have
to let go and go and I've,

2478
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,360
I believe that I do not need that lesson.

2479
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,560
I do not need to die.

2480
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,320
It terrifyingly in a plane crash.

2481
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,520
I do not need that.

2482
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,360
Right.

2483
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:48,630
I,

2484
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,250
so I'm not even gonna think about that.

2485
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,510
That is not even a possibility.

2486
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,920
When I born in an airplane,

2487
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,260
I actually think this
is because I fly a lot.

2488
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:58,770
And for the first few years
it was I was a white knuckle.

2489
01:11:59,010 --> 01:11:59,251
You know,

2490
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:00,270
every little thing was like,

2491
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:00,661
oh,

2492
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:01,290
I'm going down,

2493
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:01,501
you know,

2494
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:01,981
rock stars,

2495
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:02,371
airplanes.

2496
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:02,641
It's like,

2497
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:03,240
right.

2498
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,710
So I,

2499
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,580
um,

2500
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,110
when I board an airplane now I think,

2501
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,260
look at all these lucky people because
there is no way this plane's going to do

2502
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:12,980
anything because that's
not what I signed up for.

2503
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,680
That is,

2504
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,660
that's not the end of the lifetime movie.

2505
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:16,440
It's not,

2506
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,280
well that is a,

2507
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,700
a very positive way of looking at life.

2508
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,740
And if you're a correct,

2509
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:24,630
it's going to be amazing.

2510
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,493
Yes.

2511
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,230
I hope you around to match the face.

2512
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,760
Isn't it funny though,

2513
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:31,520
because even if your
life was a masterpiece,

2514
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,110
people like she got lucky.

2515
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,190
And that's belief.

2516
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,110
If you choose to always believe that,

2517
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,470
see,

2518
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,101
look at my life,

2519
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:38,490
it's bad.

2520
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:39,271
It will be bad.

2521
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,770
The real problem with
that is the people who,

2522
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:42,620
what will people believe
all sorts of silly things.

2523
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:44,220
And when I say to that is yes,

2524
01:12:44,221 --> 01:12:49,221
but the real issue is have we shown
that beliefs can change reality?

2525
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:50,401
Yes,

2526
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:51,840
we can through the placebo method.

2527
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,850
That's the real,

2528
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:57,450
that's scientifically measured effect
where they've shown that they can give you

2529
01:12:57,451 --> 01:12:59,580
something that is not physically active.

2530
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:03,600
It's an inert substance and the idea
of taking it for whatever reason,

2531
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:04,950
you believe that this sugar pill,

2532
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:05,880
which is actually poison,

2533
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:06,150
right,

2534
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,720
right.

2535
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,420
Um,

2536
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,560
there's doing something
is changing your life.

2537
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,750
That's why I tell people when
they come to me with cancer,

2538
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:12,961
I said,

2539
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:13,830
what do you believe?

2540
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:16,140
Do you believe that this
chemotherapy is going to help you?

2541
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:16,950
Do you believe that?

2542
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,480
Then go with your belief.

2543
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:19,350
What about r Kelly?

2544
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:20,490
Cause he believes he can fly.

2545
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,540
Well then there's that,

2546
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,310
but then he does a lot of other shit.

2547
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,450
That's really rude.

2548
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,390
So fly.

2549
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,533
Yeah.

2550
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,730
If our Kelly could just
stop peeing on people,

2551
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:35,690
maybe old just saying
doesn't do that anymore.

2552
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,390
You just saying don't judge because out
of that space are you in R Kelly fan?

2553
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,920
You stick up for our musicians,

2554
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:41,360
is it?

2555
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:41,671
No,

2556
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:41,881
no,

2557
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:41,991
no,

2558
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:42,101
no,

2559
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:42,191
no,

2560
01:13:42,191 --> 01:13:42,390
no.

2561
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:45,240
I think people make their
own reality in the world.

2562
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,710
You're aware of our Kelly?

2563
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,150
I am aware of him,

2564
01:13:48,151 --> 01:13:48,510
yeah.

2565
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,520
Have you ever watched
any of his music videos?

2566
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:51,791
Oh,

2567
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:52,030
I know.

2568
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,630
I just watched Chappelle
where they always,

2569
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,570
this is unintentional comedy.

2570
01:13:57,571 --> 01:14:01,440
It's amongst the greatest things
the world has ever known for real.

2571
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:04,620
There's a video called real
talk and you must watch it.

2572
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,830
I will preferably under
medicated conditions.

2573
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,150
Then the ridiculousness of comes blaring

2574
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,800
at you like an awesome parody,

2575
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,210
but it's not a parody.

2576
01:14:15,211 --> 01:14:15,421
It's,

2577
01:14:15,421 --> 01:14:16,111
I don't think,

2578
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:17,590
I mean he might be like parenting alone,

2579
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,080
try and be a little bit funny,

2580
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:20,730
but a lot of it's just,

2581
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,930
he's bananas.

2582
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,060
Like the Budweiser commercial yesterday.

2583
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:24,990
Did you see the Clydesdale?

2584
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:26,040
Did you watch the Super Bowl?

2585
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,501
No.

2586
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:27,270
Slept through the whole,

2587
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,103
Oh Jeez.

2588
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,370
I'm a football fanatic.

2589
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:30,980
It's a really high holy day.

2590
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,883
A lesbian.

2591
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,010
That's hilarious.

2592
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,210
Do a lot of lesbians get into
like guide Type Shit like that?

2593
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,113
Yes.

2594
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,500
My best friends are guys
because I can really,

2595
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,820
women are crazy.

2596
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,053
No,

2597
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,721
it's fun.

2598
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:49,770
It's about the balance and,

2599
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:50,241
and I,

2600
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:50,641
I grew up,

2601
01:14:50,641 --> 01:14:54,270
my father was a huge football fan
and just adored my father and he,

2602
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,010
he passed away when I was 30 but he was,

2603
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,580
he just,

2604
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,980
he was a football coach
and basketball coach.

2605
01:14:58,981 --> 01:14:59,690
So I just,

2606
01:14:59,690 --> 01:14:59,940
you know,

2607
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:00,570
I love that.

2608
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,610
And I grew up in the Midwest and
it was a big part of my life.

2609
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:03,181
Cause your team,

2610
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:03,840
Kansas.

2611
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,170
Oh,

2612
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:06,270
can you image the Kansas City chiefs?

2613
01:15:06,271 --> 01:15:08,550
We are in dead last this year.

2614
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,330
We have first round pick next to you.

2615
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:11,280
Maybe you chose that.

2616
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,193
See,

2617
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,231
everything's a metaphor.

2618
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:14,064
Life is a metaphor.

2619
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:18,260
Watching me now I'm going to choose
the best is the Patriots case.

2620
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,470
You can't drive manufacturing
a great team in Kansas.

2621
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:24,930
It isn't.

2622
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,580
The money can see unfortunately,

2623
01:15:26,581 --> 01:15:27,660
oh that there's gratitude.

2624
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:27,930
There's,

2625
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:28,561
there's will,

2626
01:15:28,561 --> 01:15:29,350
I'm telling you,

2627
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,183
Eh,

2628
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:34,740
this giant black super athletes are seven
feet tall now they run a million miles

2629
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,060
an hour.

2630
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,860
You got to go to find them when they're
10 they watch them the whole way,

2631
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:38,790
give them the right food.

2632
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:43,500
There's this guys to this day that are
recruiting kids and then when they go out

2633
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,640
and get high school kids,

2634
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,030
they,

2635
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,840
they find these white dudes that can
shoot a penny that you throw in the air

2636
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:51,040
with a rock and the other
good football like a,

2637
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:51,811
like a piston.

2638
01:15:51,811 --> 01:15:54,420
They find these kids and
all these find these uh,

2639
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,110
these uh,

2640
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:58,590
running backs that have ungodly speed
and they just keep a good eye on them and

2641
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:01,470
follow them through college
and so much money in football.

2642
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:02,550
They'd be crazy not to.

2643
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,400
The athletes that are being born today,

2644
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,570
look at the quarterbacks,

2645
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:06,751
the new,

2646
01:16:06,751 --> 01:16:08,300
they're changing the game that the,

2647
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:13,440
just the technology and training athletes
and the athletes are realizations now

2648
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,730
of what's possible with various strength
and conditioning programs and diet.

2649
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,740
Stanford just came out with some glove.

2650
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,120
This is really crazy.

2651
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,560
It's a glove,

2652
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:25,350
a cooling glove that's
better than steroids.

2653
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,311
Okay.

2654
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:26,661
It's,

2655
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:27,481
it's legal.

2656
01:16:27,481 --> 01:16:28,530
Completely legal.

2657
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,790
Somehow or another,

2658
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:34,791
they put your body in this
glove and the glove is,

2659
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,890
it freezes somehow or another.

2660
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:38,581
Your body,

2661
01:16:38,581 --> 01:16:43,020
it cools you down and it cools you down
in a way that lets you recuperate at an

2662
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:44,310
incredibly rapid pace.

2663
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,303
Ooh,

2664
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,700
it's complete new thing they figured out.

2665
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,130
So people are going to
be able to take this.

2666
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:52,860
They get a little workout
unbelievably hard.

2667
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:56,880
Where this cooling glove and
through no illegal methods,

2668
01:16:56,881 --> 01:16:58,440
no unnatural drugs,

2669
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,670
just cooling their body.

2670
01:16:59,671 --> 01:17:01,410
They're gonna recuperate like crazy

2671
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,760
when they start working with the body's
amazing properties to create a better

2672
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:07,671
body.

2673
01:17:07,671 --> 01:17:08,750
That's when it's going to work.

2674
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:09,110
Yeah.

2675
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,340
This is like a hijack.

2676
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,570
They found like a fuck up
with the system though.

2677
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,980
It was cool that body temperature down
and that's a thing they'd been doing with

2678
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,350
ice pass as well.

2679
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:19,820
That's something that you know,

2680
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,230
didn't really exist that long ago,

2681
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,540
but now they're after training.

2682
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:26,240
A lot of guys do these crazy ice baths.

2683
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:27,531
Oh my God.

2684
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:28,364
It's hard.

2685
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,910
It's so hard to like relax in there.

2686
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,241
You know?

2687
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,080
That's the hard part.

2688
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,150
Once you climb in your,

2689
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,930
your body constricts,

2690
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,100
it can't get any air.

2691
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,370
You're like,

2692
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,203
Ooh,

2693
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,503
Ooh,

2694
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,310
Ooh,

2695
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,330
it's socks.

2696
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,800
But if you could do it,

2697
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,330
it's awesome for your recovery.

2698
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:44,601
Well,

2699
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:46,250
this is even better apparently.

2700
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,233
It's crazy.

2701
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,330
So like the athletes that you're,

2702
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,330
they're getting now,

2703
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,830
they're going to be even bigger.

2704
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,170
They're going to be even faster and
they're going to be on the Kansas City

2705
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:54,900
chiefs.

2706
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,733
You think so?

2707
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,540
We got the first pick the first,

2708
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,480
even our second round pick is huge.

2709
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:00,530
It's a way up there.

2710
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,140
How does that work with who gets to pick?

2711
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:05,060
The worst team gets the first pink.

2712
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,571
Really?

2713
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:06,321
That's hilarious.

2714
01:18:06,321 --> 01:18:07,730
That sucks for the best guy.

2715
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,530
The worst he gets true.

2716
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,453
But then again,

2717
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,891
let's look,

2718
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:14,570
Andrew Luck and the colts were the worst
team last year that got Andrew Luck.

2719
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:14,930
They,

2720
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:15,150
you know,

2721
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:15,983
made to the playoffs.

2722
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,761
It's not amazing.

2723
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:18,630
That one super athlete dude,

2724
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,780
one was as a quarterback,

2725
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:21,230
one,

2726
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:21,501
you know,

2727
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:26,300
super athlete and one way one Herschel
Walker type dude who just unheard of

2728
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:26,781
athletes.

2729
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:28,520
They just can change
your whole fucking game.

2730
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:28,940
Huh?

2731
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,310
That's because he believes it and
then the other people around it starts

2732
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,240
spreading it and they start.

2733
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So Dude's was slow twitch muscles can
they believe they can win and sprinting

2734
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:41,030
competitions against Usain Bolt?

2735
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:44,390
You ask any professional athlete,

2736
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,051
what is it?

2737
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,640
They'll say the difference between,

2738
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:46,911
you know,

2739
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:47,101
the,

2740
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:49,790
the Ravens and the 40 niners last night.

2741
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,890
The Ravens believed it.

2742
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,870
You can see when the 49
or stopped believing it.

2743
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,250
That's just what,

2744
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,040
it's a thick Newton.

2745
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,490
Maybe that's just what you believe.

2746
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,790
And you've created this whole
Superbowl and we are just,

2747
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:05,300
participants are my funny
Joe Rogan background.

2748
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:07,360
I'm your new toy that
you just picked up today.

2749
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,750
I go talk to him.

2750
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,200
He just created us in our old world.

2751
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,390
Didn't even exist before you came around,

2752
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,520
but in your world that is the case.

2753
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,540
The reality is,

2754
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,440
and your universe,

2755
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:21,560
I didn't exist in a physical form
until you till we meet each other.

2756
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,730
And you didn't either.

2757
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:23,750
I saw you on TV,

2758
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:24,441
I've heard your songs.

2759
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:26,000
But as a physical human being,

2760
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,400
you didn't exist in my world until today.

2761
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,050
So it really did kind of event you.

2762
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,591
Yes.

2763
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:31,520
And you invented me.

2764
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:31,941
Yes.

2765
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:32,960
And I'm glad I did that.

2766
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:37,990
So we're all living in invented universes
and they all parallel coexist with

2767
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:39,230
each other.

2768
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,510
So take charge of your life,

2769
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:41,990
do it.

2770
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,950
Get your shit together.

2771
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:43,784
Coaches,

2772
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,990
Melissa Etheridge just
dropped some pseudo science

2773
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,380
but wonderfully empowering suicides.

2774
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,060
Right?

2775
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,810
That uh,

2776
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:57,260
that attitude is one that's espoused
by some of the happiest people.

2777
01:19:57,261 --> 01:19:58,970
I know that you create your own reality.

2778
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:00,140
I don't know.

2779
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,460
I try to be,

2780
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:04,370
and I get accused of not
being really open minded,

2781
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:07,710
but I really do try to
be as much as possible.

2782
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:08,070
I

2783
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,391
try to,

2784
01:20:08,391 --> 01:20:10,050
especially since doing this podcast,

2785
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:15,051
I try to look at every point of every
aspect of things and really try and not

2786
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:17,190
really make opinions on a lot of shit.

2787
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:17,881
Just go,

2788
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:18,870
I don't know enough.

2789
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:19,010
I know.

2790
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,160
I really can't say and I,

2791
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,340
I don't like getting into those
conversations with people with the claim.

2792
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:26,310
They do know enough to refute thing.

2793
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:28,350
I think people enjoy
refuting things as well.

2794
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:29,463
Yeah.

2795
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,361
Very.

2796
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:30,541
It's,

2797
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,160
it's all,

2798
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,850
if I just look at everyone with belief,

2799
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,310
I you are free to
believe what you believe.

2800
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:36,144
It's wonderful.

2801
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,680
Have you always been an artist?

2802
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:38,260
Have you always been?

2803
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:38,760
Uh,

2804
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,061
yeah.

2805
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:40,290
I can't do anything else

2806
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,621
anywhere else.

2807
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:44,190
Yeah.

2808
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:44,491
When,

2809
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:44,640
uh,

2810
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,270
when did you,

2811
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,230
what did you start with?

2812
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,140
Because you always be
talk eight years old.

2813
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:49,520
My,

2814
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:49,610
well,

2815
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,010
I just the transistor radio,

2816
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:53,910
it was the 70s and sixties and I was,

2817
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:54,091
you know,

2818
01:20:54,091 --> 01:20:58,020
listening to the Beatles and my sister
was a little older and she had a lot of

2819
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:58,230
music.

2820
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:01,340
My father bought her a guitar
and I was eight years old going,

2821
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,680
please,

2822
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,201
I want to play it.

2823
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:02,431
They said,

2824
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:02,581
no,

2825
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:03,151
you're too young.

2826
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:03,811
It'll hurt your fingers.

2827
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:04,021
I'm like,

2828
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:04,291
please,

2829
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:04,591
please.

2830
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:05,401
And then the teacher's like,

2831
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:05,551
well,

2832
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:06,001
let her come.

2833
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:06,201
She,

2834
01:21:06,201 --> 01:21:07,830
she won't come back because it's too hard.

2835
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,720
Then of course I played in,

2836
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,340
my fingers bled and I was like,

2837
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,091
I want to do it.

2838
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:13,020
And I kept doing it.

2839
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,393
Wow.

2840
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,040
See,

2841
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,680
I never had a desire to do it,

2842
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:18,530
but I was always fascinated by,

2843
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:21,480
it just was never pulled
me towards like a career.

2844
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:22,314
But I was,

2845
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:27,210
when I was a little kid I was probably
like seven and my sister was six and we

2846
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:32,211
had a little record player play like
45 hours and we had only a couple of

2847
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:35,940
records and one of them was
the things we do for love.

2848
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,950
You know that song?

2849
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:37,430
I remember that.

2850
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,600
Yeah.

2851
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,830
The things we do for love,

2852
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,940
the rain and the snow and I was amazed
because it was really the only time I'd

2853
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:49,860
ever have access I'd ever have access
to music that I could start and stop.

2854
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,060
I could just decide,

2855
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:51,450
ready,

2856
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,580
go and then it starts and I was like,

2857
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:56,910
now I can really pay attention to it as
opposed to like walking into a store and

2858
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:59,850
music is playing or going into a
restaurant and music is playing.

2859
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:02,820
This was my first experience where I
actually could turn on the music and turn

2860
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:03,990
off the music and realize,

2861
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:04,171
oh,

2862
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,040
this is crazy.

2863
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,610
This is coming out of this fucking desk.

2864
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,040
What is going on here?

2865
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:12,240
Someone's figured out it made him make
this flat black plastic disk and then I

2866
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:13,150
put this needle,

2867
01:22:13,151 --> 01:22:13,920
he thing on it,

2868
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,920
it spins around and it
plays me crazy song tones.

2869
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,210
The vibration you can start,

2870
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:19,500
you can do the science right there.

2871
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:24,501
That's vibration on the vinyl and the
diamond in the diamonds are like rocks and

2872
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,321
courts.

2873
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:29,160
That's why all the courts crazy stuff
that picks up a vibration and you hear it,

2874
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:30,630
which is just vibrations on your ear.

2875
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,810
I think it's one of the reasons
why I became a standup comedian.

2876
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,290
Yeah.

2877
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,520
Because listening to that,

2878
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:37,620
I started asking questions and I remember,

2879
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:42,330
I really remember this from being seven
years old that no one had any answers to

2880
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:46,770
why they or how they could
put that music on a record.

2881
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,030
No one around me.

2882
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,350
I was seven years old.

2883
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,011
I asked my mom,

2884
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,320
she didn't have any fucking idea.

2885
01:22:51,321 --> 01:22:52,020
That's my dad.

2886
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,801
No idea.

2887
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,390
No one had any idea yet.

2888
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,130
There were records all over the place.

2889
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:56,941
I was like,

2890
01:22:56,941 --> 01:22:57,211
damn,

2891
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:57,871
this is weird.

2892
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:00,030
Like why would you guys
ask how they make this?

2893
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:00,411
Like,

2894
01:23:00,411 --> 01:23:02,970
guess this freaky to you that
there's some thing around you.

2895
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:04,020
Are you curious?

2896
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,000
And I was amazed how many people

2897
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,950
just actually,

2898
01:23:06,951 --> 01:23:08,010
you weren't curious.

2899
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,031
And uh,

2900
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:14,031
that sort of started me along that path
of looking at all these adults with a

2901
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:15,031
slanted.

2902
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:15,864
I look like

2903
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,111
I don't touch it.

2904
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:19,560
You don't know everything might be crazy.

2905
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:20,050
Yeah.

2906
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,600
You don't even know how records are made.

2907
01:23:21,601 --> 01:23:22,680
His living your whole life.

2908
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:23,581
Meanwhile,

2909
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,480
I'm 45 I don't know how
records are breaking up.

2910
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:26,323
Go Fuck,

2911
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,290
but back then,

2912
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:28,710
yes,

2913
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:31,080
when I was a kid I thought
these people were ridiculous,

2914
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:32,760
but if my kid asked me,

2915
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:33,930
I would at least research it.

2916
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:34,231
I'll go,

2917
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:34,291
well,

2918
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:35,040
let's find out.

2919
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,281
You know,

2920
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:35,661
I want to know,

2921
01:23:35,661 --> 01:23:40,140
you can go on youtube and you can see
how easily you could know instantaneous

2922
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:40,741
information.

2923
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:41,500
It's,

2924
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,240
that's,

2925
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,380
that is changing our world,

2926
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:44,363
isn't it?

2927
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:44,940
Um,

2928
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,661
do you embrace it?

2929
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:46,120
Are you,

2930
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,921
you're on Twitter,

2931
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:47,161
right?

2932
01:23:47,161 --> 01:23:47,311
You,

2933
01:23:47,311 --> 01:23:49,160
I see you actually respond
to people on Twitter.

2934
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:49,860
You actually,

2935
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,970
someone does.

2936
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:51,331
Yes.

2937
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:51,990
Do it.

2938
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:52,600
It's not me.

2939
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:52,950
No,

2940
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:53,130
no.

2941
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:53,963
It's a fake.

2942
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:56,730
You don't do any blogs
or anything like that,

2943
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,583
right?

2944
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:58,560
You can't win.

2945
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,640
You just can't win.

2946
01:23:59,700 --> 01:23:59,851
Oh,

2947
01:23:59,851 --> 01:24:00,211
you can't,

2948
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:00,990
we missed it.

2949
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,030
I missed the whole time and
I don't have time to do that.

2950
01:24:03,031 --> 01:24:04,140
I have very,

2951
01:24:04,141 --> 01:24:05,100
I have four children.

2952
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,093
Right.

2953
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:06,631
And I,

2954
01:24:06,631 --> 01:24:08,340
I choose not to spend the time,

2955
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:08,511
do I?

2956
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:09,180
I will.

2957
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:09,871
I have a fan club.

2958
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:12,990
I have a whole group of people
that that work for me that do that,

2959
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,690
so I stay in that arena,

2960
01:24:15,691 --> 01:24:17,100
but I know I can't.

2961
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,550
But do people think that it's you
because you have a verified account?

2962
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:21,720
I always tell them there's not me.

2963
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:22,600
Oh,

2964
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,850
it's definitely my people.

2965
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,880
I can make,

2966
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:25,230
yeah,

2967
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,210
I can make a statement.

2968
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,660
I will go to my Twitter and I will go to
my website and I would go this and you

2969
01:24:30,661 --> 01:24:31,530
can count on that.

2970
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:33,120
If it says Melissa Eppich says this,

2971
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:34,380
that you can count that.

2972
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:35,214
That's what it is.

2973
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,051
That I did say it.

2974
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:36,200
Yeah.

2975
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,600
See,

2976
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,070
the only problem that I would
say is that on your Twitter,

2977
01:24:40,071 --> 01:24:41,030
when you go there,

2978
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,930
it looks like your responding
to things to spine,

2979
01:24:44,931 --> 01:24:49,010
to people because someone is doing it
through your verified Twitter and they're

2980
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:49,611
not saying,

2981
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:49,821
hey,

2982
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:50,960
this isn't Melissa.

2983
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,920
Ah,

2984
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,220
yeah.

2985
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,210
Like a lot of responding.

2986
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:55,880
Britney spears and stuff
like that did the same thing,

2987
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:57,800
but when every time they actually do it,

2988
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,760
they didn't know who gives you.

2989
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,860
They do like dash B a s you know,

2990
01:25:00,861 --> 01:25:01,790
like meaning like it's her.

2991
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:02,210
Yeah.

2992
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:02,901
There's a little hill,

2993
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:03,141
right?

2994
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:03,931
Like teams,

2995
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:05,810
someone or another doing this.

2996
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,990
Oh,

2997
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:07,790
I think I'll have to
go to my team and say,

2998
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:08,360
Hey,

2999
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,081
which I've found on,

3000
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:09,650
let's do that.

3001
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,540
Really unsuccessful comedians page.

3002
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:12,710
And I was very offended by it.

3003
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:13,341
I was like,

3004
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,230
what'd you got a team for?

3005
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:14,720
Bitch?

3006
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,553
You ain't got no team.

3007
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:20,300
You can't respond on your Twitter is the
actual people for a comedian Twitter,

3008
01:25:20,301 --> 01:25:21,530
it's like super important.

3009
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,011
Oh yeah.

3010
01:25:22,011 --> 01:25:24,110
We'll let you can keep
your mean keep sharp.

3011
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:24,770
Yeah.

3012
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,310
It's fun.

3013
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,560
It's fun to write like little
things on hundred 40 characters,

3014
01:25:27,561 --> 01:25:31,490
but it's also important to be able to
keep in contact with people like that.

3015
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,630
You don't do anything like that?

3016
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:33,500
No.

3017
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,333
It's too much.

3018
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:37,220
I just don't just don't want
to spend the time to do it.

3019
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:37,950
I just don't.

3020
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:38,783
It just not,

3021
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,110
it's not in my wheel,

3022
01:25:40,111 --> 01:25:40,371
but yeah.

3023
01:25:40,371 --> 01:25:41,720
I don't want people to
know that much about me.

3024
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:42,890
They know way too much anyway.

3025
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:47,230
Isn't it weird that they just want
to find so much about Dan [inaudible]

3026
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:48,081
interesting.

3027
01:25:48,081 --> 01:25:48,321
I am.

3028
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:50,690
So it's not even that.

3029
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,110
It's not,

3030
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,270
it's just they fixate and just decide.

3031
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:54,650
I don't want to look at themselves.

3032
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:55,543
Yeah.

3033
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:57,410
W what was your part of it?

3034
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,480
What was your a Woodstock
performance like?

3035
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,240
That was one of my favorite shows,

3036
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,173
four 90.

3037
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:03,950
Uh,

3038
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:04,520
and I just,

3039
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,130
that was one of my favorites
of Woodstock was a,

3040
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,520
what was that like
being in that situation?

3041
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,960
It was crazy one,

3042
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:16,940
cause it was the 25th anniversary and
they hadn't got back together to do this.

3043
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:17,480
And,

3044
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,760
and I remember being all they,

3045
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,103
we took a,

3046
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,890
uh,

3047
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,110
a car to a bus that drove to,

3048
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,800
uh,

3049
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,633
uh,

3050
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,730
the secret Ho how,

3051
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,620
somewhere that then put us on
a boat that took us up a river,

3052
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:34,730
that to a van that took
us to the backstage.

3053
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,564
It was crazy.

3054
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:36,250
And,

3055
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,420
and I remember Joe Cocker opening the,

3056
01:26:38,421 --> 01:26:39,050
the day that,

3057
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:41,210
that I've played and I
was on stage and you know,

3058
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,740
get by with little help from my friends.

3059
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:42,981
I was like,

3060
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,131
oh,

3061
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:43,964
this is awesome.

3062
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:44,871
And it was really,

3063
01:26:44,871 --> 01:26:45,810
really wonderful.

3064
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,800
They put me in between Henry
Rollins and nine inch nails.

3065
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,233
That's crazy.

3066
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,520
And it rained during Henry Rollins.

3067
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,320
So my,

3068
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,191
my show,

3069
01:26:55,191 --> 01:26:56,210
the sun came out as beautiful.

3070
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,530
You manifested that?

3071
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,470
I'm at the first rounds fucked up.

3072
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:05,471
You got all negative [inaudible] I
know you're not going to blame them.

3073
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,190
That's why I'm here to blame.

3074
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:10,200
And I liked him.

3075
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:10,830
I liked him.

3076
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:11,663
Oh yeah.

3077
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,120
I like a lot of boy that guy is so I
got to play and the audience was great.

3078
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:18,620
There was a bit of marsh and going on
in front of me that kind of scared me if

3079
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,070
people like,

3080
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,650
oh look at that.

3081
01:27:20,651 --> 01:27:22,360
Yeah it was great.

3082
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:25,110
My last song I've played like the way do,

3083
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,440
yeah there's the mud people.

3084
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,280
They started because it had just
rained and I could see this patch of,

3085
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,571
of gray,

3086
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:32,850
Brown way far.

3087
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,110
I mean I couldn't see the end of the,

3088
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,303
the audience.

3089
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,270
And so I'm looking at all of a sudden
that patch kind of turns into a snake and

3090
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:42,700
they all start coming toward the stage
and everyone's like moving out of the

3091
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:42,791
way.

3092
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:45,010
Cause it's all these completely
muddy people from head to toe.

3093
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:45,900
It was Brian show that.

3094
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:46,743
So that again,

3095
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,000
that's a real first world problem.

3096
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,421
A bunch of,

3097
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:49,720
yeah.

3098
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:54,720
People muddy or mud because white people
are so silly and their decisions to get

3099
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:56,010
muddy.

3100
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,060
Yes.

3101
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,400
That was black people
like fucking concerts.

3102
01:27:59,401 --> 01:28:00,430
Cancel pitch.

3103
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:02,131
Oh,

3104
01:28:02,131 --> 01:28:02,970
I'm outta here.

3105
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:06,900
I could've called Marsha
if it was all black girls.

3106
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,650
How many black girls you
think it would be there?

3107
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:09,590
The hair,

3108
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:10,423
hair,

3109
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,590
fucking high heels and stepping
in the mud pinch and shows over.

3110
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:16,560
It takes dopey white people to
be slamming into each other.

3111
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,873
That's us.

3112
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,273
Yeah.

3113
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,580
White people will get muddy.

3114
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:23,490
They get crazy and that
the whole matching thing,

3115
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,110
the mosh pit thing is so bananas.

3116
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,480
Like when did that start?

3117
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,330
How did to just enjoying
the music or dancing.

3118
01:28:30,331 --> 01:28:31,590
Why slamming into each other?

3119
01:28:31,591 --> 01:28:32,490
You crazy asshole.

3120
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:36,000
One guy jumped up on my stage and go to
dive off and everyone just moved and he

3121
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:38,060
just went slam oh flow.

3122
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,400
I'm like,

3123
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,300
oh dude.

3124
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,020
Yeah,

3125
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,160
that must have been bad.

3126
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,820
Get knocked unconscious.

3127
01:28:42,821 --> 01:28:44,340
She kind of just walked off really?

3128
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:46,110
Cause you got thrown out.

3129
01:28:46,111 --> 01:28:46,870
If you do that,

3130
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:47,930
oh he must have been fucked.

3131
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,910
Signing off a stage
and everybody scatters.

3132
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,100
Why don't you think that
they would catch you,

3133
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,380
that you need hurt
catching somebody you know?

3134
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:56,911
Oh,

3135
01:28:56,911 --> 01:29:01,911
why would you just risk that alcohol
that Si si gets you all Brian.

3136
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:04,360
It was also his choice.

3137
01:29:04,361 --> 01:29:07,580
It was choice and see a Dick Wad
the universe trying to end them.

3138
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,550
University setting up bad signals.

3139
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:10,680
Jump,

3140
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,440
dummy.

3141
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,280
We're tired of your bullshit.

3142
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:12,910
No,

3143
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,420
never.

3144
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,200
Never.

3145
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,930
No judgment whatsoever from you.

3146
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,170
What do you,

3147
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:20,590
how do you feel though when you see
like a horrible tragedy like Connecticut

3148
01:29:20,591 --> 01:29:21,420
shootings?

3149
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:21,850
Yes.

3150
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,170
That is definitely the hardest,

3151
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,470
and I'm not telling you it's,

3152
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,360
it's easy that I just go,

3153
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:25,781
oh,

3154
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:26,050
you know,

3155
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,580
that's near the balance.

3156
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:33,030
I understand that through this horrific
act that the outpouring of goodwill,

3157
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,500
the outpouring of weight,

3158
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,490
but we have to do something.

3159
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:39,951
Not only,

3160
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:40,784
you know,

3161
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,490
I mean I'm not going to
get the gun control thing.

3162
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,340
I think it's beyond that to the people,

3163
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:45,971
the person,

3164
01:29:45,971 --> 01:29:50,020
a person that can be in so much pain
that they can walk in and do that.

3165
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:50,320
That's,

3166
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,120
that's a lot of pain.

3167
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:57,600
Let's look at what leads are human beings
of our society to that sort of pain

3168
01:29:58,661 --> 01:29:59,950
without anyone noticing.

3169
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,061
Right.

3170
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:02,110
But wouldn't you have to say that he,

3171
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,980
he asked for that wouldn't,

3172
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,410
I mean with your field philosophy,

3173
01:30:05,411 --> 01:30:06,460
he created this idea.

3174
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:07,070
Yes.

3175
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:12,070
I imagine his pain was so great that the
only way to unload it was to spray that

3176
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:18,940
much pain around [inaudible] and the pain,

3177
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:21,160
it becomes all encompassing.

3178
01:30:21,161 --> 01:30:21,521
And of course,

3179
01:30:21,521 --> 01:30:21,701
you know,

3180
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:23,950
you just fall into it and of course
you just going to end your own life.

3181
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:24,940
It's like game over.

3182
01:30:24,941 --> 01:30:28,810
It's like tilt or how do you factor in
like psychosis and things along those

3183
01:30:28,811 --> 01:30:30,400
lines of real mental issues,

3184
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,800
real mental issues.

3185
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,470
It depends on how you look at what,

3186
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:40,690
just because something is not
the way you and I perceive.

3187
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:41,524
Okay,

3188
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:44,560
this is sane and that's crazy.

3189
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,453
Right?

3190
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,690
Real mental issues.

3191
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:51,900
Where's the line drawn me the line
where your thoughts become psychosis.

3192
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:53,050
Right.

3193
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:53,531
And where is it?

3194
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,730
The resume spectrum?

3195
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:56,133
Is it broad?

3196
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:56,890
Yeah.

3197
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:57,910
It's just the,

3198
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:58,600
it's just,

3199
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,300
it's been vibrating that much more.

3200
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:04,720
And so you are so far out of
it that we call it psychosis,

3201
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:07,600
but there are some people that do not
have an emotional connection to other

3202
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:08,060
people.

3203
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,330
They don't feel remorse indeed.

3204
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:10,990
That,

3205
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,370
that you look at that and go,

3206
01:31:12,371 --> 01:31:13,204
what,

3207
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:13,990
what,

3208
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:15,580
what is their intention here?

3209
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:16,450
What is there?

3210
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:17,940
What do they need to draw?

3211
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:18,790
I mean,

3212
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:23,790
who knows what they are intending
and creating given that it's like,

3213
01:31:26,801 --> 01:31:27,161
okay,

3214
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:28,640
you're gonna go back into this,

3215
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,100
the biosphere called Earth,

3216
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:33,040
you're going to go in there
and we're going to this,

3217
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:34,090
this is your handicap.

3218
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:39,420
You can't feel a thing because
it now now work through that.

3219
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:41,800
How do you work through that?

3220
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,570
How do you have any feelings?

3221
01:31:43,571 --> 01:31:47,860
I mean the idea of not having any feelings
and lashing out is a big difference

3222
01:31:47,861 --> 01:31:52,330
between the idea of just not having any
feelings without the need for inflicting

3223
01:31:52,331 --> 01:31:53,440
pain on other people.

3224
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:53,861
That's,

3225
01:31:53,861 --> 01:31:55,210
it seems to be a dual issue.

3226
01:31:55,211 --> 01:31:58,120
It seems to be an issue of
not being able to feel it

3227
01:31:58,740 --> 01:31:59,200
for,

3228
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,033
of them,

3229
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,400
you know,

3230
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,960
and also the anger.

3231
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:02,911
And the,

3232
01:32:02,911 --> 01:32:03,370
the meat,

3233
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:06,070
the want and the desire to hurt

3234
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,930
the belief that if they
don't hurt something,

3235
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,490
they're going to hurt more.

3236
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:16,180
It seems like with this way
of thinking that if you,

3237
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:17,043
uh,

3238
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:18,243
if you,

3239
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:23,250
if you got more people to sort of a look
at it that way and more people to do,

3240
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:26,150
do you think that that would
be like an empowering thing?

3241
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:26,800
Yeah,

3242
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,610
it's,

3243
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,450
it's the,

3244
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,280
it's the point in which
you see that piece is okay,

3245
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,210
I need to,

3246
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:34,991
okay,

3247
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:36,880
you might've thrown the last rock,

3248
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:38,320
you might have shot the last bullet,

3249
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,510
but I need to be willing to go,

3250
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,140
oh,

3251
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:41,770
okay.

3252
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,780
I'm not going to shoot back.

3253
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:46,660
I'm going to start a different reaction.

3254
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:52,620
So if you get enough
people who believe that

3255
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:59,320
and believe that if I take care of myself
that nothing bad is gonna happen to me

3256
01:33:01,691 --> 01:33:02,524
that I don't,

3257
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:06,090
that I can't handle because I'm
not saying the world is all good a,

3258
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,070
it's about understanding your balance and
what you asked for and walking through

3259
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:09,904
it.

3260
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:15,060
If I can hold that and not blame anybody
else and nobody else is going to blame

3261
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:16,000
me,

3262
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,470
then we start walking.

3263
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:19,630
We start moving to a future.

3264
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:21,850
That is all of a sudden
you don't need prisons.

3265
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,590
All of a sudden you don't need,

3266
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:24,933
uh,

3267
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:29,620
all of a sudden the way we govern
ourselves completely changes.

3268
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,550
You got to catch people in a very,

3269
01:33:31,551 --> 01:33:31,881
very,

3270
01:33:31,881 --> 01:33:35,570
very early age and sort of
manifest this type of behavior.

3271
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,730
You have to get them when they're young,

3272
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:42,731
expose them to nothing but love and
curiosity and curiosity with joy.

3273
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,450
Why did they think you're crazy?

3274
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,771
Call that Voodoo dog.

3275
01:33:45,771 --> 01:33:46,700
Cause it is different.

3276
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,181
That's what I said.

3277
01:33:47,181 --> 01:33:47,271
Like,

3278
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:49,970
oh mom stopped at Voodoo stuff but they
will believe it when it called Buddha.

3279
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:50,151
Yeah,

3280
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:51,110
they do that.

3281
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:51,710
Moody's Dough.

3282
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,850
How long have you been talking to Buddha?

3283
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,331
Oh,

3284
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:54,220
it's been about eight years now.

3285
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:54,711
Eight years.

3286
01:33:54,711 --> 01:33:55,544
Yeah.

3287
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,680
But I can constantly go,

3288
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:58,401
okay,

3289
01:33:58,401 --> 01:33:59,750
you saw that choice you made.

3290
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,760
This is the result of that choice.

3291
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:02,900
This is not anybody else.

3292
01:34:02,901 --> 01:34:04,520
It's not anybody's doing anything to you.

3293
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,330
So there is no randomness.

3294
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:08,520
You think so people that
are in like the tower,

3295
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:09,390
when the plane hits,

3296
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:09,671
they,

3297
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:12,810
they made a choice somehow in
the world to be in that spot.

3298
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:15,680
If you can look at it without blame,

3299
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,340
right?

3300
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:19,610
If you can look at the day that
that was what they signed up for,

3301
01:34:19,611 --> 01:34:21,320
they wanted to be in it for that long.

3302
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:21,531
I'm,

3303
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:22,340
you know,

3304
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:25,200
I can't tell this to someone
who lost their loved one.

3305
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,260
They're going to,

3306
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,340
that's not going to sound yet.

3307
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:32,480
My belief is founded on that.

3308
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:35,840
I can't blame anybody else for anything,

3309
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:41,520
but it's also founded on the idea that
you're creating this sort of reality that

3310
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:44,700
you exist in and that everybody's
creating their own reality.

3311
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:45,130
So

3312
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:45,731
if I work,

3313
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:48,160
if I make my little Hologram,

3314
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:50,050
my little fractal of the Hologram,

3315
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,970
if I work in making that the best I can,

3316
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:55,480
it's fill it with as much love
and as little fear as possible.

3317
01:34:56,470 --> 01:35:00,170
Then I helped whole picture because
the whole picture has me in it.

3318
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,040
I look at it as a,

3319
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:02,520
uh,

3320
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,020
I don't,

3321
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,590
I don't have an opinion
one way or another,

3322
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:09,330
but I do look at it often that it's
a combination of that and scientific

3323
01:35:09,331 --> 01:35:10,164
reality.

3324
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:13,170
Like I think that if
the super volcano goes,

3325
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,360
we're all fucked no
matter what you believe.

3326
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,350
I do believe that.

3327
01:35:16,351 --> 01:35:21,351
But I do believe that there's also a
real possibility that your thoughts are

3328
01:35:22,261 --> 01:35:26,700
creating a good portion of your reality
and your thoughts interacting with other

3329
01:35:26,701 --> 01:35:29,220
people are actually responsible
for culture in the first place.

3330
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,170
And that's how decisions get made.

3331
01:35:31,171 --> 01:35:33,390
Conversations have taken place,

3332
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,560
letters get written,

3333
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,640
books get written.

3334
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:36,690
That's how it all happens.

3335
01:35:36,691 --> 01:35:39,000
It happens through your mind,

3336
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,690
interacting with other
people and literally changing
things in a very physical

3337
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:43,950
form that everybody agrees on.

3338
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:46,710
But I think that even besides that,

3339
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,570
I think there's other issues going on.

3340
01:35:48,571 --> 01:35:52,380
I think it's a lot more ethereal
than we give them credit for.

3341
01:35:52,381 --> 01:35:53,640
It's very strange.

3342
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:56,380
I'm just trying to walk every day,

3343
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:57,303
just walk.

3344
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,980
Asteroids will fuck your world up.

3345
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,870
And that shit is real,

3346
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,300
real.

3347
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,133
His ice cream,

3348
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:07,990
they come down and that's a wrap sign
and there's nothing he could do about it.

3349
01:36:07,991 --> 01:36:09,100
And there's a lot of them out there.

3350
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,070
I think that too.

3351
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,740
I think you create your reality,

3352
01:36:11,741 --> 01:36:14,680
but I also think that there's some
random shit that I didn't sign up for.

3353
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,060
If it was up to me,

3354
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:17,710
there would be no asteroids.

3355
01:36:17,711 --> 01:36:18,041
Okay.

3356
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:18,930
I would work that out.

3357
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,080
I'd figure it out.

3358
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:21,110
I'd be like that.

3359
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:24,460
It's gotta be one fucked up way to go
with is a big light in the sky for three

3360
01:36:24,461 --> 01:36:26,230
days until finally,

3361
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,093
boom.

3362
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:28,600
Yeah.

3363
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,620
I'm not really into that.

3364
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:32,890
That was not my idea.

3365
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:33,953
I'm pretty sure,

3366
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:34,960
but I could be wrong.

3367
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:36,550
Maybe I was a real mess.

3368
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,633
Thinking about it though.

3369
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,410
Yes.

3370
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:39,130
Well,

3371
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:39,701
I guess,

3372
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:44,230
I mean if your correct than I do live
in this world that's really nutty and

3373
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:45,700
asteroids are there to keep you honest

3374
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,391
or you could say,

3375
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:49,100
I'm really grateful that I did that.

3376
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,670
They were no asteroids that it
was a perfectly uneventful day.

3377
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,520
What other kind of crazy out there
ideas do you have in your head?

3378
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:57,140
Do you believe in alien contact?

3379
01:36:57,141 --> 01:36:58,190
Do you believe in anything like that?

3380
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,233
Um,

3381
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,230
I don't,

3382
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,410
I don't think that there's
like a whole race of people.

3383
01:37:03,411 --> 01:37:03,770
They're like,

3384
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,311
Ooh,

3385
01:37:04,311 --> 01:37:04,510
you know,

3386
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:05,331
I'm from another planet,

3387
01:37:05,331 --> 01:37:05,451
blah,

3388
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:05,541
blah,

3389
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:05,690
blah.

3390
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:09,980
I do believe in multidimensional reality
and I believe that there are other

3391
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:15,100
spiritual beings that live on that exist.

3392
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:19,250
I wouldn't say limb that exist
on different planes and that,

3393
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:23,390
that is where my spirit goes to when this,

3394
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:23,990
uh,

3395
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,400
biological body dies.

3396
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,680
I've tried pretend they're
watching me all the time.

3397
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,511
They lose me.

3398
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:29,344
I'm steady.

3399
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,380
It keeps me on the straight now.

3400
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,320
Yeah.

3401
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:33,681
But no,

3402
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,210
I'm not.

3403
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:34,790
Uh,

3404
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:35,070
you know,

3405
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:35,720
you can,

3406
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:36,553
you can.

3407
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:38,840
I think everything's metaphor.

3408
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:43,841
So I lost a lot of interest in aliens
once I had a psychedelic experience.

3409
01:37:43,931 --> 01:37:44,764
Yes.

3410
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,010
The first DMT trip,

3411
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:49,010
I had a really checked out the
whole alien culture and was like,

3412
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:50,520
you guys are missing the hole.

3413
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,670
That's also what I,

3414
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,361
it's like,

3415
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:54,620
it's not out there.

3416
01:37:54,621 --> 01:37:55,454
It's in

3417
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:01,190
and tried to explain that to someone that
if you have a Ufo landed on the White

3418
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,513
House law,

3419
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,220
just the White House lawn got out,

3420
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,990
aliens got out and met the president,

3421
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:08,610
gave him some new supercomputer.

3422
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,350
It would be way less crazy than TMT.

3423
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,490
Like NT is infinitely crazy than that.

3424
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:15,460
And it's you.

3425
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,140
It pushes you to see
what are you believing?

3426
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:20,400
Yeah.

3427
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,810
What's beyond this thing that you
are so dead certain is reality.

3428
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:25,973
Yeah.

3429
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,860
The deer head just fell over.

3430
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:29,951
That's his reality.

3431
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:30,990
Right?

3432
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,370
That's powerful stuff.

3433
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,230
Yeah,

3434
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:34,920
no kidding.

3435
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:35,611
He got so excited.

3436
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:36,600
You a pounded on wood.

3437
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,523
You're going nutty.

3438
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,583
There we go.

3439
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:41,311
Dude.

3440
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:42,900
Your bladder must be huge.

3441
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,630
I'm in sitting here talking to you and go,

3442
01:38:45,631 --> 01:38:45,961
go,

3443
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:46,181
go.

3444
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:47,014
There's the restaurant.

3445
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,653
Don't worry about it.

3446
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:50,003
I can take it.

3447
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,760
My cohost and the UFC has a real problem.

3448
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:54,690
That's not the bathroom.

3449
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,150
The next to that door to the right.

3450
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:58,943
Uh,

3451
01:38:59,460 --> 01:38:59,610
well,

3452
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,030
this athlete,

3453
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:01,430
just because fuck yeah,

3454
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,870
I didn't think she was
going to be so crazy hippie.

3455
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:05,070
She's super crazy happy,

3456
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:05,430
right?

3457
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:06,263
Yeah.

3458
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,310
Neil degrasse Tyson
would be having fucking,

3459
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,420
he would be flipping out,

3460
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:09,751
you know,

3461
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:10,680
it'd be really flipping out.

3462
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:11,041
Cara,

3463
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:11,311
Cara,

3464
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:12,144
Santa Maria.

3465
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:13,740
That pitch would be going crazy right now.

3466
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,110
That's like nine scientific crazy talk.

3467
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:25,310
Vegas was a lot of fun this weekend for
everything better except for the pink on

3468
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,250
my pillow part.

3469
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:26,581
Yeah.

3470
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:28,290
Brian got so drunk.

3471
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:31,420
I left him at a certain
point in the night.

3472
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:31,560
Oh,

3473
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,190
after the show I went and played pool
because this guy Stevie more was in town,

3474
01:39:35,191 --> 01:39:38,520
who's like this world theme
is professional pool player
and he wanted to play

3475
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:38,931
with me for,

3476
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:39,764
for me that's like,

3477
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:40,471
you know,

3478
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:43,740
it's like a golfer who gets a chance
to go play with Jack Nicklaus.

3479
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:44,700
How bad did he kick your ass?

3480
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:45,190
Oh,

3481
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,140
he tortured me.

3482
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,130
Did you win any games?

3483
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:47,251
Yeah,

3484
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:48,084
I won a couple games.

3485
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:48,750
Yeah.

3486
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,980
I mean he messes every now and again,

3487
01:39:49,981 --> 01:39:50,910
but he's amazing.

3488
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,430
So I did that and uh,

3489
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:57,300
Brian went out and got fucking bull last
it to the point where he almost died

3490
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,800
and he went back home to his,

3491
01:39:58,880 --> 01:39:59,360
I learned,

3492
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,950
I'm learning more new things by the way.

3493
01:40:00,951 --> 01:40:01,940
Somebody like,

3494
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:03,620
I have this alert thing on Google.

3495
01:40:03,621 --> 01:40:05,660
If anyone you know uses red band,

3496
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:06,141
it goes,

3497
01:40:06,141 --> 01:40:06,291
hey,

3498
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:06,460
you're,

3499
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,210
you're being talked about
on this message board.

3500
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,090
It's not going to,

3501
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:10,100
no,

3502
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:10,270
no,

3503
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:10,480
it's,

3504
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,380
it's just kind of a way to
like kind of track things.

3505
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:12,741
Well,

3506
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:13,401
somebody was like,

3507
01:40:13,401 --> 01:40:13,671
hey,

3508
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:15,740
just met red band in the elevator.

3509
01:40:15,741 --> 01:40:16,130
He,

3510
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:18,380
he came back to our
room and we smoked weed.

3511
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,680
I went to [inaudible] room
and smoked weed in Vegas.

3512
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:24,140
Like a stranger or
somebody just made that up?

3513
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:24,720
No,

3514
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:24,880
I,

3515
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,210
I,

3516
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:27,040
I slightly remember it.

3517
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:27,650
Really?

3518
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:28,010
Yeah.

3519
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:28,460
And then,

3520
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,910
then I guess I went back to my room and
I had to go to the bathroom so bad that

3521
01:40:31,911 --> 01:40:36,260
I woke up and peed on my pillow and
then put a blanket on my pillow,

3522
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,630
then slept back on it and
then woke up in the morning.

3523
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:38,970
Why

3524
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:41,430
is my pillow when you know Jesus,

3525
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:42,051
Oh,

3526
01:40:42,051 --> 01:40:42,490
I'm back.

3527
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:43,323
Sorry.

3528
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,393
Timing

3529
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:47,820
for a recap of Brian's weekend.

3530
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,210
Yeah,

3531
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,490
we have Ari Shaffir coming less tomorrow.

3532
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:54,280
Who I watched scream and
yell at the TSA agents.

3533
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,090
Oh no Dee.

3534
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,800
Did he do it again on doing it?

3535
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:57,730
He's doing it constantly.

3536
01:40:57,731 --> 01:40:58,481
That's what he does now.

3537
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:59,650
He yells at the Tsa,

3538
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,230
you want to take off his shoes?

3539
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,140
I'll take off my shoes.

3540
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:03,630
He goes through a,

3541
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,530
a a screening thing and he's like,

3542
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:05,801
he goes,

3543
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:06,401
we're all corrupt.

3544
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:08,530
It's a stupid tomorrow
we'll talk about it.

3545
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:09,281
It was amazing.

3546
01:41:09,281 --> 01:41:10,061
I got a picture of it.

3547
01:41:10,061 --> 01:41:10,161
I,

3548
01:41:10,161 --> 01:41:11,950
I tweeted the picture when it went down.

3549
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:12,940
I put it on my Instagram,

3550
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:13,930
but uh,

3551
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,620
it was,

3552
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,460
it was hilarious.

3553
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:15,731
I'm like,

3554
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:17,380
why are you creating all this problems?

3555
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:17,981
He's like,

3556
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:18,611
this is stupid.

3557
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:19,444
It's corruption.

3558
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,380
We didn't ask for this.

3559
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:20,801
I go,

3560
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:20,951
yeah,

3561
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:23,440
but I have to do is just take your shoes
off and walk through that little thing.

3562
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:24,880
Show me a chunk and then you go,

3563
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:25,390
yeah,

3564
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:25,570
no,

3565
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:26,680
everyone's going to be fine.

3566
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:27,970
It does naked scanners.

3567
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,110
What are you afraid of man?

3568
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:29,860
For Real?

3569
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,101
Oh,

3570
01:41:30,101 --> 01:41:32,230
I don't go through just for the radiation.

3571
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,190
Some of them,

3572
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:33,541
the,

3573
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:33,631
uh,

3574
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:34,151
the new ones,

3575
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:35,770
when you stand up and you
hold your hand up like that,

3576
01:41:35,771 --> 01:41:36,660
it's not radiation.

3577
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,050
Some sort of a radio wave,

3578
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,420
you know,

3579
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:39,820
you don't,

3580
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:40,530
you're not in,

3581
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:41,590
I just stay out of it.

3582
01:41:41,591 --> 01:41:43,490
Just general in general.

3583
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:48,340
This is more of an issue
with the radiation of space
actually scientifically.

3584
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:49,653
That is,

3585
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:53,830
if we believe what the numbers are
that they say that those things,

3586
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,180
those scanners give off,

3587
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:57,910
but they say those are
real risk of radiation.

3588
01:41:57,911 --> 01:41:59,020
Just actually flying,

3589
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,161
just flying,

3590
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:01,310
just being up in the air that high.

3591
01:42:01,311 --> 01:42:02,950
It's very a lot of radiation,

3592
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:03,431
you know,

3593
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:06,430
there's a lot of stuff week
again can be afraid of.

3594
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,100
I just,

3595
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:09,970
I just believe I'm going
to do the best I can.

3596
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:14,050
I'm going to stay in the best
possible shape I can be in.

3597
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,160
Well that argument,

3598
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:15,491
you know,

3599
01:42:15,491 --> 01:42:19,600
that way of looking at things is what
I've always argued was a good aspect of

3600
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:21,550
religion with religion.

3601
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:21,790
Yeah.

3602
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:24,540
Putting things in the faith of God and
having this belief that it's all going to

3603
01:42:24,541 --> 01:42:26,830
work out even though it's sort of like,

3604
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:27,970
in my opinion,

3605
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:29,213
I,

3606
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:30,640
I believe,

3607
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:30,850
you know,

3608
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:31,361
people always say,

3609
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:33,370
are you an atheist or an agnostic?

3610
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,310
I believe people are full
of shit first and foremost.

3611
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:39,100
And that's always an issue
whenever I hear a story.

3612
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:42,520
So I look at every religion
as a collection of stories.

3613
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:45,970
Every religion has either a collection
of stories or collection of rules that

3614
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:47,590
came down from those collections stories.

3615
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,420
Everybody's stories are bullshit.

3616
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:49,811
Okay?

3617
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:51,040
So let's just put that out there.

3618
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:56,430
Now I also believe that you believing
in those stories and you believing in

3619
01:42:56,861 --> 01:43:00,520
God's love and you believing in doing
God's will and you believing and being a

3620
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:04,300
good God fearing person in the
same way that I believe it's,

3621
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:04,601
you know,

3622
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:06,670
I pretend that the interdimensional
beings are watching me,

3623
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:07,560
so it keeps me on the straight.

3624
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:09,040
Now I think there's a,

3625
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:10,360
there's a benefit to that.

3626
01:43:10,361 --> 01:43:11,200
There's a benefit to them.

3627
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:15,880
I don't think it's a correct way of
approaching it rationally because I think

3628
01:43:15,881 --> 01:43:18,670
whatever merit is in the ancient texts,

3629
01:43:18,671 --> 01:43:20,410
whether it was actually the word of God,

3630
01:43:20,411 --> 01:43:25,411
it very well could be the huge
issue is reading it at face value,

3631
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,680
using it for uh,

3632
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:33,720
like a framework for how you behave
and act in this life when it's written

3633
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:38,290
thousands of years ago by people with
very limited access to information and all

3634
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:39,430
of it is ridiculous.

3635
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:40,960
It's all ridiculous.

3636
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:46,730
And the desire to do good
is a natural human state.

3637
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,820
And to Eh,

3638
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:51,920
to it with fear

3639
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,370
is,

3640
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,203
is

3641
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:54,071
unfortunate when,

3642
01:43:54,071 --> 01:43:58,150
when religious religion
and that's right and yeah,

3643
01:43:58,151 --> 01:44:00,820
and you're not control
when someone has power.

3644
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:02,860
It's really simple.

3645
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:03,880
It's just the same.

3646
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:06,580
It's very similar to what we were talking
about with actors losing their mind

3647
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:07,660
when the beginning of my famous,

3648
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,140
yeah,

3649
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,070
it's almost similar.

3650
01:44:09,071 --> 01:44:09,691
It's like they,

3651
01:44:09,691 --> 01:44:14,680
they have crazy outfits on
and they control the Vatican
and so they are used to

3652
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:17,720
everyone being terrified of them and
freaking out and they're present works.

3653
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:18,820
So they think they deserve it.

3654
01:44:18,821 --> 01:44:19,150
Like,

3655
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,540
if I could get the pope on a
podcast and the pope's book English,

3656
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:24,580
it would be the most
hilarious conversation ever.

3657
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,020
He would never do it.

3658
01:44:26,021 --> 01:44:26,854
He would leave.

3659
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:29,140
The moment we started
talking about pedophilia,

3660
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:30,010
he would probably run out right.

3661
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:31,740
But the,

3662
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,780
the idea that this guy is so completely
sheltered and so completely revered

3663
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:41,680
where he's just a guy with a
wacky outfit on and that is it.

3664
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:42,850
That really is it.

3665
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,510
And this idol worship that was
actually talked about in the Bible,

3666
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:46,890
you know,

3667
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:49,500
while worshiping false idols dangerous.

3668
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:49,870
Yeah,

3669
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:50,531
it really is.

3670
01:44:50,531 --> 01:44:51,341
It's confusing.

3671
01:44:51,341 --> 01:44:52,174
It's ridiculous.

3672
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,920
And the Real God,

3673
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:54,550
whatever,

3674
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:58,210
stop saying the word or say it if you
like the universe or the creator and the

3675
01:44:58,211 --> 01:44:59,400
intelligent being whatever it,

3676
01:44:59,440 --> 01:44:59,710
you know,

3677
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,840
Alex Gray is the visionary artists,

3678
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:02,501
brilliant,

3679
01:45:02,501 --> 01:45:04,300
brilliant man and a beautiful human being.

3680
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:06,610
And he came into the podcast
and he was just amazing,

3681
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,560
but he uses that word God
all the time and he's like,

3682
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:09,640
we have to take that word back.

3683
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:10,540
He's like,

3684
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,310
stop connecting.

3685
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:12,730
Everyone's connecting it to religion.

3686
01:45:12,731 --> 01:45:13,031
And you know,

3687
01:45:13,031 --> 01:45:14,200
what did it represents?

3688
01:45:14,201 --> 01:45:17,260
The idea of the perfection
that it is possible,

3689
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:18,550
represents love,

3690
01:45:18,551 --> 01:45:19,384
it represents,

3691
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:22,560
and the his really beautiful
a point of view on it.

3692
01:45:22,561 --> 01:45:24,640
It really opened me up to that.

3693
01:45:24,641 --> 01:45:28,630
I don't use it that often because
people misinterpret it and people

3694
01:45:28,631 --> 01:45:30,110
automatically cookie cutter,

3695
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,240
they shove it into that,

3696
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:36,630
that framework of predetermined patterns
of behavior that have been adopted from

3697
01:45:36,941 --> 01:45:37,774
religions.

3698
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:42,580
But I think that the heart of everything
good at the heart of all good feelings

3699
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,870
is that love thing,

3700
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:44,140
that,

3701
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,020
that the thing that pulls us all together,

3702
01:45:46,021 --> 01:45:46,854
the things just makes it,

3703
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,980
it makes us interact.

3704
01:45:47,981 --> 01:45:48,814
Well,

3705
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:49,863
that's something,

3706
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,420
if you take the teachings of Jesus,

3707
01:45:52,421 --> 01:45:52,991
of Mohammed,

3708
01:45:52,991 --> 01:45:53,824
of a Buddha,

3709
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:56,130
of all the great Martin Luther Gandhi

3710
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,510
of all,

3711
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,580
they are all based in the love each other.

3712
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:05,940
Love your neighbor as yourself.

3713
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,090
Right?

3714
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:07,330
And,

3715
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:08,010
and that's,

3716
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:08,760
that's,

3717
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,630
that's what I'm saying is it,

3718
01:46:10,631 --> 01:46:12,870
you can't blame anybody.

3719
01:46:12,871 --> 01:46:16,560
And then the it then love the
Lord your God or whatever,

3720
01:46:16,561 --> 01:46:16,711
you know,

3721
01:46:16,711 --> 01:46:18,660
with all your might and
your heart and it in.

3722
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:23,670
So it's about infusing love and
if you can walk with those really,

3723
01:46:24,271 --> 01:46:24,481
I mean,

3724
01:46:24,481 --> 01:46:24,660
and,

3725
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:27,720
and to completely taken away from
religion because I certainly,

3726
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:28,501
you know,

3727
01:46:28,501 --> 01:46:30,540
being the big homosexual I am,

3728
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:30,691
it's,

3729
01:46:30,691 --> 01:46:30,871
you know,

3730
01:46:30,871 --> 01:46:31,110
I,

3731
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:32,580
I didn't fit into religion at all,

3732
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,530
so it's yet,

3733
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,301
God,

3734
01:46:36,301 --> 01:46:36,870
let's leave.

3735
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:37,860
I believe in that.

3736
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,723
I,

3737
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:40,370
I'm with you on taking that back.

3738
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,000
I think that was a huge mistake in
keeping homosexuals in the church.

3739
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,490
What a dumb move because by doing that,

3740
01:46:46,491 --> 01:46:48,950
by alienating that
aspect of the population,

3741
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,351
you,

3742
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:52,170
you missed out on a whole bunch of
other people you can control stupid.

3743
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:52,580
Yeah.

3744
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:53,820
Now they're all against it.

3745
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:55,580
You dummy dress better.

3746
01:46:55,581 --> 01:46:55,811
Yeah.

3747
01:46:55,811 --> 01:46:57,180
There was just shitting chess move,

3748
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:57,770
you know,

3749
01:46:57,770 --> 01:46:59,720
they should have embraced
the gay people said that.

3750
01:46:59,721 --> 01:47:01,250
That's just another aspect of life.

3751
01:47:01,251 --> 01:47:02,630
It's just the same,

3752
01:47:02,631 --> 01:47:05,150
just as beautiful as a
male woman relationship.

3753
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,790
Right along with you do
whatever you want to do.

3754
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,050
And then people have been like,

3755
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:09,441
oh,

3756
01:47:09,441 --> 01:47:10,730
there's lesbians in our church today.

3757
01:47:10,731 --> 01:47:11,690
And no one would have cared.

3758
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:12,411
It would have been fine.

3759
01:47:12,411 --> 01:47:13,640
You had had more people in your church,

3760
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:14,474
stupid,

3761
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,633
but you blew it.

3762
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:17,480
Why alienated gay people too.

3763
01:47:17,481 --> 01:47:18,314
That to me is,

3764
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,340
that's a weird one.

3765
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:20,660
I've never understood that one.

3766
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:21,470
Fear.

3767
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:22,250
Yeah.

3768
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:22,881
Fear of what?

3769
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:24,660
If you hear them actually
being homosexual,

3770
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,230
your own fear of sex.

3771
01:47:27,231 --> 01:47:28,280
Sex depends on how,

3772
01:47:28,281 --> 01:47:28,971
where you grew up.

3773
01:47:28,971 --> 01:47:30,200
If you grew up in your parents,

3774
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,920
if when you were three years old and
running around without a diaper on,

3775
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,700
if you were touching your genitalia,

3776
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:36,891
I just said,

3777
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:37,491
genitalia,

3778
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:38,324
that's fine.

3779
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:40,910
If you're touching yourself
and your mother goes,

3780
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:41,744
don't do that.

3781
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:44,600
That starts your whole waiting when
there's something wrong with that.

3782
01:47:44,601 --> 01:47:45,560
I'm not supposed to do that,

3783
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:51,190
and that grows and then depends on all
their other parts of your experience and

3784
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,770
any things that naturally happen to
us when they put that fear on it,

3785
01:47:54,771 --> 01:47:55,550
then that'll nessie.

3786
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,300
How it's not a,

3787
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:57,000
not a coincidence

3788
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
that the most suppressive aspect of our
accepted culture is Catholic priests.

3789
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:03,271
I mean,

3790
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:04,770
they're not allowed to have sex.

3791
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:04,930
That,

3792
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:06,930
and then they're always
involved in scandals there.

3793
01:48:06,931 --> 01:48:07,411
Sexual,

3794
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:07,920
I mean,

3795
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,200
we are sexual beings.

3796
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,720
Part of connection with the,

3797
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,610
the God.

3798
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:12,031
Yeah.

3799
01:48:12,031 --> 01:48:12,240
Well,

3800
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,010
how do you explain those
dumb monks that are up there?

3801
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:15,390
They're not having sex
with anybody either.

3802
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,610
They got a good thing though.

3803
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,061
These,

3804
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:21,570
they're monitoring their mind to a
point where they're controlling their

3805
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:22,291
physicality,

3806
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:24,300
but I still think that shit's ridiculous.

3807
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:24,990
It's true.

3808
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:25,381
I do.

3809
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:26,460
You don't have to go be a monk.

3810
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:29,760
I don't worry about this is
so not necessarily make it.

3811
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,040
Have you had an experience
in the isolation tank?

3812
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,091
I have not.

3813
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:34,710
I really want to do that though.

3814
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:37,710
I am consistently amazed
at how many amazing,

3815
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:39,300
interesting people haven't tried that out.

3816
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:39,860
Yeah.

3817
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:40,200
I just,

3818
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,033
I haven't.

3819
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:42,023
Where do you do it?

3820
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,560
I can get you in.

3821
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,200
You want to try it as a
place in while there's a,

3822
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:48,420
the best place in the world
actually is in Venice.

3823
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:49,620
Yeah.

3824
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,321
Venice A,

3825
01:48:50,321 --> 01:48:51,270
I dunno if that's close to you,

3826
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:52,980
but it's a one in Burbank.

3827
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:55,740
There's a place called
soothing solutions in Burbank,

3828
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:59,730
but the issue of the Burbank place as
opposed to the Venice place though is the

3829
01:48:59,731 --> 01:49:00,510
tanks.

3830
01:49:00,510 --> 01:49:01,550
Burbank place is fine.

3831
01:49:01,551 --> 01:49:02,940
I mean if you're close to that,

3832
01:49:02,941 --> 01:49:03,541
definitely go in.

3833
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:04,980
The lady who runs it is super cool.

3834
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:09,000
The difference is what that
guy at the float lab has done.

3835
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,530
The float lab is the place in Venice.

3836
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:13,590
He's ticking floating to a
completely different place.

3837
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,150
He's a super genius,

3838
01:49:15,151 --> 01:49:19,560
this guys and nuts and he
creates these unbelievably solid,

3839
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:20,161
amazing,

3840
01:49:20,161 --> 01:49:23,590
huge tanks that are so regulated and the,

3841
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:25,140
they pump oxygen into them.

3842
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:28,410
He's got it down to such a
science that when you're in that,

3843
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,273
I mean it's,

3844
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:32,220
it's just so the
environment is so perfect,

3845
01:49:32,221 --> 01:49:33,420
completely soundproof.

3846
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,950
You don't feel anything.

3847
01:49:34,951 --> 01:49:36,570
You're floating through space.

3848
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:40,680
Your body is just like the water's
the same temperature as your skin.

3849
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:42,510
So as you float there,

3850
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:45,750
you literally don't feel the water
you're released of massive amounts of

3851
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:46,584
tension.

3852
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:47,483
Physical.

3853
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,150
Alright.

3854
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:50,340
It's amazingly recharging just physically.

3855
01:49:50,341 --> 01:49:52,320
And then if you go in there with brownies,

3856
01:49:52,321 --> 01:49:53,670
you get to meet aliens.

3857
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:55,730
I believe that.

3858
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:56,450
Absolutely.

3859
01:49:56,450 --> 01:50:00,440
Because all you have to do is just get
past that your belief that this is what's

3860
01:50:00,441 --> 01:50:00,891
in front of me.

3861
01:50:00,891 --> 01:50:02,090
So I can't possibly see aliens.

3862
01:50:02,091 --> 01:50:03,500
But if you remove all that,

3863
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:04,580
absolutely.

3864
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,750
And we say aliens just as,

3865
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,350
yeah,

3866
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,610
the spiritual diligence.

3867
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:07,880
Yeah.

3868
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:08,450
Being silly.

3869
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:08,590
Yeah.

3870
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:10,700
It should be something that talks back.

3871
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:10,851
Yeah.

3872
01:50:10,851 --> 01:50:11,850
That's what I like to talk to.

3873
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,450
That's when you realize that
because some people think,

3874
01:50:14,451 --> 01:50:15,020
oh,

3875
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:16,880
the way that I believe is very lonely.

3876
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:17,430
Yeah.

3877
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,811
No,

3878
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:18,081
no,

3879
01:50:18,081 --> 01:50:19,260
you don't put you up to the holidays.

3880
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,960
We are anything but alone.

3881
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:21,220
Yeah.

3882
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:21,690
It makes me

3883
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:23,670
very thankful whenever
I come out of there.

3884
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:28,710
That's probably been like the biggest
tool for developing my own personality.

3885
01:50:28,711 --> 01:50:32,370
My own view of reality is that
because it's a real reset,

3886
01:50:32,371 --> 01:50:35,160
it's a real time off when
everything is shut off.

3887
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:38,040
And when I get out I just want to call
my friends and tell them I love them.

3888
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,030
I just want to pet my dog or just want to,

3889
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:42,450
I really like thankful.

3890
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:43,610
How long do you stay in it?

3891
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:44,341
A couple hours.

3892
01:50:44,341 --> 01:50:45,450
I like to do two hours.

3893
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:46,681
I just think it's,

3894
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:47,160
um,

3895
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:47,993
it's,

3896
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:51,450
it's another thing that I would like to
see spread and I know some people are

3897
01:50:51,451 --> 01:50:51,751
doing it.

3898
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:55,380
My friend Scotty from a
on the mat.com he's got a,

3899
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:59,390
a tank center that he's looking into
opening and California and then uh,

3900
01:50:59,460 --> 01:50:59,770
uh,

3901
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,630
earn La Rather.

3902
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:03,420
And then I know the float labs going to
open up another place in Hollywood too,

3903
01:51:03,421 --> 01:51:04,111
so there's,

3904
01:51:04,111 --> 01:51:07,080
and there's plenty of business
out there if more people did it.

3905
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:10,620
A lot of people want to know about
this and a lot of people would benefit

3906
01:51:10,621 --> 01:51:11,311
massively.

3907
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:14,610
Like if you enjoy getting a massage every
now and then you enjoy taking a yoga

3908
01:51:14,611 --> 01:51:15,120
class.

3909
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,110
This is that times a hundred cool.

3910
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,480
We're really inquire will do that.

3911
01:51:18,481 --> 01:51:18,771
Thank you.

3912
01:51:18,771 --> 01:51:19,790
You should totally do that.

3913
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,250
Yeah.

3914
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:24,690
What's wrong with your music that you
come up with some crazy shit from in

3915
01:51:24,691 --> 01:51:24,841
there?

3916
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:25,920
Too much space.

3917
01:51:25,921 --> 01:51:26,460
Wow.

3918
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:27,293
Yeah.

3919
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:28,223
Yeah.

3920
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,600
Just being complete floating
around in there and do it.

3921
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,710
How do you write?

3922
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:32,250
Do you,

3923
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:35,390
do you sit down with a guitar or do
you sit down with a piece of paper?

3924
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,030
Do you bowl?

3925
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:36,181
Well,

3926
01:51:36,181 --> 01:51:37,950
it always starts with inspiration,

3927
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:39,840
so that can be different.

3928
01:51:39,841 --> 01:51:41,550
That can be me sitting here going,

3929
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:41,881
oh,

3930
01:51:41,881 --> 01:51:42,714
wait a minute.

3931
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,890
Maybe you just said something
that sounds rhythmic,

3932
01:51:44,891 --> 01:51:45,450
that sounds like,

3933
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:45,571
oh,

3934
01:51:45,571 --> 01:51:46,231
I want to write about,

3935
01:51:46,231 --> 01:51:47,990
do you just go run out of
the room and write it down?

3936
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:48,931
Actually,

3937
01:51:48,931 --> 01:51:53,010
I use the iPhone a lot to just make notes
to myself or if I hear a rhythm or a

3938
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:53,241
sing,

3939
01:51:53,241 --> 01:51:53,881
a melody or something,

3940
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:55,520
I'll put it on the voice memo.

3941
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:56,460
Yeah,

3942
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,121
I do that a lot.

3943
01:51:57,121 --> 01:51:58,560
And then when I have time,

3944
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,611
when I make time,

3945
01:51:59,611 --> 01:52:00,151
I tried to make,

3946
01:52:00,151 --> 01:52:00,361
you know,

3947
01:52:00,361 --> 01:52:00,631
two,

3948
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:00,841
three,

3949
01:52:00,841 --> 01:52:03,900
four hours and I can sit down and
really just work something out.

3950
01:52:03,901 --> 01:52:04,734
So you know what's going out.

3951
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,560
Amazing.

3952
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,180
I don't know if you've
ever used it on the iPhone.

3953
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,610
It has this little um,

3954
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:09,580
icon.

3955
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:11,710
Apparently the android
phones have this now as well.

3956
01:52:11,711 --> 01:52:12,280
For the,

3957
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,113
for the notes,

3958
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,110
if you press it,

3959
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,890
you press this little microphone icon
next hit space bar and you can talk into

3960
01:52:17,891 --> 01:52:19,090
it and it does it in real time.

3961
01:52:19,091 --> 01:52:19,511
It's amazing.

3962
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:20,230
Like check this out,

3963
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:23,500
watch Melissa Etheridge is a bad mother.

3964
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:24,493
Fuck.

3965
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:26,063
Watch this.

3966
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:26,490
Bam,

3967
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,150
look at that.

3968
01:52:27,150 --> 01:52:28,050
I've got a quick that is,

3969
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,610
oh it typed it out.

3970
01:52:29,611 --> 01:52:33,150
It typed it out perfectly
when you said I have this.

3971
01:52:33,151 --> 01:52:33,570
So I,

3972
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:34,231
cause I used to,

3973
01:52:34,231 --> 01:52:39,231
I have a lot of stuff that I wrote in
my little note pad but I'm not as fast

3974
01:52:39,601 --> 01:52:40,860
with my thumbs is that is.

3975
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:42,300
And sometimes like for me,

3976
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:42,850
uh,

3977
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,950
a new idea,

3978
01:52:43,951 --> 01:52:46,100
like a new idea for a joke is so slippery.

3979
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,350
It's like a fish that I can't hold onto,

3980
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:48,771
can't run.

3981
01:52:48,771 --> 01:52:49,650
And I got to write it down.

3982
01:52:49,651 --> 01:52:49,840
It's good.

3983
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,070
Greg,

3984
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:50,903
how's that go again?

3985
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:52,230
Oh I got to,

3986
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:53,660
someone's still talking
to me like please stop,

3987
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:54,590
stop talking for a second.

3988
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:55,760
I gotta I gotta hold on.

3989
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:56,991
What is this?

3990
01:52:56,991 --> 01:52:58,340
How do I write this down and then,

3991
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,500
but if I could just say it,

3992
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,560
it would be way better.

3993
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,420
Like I could get the idea completely.

3994
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,190
Cause sometimes my
ideas are so ridiculous.

3995
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:07,400
Like I have to go back and read them like
two or three times to figure out even

3996
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:08,234
what the Hell I was saying.

3997
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:09,651
But these,

3998
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:10,010
um,

3999
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:11,150
these new little icon,

4000
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:11,741
these new little,

4001
01:53:11,741 --> 01:53:12,080
um,

4002
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,830
note features where you could do
that with just the microphone.

4003
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:16,401
It's amazing.

4004
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:17,660
These new cell phones are just,

4005
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:18,381
well,

4006
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:18,951
you can do with them.

4007
01:53:18,951 --> 01:53:20,030
It's just unbelievable.

4008
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,930
It's so crazy.

4009
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:25,970
So you write things down just when you
have this idea where you record like the

4010
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:26,331
melody,

4011
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:28,730
like you hum it or something
like that into your voice memos.

4012
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:29,600
Yeah.

4013
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:29,841
Yeah.

4014
01:53:29,841 --> 01:53:30,390
It depends on,

4015
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:31,161
or I'll play.

4016
01:53:31,161 --> 01:53:32,810
If it's a piece of guitar playing,

4017
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:34,400
I'll play that or piano or whatever it is.

4018
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:39,230
It always comes from different places and
then I'll give the time to work it out

4019
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:40,130
and do what if it's going to be,

4020
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:43,010
I love when people still keep creating.

4021
01:53:43,011 --> 01:53:43,940
They just never stopped.

4022
01:53:43,941 --> 01:53:45,200
They just keep pumping stuff out.

4023
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:45,880
I love it.

4024
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:46,713
I love it.

4025
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,361
It's so,

4026
01:53:47,361 --> 01:53:48,320
it's so fun.

4027
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:50,000
It's so fun to be a part of,

4028
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:50,420
uh,

4029
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:52,730
this crazy culture that,

4030
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,350
you know,

4031
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:56,660
w it was crazy world that we live in now
and see all the stuff that's coming out

4032
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:57,290
too.

4033
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:01,100
It's like we have more
access to great information,

4034
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:02,030
great music,

4035
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:03,050
great movies,

4036
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:03,800
great everything.

4037
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,131
It's like,

4038
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:04,490
it's,

4039
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:07,100
we have so much access to inspiration.

4040
01:54:07,101 --> 01:54:08,690
We have so much access to art.

4041
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,460
It's an amazing time.

4042
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:11,060
Yeah.

4043
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:15,980
And to see people embracing the Internet
and using the Internet as a method of

4044
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:17,300
spreading all this stuff too.

4045
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,051
It's just,

4046
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:18,910
I think it's,

4047
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,900
we just live in just very,

4048
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:22,100
very rare times.

4049
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:23,810
That's another thing to be really,

4050
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:27,290
really happy for and really
appreciate it above this time,

4051
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,491
this strange,

4052
01:54:28,491 --> 01:54:33,491
strange time that we exist to do you
write and create as just a matter of like

4053
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:33,670
you,

4054
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,760
I mean you're so successful now,

4055
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:36,050
you just must do it as a desire.

4056
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:37,220
Like whenever you feel like it,

4057
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,470
not every day like this is my gig.

4058
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,350
Like how do you treat it nowadays?

4059
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,140
My life is so full and so,

4060
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:48,770
so blessed that when it's time
for me to create something,

4061
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:51,350
it's like I'm thinking about a musical.

4062
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,760
Like I would really love to,

4063
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:53,030
you know,

4064
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,721
have a musical,

4065
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:54,830
but that that's a big,

4066
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:56,300
huge undertaking.

4067
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,850
So I just

4068
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:01,550
give myself say,

4069
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:01,821
okay,

4070
01:55:01,821 --> 01:55:06,140
these few weeks I'm going to get myself
from Monday to Friday from 10 to two

4071
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:06,831
every day.

4072
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:07,940
That's what I'm going to work.

4073
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:09,470
And then when I'm done with that,

4074
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:11,810
then I'll give myself some
time off and then I'll say,

4075
01:55:11,811 --> 01:55:12,530
okay,

4076
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:14,780
I'll gather the pieces of the notes,

4077
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:15,201
the stuff,

4078
01:55:15,201 --> 01:55:16,610
and then I'll make another album.

4079
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:17,300
I'll give myself,

4080
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:17,661
you know,

4081
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:17,921
I'll,

4082
01:55:17,921 --> 01:55:18,200
I'll,

4083
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,190
I'll actually work,

4084
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,170
I'll make a time every day to work.

4085
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,470
And when you do that and
you put together an album,

4086
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:23,811
do say,

4087
01:55:23,811 --> 01:55:24,171
okay,

4088
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:24,591
you know what,

4089
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:25,820
let's take this bitch on the road.

4090
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:26,260
See what's up.

4091
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:27,093
Oh yeah.

4092
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:27,501
Oh yeah.

4093
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:27,890
That's the,

4094
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:28,701
that's the best part.

4095
01:55:28,701 --> 01:55:33,530
And it's great to create out of
nothing and make music is I'm,

4096
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:34,250
I love it.

4097
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:36,890
I would do it all the time for nothing.

4098
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:42,640
And then when I get to take that
and share it with a thousand,

4099
01:55:42,681 --> 01:55:44,270
2000 a night and,

4100
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,510
and here,

4101
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:46,201
here they are.

4102
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:46,471
And they,

4103
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:48,280
and they love that music
and I'm singing it.

4104
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:51,570
And in it's an energy exchange
that then it's just beyond.

4105
01:55:51,571 --> 01:55:52,290
That's just wonderful.

4106
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:52,530
Yeah.

4107
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,040
The live energy exchange.

4108
01:55:54,041 --> 01:55:57,090
Isn't it amazing when the glue
your fans and the Chemo there,

4109
01:55:57,091 --> 01:56:02,091
Melissa Etheridge fans and you know you
hit him with one of the classics and you

4110
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:05,720
see their eyes light up and
starting the song that people know,

4111
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,101
oh,

4112
01:56:06,101 --> 01:56:07,620
it must be an amazing feeling.

4113
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:12,060
It's an amazing feeling to be an audience
member in a song you love comes on

4114
01:56:12,061 --> 01:56:12,630
like that,

4115
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:13,740
but to be able to do it,

4116
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:14,850
that must be crazy.

4117
01:56:14,851 --> 01:56:16,080
You're a weird conduit.

4118
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,071
Yes,

4119
01:56:17,071 --> 01:56:17,980
I am and it's what it,

4120
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:19,290
what it really boils down to.

4121
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:19,801
Absolutely.

4122
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:21,270
You move the energy through you right out.

4123
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:21,750
Yeah.

4124
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,340
People that think that's hippy crazy,

4125
01:56:23,341 --> 01:56:24,930
like there's something happening.

4126
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:26,340
Why am I getting goosebumps?

4127
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:29,370
There must be something that actually
somebody just sent me that the other day

4128
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:32,790
that some sort of a scientific explanation
for why music gives you goosebumps,

4129
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,290
but I say that's horse shit.

4130
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,221
You know what I'm saying?

4131
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:35,431
Fuck.

4132
01:56:35,431 --> 01:56:36,330
That means why argument?

4133
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:38,280
It gives me goosebumps and not you.

4134
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:39,900
Why am I responding to it?

4135
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:42,630
But to another person
that's not the right music.

4136
01:56:42,631 --> 01:56:43,250
You know?

4137
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:44,083
You don't believe.

4138
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:47,850
That's what's really important to
recognize that in a lot of people it takes

4139
01:56:47,851 --> 01:56:51,900
them a long time to figure this out is
that everybody likes different stuff.

4140
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:55,620
They just do and they are some
people that are not going to be,

4141
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:57,680
they're not tuned into
it for whatever reason.

4142
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:58,940
They're not I.

4143
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:04,700
It's a weird thing when you are a
performer and you and you are beholden to

4144
01:57:05,341 --> 01:57:07,050
people buying your records in that,

4145
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,570
that chart position or that,

4146
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:11,400
that certain position,

4147
01:57:11,401 --> 01:57:13,440
that number and you think,

4148
01:57:13,441 --> 01:57:13,831
oh my gosh,

4149
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:16,170
I want everyone to like me
and it's just not possible.

4150
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:16,980
It's not Bob,

4151
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:18,900
and that's a good thing everybody,

4152
01:57:18,901 --> 01:57:22,300
and that's why you can then
it helps in my belief when I,

4153
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:22,660
oh,

4154
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:23,490
I,

4155
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:28,490
I believe that those who resonate with
the music I make will come to it and it

4156
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:29,730
would just be fine.

4157
01:57:29,731 --> 01:57:30,181
Everybody else,

4158
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:31,470
I'm not blaming you judging,

4159
01:57:31,471 --> 01:57:32,620
it's just that's what you are.

4160
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:33,301
Yeah.

4161
01:57:33,301 --> 01:57:34,980
I mean there's billions of people.

4162
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:38,940
The people that they'll only
love you for who you are.

4163
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:43,710
If you are who you are and if you tried
to be a bunch of different people on a

4164
01:57:43,711 --> 01:57:44,700
bunch of different things,

4165
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:45,780
we see that over and over.

4166
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:50,700
We see these people just lose it because
they have created a certain persona in

4167
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:52,500
the public eye and then they feel,

4168
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,390
you start feeling like that persona,

4169
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,360
Eh,

4170
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,131
that's not you.

4171
01:57:56,131 --> 01:57:58,770
So any accolades that that
persona gets is not you.

4172
01:57:58,771 --> 01:57:59,760
And then you're just miserable.

4173
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,650
He started drinking and
you're fucking crazy puzzles.

4174
01:58:02,651 --> 01:58:05,520
You're driving fast and
they're taking your picture.

4175
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:06,570
How do you avoid it?

4176
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:08,590
Like crazy rock star cliches like that?

4177
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:09,751
Well,

4178
01:58:09,751 --> 01:58:10,640
I figured I uh,

4179
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,440
I have two ex wives,

4180
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:13,650
you know,

4181
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,610
two baby mamma's side.

4182
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:18,030
I figure I fall into the
rock and roll to Exelon.

4183
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:20,900
I know what is,

4184
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,170
I like to stay in contact.

4185
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:27,530
I have to have two children with each
of them while I know and I have to send

4186
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,374
them.

4187
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,510
That's hilarious.

4188
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:33,770
It's the same cliche appears in the male,

4189
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,703
female,

4190
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:35,040
male,

4191
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:35,761
female world.

4192
01:58:35,761 --> 01:58:37,470
You got to pay for it no matter what.

4193
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:38,310
That's what they say.

4194
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:42,070
Nobody rides for free.

4195
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:43,120
Right.

4196
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:43,540
Oh,

4197
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:44,500
so you know,

4198
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:45,041
what would I do?

4199
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:45,874
We actually,

4200
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,170
because when it comes to the kids,

4201
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:47,770
we get along.

4202
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:48,101
Okay.

4203
01:58:48,101 --> 01:58:48,281
You know,

4204
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:49,040
there's,

4205
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:49,530
I,

4206
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:52,330
I don't have to socialize
with them and that's fine.

4207
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,740
But for the kids,

4208
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,270
they need a,

4209
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,133
they need a,

4210
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:56,710
uh,

4211
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:57,543
a happy,

4212
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:58,181
not happy,

4213
01:58:58,181 --> 01:58:58,780
but they need a,

4214
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:01,630
a cohesive unit that they
go back and forth from.

4215
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:02,701
And so I,

4216
01:59:02,701 --> 01:59:04,240
I'm determined to do that.

4217
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,583
That's awesome.

4218
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:06,070
Um,

4219
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,550
the,

4220
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:09,790
the lesbian relationship dynamic,

4221
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:14,380
is it often like the male
female heterosexual dynamic
or it depends on who you

4222
01:59:14,381 --> 01:59:14,651
are.

4223
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:15,490
It depends on what you,

4224
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:20,590
Paul's with his to Melissa averages
both bad asses and that together.

4225
01:59:20,591 --> 01:59:20,981
Is that,

4226
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:21,660
that'd be nice.

4227
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:21,991
Yeah.

4228
01:59:21,991 --> 01:59:22,151
Right.

4229
01:59:22,151 --> 01:59:22,300
Yeah.

4230
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,040
I have,

4231
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:23,500
um,

4232
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,221
my partner now,

4233
01:59:24,221 --> 01:59:28,720
her name is Linda and she
is a television producer,

4234
01:59:28,721 --> 01:59:29,050
writer,

4235
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:29,321
director.

4236
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:30,520
She did nurse Jackie.

4237
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:31,690
So she's successful.

4238
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,553
Yes.

4239
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:36,160
I know this bad ass is living together.

4240
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,440
Exactly.

4241
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:39,130
And that it actually,

4242
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:41,530
because I believe,

4243
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:44,140
because I finally started believing
in myself a few years ago.

4244
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:44,351
Okay,

4245
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:45,011
I'm a bad ass.

4246
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:45,844
I'm a bad ass.

4247
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:47,290
Then I'm going to draw it.

4248
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:48,130
But that's what you got to do.

4249
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:49,360
Then you got to draw,

4250
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:54,540
then you will draw a bad ass to you
because you are vibrating that that's the

4251
01:59:54,821 --> 01:59:55,031
only way.

4252
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:55,930
If you're sitting there going,

4253
01:59:55,931 --> 01:59:56,920
I need someone to fix me,

4254
01:59:56,921 --> 01:59:58,060
I need someone to come and be,

4255
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:02,050
then you're going to think
yourself as broken and broken.

4256
02:00:02,051 --> 02:00:02,950
People will come to you.

4257
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:03,761
Yeah.

4258
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:06,850
This is something that is driving
scientists crazy right now.

4259
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:08,920
They're hearing this and
they're going this demo,

4260
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:12,070
Melissa Etheridge mirrors nonsense.

4261
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,870
What are you saying?

4262
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:15,430
Show me the studies.

4263
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:19,090
Show me peer reviewed papers are shut it.

4264
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:20,430
Yeah.

4265
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:20,650
Uh,

4266
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:22,240
I think there's a lot of
merit to what you're saying.

4267
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:23,140
I don't know if it's right,

4268
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,030
but I do believe that believing in it,

4269
02:00:25,031 --> 02:00:28,270
it's very powerful and I
think that's all I say.

4270
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:30,640
You're obviously living
embodiment of that,

4271
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:31,031
you know,

4272
02:00:31,031 --> 02:00:34,930
and also a person who's experienced the
ups and downs of not being aware of the

4273
02:00:34,931 --> 02:00:37,630
body and then re changing
it and becoming aware,

4274
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,430
becoming much happier.

4275
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:40,264
And you know,

4276
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,070
and I do not do it perfect every day.

4277
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:42,431
Again,

4278
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:43,840
this is a practice I make,

4279
02:00:43,841 --> 02:00:44,411
my choices.

4280
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:44,801
I live,

4281
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:45,521
I go up and down.

4282
02:00:45,521 --> 02:00:46,354
But that's life.

4283
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,590
Especially when you're busy.

4284
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:48,370
It's hard.

4285
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:52,100
It's hard to manage it all and keep
cool and treat everybody as if it's you

4286
02:00:52,101 --> 02:00:53,110
living another life.

4287
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:54,161
Yes,

4288
02:00:54,161 --> 02:00:54,821
it is difficult,

4289
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:55,654
isn't it?

4290
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:56,391
Well listen,

4291
02:00:56,391 --> 02:00:56,741
you just,

4292
02:00:56,741 --> 02:00:57,551
you being on here,

4293
02:00:57,551 --> 02:00:58,540
it was a huge treat.

4294
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:00,440
It was a an honor and it was a,

4295
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:01,290
it was weird,

4296
02:01:01,290 --> 02:01:01,741
you know,

4297
02:01:01,741 --> 02:01:03,440
because it was like I kept
telling me what to do,

4298
02:01:03,441 --> 02:01:04,680
but most of us are just coming on here.

4299
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:05,533
I tell him

4300
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:09,220
he does to Brian and I,

4301
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:12,280
we started doing this in my
living room on a laptop as a goof.

4302
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,160
But you believe you loved it.

4303
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:17,320
What was it you love will grow?

4304
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:17,621
Well,

4305
02:01:17,621 --> 02:01:19,630
it became something
somewhere along the line.

4306
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:20,740
I don't know how it happened,

4307
02:01:20,741 --> 02:01:22,990
but it just did and we're
just sort of riding it,

4308
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:23,650
you know?

4309
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:26,410
I figured you would ask me the
questions that I want to be asked.

4310
02:01:26,411 --> 02:01:28,420
I'm always available to talk like this,

4311
02:01:28,421 --> 02:01:29,810
but no one has stuff.

4312
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:31,520
And then they will,

4313
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,470
they'll ask me the same
10 questions over there.

4314
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:34,031
Well,

4315
02:01:34,031 --> 02:01:37,690
it's very obvious that this way
of thinking is important to you,

4316
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:38,020
to,

4317
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:38,910
you want to express it.

4318
02:01:38,911 --> 02:01:39,171
And you,

4319
02:01:39,171 --> 02:01:42,270
you're very courageous and expressing
it because it sounds fucking crazy.

4320
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:43,310
Well,

4321
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:43,760
people,

4322
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,050
what have I got to lose?

4323
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:48,080
And I'm not saying it sounds crazy
to me all it does sound crazy to me.

4324
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,640
It also sounds possible to me,

4325
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:50,211
you know,

4326
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:51,560
I think there's a,

4327
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:54,740
there's a lot of weirdness to the way we
perceive the world and there's a lot of

4328
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:55,390
strange,

4329
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:58,250
if you can even start
from that is maybe that,

4330
02:01:58,251 --> 02:02:01,070
which I think is so definite is not.

4331
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:02,210
If you can start from that,

4332
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:03,500
then you're on a journey.

4333
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,270
I think having these
conversations are very,

4334
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:06,050
very important.

4335
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:09,410
I think having these conversations
publicly and just the consideration that

4336
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:11,900
takes to not necessarily accept the idea,

4337
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:14,060
but just to consider the
points of it and not,

4338
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,260
as I said,

4339
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:16,910
I believe that that is possible,

4340
02:02:16,911 --> 02:02:18,260
but I also believe in asteroids.

4341
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:22,070
I believe that if you're in the wrong
place at tiger will eat your ass and it

4342
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:23,240
doesn't mean you're a bad person.

4343
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:24,263
You live in India,

4344
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:25,423
London bed.

4345
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:26,403
Yeah,

4346
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:27,400
exactly.

4347
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,210
So a beautiful way of
looking at the world,

4348
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:30,320
and again,

4349
02:02:30,321 --> 02:02:31,190
you might be right.

4350
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,293
There's a lot of,

4351
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:37,160
there's a lot of flexibility to this
thing that we exist in and it doesn't seem

4352
02:02:37,161 --> 02:02:42,161
like we are operating on a long history
of people's work where they've really

4353
02:02:43,611 --> 02:02:44,270
figured it out.

4354
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:45,830
It seems like as a culture,

4355
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:50,510
we've been doing crazy barbaric shift to
each other since the jump and we're now

4356
02:02:50,511 --> 02:02:52,310
just in this period of
abundance starting to go,

4357
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:52,461
Whoa,

4358
02:02:52,461 --> 02:02:52,580
Whoa,

4359
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:52,761
whoa,

4360
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:52,911
Whoa,

4361
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:53,150
whoa.

4362
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:53,481
Hold on,

4363
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:53,781
hold on,

4364
02:02:53,781 --> 02:02:54,410
hold on.

4365
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:55,340
Let's Google that.

4366
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:56,653
You know,

4367
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,203
is that true?

4368
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,200
Are you sure that's true?

4369
02:03:00,201 --> 02:03:01,460
What are we doing here exactly?

4370
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:02,570
Where's the,

4371
02:03:02,570 --> 02:03:03,291
where's the oil?

4372
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:03,590
Whose,

4373
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:06,050
whose gun is that a real UFO?

4374
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,260
What the fuck is big?

4375
02:03:07,261 --> 02:03:10,870
But that's all happening right now and
thank you very much more so it was big,

4376
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:11,810
beautiful talking to you.

4377
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:13,550
It was a real pleasure and an honor.

4378
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:14,420
Thank you very much.

4379
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:15,320
Thank you so much.

4380
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:16,580
Your new CD.

4381
02:03:16,581 --> 02:03:18,500
I have it here it is.

4382
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:19,100
Um,

4383
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:19,850
some of this in it.

4384
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:21,230
I do put that in my music too,

4385
02:03:21,231 --> 02:03:21,710
you know?

4386
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:22,071
Yeah.

4387
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:23,870
It's a fourth street feeling.

4388
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:25,190
And is it out everywhere?

4389
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:27,700
Amazon and iTunes.

4390
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:33,220
Yeah.

4391
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:35,770
It's unlike a lot of CCS.

4392
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:38,360
There's a lot of artwork
put into the actual cover,

4393
02:03:38,361 --> 02:03:39,350
which I really miss.

4394
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:39,891
I mean,

4395
02:03:39,891 --> 02:03:43,520
I'm not old enough to really
remember too many records,

4396
02:03:43,521 --> 02:03:44,271
but when I was a little kid,

4397
02:03:44,271 --> 02:03:48,560
I had a Cheech and Chong record and it
was big bamboo and I opened it up and it

4398
02:03:48,561 --> 02:03:48,981
was like,

4399
02:03:48,981 --> 02:03:50,840
I didn't even know what
smoking pot was back then.

4400
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,171
I was,

4401
02:03:51,171 --> 02:03:51,391
you know,

4402
02:03:51,391 --> 02:03:53,960
I was like eight but I'm are
probably knew what it was,

4403
02:03:53,961 --> 02:03:54,920
but I wasn't into it.

4404
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,031
But you know,

4405
02:03:56,031 --> 02:03:57,410
it's not why I bought
it because it was funny.

4406
02:03:57,411 --> 02:03:57,800
But there,

4407
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:02,330
their album cover was this
big like rolling paper thing
and you would open it up

4408
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:02,811
and it was like,

4409
02:04:02,811 --> 02:04:04,370
there was so much work put into it,

4410
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:05,010
you know,

4411
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:07,190
really an art form that I do miss.

4412
02:04:07,191 --> 02:04:07,341
Yeah.

4413
02:04:07,341 --> 02:04:08,560
This the deluxe version,

4414
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:09,231
my record companies,

4415
02:04:09,231 --> 02:04:09,440
great.

4416
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,640
They'll put out the regular version,

4417
02:04:10,641 --> 02:04:11,474
which has the,

4418
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,220
I think there's 11 songs on there,

4419
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:17,750
12 minutes and this is the deluxe version
that I have a lot of fans that really

4420
02:04:17,751 --> 02:04:20,870
appreciate the extra artwork and the
extra songs and so we put that on it.

4421
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:21,681
That's great.

4422
02:04:21,681 --> 02:04:22,431
Photography.

4423
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:23,520
Whoever it said that they,

4424
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:27,230
they really sort of captured the
tone of a lot of the music on here.

4425
02:04:27,231 --> 02:04:28,160
It's really awesome.

4426
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:28,730
What does it,

4427
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:31,960
what does that car is a replica.

4428
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:34,250
It is a 64 Chevy impala.

4429
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:37,470
I asked them to give because that's
the first car I had when I was a kid.

4430
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:41,040
That was the first car I ever
bought when I was 15 I got it.

4431
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:41,850
Wow.

4432
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,171
Yeah.

4433
02:04:42,171 --> 02:04:43,730
So yeah.

4434
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:48,390
So I said with a big bench seats in
the back and the front was awesome.

4435
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:51,100
It's amazing that people drove
those with no seat belts.

4436
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:51,840
No seatbelt.

4437
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,111
Well,

4438
02:04:52,111 --> 02:04:52,944
you could,

4439
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:56,490
I don't know how we survived without good.

4440

4441
02:04:57,101 --> 02:04:58,320

No,

4443
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:00,180
nobody had figured that out.

4444
02:05:00,181 --> 02:05:01,230
