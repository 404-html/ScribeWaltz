1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,520
Five four,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,533
three,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,553
two,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,743
one.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,283
Legit.

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,610
Hello Bill.

7
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,090
Hey Man.

8
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,830
What's going on here?

9
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,590
You are here with a book.

10
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,470
You got a book of Shit.

11
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,760
I got to come prepared.

12
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:16,211
I mean,

13
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:16,361
yeah,

14
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:16,991
I'm trying to write,

15
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:18,220
I'm trying to get back into handwriting.

16
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,940
Uh,

17
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,930
for people don't know.

18
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:24,010
Bill is the CEO and cofounder of mines.com
and we've been going back and forth

19
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,310
through email and you got hoax by
some dude who said he was Joey Diaz.

20
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,563
It did happen.

21
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,351
He really believed you.

22
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,850
Like Joey's been on my
network and I'm like,

23
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,580
he was messaging me,

24
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,560
messaging me in Joey's voice.

25
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,260
Like basically cloning it.

26
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,510
Like there's weird people out there,

27
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:38,640
man.

28
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,130
Yeah.

29
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,030
Well that's not hard to do.

30
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,281
Yeah.

31
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:41,114
You know?

32
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,490
Yeah.

33
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,480
And watched enough Joey just cloning his,

34
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,403
his tweets.

35
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,220
Yeah,

36
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,670
yeah,

37
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,503
yeah,

38
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:46,901
yeah.

39
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:48,970
Every Monday morning or so there's a,

40
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,640
there's a tweet about someone
needs to suck your Dick.

41
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,463
That's it.

42
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,570
They need to suck your Dick.

43
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,404
You need a lot of no,

44
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,843
that's uh,

45
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,983
on the regular.

46
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,321
Um,

47
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,250
what's the notes man?

48
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,510
Just some ramblings from this morning.

49
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,620
Yeah.

50
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,453
Yeah.

51
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,361
Important stuff.

52
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,710
It's actually the first thing that I,

53
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:09,340
uh,

54
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,540
I've written in this notebook.

55
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,800
I've not been doing handwriting
lunch at all in the last years,

56
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,720
probably mostly digital,

57
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,540
which is not good because I
actually majored in English.

58
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,471
So yeah,

59
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,630
you definitely lose your
ability to write words.

60
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,051
It's funny,

61
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,400
I tried riding in,

62
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:24,910
um,

63
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,150
uh,

64
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,310
for whatever reason I
wrote mostly in all caps,

65
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,010
you know,

66
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,650
cause I just mostly just write notes.

67
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,860
But I tried writing with like lowercase
letters and then I tried writing in

68
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,750
cursive and my cursive is like,

69
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,700
it's almost like I have to relearn it.

70
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,290
Yeah.

71
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,350
I was finding and just like trailing
off at the end of certain words.

72
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,790
But I blended all together.

73
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,020
He what?

74
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,840
I blended all together with
capital and lower case o.

75
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,620
Why you do that?

76
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,951
I mean,

77
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,200
well just as a normal
person would proper grammar.

78
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,470
I thought you were just
mixing them up randomly.

79
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:53,760
No,

80
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,990
no.

81
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,520
Okay.

82
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,671
No,

83
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,540
I did write my,

84
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,020
uh,

85
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,440
college thesis in all lower case y hyped.

86
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,630
I don't read protesting.

87
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,081
Yeah,

88
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:02,550
kind of.

89
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,383
It was stupid.

90
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,421
It's like a cool move.

91
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:04,720
Right?

92
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,220
I'm not going to use any upper case.

93
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:06,731
Who Cares,

94
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,300
man.

95
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,300
There's weird like postmodern theory
about like capitalization and that's kind

96
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:13,361
of what I was talking about.

97
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:16,390
I got a little bit and doctrinated
at Ed Uvm to be really?

98
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:17,224
Yeah.

99
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,700
Yeah.

100
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,270
They're like,

101
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,660
they,

102
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,411
this one class,

103
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,244
it was called credit.

104
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,970
Which one is you?

105
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,803
What does Uvm,

106
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,260
Vermont.

107
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,640
Vermont,

108
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:23,990
yeah.

109
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,101
Oh,

110
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:24,934
Vermont is like,

111
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,480
yeah.

112
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,500
Super Social.

113
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,640
Justicey right.

114
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,450
And paved with good intentions.

115
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:30,671
Yeah.

116
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,350
Yeah.

117
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,000
So great ice cream up there
to [inaudible] nice folks.

118
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,300
But like this one class was
called critical theory and
we had to watch Buffy the

119
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:44,431
vampire slayer and apply like Marxist
theory to it to show how like it's the

120
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,770
rise up of the lower class.

121
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,940
It's like you're forced to write
these papers in like a certain way.

122
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:52,870
Yeah.

123
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,703
Yeah.

124
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,910
What were they trying to prove?

125
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,401
Class,

126
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,150
division.

127
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,541
Class.

128
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,374
Division.

129
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,770
Yeah.

130
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,240
In Buffy the vampire slayer.

131
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,020
It's there.

132
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,550
There's like books and books written about
Buffy the vampire slayer and Marxism.

133
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:06,790
Yeah.

134
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,370
Come on.

135
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,960
Not Kidding.

136
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Railing.

137
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,273
Yep.

138
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,450
What do they have to say?

139
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,010
I don't remember to go into it.

140
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,470
It's amazing.

141
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,691
I mean,

142
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:16,901
I'm,

143
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,901
I'm sure you're aware of a James Lindsey
and Peter Boghossian and what does it

144
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,080
so Glen's name?

145
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,003
Yes.

146
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,270
Helen Shit,

147
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,440
I didn't meet her unfortunately.

148
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,753
Um,

149
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,760
the grievance studies hoaxes that they
submitted a bunch of a fake studies to

150
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,821
these journals and not only got reviewed
but got lauded and praised for their

151
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,960
academic scholarship.

152
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,741
Yeah.

153
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:46,741
That I think that standing from this
Guy Sokol who first trolled a lot of the

154
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,690
postmodern journals and he was the first,

155
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:53,140
and so it's called a socal hoax
to do that kind of trolling.

156
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,430
It's hard to figure out who's who.

157
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:54,821
Right.

158
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,200
It's hard to figure out what's the hoax.

159
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,670
I got a trick by that.

160
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,730
There's this one thing called the
postmodernism generator online.

161
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,170
It's a computer that writes articles
that puts all of this fancy language

162
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,880
together and I,

163
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,940
someone sent it to me and I showed
it to my teacher and I was like,

164
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,121
oh,

165
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,600
this is,

166
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,130
this is saying something
pretty interesting.

167
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,300
But it was,

168
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,230
it was horse shit.

169
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,093
Yeah.

170
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
What do you a,

171
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,353
you know,

172
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,520
what do you make of all this?

173
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,670
Hoaxing you've been hoaxed twice then you
just admitted in the first admitted to

174
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,504
the show.

175
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,641
I mean,

176
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,220
I think that you sort of
have to have the right to,

177
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,770
to hoax a hoax to be wrong,

178
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,210
to mess up.

179
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:31,901
Well,

180
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:32,830
that's not messing up.

181
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,970
That's deceiving people.

182
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,863
True.

183
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,650
Um,

184
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,660
but you kind of have the
right to do that too.

185
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,980
You kind of have the right to troll.

186
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,251
Yeah.

187
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,540
You don't have the right to impersonate,

188
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,430
but I have the right to
get trolled and be wrong.

189
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:45,581
Well,

190
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,010
you don't have the right to impersonate.

191
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,850
Like you can't have a verified account.

192
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,840
Pretend you'd Joey Diaz.

193
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,321
Oh no,

194
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,130
of course not.

195
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,680
But harmless trolling
like that guy did to you.

196
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,290
Isn't that kind of like part of freedom?

197
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,070
Yeah,

198
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,520
yeah,

199
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,950
yeah.

200
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,320
Just comes down this info from
social networks because it's wrong.

201
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,940
That doesn't make sense.

202
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,300
It,

203
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,710
it,

204
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,531
it also depends on,

205
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:06,364
does that make sense?

206
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,623
I mean

207
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,290
like if someone is purposely,

208
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,861
okay,

209
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,780
let's say that you find some Chinese
bought that's purposely disseminating

210
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,140
incorrect and negative information
about maybe a potential presidential

211
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,260
candidate.

212
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Let's pick one Tulsi Gabbert there
are disseminating fake news about her.

213
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,820
And you know for sure that it's fake,

214
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:31,950
you know for sure who the,

215
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,981
I don't know how you know,

216
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,660
but you know for sure
who the source of it is.

217
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
You don't think that should be taken down?

218
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,580
I think that if it's illegal
it should be taken down.

219
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,300
If it's illegal.

220
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,110
Yeah.

221
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,650
Okay.

222
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,320
But it was just lies then.

223
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,310
That could be illegal.

224
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm not a lawyer so I,

225
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:52,341
I'm trying to position the network or
just like advocate for other networks to

226
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,150
take more of a neutral stance.

227
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,400
There's this cool thing
called the Manila principles,

228
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,120
which the Electronic Frontier Foundation
wrote with a bunch of other Internet

229
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,990
freedom groups,

230
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,950
which is talking about how
digital and intermediaries should,

231
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,570
shouldn't be making subjective decisions
about what's getting taken down and

232
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,250
should require a court order now
with a DNS provider or you know,

233
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,480
something less content focused,

234
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,690
playing DNS to people don't know.

235
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,010
We don't like a domain name.

236
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,310
So explain what that is.

237
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,180
It's like where you buy
domain and you know,

238
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,340
but for a soldier now or
we're hosting tons of content,

239
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,330
so it's harder for us because
we see illegal content in it.

240
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
We should proactively take some of
it down if we know it's illegal,

241
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,830
but at the same time,

242
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,750
you know it's just slippery.

243
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,391
Well,

244
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,970
I follow quite a few people who have a,

245
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,301
I want to,

246
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,590
I don't want to say
they have hoax accounts,

247
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,450
but they have parody accounts and they,

248
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,560
and you know a lot of people read into
it wrong and think they're being honest

249
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,420
and argue with them like a,

250
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:54,910
there's a,

251
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,960
there's progressive dad
guy on Instagram your fall,

252
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,180
him know exactly what
you're talking about.

253
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,650
This hilarious when I fall it too.

254
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,484
That's pretty funny.

255
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,140
I follow quite a few of them.

256
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:07,440
There was a guy who was the wrong skin
guy who was saying he was born in the

257
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,310
wrong color skin,

258
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:13,290
that he's trans racial and he would make
these ridiculous arguments about it and

259
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,280
Elwick.

260
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,911
What was his name?

261
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:15,980
He apparently is a comic.

262
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,050
I was just thinking of this,

263
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,100
this sort of star,

264
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,401
a couple,

265
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,930
I don't know the moment they had to do it,

266
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:24,100
but let's say four years ago a lot of
those troll accounts had to sort of say,

267
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,260
we're not this person.

268
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,861
For instance,

269
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,310
the one main one I follow is a,

270
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:28,990
is now,

271
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,700
now it's known as not Bill Walton.

272
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,880
He tweets funny sports jokes all night
long after like what's on TV as though

273
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,061
he's Bill Walton,

274
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,894
Mike and Bill Walton.

275
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,160
But like at some point he had to put in
the name like this is not bill Walton,

276
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,700
but still has quite a few
followers and he's still,

277
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,880
he still gets the jokes out,

278
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:46,290
but

279
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:46,810
that's from,

280
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,100
yeah.

281
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,040
Well what's your stance on people
who make accounts of your stuff?

282
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,000
Put it out there?

283
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,481
Well,

284
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,560
I got with a lot of them,

285
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,650
you know,

286
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,480
um,

287
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,261
there's a ton of them.

288
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:57,090
Some of them actually do good stuff.

289
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,360
Like they make little clips and they put
those clips online and it's actually,

290
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,320
it's good.

291
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,760
It's good for people enjoy the show.

292
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:07,410
They get a little one minute snippet of
things and then some of them just will

293
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:10,860
pretend to be me and contact people
and try to book them on the show,

294
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:11,880
which is really weird.

295
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,900
Oh yeah,

296
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,763
I've had that.

297
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,383
Um,

298
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,231
but you know,

299
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:16,441
I mean,

300
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:16,891
who is that?

301
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,900
Is that a 16 year old kid in Indiana?

302
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:19,081
I mean,

303
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,630
who is that?

304
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,463
It's uh,

305
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,653
it's odd.

306
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,141
It's,

307
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:26,670
but it's overall like get
past my own personal feelings.

308
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,310
Uh,

309
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,630
because,

310
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:27,990
uh,

311
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,920
because it's about me,

312
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,813
it's interesting.

313
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,201
This is the,

314
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:31,501
you know,

315
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:32,200
this,

316
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,510
this strange new ground
that we're covering.

317
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,241
You know,

318
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,410
mean we've been discussing this ad
nauseum on the podcast lately that

319
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,440
essentially we've been dealing with 20
years of this and in those 20 years it's

320
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:46,950
changed radically.

321
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:47,250
I mean,

322
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,150
what it is,

323
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,610
it's become something
completely different.

324
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,290
It's become something that changes
public opinion on things overnight.

325
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,460
It's

326
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,390
become something where you can
distribute information from,

327
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,320
you know,

328
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,510
person to person about some,

329
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,150
you know,

330
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,350
huge international news event.

331
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,690
You could get all of your
information from Twitter,

332
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,850
whether it's what happened
in Venezuela or what,

333
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,361
you know,

334
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,710
anywhere there's something in the world.

335
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,500
You,

336
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,330
your people are turning to social media
almost before they're turn anywhere

337
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,100
you're looking.

338
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,320
I,

339
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,561
you know,

340
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:19,770
I,

341
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,880
when I hear about something,

342
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:21,840
I almost always,

343
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,250
before I even Google it,

344
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,940
I almost always go to Twitter
and check Twitter and you know,

345
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,930
and see what's going on.

346
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,120
And she had us that go at duck duck,

347
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:30,600
go.

348
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,380
Have you heard of that one?

349
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,581
No,

350
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:31,950
it's at,

351
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,660
it's like a privacy focused search engine.

352
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,490
It's like pretty much the only
privacy alternative to Google.

353
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,710
It's like this idea that we say,

354
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,573
I'll just Google it.

355
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,911
Right.

356
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,360
Why do we,

357
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I mean our whole process has been to
like purge proprietary surveillance tools

358
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:54,261
from our company and I've been trying
to get myself like getting off Facebook,

359
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,110
getting off Twitter,

360
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,340
getting off Instagram.

361
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,160
It's just like there's so abusive to
everybody and it's like there's brilliant

362
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:02,910
people who work there.

363
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,870
I mean Instagram is such a well
designed app or you can beautiful,

364
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
but so what do you think is
abusive about it particularly?

365
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,600
There's start with Twitter.

366
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,280
They're all the same.

367
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,840
They're all the same.

368
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,360
Yeah.

369
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,470
Do you think they're all the same?

370
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,870
Because they're all gigantic businesses.

371
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,180
Yeah.

372
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,440
And they're all the same because none
of them share their source code and they

373
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:29,850
all spy on everybody and they don't
show you what is happening behind the

374
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,151
scenes.

375
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,440
They don't show you
what the code is doing.

376
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,030
So like in that,

377
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,290
in that note I wrote to the other day,

378
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,440
it's like I compare it to
like food transparency.

379
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,293
You know,

380
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,360
50 years ago nobody thought about that.

381
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,610
And then 20 years ago everyone's like,

382
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,440
I want to know what's in my food white.

383
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,360
But why wouldn't you want
to know what's in your apps?

384
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,740
Yeah,

385
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,650
I mean it's super sketchy
what they're doing,

386
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,500
but how so like what,

387
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,141
what supers can,

388
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:55,830
I don't know.

389
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,740
But we know that they're
spying on everyone and
tracking you everywhere you go.

390
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,770
They're targeting things at
you based on physical location,

391
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,030
browser history,

392
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,650
even when you're not on those websites,

393
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,720
some of their falling around where
you're going in the Internet.

394
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,260
Right.

395
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,260
And so some people except that for this
free search engine would free email and

396
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,130
things along those lines.

397
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,480
The PSAP except the fact that a certain
percentage of what they're doing is not

398
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,380
going to be private,

399
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,850
or at least their searches are not going
to be probably like say if you circle

400
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,270
you thinking about buying a
jeep and you searched jeeps,

401
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,641
you look at,

402
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:26,881
you know,

403
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:31,680
2019 jeep and then all of a sudden
all your Google ads are about jeeps,

404
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,290
right?

405
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,611
They'll like,

406
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:33,570
we know,

407
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,750
we know you thinking about the jeep
bill and I don't think that that makes

408
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,500
people want to spend more
time on Google and Facebook.

409
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,550
If fruity he does.

410
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,570
Do you think it freaks them out?

411
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,050
I think that we're just numb
to it and so we accept it,

412
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,610
but I think it's more that.

413
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,601
Yeah.

414
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:53,601
And so there's all different
layers of like what we use

415
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,950
with your browsers,

416
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,180
your apps,

417
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,650
your operating system,

418
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,970
your food,

419
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,050
your,

420
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,350
you know,

421
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,183
government,

422
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,181
your energy.

423
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:09,181
Like all of this technology has
code that's associated with it.

424
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,433
So,

425
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,440
and when you open up your computer,

426
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,640
when you sign into a browser,

427
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,750
when you open up an app,

428
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,340
you are empowering that APP.

429
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,160
That's how the apps of
the world become huge,

430
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,210
monstrous corporations.

431
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,600
This because we all use them every day.

432
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,310
Right?

433
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,990
So if you switch from,

434
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,050
you know,

435
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,480
oh at Macko s to like a new Lenox
or like Debbie and urban too,

436
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,000
if you use brave or Firefox,

437
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,340
if you um,

438
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,910
you know,

439
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,410
Duckduckgo is actually proprietary,

440
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:38,921
which is annoying,

441
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,630
but they are very privacy focused.

442
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,860
And then there's apps,

443
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,120
there's minds,

444
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,380
there's all sorts of,

445
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:48,010
there's other open source of decentralized
social networks out there that we can

446
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,420
potentially federate with.

447
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,450
There's really cool new interesting
protocols like dat and IPFS that are like

448
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,570
more torn style backend.

449
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,590
So there's actually no servers in a
giant warehouse like Facebook and Google.

450
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,270
It's more,

451
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,410
it's fully peer to peer and we're trying
to balance it because it's not like

452
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,680
decentralization equals good
and centralization equals bad.

453
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,430
But like,

454
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,761
you know,

455
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,850
in order to get a suite
app like Instagram style,

456
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,760
you need servers to like process video.

457
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:22,180
And so the tech is still sort of
immature in the fully peer to peer,

458
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:22,520
like,

459
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,780
you know,

460
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,940
bitcoin style internet.

461
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,710
But we're definitely getting there.

462
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,770
And I just think it's important for people
to use things that are transparent to

463
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,330
them and respecting our freedom.

464
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:34,961
Yeah.

465
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:38,290
I think one of the problems with these
giant companies is that once they become

466
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:38,741
big,

467
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,360
he kind of used them as a default.

468
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,120
And it's very difficult to get people
to communicate with you off of them.

469
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,700
You know?

470
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:43,960
It's,

471
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,890
it's a hard to say,

472
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,401
hey man,

473
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:45,601
I'm,

474
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm launching this new social media APP.

475
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
I would imagine you could speak to this.

476
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,690
I'm launching this new
social media APP and,

477
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,110
uh,

478
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,100
I want you to join it.

479
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,350
People like put them
already on fucking Facebook.

480
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,310
I'm already on Google.

481
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,110
I'm Ernie on Instagram.

482
00:13:59,111 --> 00:13:59,980
I don't want to do that,

483
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,670
man.

484
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,360
It's too much,

485
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,110
too much extra.

486
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,650
And we make it a million times harder
for ourselves because we're not scooping

487
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:05,820
it

488
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,130
people's contacts and,

489
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,610
you know,

490
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,600
taking all their information.

491
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,140
You are not,

492
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,910
we're minds.

493
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,121
No.

494
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:11,370
Okay.

495
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,940
So like when you give your
address book to a App,

496
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,953
who does that?

497
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,750
Every most apps would be,

498
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:18,660
you've gotta be an Asshole,

499
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,980
you know?

500
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,231
But no,

501
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:19,980
but when you say,

502
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,131
oh,

503
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:23,370
I want to find my friends who are on
this app and you share your contacts,

504
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,360
we not supposed to do that.

505
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,621
You're not supposed to do that.

506
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:25,860
Yeah.

507
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,660
But most people do.

508
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,421
And you know,

509
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:30,810
your friends didn't give you permission
to give Facebook their phone number.

510
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:31,644
Do you do that?

511
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,970
I probably used to like

512
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,781
seven,

513
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:35,261
eight years ago,

514
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:35,481
whatever.

515
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:36,310
But don't do it anymore.

516
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,760
I always say the same thing
when it pops up kit though.

517
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,910
Fuck Outta here.

518
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,080
That's always what I say.

519
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,110
Would you like to share your,

520
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:42,970
your contacts?

521
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,830
Get the fuck Outta here.

522
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,251
No,

523
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,630
you can't have my contacts.

524
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,171
You asshole.

525
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,010
I know what you're doing.

526
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,140
Facebook is weird one man.

527
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,003
It's so,

528
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,160
it's such a sneaky

529
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,930
one.

530
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,420
You know,

531
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,800
Facebook and it,

532
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,161
you know,

533
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:55,971
like all this,

534
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:56,370
uh,

535
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,230
the,

536
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,860
the congressional hearings and
the inner workings of it all.

537
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:05,861
And w there the fact that
it profits off of outrage.

538
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,010
So it wants people to argue like the,

539
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:10,791
the Ai,

540
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,791
the computer learning specifically wants
people to have like contentious debates

541
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,684
about things.

542
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,810
Cause that keeps their eyes
focused on the website.

543
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,390
And if your eyes are focused on Facebook,

544
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:23,871
you know,

545
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,180
then those Facebook ads are very valuable.

546
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,710
It's really fascinating,

547
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,544
man.

548
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,940
I think the outrage is
unavoidable on any network.

549
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,960
It's more,

550
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,130
you know,

551
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,040
are you gonna are you going to take
down there taking down outrage,

552
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,440
Tom?

553
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,631
Yeah,

554
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:39,080
sure.

555
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,531
So,

556
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:44,390
and it just seems so inconsistent
and subjective how they're applying.

557
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:44,631
I mean,

558
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,650
even just yesterday,

559
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:46,490
I think some,

560
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:46,970
uh,

561
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,280
journalists got banned from Facebook.

562
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,020
Yeah.

563
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,290
Let me,

564
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm going to send this to you Jamie.

565
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:52,910
Cause it's,

566
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,910
it's a really crazy one because they
wanted her to show who her funding sources

567
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:02,630
were and I didn't even know that there
was an area where you could show that.

568
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:04,970
So it's almost like they're
making this up as they go along.

569
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:05,930
Yeah.

570
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,760
Kyle Kalinsky sent me this today.

571
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,990
I'm going to send this to you right now.

572
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:09,351
Jamie.

573
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,460
Hang on one second.

574
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,273
Oh,

575
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,411
hold on.

576
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,340
I'm a very quiet,

577
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,650
unfortunately this is an audio show,

578
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,730
but it's alive there.

579
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,540
Yes.

580
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,373
Not Dead Air.

581
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,920
There you go.

582
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,191
Okay,

583
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:24,461
buddy.

584
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,294
I just sent it to you.

585
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,020
Okay.

586
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,530
Uh,

587
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,250
Facebook suspended in the now tweets,

588
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,750
uh,

589
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,750
page at the behest of CNN and the
u s government funded think tanks.

590
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,260
Says we had almost 4 million subscribers,

591
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,240
did not violate Facebook rules were
given no warning and Facebook isn't

592
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,200
responding to us.

593
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,121
So yeah.

594
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:46,600
What is,

595
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,433
what was the,

596
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,170
what it would actually started this off?

597
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,063
I mean,

598
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,570
who knows?

599
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,570
They don't communicate with anyone.

600
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,030
They've been banning
legit accounts for years.

601
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,330
They,

602
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,380
you cannot even send a mines.com the link
through Facebook messenger right now.

603
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,214
It's blocked.

604
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,820
What?

605
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,350
Yeah,

606
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,183
whites,

607
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,850
if you post in the newsfeed,

608
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:07,684
it says,

609
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,770
careful,

610
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,470
this could be an unsecure website.

611
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,143
Oh,

612
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,650
just I clicked on a link from TMZ
yesterday and got the same thing from on

613
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:17,950
Twitter.

614
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,191
Twitter.

615
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,450
I said this might be malicious.

616
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,284
They're spam.

617
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,710
There could be from minds.

618
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,930
No,

619
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,480
it's from Tia.

620
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,201
TMZ Link.

621
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:26,150
It was clicking this like this
story is on TMZ here to us.

622
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,720
You the,

623
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,670
the rest of the story.

624
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,950
So they're trying to keep
you from going to TMZ.

625
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,220
Yeah.

626
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,990
I don't know why it was the
first time I've ever seen that.

627
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,843
Huh.

628
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,190
Huh.

629
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,420
It's probably caught up in some algorithm
and I sent an actual written letter to

630
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:38,800
Facebook about it.

631
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:39,670
Obviously I don't get back.

632
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,440
And then there's no human written letter.

633
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,080
He wrote it with a piece of paper
known now that would have been cool.

634
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:44,920
I sign it with ink,

635
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,720
but really we had no cars.

636
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,000
Our lawyer said to you,

637
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,050
that actually proves that
you sent them something,

638
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,610
some sort of diligence,

639
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,270
but there's just no recourse
and it's their lost.

640
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,010
So explain.

641
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,750
So if someone is trying
to say on Facebook master,

642
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,330
Hey,

643
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,020
you should go check out minds.com
they won't let you post that link now.

644
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,400
And what is their excuse?

645
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,811
They don't tell you.

646
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:13,050
You know,

647
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,501
they don't tell you.

648
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,750
So is it because you're
competing social media network?

649
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,291
I don't know.

650
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,670
I don't want to get into,

651
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,010
I don't know.

652
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,520
You don't know?

653
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm not going to say,

654
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,350
just know that it does.

655
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,040
Yeah.

656
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,460
Yeah.

657
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,510
You don't know why it does,

658
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:24,871
but you know,

659
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:25,171
it doesn't,

660
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,220
they're calling us unsecure and I'm
pretty sure that Facebook got hacked.

661
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,333
You know,

662
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,770
they compromise everybody's data.

663
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:31,891
Like,

664
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,360
do you want to talk about unsecure?

665
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,110
There's no more unsecure site that exists.

666
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,681
It is kind of funny,

667
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:40,981
right?

668
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,460
I mean after those hearings and uh,

669
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,460
after all the,

670
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,180
uh,

671
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,140
the Russia stuff,

672
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,401
yeah.

673
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,030
It's um,

674
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,040
it is kind of funny calling
somebody else on secure.

675
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,180
Yeah,

676
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,080
they're insecure.

677
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,520
Mark Zuckerberg was very insecure.

678
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,730
Well,

679
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,200
he's also stupid rich.

680
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,921
He,

681
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:56,280
um,

682
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,580
he seems like he's too rich.

683
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:58,470
Like he fucked up.

684
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,940
Like he's there sipping water,

685
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,610
like a robot trying to figure out what
the fuck he's doing with his life.

686
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I think that they're scared because they
know they've betrayed everybody and so

687
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,480
it's hard to get them to speak.

688
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:10,710
You know,

689
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,700
it was interesting with,

690
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,500
with Dorsey here because I,

691
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:13,890
you know,

692
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,360
give him credit for speaking,

693
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,960
but the fact is that he's not
answering the question well,

694
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,750
he's bringing someone else in to answer
the questions in the next go round.

695
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,090
And so that should be very interesting.

696
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,660
He actually didn't know the
answer to those questions.

697
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,690
I think he probably doesn't know all
the specifics because he's a CEO of not

698
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,241
one,

699
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,650
but two different corporations,

700
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,990
these busy shit and also Richard,

701
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,330
but true.

702
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,980
But I think that when we look at the
policy that exists on these networks,

703
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,980
like he is in control of
the policy to large degree,

704
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,420
there's a board decision,

705
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,710
there's a decision making process,

706
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:50,970
but he has a large voice.

707
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,330
Okay.

708
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,310
I don't know how large his voices,

709
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,600
I assume that's probably true,

710
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,530
but one of the things we did detail on
the last podcast with Tim Pool was how he

711
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,560
wasn't the CEO for quite a long
time fired and then rehired it.

712
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:02,310
Yeah.

713
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,551
Yeah.

714
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:02,911
So,

715
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,570
um,

716
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,670
obviously there's some contention,

717
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,210
there's some issues and you know,

718
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,000
there's a,

719
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,980
it's a lot of money involved in these
things and I think that plays a giant part

720
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,930
and how they decide to make decisions and,

721
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
but do you think that an
advertiser in reality doesn't like,

722
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,100
say you're an advertiser and you
want to advertise your computer.

723
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

724
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,960
And there's a video on youtube that
is about something controversial.

725
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Does it actually make sense for that
advertiser to not show their product on

726
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,610
that controversial video?

727
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,350
Don't they want to sell computers?

728
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,341
Uh,

729
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,180
well it depends.

730
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:39,541
I mean,

731
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,950
if the controversial videos are about
how Jews are evil and you have this video

732
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,980
about Jews being evil and then you know,

733
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,340
you're like by razor computers come on.

734
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,270
Right?

735
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,070
But do you think that people actually,

736
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,810
I can understand not wanting to support
certain types of content and maybe

737
00:20:55,811 --> 00:21:00,811
advertisers feel like they're supporting
that content by advertising next to it.

738
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,100
But I also don't think that people,

739
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,450
when they're watching a controversial
video on the Internet say,

740
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,493
oh my gosh,

741
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,333
you know,

742
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,870
this advertiser is completely out of
line for being next to this controversial

743
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:14,051
thing.

744
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:14,261
I,

745
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,250
I don't think that's a,

746
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,140
a healthy direction to move.

747
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,381
Well,

748
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:17,650
okay,

749
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,640
that's one way to look at it.

750
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,750
Another way to look at it is if you
are a giant company that sells things,

751
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,510
let's say you're Toyota
and you're selling Tundras,

752
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,770
you don't want your Tundras
to be associated in any
way with something that you

753
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:30,760
might think is negative.

754
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,660
It's their prerogative.

755
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,060
If they're paying for advertising,

756
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,090
they can kind of decide.

757
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,580
This is one of the things that's leading,

758
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,540
um,

759
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,010
youtube and specific,

760
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,173
and I've had

761
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,940
a ton of conversations about this there.

762
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,010
It's leading them specifically to
try to monetize things that could be

763
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:54,010
considered distasteful or
insensitive or controversial.

764
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,910
And it's very frustrating to content
creators when you talk to them.

765
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,170
They're essentially saying that they need
to do better and that their tools are

766
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,070
very blunt,

767
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,440
that they don't really have the correct
computer learning tools to figure out

768
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,120
what is offensive and why.

769
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,740
And then there's a human review system,

770
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:15,310
which is very weird and we've
run into that many times.

771
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,791
We're like,

772
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:20,080
we'll have like a podcast with like
say Tom Papa who's an uncontroversial

773
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,770
fantastic standup comedian and it's
like demonetized and then we're like,

774
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,131
why?

775
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:24,880
What happened?

776
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,331
And then we go,

777
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,530
what the fuck can we talk about?

778
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:27,790
We didn't talk about anything crazy.

779
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,300
And it's really damaging for brands
when it gets the monetize right away.

780
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:34,660
Cause it's that initial time period
that generates the most revenue.

781
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,050
Yeah.

782
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,760
So when you have to go back and do it,

783
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,110
I mean,

784
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,150
so I agree with that,

785
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,540
but so we built a tool that's like
a peer to peer advertising tool.

786
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,950
So it's not,

787
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,940
there's two options.

788
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:50,941
You can say you earn crypto
for your contributions and
then which Cryptos do you

789
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:52,121
support?

790
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,340
We have an ethereum based token,

791
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,350
but we're going to support all of them.

792
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,270
So what is a theory on base token?

793
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,830
So it's an Erc 20 token.

794
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,460
What does that mean?

795
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,800
It means that we basically reward
people for all of their activities.

796
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,190
Okay,

797
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,990
so let's say if Jamie's
posted on mines and uh,

798
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,220
people love his posts,

799
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,020
he gets rewarded in some,

800
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,950
yeah.

801
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,783
How much?

802
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,390
How much again?

803
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,223
Well,

804
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,680
can I go buy one token will
give you a thousand impressions.

805
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,340
Oh,

806
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,530
so you were not focused on like,

807
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:20,711
oh,

808
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,480
you're going to make money from this one.

809
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,870
We're saying one token will give you
a thousand impressions or you get a

810
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,740
thousand impressions from,

811
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,860
you get a token from 1000 impressions
want when you use a token to advertise on

812
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,100
mine.

813
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,490
Oh,

814
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,280
you get a thousand impressions
when you boost your posts with it.

815
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,910
So wait a minute.

816
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,460
If you use the Crypto,

817
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,990
you use a token.

818
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,700
You guarantee views.

819
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,270
Yeah.

820
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,990
Well that's word,

821
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,500
isn't it?

822
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,333
Why?

823
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,761
Well,

824
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,580
you're guaranteeing people see something.

825
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,300
Well,

826
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,133
we,

827
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,920
when you boosted it gets fed to
people's newsfeed chronologically,

828
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,281
right?

829
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:57,440
I say so there's just a backlog.

830
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,890
So sort of like when Instagram
has a sponsored posts,

831
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,630
except we're not spying on people to,

832
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,880
when we send them Instagram
Spaz on people to mine.

833
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,570
Yeah.

834
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,430
I don't know man.

835
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm stupid.

836
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,120
Help me out.

837
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,953
It's,

838
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,240
yes they do.

839
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,640
And the thing is we just don't know.

840
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,750
So this is where free and open
source software is just essential.

841
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,370
Like the big networks,

842
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,080
there's no excuse for them not
to be sharing their software.

843
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,530
Right.

844
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,830
It's like when you're a
public forum on that scale,

845
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,640
the community just has a right to
know what the algorithms are doing.

846
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,720
So you think that they're not sharing
their software because their software is

847
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,460
encoded and designed to spy on you
and extract information and sell that

848
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:41,294
information?

849
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,300
Partially like when Jamie
gives up your contacts,

850
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,430
when he signs up for an APP and he says,

851
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:47,240
yes,

852
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
you can get access to all my contacts.

853
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,620
There's a lot of reason and they don't
want people to compete with them.

854
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,320
Like anyone could actually take all
of our code and make their own social

855
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,280
network and compete with us.

856
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,240
They could set up on their own
servers and we encourage that.

857
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:02,000
That's what like the Fed averse is called.

858
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,190
That's what Elon Musk does with Tesla.

859
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,980
All of his electric
patents for electric cars.

860
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,540
I think that he opened up the pants.

861
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,374
I don't think if he,

862
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,880
he opened sourced all the,

863
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,160
the code of the car.

864
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,551
Right.

865
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:17,330
He's definitely in moving in the right
direction of like he wants to build the

866
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,164
market.

867
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,950
Yes.

868
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,570
And he also wants to save the world.

869
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:23,150
I mean he legitimately
has any also house shit,

870
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,890
load of money and just got enough money.

871
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,880
Yeah,

872
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,240
that's,

873
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,980
I think that's a big
factor with those guys.

874
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,620
But don't,

875
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,620
don't you think that it's almost like
it's going to help whatever network does

876
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:37,100
that Oh is more transparent,

877
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,750
stop spying on people.

878
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,280
Is More community run and evolved.

879
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,000
Wouldn't that be the network that you
would think humanity would want to stick

880
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,440
with in the long term?

881
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,880
Like wouldn't that be a good move of them?

882
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,230
Yes and no.

883
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,640
For the average person.

884
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,570
What are they losing when they
get on Facebook or Google?

885
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,310
What are the what?

886
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,210
What's bad?

887
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,250
What happens now their
legs are going down,

888
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,430
everybody's likes are going down
and that makes everyone very sad.

889
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,300
What do you mean?

890
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,451
Well,

891
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,261
the algorithms,

892
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:11,261
you're only reaching 5% of your own
followers organically on Facebook now,

893
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,110
and they're starting to change the
chronological feed on Instagram too.

894
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,150
And they know that this causes depression
and they're still doing it because

895
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:22,220
they know that the,

896
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,790
you know,

897
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,540
they're,

898
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,890
they think they're better at showing you
what you want to see than you are and

899
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,850
they want to make money from it.

900
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,490
What do you mean by they know
that this causes depression?

901
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,760
They've done studies about
mental health in relation to,

902
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:41,921
actually Facebook got exposed like five
years ago for doing a secret study on

903
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:46,650
like a few million users where they were
injecting both positive and negative

904
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:50,490
content into the newsfeed and they proved
that they could affect people's moods.

905
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,100
This was with Princeton and there's
a huge backlash and they're like,

906
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,251
oh,

907
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:54,084
sorry.

908
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,583
Whoops.

909
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,301
Right.

910
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:00,780
But this isn't of injecting
negative or positive content.

911
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:05,760
This is just moving these images or
these posts around so that less people

912
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,190
[inaudible] there's two
different topics there.

913
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,640
The basic news feed on Facebook is now
a mysterious conglomeration of thousands

914
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,020
of variables,

915
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,010
which we don't know.

916
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,060
And,

917
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,080
but additionally,

918
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:19,950
like a few years ago,

919
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:24,951
they were exposed for having been
experimenting with people's brains.

920
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,341
That's right.

921
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,360
I remember that now.

922
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,610
I remember that now that that's right.

923
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,421
Yeah.

924
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:31,290
I remember thinking like,

925
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:31,591
wow,

926
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:32,424
that's kinda creepy.

927
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,280
[inaudible] on the people that are on
their site and they're not telling these

928
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,390
people that are experimenting on them.

929
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,290
Yeah.

930
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,070
But do they,

931
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,903
I mean,

932
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,950
if they're trying to make it better,

933
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,150
um,

934
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,470
do you think that they're really,

935
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,750
that's a factor that it acts,

936
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,660
it actually mean how does it
cause depression if they're just,

937
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,890
if your images or your posts are
not being seen as by as many people

938
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,330
have you talked to kids posting on social
media and their reactions to how many

939
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,074
likes they're getting,

940
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,980
they get very,

941
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,993
very,

942
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,183
um,

943
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,153
concerned.

944
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,401
Well,

945
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:14,100
that seems like more
of a problem with that.

946
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,270
It is both.

947
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,841
It's not,

948
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,190
it is on both sides being
addicted to likes as some sort of,

949
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,024
uh,

950
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,720
you know,

951
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,480
to weird dope.

952
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah.

953
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,220
Right.

954
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,780
It's not healthy and no,

955
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,880
we need to learn to not care about that.

956
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,160
But I think that the core purpose of a
social network is to subscribe to someone

957
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:32,994
and see their stuff.

958
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,600
Yeah.

959
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,950
And when people subscribe to you,

960
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,270
they see your stuff,

961
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:36,990
right?

962
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,990
So when you spend years building up a
following on social media and say you earn

963
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,890
100,000 followers or something,

964
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,410
and then suddenly the network says,

965
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,190
mm,

966
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,023
Nah,

967
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,790
now your friends can't see that anymore.

968
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,680
That's not cool.

969
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:53,700
And,

970
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,690
and even to like Twitter's default
newsfeed is no longer chronological.

971
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,250
You have to click it to go chronological
and then it defaults back to their

972
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,270
weird algorithm thing.

973
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,440
So we're saying,

974
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:04,760
look,

975
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,730
a hundred percent organic,

976
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:06,391
chronological,

977
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,340
raw forever as default.

978
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,110
And then if you want to curate,

979
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,441
you know,

980
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,410
algorithms or have recommended
stuff come in as a alternative,

981
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,244
fine.

982
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,660
But that is the core purpose of social
media is to connect with people that

983
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,510
follow you and the other way around.

984
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,110
Do you think the purposes,

985
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,080
like why do you think Facebook would
decide to have things not in chronological

986
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:29,990
order and only be seen
by 5% of your followers?

987
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:32,270
Like what will it be the
benefit in that for them?

988
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,133
Revenue.

989
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,471
Revenue.

990
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,304
How so?

991
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,450
How's that generate revenue?

992
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,510
They just know that they can keep you
on the app better if you had less likes.

993
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,260
No.

994
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,100
If your your stuff seen by less people,

995
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:45,934
it doesn't make sense.

996
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,440
That's a good point.

997
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,270
It sort of works both ways.

998
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:54,271
I think that they think they know the
people that you're going to react to the

999
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:55,894
most.

1000
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,550
So as a consumer,

1001
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,900
when you're getting that content,

1002
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,290
you know the algorithms are showing
you what you typically like.

1003
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,124
Have you noticed that?

1004
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm really not paying much
attention but I don't believe you.

1005
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,280
So yeah,

1006
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,200
for Creator it's hurting creators.

1007
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,200
People who post are getting hurt.

1008
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,170
People who are sitting
there just scrolling.

1009
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,230
They're the ones who are really getting
addicted more so with the algorithms.

1010
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,890
So how are the people that
are posting getting hurt?

1011
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,270
They're getting hurt because their
stuff is being seen by last people.

1012
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,780
Yeah.

1013
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,650
Because it's not chronological and
it's an organic cause it's curated.

1014
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,820
Huh.

1015
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,540
But aren't they doing it because they
think it's going to be a better and a,

1016
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,400
an experience that's more
conducive to your life?

1017
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:40,270
That's what they say.

1018
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:40,871
What do you think?

1019
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:41,141
They're doing?

1020
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:46,141
A four then they're doing it because
they have studied through looking at the

1021
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,380
data,

1022
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,120
how to keep people on the APP more.

1023
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,661
Right.

1024
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:53,950
And that way is to give them like say if
I Google or if I look at muscle cars on

1025
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:54,910
Instagram now,

1026
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,320
if I go to my search,

1027
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,460
it's all muscle car stuff.

1028
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,750
So that's what it is.

1029
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:58,991
They say,

1030
00:30:58,991 --> 00:30:59,141
oh,

1031
00:30:59,141 --> 00:30:59,974
he likes that.

1032
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,640
So we're going to,

1033
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,870
we're just going to
give him a lot of that.

1034
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,900
And I think that's okay as an alternative
feed or to put that somewhere.

1035
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,270
I just think the core feed
always needs to stay pure.

1036
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,410
Hmm.

1037
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,840
Because otherwise you're just down the
slippery slope again and understand it's

1038
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:16,660
just feeding their,

1039
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,040
they're injecting things into
your head that you didn't ask for.

1040
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,590
Right.

1041
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,480
And they're doing it because
they want to keep you around.

1042
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,440
Yeah.

1043
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,273
That makes sense.

1044
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,810
Um,

1045
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,320
how many different companies
are subscribing to that is,

1046
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:34,321
it seems like all the big ones were saying
are curating and moving things around

1047
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:38,350
and all the big ones have an algorithm
that's designed to keep you on board.

1048
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,184
Right.

1049
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,080
And that's okay to pursue.

1050
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,050
I think there's really cool things you
can do with AI and machine learning and

1051
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:47,470
algorithms that is really beneficial,

1052
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,480
but it's just taking away people's reach
when they have worked years and years

1053
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:53,314
to achieve it.

1054
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,423
It's not okay.

1055
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,550
Do you think that this is this marriage
between something that is this social

1056
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:03,250
media network that's designed to allow
people to communicate with each other and

1057
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:05,500
then commerce like this business,

1058
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:07,210
like how do we maximize this business?

1059
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,920
How do we get more profit
out of this business?

1060
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,990
How do we get these people to engage more?

1061
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,580
And then they start monkeying with the
code and screw in with what you see and

1062
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,181
what you don't say.

1063
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,140
You think that's what's happening?

1064
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,310
Yeah.

1065
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,860
But in,

1066
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,410
in the short term it's probably working,

1067
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,170
but in the long term they're
betraying everybody's trust.

1068
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:24,970
It has to be more of a
consent based system.

1069
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,690
So you know,

1070
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,090
at least give people,

1071
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,990
well it should be a opt
out by default and find,

1072
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,980
give me messages to opt in so that
you can show me certain things.

1073
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:39,980
But this whole force forcing

1074
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,390
people into surveillance has,

1075
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,160
it just has to stop.

1076
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,510
It's,

1077
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,070
it's super scary.

1078
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,780
How's the super scared of you?

1079
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,030
It's just too much power.

1080
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,010
Yeah,

1081
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,620
it's too much power for something
that supposed to be silly,

1082
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:54,831
right?

1083
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,920
Like what was Facebook
supposed to supposed to be
some silly thing that you just

1084
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,480
can communicate with friends.

1085
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,560
It was,

1086
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,360
but from the beginning,

1087
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,871
all of these,

1088
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:06,560
none of these networks have ever really
been about the people of the networks.

1089
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,890
It's always been closed
source since the inception.

1090
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,330
So,

1091
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,730
but then you look at
open networks out there,

1092
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,593
you have Wikipedia,

1093
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,090
totally open source community.

1094
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,400
Ryan granted they have their
issues with moderation.

1095
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,263
Fine.

1096
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,350
But it's a top 10 website in the
world is totally open source,

1097
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,670
creative Commons content,

1098
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,190
incredible human achievement,

1099
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,683
bitcoin,

1100
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,770
open source money.

1101
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,250
Wordpress even is an open source CMS
system that is like powering 25% of the

1102
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:37,784
Internet.

1103
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,060
So why when that happened
with social media it should,

1104
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,350
I mean this way everyone's hanging out
so we should all sort of collectively

1105
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:46,184
even own it.

1106
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,680
We did a an equity crowdfunding round,

1107
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:53,120
so like thousands members of our
community actually on the site now.

1108
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,280
How many people are on mines?

1109
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,200
We have like a million
and a half registered,

1110
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,640
like quarter million active.

1111
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,301
Various we're,

1112
00:33:59,301 --> 00:33:59,471
we're,

1113
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,201
we're small.

1114
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:05,201
But the weird thing is that even
though we're a fraction of the size,

1115
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,130
especially smaller creators who come get
better reach on minds than they do on

1116
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,850
Facebook and Twitter because we have
this reward and incentive system sort of

1117
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:18,851
like gamified where you earn breach
and you earn more of a voice for

1118
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,494
contributing.

1119
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,680
So like you could have a account on
Twitter for 10 years in post thousands and

1120
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,740
thousands of tweets and you never hit
that viral nerve and you just never,

1121
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,480
never really get much exposure.

1122
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,660
So we're trying to help people be heard.

1123
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,440
And so you'll find a small creator who
on other networks has no followers,

1124
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,300
have thousands and thousands
of followers on mines.

1125
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,490
And what do you think you would like
to do with mines in the future that you

1126
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:47,480
haven't been able to do yet?

1127
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Engineer the control out of ourselves
so that we aren't even in a position to

1128
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,094
really,

1129
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,843
you know,

1130
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,940
take people's stuff down or who would
have someone in posts your house and your

1131
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:07,070
information where your kids go to school.

1132
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,660
I think that on the central
servers obviously yes,

1133
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,661
we're always going to moderate
and if it's legal it can stay.

1134
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,990
If it's not illegal it can't.

1135
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,853
But

1136
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
a decentralized social network is
definitely where we have to go because,

1137
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,970
and yeah.

1138
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,301
Okay.

1139
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:26,570
It's,

1140
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,260
it's scary.

1141
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,711
And you know,

1142
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:28,461
you've talked about this,

1143
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,620
like things are getting more transparent.

1144
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,700
Our lives is sort of like the
inevitable evolution of technology.

1145
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,541
I mean,

1146
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,620
how many hours a day
do you stream a couple,

1147
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,880
you know,

1148
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,970
25 years ago would you have
thought you'd be sharing,

1149
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:42,751
you know,

1150
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:45,510
20% of your life live streaming to,

1151
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:45,960
you know,

1152
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,300
millions of people like you're,

1153
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:50,310
our lives are becoming more transparent.

1154
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,320
Just inevitably it's just pulling us.

1155
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,281
Yeah,

1156
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:53,670
I agree.

1157
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,503
So,

1158
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,793
you know,

1159
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,780
bitcoin crypto,

1160
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,260
dat torn Stipe,

1161
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,720
torn type architecture.

1162
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,530
That is just where we're going
because it's more resilient,

1163
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,410
it's less censorship prone,

1164
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,540
there's just benefits of it.

1165
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,630
I think that we can bounce it
to like maybe when you post,

1166
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,190
you have a,

1167
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,023
a decision.

1168
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,140
Do you want to be able to
delete this at any point?

1169
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,431
All right,

1170
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:20,701
fine.

1171
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:21,990
Then you can post the central server.

1172
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,580
Do you want this to get unleashed?

1173
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,091
Yeah.

1174
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:26,520
It's scary because you know,

1175
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:27,660
they're scary stuff on the Internet.

1176
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,890
It's already like that.

1177
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,570
But you know,

1178
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,100
getting into censorship more.

1179
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,270
But does censorship even solve the
problem or does it make it worse?

1180
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,513
What problem?

1181
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,140
The problem of crazy content,

1182
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,430
illegal content does it,

1183
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,360
how could it make it worse?

1184
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,470
Well,

1185
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,040
I mean it seems like it can
often amplify radicalization

1186
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,901
definitely count,

1187
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,101
right?

1188
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:48,290
Yeah.

1189
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,561
Yeah.

1190
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:49,490
And it definitely,

1191
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:50,120
um,

1192
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,920
when you censor people,

1193
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,400
it just makes them aware that
there's plot against them too.

1194
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,660
Right?

1195
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,420
It's a lot of conservatives
on Twitter are finding that.

1196
00:36:59,421 --> 00:36:59,850
Some of the,

1197
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,580
Sam Harris actually
just sent me an article.

1198
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,020
Um,

1199
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,520
it was a detailing the bias against
conservatives on Twitter that they've

1200
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,473
actually done,

1201
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,790
you know,

1202
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,790
like some real studying it and it's pretty
demonstrated [inaudible] demonstrably

1203
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,460
it affects both the left
and the right wheel.

1204
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,500
Too much trouble.

1205
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,990
Yeah.

1206
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,890
The way I'm saying it wrong.

1207
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:19,491
Um,

1208
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:20,540
but it's,

1209
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,340
it affects the left
and the right for sure.

1210
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,811
Yeah,

1211
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:23,621
that's what Kyle was saying.

1212
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:26,680
I watched that video that he did and he
said it's antiestablishment that seems

1213
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,550
to be getting targeted.

1214
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,230
And so,

1215
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,441
you know,

1216
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:32,210
Abby's been censored on face
and I'd be willing to learn.

1217
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,393
Um,

1218
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,331
and yeah,

1219
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:35,370
this person today,

1220
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,650
I mean most of the stuff coming
out of our t is progressive,

1221
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,401
which is weird.

1222
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:43,180
And who knows what kind of games are
getting played behind the scenes with the

1223
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:43,541
rush.

1224
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,374
I mean,

1225
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,573
who knows?

1226
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,100
But the point is they
have a right to be there.

1227
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,641
And I mean,

1228
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,450
look at,

1229
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,860
this is not youtubes fault,

1230
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,810
but remember the youtube shooter,

1231
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,341
I mean,

1232
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:58,960
she thought she was getting censored on
Youtube and she went and brought a gun

1233
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,190
to the youtube headquarters.

1234
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,180
Like people get pissed
when they get censored.

1235
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,340
It affects you.

1236
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,001
Right.

1237
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:07,661
But in her case,

1238
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,330
you're talking about a crazy person
and loads of really being sensitive to

1239
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:10,840
people out there.

1240
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,110
Yeah.

1241
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,390
No,

1242
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,700
shoot.

1243
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,550
Shashi wasn't being,

1244
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,910
she was getting censored just like
everybody else is getting soft censored on

1245
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:16,744
these networks.

1246
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,321
Well,

1247
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,101
she just thought does,

1248
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:18,550
it wasn't,

1249
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,960
she didn't,

1250
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,150
wasn't getting promoted
the way she wanted to wait.

1251
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,630
I don't think anybody was
actively doing anything to her.

1252
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:26,980
I'm not saying that her stuff was 10
saying that the soft censorship of the

1253
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:27,850
algorithms,

1254
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:32,560
people getting demonetized this
has an impact on psychology.

1255
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,490
Okay.

1256
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,150
I see what you're saying.

1257
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,841
So it's,

1258
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:38,650
I'm saying they were
deliberately targeting her and
so horrible what happened,

1259
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,503
but

1260
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,813
yeah.

1261
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,270
Hmm.

1262
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,900
So what you're saying is that these
algorithms that they use in order to

1263
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:49,380
maximize their revenue and give
people things that they like,

1264
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,520
but actually takes away from things
being posted chronologically,

1265
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,430
keep certain things from
being seen by as many people.

1266
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,080
So it keeps him from being as viral,

1267
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,210
so keeps the whole thing
from being organic.

1268
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,130
Yeah.

1269
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:02,963
Yeah.

1270
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,803
Makes Sense.

1271
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,560
Yeah.

1272
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,891
It's,

1273
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:05,220
uh,

1274
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,600
it gets to that point where we're
realizing that all of these things,

1275
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:11,730
all these social media
things are really recent.

1276
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,140
We've only had them for a few years and
we don't necessarily know what the rules

1277
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:17,250
should or shouldn't be.

1278
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,390
So it's good.

1279
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,591
I mean,

1280
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,010
it's one of the reasons why
I wanted to have you on,

1281
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,300
I wanted to find out where these upstarts
or these new people are coming into

1282
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:24,691
the game.

1283
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:25,524
Like minds,

1284
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,620
like where you're coming
into the game from and what,

1285
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,910
what is your position on what's wrong
with the current state of affairs?

1286
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:33,931
Yeah.

1287
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:34,471
And look,

1288
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,710
there is messed up stuff on social media.

1289
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,963
Like I'm not,

1290
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,400
we'll get pigeonholed into being like,

1291
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,641
oh,

1292
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:42,900
you support all of this,

1293
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,160
this crazy stuff.

1294
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,150
First of all,

1295
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,160
most of the users on
mines are like artists,

1296
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:47,851
musicians,

1297
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:48,480
filmmakers,

1298
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,961
activists,

1299
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:49,561
journalists,

1300
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,000
just trying to get
their content out there.

1301
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,090
There's a very tiny
minority of like actually,

1302
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,810
you know,

1303
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,710
crazy content.

1304
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,720
But when you say crazy content,

1305
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:58,240
what do you mean?

1306
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,073
All right.

1307
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,940
Yeah.

1308
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,360
Yeah.

1309
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,991
Or I mean,

1310
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:04,140
I'm not even going to make decisions
on what is and isn't crazy.

1311
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,770
That's not,

1312
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,590
that's not my place,

1313
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,423
but

1314
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,950
the,

1315
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,610
it's been proven that
censorship is not the answer.

1316
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:15,840
I mean,

1317
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,200
look at the history of prohibition.

1318
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,190
Yeah.

1319
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,450
It's,

1320
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:19,840
it's,

1321
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
you have digital content,

1322
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,270
it's substances,

1323
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,133
it's,

1324
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,490
it's anything from people want information
and they want the ability to make the

1325
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,540
decision for themselves.

1326
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,800
They certainly do.

1327
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,880
And then the argument on the other
side is when people were distributing,

1328
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,350
and I'm going to use the big air quotes,

1329
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,790
hate speech,

1330
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,990
that's when it gets slippery to me
because who's to decide what's hate speech

1331
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:41,920
and what's not hate speech.

1332
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,071
I mean,

1333
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:45,610
I've seen people make some ridiculous
fucking statements about all sorts of

1334
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:49,510
people that are inaccurate and they do
that in order to categorize them and

1335
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:53,550
pigeonhole them and an easily
definable and dismissible care,

1336
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:53,890
uh,

1337
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,880
characterization,

1338
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,581
you know,

1339
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:56,530
and you just decide,

1340
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:56,771
hey,

1341
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:58,060
that Bill Ottman guy,

1342
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,710
that guy's a this.

1343
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,041
Oh,

1344
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,770
he's a radical that and
he believes in this,

1345
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,670
so fuck him.

1346
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,301
And they're like,

1347
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:04,721
okay,

1348
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:05,201
fuck cam,

1349
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:05,641
sweep more.

1350
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:05,761
I,

1351
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,600
and then cancel culture comes in like,

1352
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,770
we're going to cancel bill Ackman.

1353
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,390
We're not listening to him anymore.

1354
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,330
He lied to us about his source
or whatever the fuck you doing.

1355
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,310
Have you heard of Daryl Davis?

1356
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,641
No,

1357
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,474
I have not.

1358
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,020
Most,

1359
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,910
I forgot Dale Davis.

1360
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,580
Your boy.

1361
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,320
He's my boy.

1362
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,880
He,

1363
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,230
you'll,

1364
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,560
you'll,

1365
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,191
I haven't met him,

1366
00:41:21,191 --> 00:41:21,760
but he's,

1367
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,271
he's my boy.

1368
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,380
I want him to be my boy.

1369
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,740
So he is a black man who befriended
hundreds of members of the KKK and he got

1370
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:31,144
them all to leave.

1371
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,470
He got them to leave the kid.

1372
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,860
200

1373
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,640
members.

1374
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,390
Wow.

1375
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,380
After he was like,

1376
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,711
yeah,

1377
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,544
I'm just gonna talk to you

1378
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,430
really well.

1379
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Did you ever see the n a w Kamau Bell's
a show when he visited with those white

1380
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:46,310
supremacists?

1381
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,080
Not that specific one.

1382
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,511
Yeah,

1383
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:51,380
it was really good because
he's such a nice guy.

1384
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,260
He's so like easy to get along with that.

1385
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,600
They were like sort of like,

1386
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,920
they let the guard down
around them and you know,

1387
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:01,400
you get to see these people kind of
confused that they liked this guy.

1388
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,133
You know?

1389
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,950
That's why I think initiating human
contact via the social networks,

1390
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,930
like that's really important.

1391
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:13,730
But to play devil's advocate,

1392
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,410
it's one of the worst ways for people
to express themselves in a way where you

1393
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,520
consider other human beings experiences
and feelings and the way they're going

1394
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:24,860
to receive what you're saying
because there's no social cues.

1395
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:25,880
You're not interacting with them,

1396
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,320
you're not looking at them in the eyes.

1397
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,420
It's one of the weirder forms
of communication between
human beings and one that

1398
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:37,421
I would argue we have
not really necessarily a
successfully navigated it yet.

1399
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,130
I agree.

1400
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,630
I was actually saying that I think we
should use social media more to get people

1401
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,700
to get together in real life.

1402
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:47,991
Do you know who,

1403
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:48,350
uh,

1404
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,280
Megan Phelps's?

1405
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,390
No,

1406
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,931
she,

1407
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:51,201
uh,

1408
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:51,801
was a,

1409
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,530
with the Westboro Baptist Church.

1410
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,281
Uh,

1411
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:55,641
you know,

1412
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:56,030
the,

1413
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,271
the,

1414
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,130
the famous one that the protests
sows soldier's funerals and you know,

1415
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:01,231
and,

1416
00:43:01,231 --> 00:43:04,700
and anything gay and
they're like ruthlessly,

1417
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:07,700
viciously fundamental Christians were,

1418
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:08,661
you know,

1419
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:08,750
they,

1420
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,900
they do a lot of protesting at funerals
and do a lot of stuff to try to get,

1421
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,350
she was with them for the longest time
and then got on Twitter and through

1422
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:19,790
communicating on Twitter
when you meet her,

1423
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,420
you would never believe it in a
million years that she was ever this

1424
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:27,650
fundamentalist and that she was ever
some mean person sending hateful messages

1425
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:30,050
to people because their son
was gay or whatever it was.

1426
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,380
Now she's completely cured of it.

1427
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,540
She has no contact with
the church anymore.

1428
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:36,230
She's married,

1429
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,831
has a kid,

1430
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,030
she completely outside of it.

1431
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:42,470
She does podcasts now and give Ted talks
and speaks about radicalization and

1432
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:44,630
about how she was kind
of indoctrinated in,

1433
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:46,880
grew up in this family and her,

1434
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,930
her grandfather,

1435
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:49,250
Fred Phelps was this,

1436
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,091
you know,

1437
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:50,924
it's like,

1438
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,430
it's a fucking mean guy.

1439
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,790
Like a really mean Vishy.

1440
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,220
He's the God hates fags guy.

1441
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:55,990
You know,

1442
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,980
they would have those signs
that they would hold it up.

1443
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:00,410
But at the soldier's funerals,

1444
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:00,561
I mean,

1445
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:02,060
he's like really inflammatory stuff,

1446
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,160
but through Twitter,

1447
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,730
through her communicating with people
on Twitter and specifically her now

1448
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,564
husband,

1449
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,190
like he,

1450
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,190
he cured her like it just with rational
discourse and communication and she was

1451
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,830
[inaudible] will change.

1452
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,860
They will change.

1453
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,740
And so that's why banning them.

1454
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,650
I mean,

1455
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,140
and you,

1456
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,740
I saw on a recent podcast you've
been talking about redemption.

1457
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,693
Yeah.

1458
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,300
So,

1459
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,350
but I'm curious,

1460
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:28,184
what do you,

1461
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,630
do you think people,

1462
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,110
what is,

1463
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,710
how does that look like?

1464
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:31,930
Well,

1465
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,330
timber,

1466
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,190
you look in the case of like Megan Phelps,

1467
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,450
that's a real thing,

1468
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,170
right?

1469
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,340
She really did change.

1470
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,000
Um,

1471
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,130
another example is Christian peak Illini.

1472
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,993
Do you know who he is?

1473
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,200
He was a,

1474
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:48,020
a white supremacists KKK member guy
who's been on Sam Harris' podcast.

1475
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,060
He's also done some Ted talks who now
speaks out against it and talks about how

1476
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:55,770
he's indoctrinated and
talks about how lost he was.

1477
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:57,810
Now he was brought into this ideology.

1478
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:58,770
Um,

1479
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,370
there are,

1480
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,250
there's many people like
that all over the world.

1481
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,110
Um,

1482
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:03,720
uh,

1483
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,530
Magid,

1484
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,840
Magid was another perfect example.

1485
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:07,830
He was an Islamist,

1486
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:08,491
I mean,

1487
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:11,010
he was trying to form a caliphate,

1488
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,900
was literally thinking about radical
Islamic terrorism as being some sort of a

1489
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:16,351
solution.

1490
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:17,610
Now he's the opposite.

1491
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,990
Now he's trying to get people to leave
and he's trying to get people to be more

1492
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,660
reasonable and secular and
see what happened to him.

1493
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,130
He ain't got punched in the street.

1494
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,090
Yeah.

1495
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,750
Um,

1496
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,961
yeah.

1497
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:29,940
Some guy called him a fucking packy,

1498
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:30,421
I guess,

1499
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:33,510
and punched him in the head and fucked
his head up and he's got this giant

1500
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:33,840
cotton,

1501
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,570
his head from a ring and
his face is swollen up,

1502
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:39,270
but apparently they have
the guy on video and um,

1503
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,571
you know,

1504
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:42,420
they think that they're going to be able
to arrest the guy I've had imagined on

1505
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:42,631
the show.

1506
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:43,650
He's a super nice guy.

1507
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:43,931
The,

1508
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:46,860
the hard thing is that all right.

1509
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:47,461
Yes.

1510
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,990
We see these transformations take place.

1511
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:51,420
It makes us feel warm inside and yes,

1512
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:52,020
people,

1513
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,890
people can change,

1514
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:54,210
but at the same time,

1515
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,613
what are people have,

1516
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,110
should people have to
go apologize to Twitter?

1517
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,351
Oh,

1518
00:45:58,351 --> 00:45:59,190
I'm sorry.

1519
00:45:59,220 --> 00:45:59,461
Like,

1520
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:00,600
can I come back?

1521
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,050
Right.

1522
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,170
I mean that's not like sometimes
people are going to think completely

1523
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:06,570
differently than you and you
just have to deal with it and it,

1524
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,680
that should be okay.

1525
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:07,861
We,

1526
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:12,861
we shouldn't force people to come in
to our way of thinking in order to have

1527
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,010
discourse.

1528
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:14,191
No,

1529
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:14,970
that's a good point.

1530
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:15,840
That's a very good point.

1531
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,800
Um,

1532
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,240
and like who is to decide what this
path to redemption is and whether or not

1533
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,074
you've completed it,

1534
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,040
right?

1535
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,600
Who has decided like maybe you are a log,

1536
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:30,750
a hyper radical lefty and maybe Jamie's
points of view and yours are just never

1537
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,500
going to line up.

1538
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:31,921
So you're like,

1539
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:32,754
fuck him.

1540
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,840
He's banned for life,

1541
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,400
which a lot of people had been banned
for life and when you look at some of the

1542
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:39,211
infractions,

1543
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:40,230
they'd been banned for it.

1544
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:40,501
They're like,

1545
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:41,310
boy,

1546
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,270
I don't know about that one.

1547
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,440
That doesn't really make sense.

1548
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,640
Almost none of the high pro profile
banning cases make much sense.

1549
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,000
No,

1550
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,950
it's like a short term solution
that's creating a longterm problem.

1551
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,670
Yeah.

1552
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,690
That's really what it is.

1553
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,210
So I just think that we
have to talk about it more.

1554
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,510
I Dunno.

1555
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:02,720
I,

1556
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,060
I,

1557
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,451
it's like,

1558
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:05,670
why can't we just get
everyone to talk about it?

1559
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,060
Yeah.

1560
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,080
Like at the same time,

1561
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,400
I mean,

1562
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,260
it's like we're just wasting time here.

1563
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:11,461
Well,

1564
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,151
sort of,

1565
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:15,870
but I also think we're figuring it out
as we go along with a bunch of different

1566
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,220
competing ideologies.

1567
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,150
Um,

1568
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,391
you know,

1569
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:19,290
you have yours,

1570
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,430
which like you dude,

1571
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,440
you look like a hacker.

1572
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,820
Unlike House of cards.

1573
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,490
He looked like a guy you
call in to break into the,

1574
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:26,731
the,

1575
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:28,280
the mainframe server.

1576
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,470
Not that honestly.

1577
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:29,980
I believe

1578
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,371
you're not.

1579
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:30,790
I,

1580
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,710
I hang out on get lab in checkout co,

1581
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,553
but I,

1582
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,411
I cannot code.

1583
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,220
I cannot code.

1584
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,850
Listen man,

1585
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,100
I'm claiming I'm not
claiming to be a developer.

1586
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,940
No D's.

1587
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,121
No,

1588
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:40,481
you're not.

1589
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,470
These people are,

1590
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,700
I know there's another level.

1591
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:42,920
Yeah,

1592
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,840
it is incredible.

1593
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:44,674
I understand.

1594
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,790
Yeah,

1595
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,270
I get it.

1596
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:46,421
Well,

1597
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:46,900
that's like,

1598
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,010
if someone says to me like,

1599
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,060
you're an MMA fighter,

1600
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:49,241
I'm like,

1601
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,080
I'm definitely not.

1602
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,020
They are on another fucking level.

1603
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,731
Like there's a different,

1604
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:53,881
like,

1605
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:54,010
yeah,

1606
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,150
I know a little martial arts,

1607
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:56,800
but just settle the fuck down.

1608
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,550
Right?

1609
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,383
Same kind of thing.

1610
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,360
I think though that you,

1611
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,050
your ideology is going to be your,

1612
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:07,330
your point of view and perspectives
going to be very different than maybe

1613
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,310
someone who's like a radical Marxist,

1614
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:09,780
you know,

1615
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,490
it shouldn't they be allowed to post
post on the site to someone who's like an

1616
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:13,720
extreme socialist,

1617
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,150
someone like a AOC.

1618
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:16,850
You know,

1619
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,320
someone,

1620
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,890
someone who thinks that we should give
money to people who are unwilling to

1621
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:21,310
work,

1622
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,170
someone who thinks that we should try
to engineer society and tax the top x

1623
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:27,004
percent,

1624
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,251
you know,

1625
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:29,680
70 something percent of their income.

1626
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:34,710
There's a lot of those different people
and we have to figure out how to,

1627
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,760
to make it so that,

1628
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,753
well,

1629
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,340
we have to figure out a way to make
it so all the ideas can compete in the

1630
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,600
marketplace of ideas.

1631
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:45,930
Right.

1632
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,140
All these different ideas can compete
and we can find out which one is better

1633
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,360
and we can find out which one is better.

1634
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,931
Yeah.

1635
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,400
You don't always find out
which one is better though.

1636
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:54,581
Right.

1637
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:55,680
You find out which one is most people?

1638
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,860
I mean that's what happened with Hitler.

1639
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:57,360
Right?

1640
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,690
Or you don't really
find out what's better.

1641
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,524
You find out what,

1642
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,090
what's got more juice behind it.

1643
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,583
It's just,

1644
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,030
it's too risky.

1645
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,240
Even being in the position that I'm in,

1646
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:08,901
you know,

1647
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:10,310
I see these edge cases,

1648
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,091
like we say,

1649
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:11,301
look,

1650
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,740
if it's legal it can be there.

1651
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,290
But we still see edge cases
where we have to make decisions.

1652
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,400
What's like an edge case?

1653
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,753
I mean,

1654
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,423
let's say,

1655
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,980
I mean there is,

1656
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,090
I don't even want to go here,

1657
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,080
but I will right there,

1658
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,300
there is a type of animation.

1659
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,253
Oh,

1660
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,640
porn anomia yeah,

1661
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,480
yeah.

1662
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,190
That is very sketchy.

1663
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,190
Uber,

1664
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:38,930
you know,

1665
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,400
like child porn,

1666
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,530
animated child porn.

1667
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,980
And we've taken the stance that,

1668
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:43,280
look,

1669
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,000
it's,

1670
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,890
it could fall under obscenity laws.

1671
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,611
So we don't,

1672
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:47,444
we're not cool.

1673
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,070
But you know,

1674
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,390
that is a huge debate,

1675
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:50,900
right?

1676
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,201
That,

1677
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:51,380
that,

1678
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,580
that it has not been decided by
the Supreme Court if animated,

1679
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,330
you know,

1680
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,790
kids like they will do the weirdest stuff.

1681
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,080
And I,

1682
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,060
I just don't want to be telling
people what is and what is not art.

1683
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,953
Right.

1684
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,480
So like some of that Japanese
stuff with tentacles,

1685
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,850
like some of that stuff is just like,

1686
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,350
what is happening here?

1687
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,890
Like octopuses Bang and checks and
every hole and they're choking on it and

1688
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:24,550
they've got one in their ass and one
of their vagina and it's all like very,

1689
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,200
very liquidity.

1690
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,230
You know,

1691
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,370
there's a lot of splattering

1692
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:28,761
going on.

1693
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:29,001
You're like,

1694
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,260
what the fuck is this?

1695
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:31,250
And is that okay?

1696
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,360
Because it's just art,

1697
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,230
right?

1698
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:33,501
I mean,

1699
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,780
if it was a person getting fucked left,

1700
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,160
right and center by an octopus,

1701
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:37,581
he'd be like,

1702
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:37,791
yeah,

1703
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,380
I think we've crossed some lines here.

1704
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,460
That's beastiality.

1705
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,360
But if it's an image and if then,

1706
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,170
then the image is a girl with
a school girl costume on,

1707
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:46,600
she's dressed like a Catholic school girl,

1708
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:47,434
a little skirt,

1709
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,690
and she's getting banged by an octopus.

1710
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,320
Like what do you do with that?

1711
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:54,830
Right?

1712
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,580
Yeah.

1713
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,320
Yeah.

1714
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,153
What would you do?

1715
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,010
It's a good question.

1716
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,650
I'm glad I don't have a social media
site where I have to make that decision.

1717
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:00,951
Well,

1718
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:03,830
the real concern would be,

1719
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,800
is this something that
is actually illegal?

1720
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:07,963
That's the thing,

1721
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:08,360
right?

1722
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,871
And we,

1723
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:13,520
we've tried to look at the case law and
we've seen that this type of stuff has

1724
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:14,354
been,

1725
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:14,900
you know,

1726
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,770
called obscenity.

1727
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,101
Yeah.

1728
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:16,401
Before.

1729
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,590
And so we're just not going to risk it.

1730
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:19,850
But I still,

1731
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,270
you know,

1732
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,270
in a alright,

1733
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,143
nipples,

1734
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,710
nipples look right.

1735
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,020
Did you know that free the
nipple started out fortune?

1736
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,960
Well,

1737
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,561
everywhere.

1738
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:31,100
It's a whole,

1739
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,730
it's a whole movement to be honest.

1740
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,380
All right.

1741
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,230
Time magazine just did a really
interesting piece about a statue.

1742
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,650
They got banned from Facebook and
he was a naked ancient statue.

1743
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,653
That's a nipple.

1744
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:41,571
Like,

1745
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:42,111
I'm sorry,

1746
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:42,944
that's not,

1747
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,060
that's not realistic that,

1748
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,520
that,

1749
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,060
that's not helping society
taking down in a naked statue.

1750
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,590
When we were talking about the other day,

1751
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,160
uh,

1752
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,160
during the Superbowl that a Adam Levine
had his shirt off and Brian read,

1753
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:57,821
Ben was like,

1754
00:51:57,821 --> 00:51:57,961
Hey,

1755
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,230
d wasn't that like what Janet
Jackson got in trouble for?

1756
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,651
Like,

1757
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,170
yeah.

1758
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:01,790
Why does,

1759
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,200
why is it okay if Adam Levine shows his
nipples and Janet Jackson's nipples are

1760
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,840
offensive because there's
sexualized because she's a woman.

1761
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,690
This is the weird fact.

1762
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Men had to gain the right to have their
nipples shown in public back in the day.

1763
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,600
When's the day I,

1764
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,530
if you,

1765
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,660
if you go on the free the nipple site,

1766
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,494
there's this

1767
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,080
go on their Instagram or something.

1768
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,840
I think that's maybe where I saw
it back when I used Instagram.

1769
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:30,674
But

1770
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,150
you know,

1771
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,260
society is evolving.

1772
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,310
We're going to get there,

1773
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,970
we're going to be able to handle it I
think or give people the controls so that

1774
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:40,750
they can only see the types of
things that they want to see.

1775
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,080
That's ultimately what it's about.

1776
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,030
So like you should have like a filter.

1777
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:45,680
Like do I want 18 plus?

1778
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:46,820
Do our want.

1779
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,540
Um,

1780
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,740
PG 13,

1781
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,783
like what,

1782
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,740
what kind of distinction do I want?

1783
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:52,310
Yeah.

1784
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:52,850
Yeah.

1785
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:53,421
And then when,

1786
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,500
when things come up,

1787
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,010
like one of the things that Instagram
has been doing is like they say,

1788
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,360
I follow a lot of hunters and
Instagram has things where they say,

1789
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,841
warning,

1790
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:04,040
this is a sensitive content.

1791
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:04,670
Uh,

1792
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,540
nature is metal gets popped on that
a lot too because nature's metals and

1793
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:09,231
Instagram side,

1794
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:14,231
that's all like these crazy images and
videos of animals eating other animals

1795
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:16,700
and attacking their animals.

1796
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,610
And sometimes some of them they just
decide this one's too fucked up.

1797
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,330
You know,

1798
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,200
like just decide,

1799
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:21,930
you know,

1800
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,190
like this one of them where
a lion is a looking out of

1801
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,571
a,

1802
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,050
a Willdabeast asshole.

1803
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,430
Like from the inside.

1804
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,300
Like this is giant hole.

1805
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,550
They've eaten through its
stomach and it's looking out.

1806
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:33,960
It's asshole now like,

1807
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,794
yeah,

1808
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,540
this one you're going to
have to click on your own.

1809
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:37,500
You have to double click.

1810
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,393
What do you got Jamie?

1811
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,870
Basically from,

1812
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:40,441
I just looked up,

1813
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:44,790
Tarzan is the catalyst for why guys
wanted to wear their shirts off.

1814
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,260
They had like a 1920s,

1815
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,530
19 terrorists they had to wear in pools.

1816
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:50,670
They had to wear a top.

1817
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:51,301
But look,

1818
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:52,590
this is the only covers one mil.

1819
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:55,860
Thus they're probably tired or
sway or an alien right there.

1820
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,690
That's how they started
playing down the strap.

1821
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,471
Look at it says here,

1822
00:53:58,471 --> 00:53:59,850
saucy lifeguards,

1823
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:00,421
flash,

1824
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:01,710
rebellious nipples.

1825
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,473
Ah,

1826
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,910
areas 37 that's hilarious.

1827
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,180
So it was Tarzan 1937 in New
York state's male shirtless ban.

1828
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,870
That's when they overturned it.

1829
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:18,690
The incident attracted press
attention as Atlantic city,

1830
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,780
other waterfronts similarly
mandated against men.

1831
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,613
Nips.

1832
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,000
Would that legal domino tipped along
with the help of Hollywood hunks.

1833
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,020
And you were talking about
how their Twitter has porn.

1834
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,010
Yes.

1835
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:32,550
Yo,

1836
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,790
a lot banned from Google play for that.

1837
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,320
Twitter has it.

1838
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:42,090
They're up on Google play is Twitter
has a substantial amount of porn.

1839
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:42,810
You know,

1840
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,510
you follow like some of them gals
and they just wanted you to see,

1841
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:45,841
look,

1842
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:48,600
here's one of the my pussy right there.

1843
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,670
Take a look like full blown.

1844
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:51,504
Not Offensive.

1845
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,310
Well it's not offensive.

1846
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:53,431
You've,

1847
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:54,171
you've followed them.

1848
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:57,890
I mean if you follow
certain porn stars in terms,

1849
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,650
Oh really?

1850
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,770
But they're just allowing it because
they know they want that traffic.

1851
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:01,890
Oh,

1852
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,690
is that what it is?

1853
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,600
They want that traffic,

1854
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,130
that traffic bro.

1855
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,350
Yeah.

1856
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,070
Um,

1857
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,300
it's a problem if you hand your phone
to your kid accidentally click on that

1858
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:12,871
link and I'm like,

1859
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:13,291
Mommy,

1860
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:13,950
what's happening?

1861
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:14,783
Her?

1862
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,790
But Jonathan Haidt Haidt her height,

1863
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,380
height,

1864
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,830
height,

1865
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,161
height.

1866
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:23,190
He was talking about an
interesting thing where,

1867
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,630
you know,

1868
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,980
it should there be an age where
we really get into social media.

1869
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,361
I don't know.

1870
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,300
I mean people should be free with
free to do what they want to do,

1871
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,450
but you know,

1872
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,750
the Internet is,

1873
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,230
is the wilderness,

1874
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,610
well his book,

1875
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,290
the coddling of the American mind,

1876
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,761
uh,

1877
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:42,080
I'm,

1878
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,060
I'm in that right now.

1879
00:55:43,061 --> 00:55:46,330
I just finished his other one
and I'm working on that one.

1880
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,660
And a lot of it has to do with social
media and a lot of it has to do with the

1881
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:51,430
impact that it has on young people.

1882
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:52,923
You know,

1883
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,500
people are not really designed for this
and you might be able to handle it if

1884
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:59,620
your 32 year old man or a 35 year
old woman or whatever you are.

1885
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,810
But if you're a 15 year old girl,

1886
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,811
this might,

1887
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:03,950
it might be overwhelming.

1888
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:04,671
I mean,

1889
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:05,390
and the,

1890
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:09,050
the angst and the anxiety and you know,

1891
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:09,620
wanting to,

1892
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,430
I was saying about the,

1893
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,180
the depression,

1894
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:11,391
you know,

1895
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:15,170
they see if they're not at a party
or their stuff's not getting liked,

1896
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,030
that has an impact on them.

1897
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,060
And ultimately I think the networks need
to be helping educate people how to,

1898
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,341
you know,

1899
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:25,390
whether it's this info,

1900
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,920
educate people how to research.

1901
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,740
I did see that youtube
is starting to do like a,

1902
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:31,600
you've been on this for
too long type thing.

1903
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:32,501
Really?

1904
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:33,040
Yeah.

1905
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,050
Like get a life you fuck yeah.

1906
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,950
They tell you that I want
to build stuff like that.

1907
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:38,230
That that's really important.

1908
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:39,064
Yeah.

1909
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,510
Helping people get off.

1910
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,190
Yeah.

1911
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,023
I haven't,

1912
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,163
I haven't seen that.

1913
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,870
I haven't done enough time on
youtube where they're kicking me off.

1914
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:49,623
I have,

1915
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,873
it's easy.

1916
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:52,181
You know,

1917
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:52,631
I was uh,

1918
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:53,140
I sent,

1919
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,500
uh,

1920
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,290
Eddie Bravo,

1921
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,650
this thing from the Guardian about,

1922
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:57,400
uh,

1923
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,660
the upsurge in people that believe in
the flat earth and all of it because of

1924
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:05,200
youtube videos and that
apparently now youtube is,

1925
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,730
they want to censor those.

1926
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,201
They want to,

1927
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:08,920
uh,

1928
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,140
they,

1929
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:09,400
they,

1930
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,940
they feel like flat earth videos and uh,

1931
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,020
I think another one,

1932
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,080
check this check gives this
if I'm wrong about this,

1933
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,610
but I think they also want to lean
on those anti-vaccination videos.

1934
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,070
I think there's a concern with those.

1935
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,640
I think they're worried about a bunch
of different things along those lines.

1936
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,150
You know,

1937
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,750
like they feel like there's disinformation
and outright lies that are being

1938
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:32,530
spread.

1939
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,520
How do we combat it?

1940
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,600
We own this platform.

1941
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:35,170
What do we do?

1942
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,670
They feel like they have a responsibility.

1943
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:38,680
I think there is responsibility.

1944
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:39,230
Okay,

1945
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,450
but what is the responsibility?

1946
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:41,260
If there's a debate,

1947
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:46,260
I think it's more to educate people how
to research as opposed to saying this is

1948
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:47,500
or is not true.

1949
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:47,831
Right?

1950
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,270
Because who's deciding that?

1951
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,230
Well,

1952
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,340
I believe the earth is round,

1953
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,073
but uh,

1954
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,573
um,

1955
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:59,790
I also believe it's such a stupid
conspiracy that you should have it.

1956
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,240
You should be allowed and it should be
something you should show your friends.

1957
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:04,361
Like,

1958
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:04,930
dude,

1959
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,040
I need you to go look at this.

1960
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,320
This has 37,000 thumbs up.

1961
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,800
And they really believe that
the fucking earth is flat.

1962
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,770
They really believe there's an
ice wall outside Antarctica.

1963
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,350
They really believe that
the sky doesn't move.

1964
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,610
That it's that the,

1965
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,360
you know,

1966
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,830
that we're in some sort of a,

1967
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,950
I think it's like projected
images or something.

1968
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:25,630
Like there's a bunch of like really,

1969
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,310
really wacky theories.

1970
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,740
Like I think those are okay.

1971
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:30,783
Yeah,

1972
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,680
of course.

1973
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:31,960
Yeah.

1974
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,850
But I think freedom of information sort
of transcends a lot of these little

1975
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,743
debates.

1976
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,260
So if there was more
freedom of information so we
actually knew everything the

1977
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:46,261
government knew about all of the
different conspiracies and black projects,

1978
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:47,740
the black budget.

1979
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,633
Yeah.

1980
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,180
More information is
going to get both sides.

1981
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:54,520
The ability to understand
what is happening.

1982
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,090
That's true.

1983
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:58,960
The reality is that we don't know what's
happening and there is lots of secret

1984
00:58:58,961 --> 00:58:59,770
stuff.

1985
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,070
The problem with that though is then
you're dealing with foreign governments

1986
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:05,950
that are way better at
keeping secrets than we are.

1987
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,780
And if they have access to our secrets,

1988
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:11,500
like one of the things that's been
kind of disturbing is seeing the actual

1989
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:16,501
influence of these Russian troll farms
have had on not just our political

1990
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:18,004
process,

1991
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,400
but sowing seeds of
descent amongst people and,

1992
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,280
and starting

1993
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,130
conflict amongst people and
how people are buying into it.

1994
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:25,701
You know,

1995
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:29,050
like this a podcast I've been talking
about a lot with Sam Harris and Renee

1996
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:29,630
[inaudible],

1997
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,021
that's her name,

1998
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:30,854
right.

1999
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,053
Um,

2000
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:37,180
where they talked about how these
Russian troll farms set up a conflict by

2001
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:43,151
having a pro Muslim rally across the
street from a pro Texas pride rally.

2002
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,860
And they just set it
all up and had it there.

2003
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:48,650
And then a skirmish broke out because
these people are across the street from

2004
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,900
each other and that they do this with,

2005
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,890
they were having these African American
groups that were seeing anyone but

2006
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,190
Hillary and they were going to like try
really trying to get people to vote for

2007
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:59,030
Jill Stein.

2008
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,460
Really trying to get people
to even consider Trump,

2009
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,770
but anyone but Hillary and then you,

2010
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:07,040
they were also having like
ones that were against them.

2011
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:11,810
They're trying to like make debate to
trying to make anger and they don't think

2012
01:00:11,811 --> 01:00:12,830
you can stop that.

2013
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,210
But it's a fascinating thing,

2014
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:14,541
isn't it?

2015
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,400
That this is like a concerted effort.

2016
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,220
Yeah.

2017
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:17,420
Yeah.

2018
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,120
Like how do you feel
about that when you say,

2019
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,240
when you are,

2020
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:20,481
you know,

2021
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:23,540
you're in a position where you
have a fairly small network,

2022
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:24,740
but it's influential.

2023
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:25,250
Right.

2024
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:30,250
And then see watching Zuckerberg and the
Facebook shit on TV and they're talking

2025
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:32,930
to these congresspeople and senators
and they're talking to all these

2026
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:36,380
politicians about what's going on and
how to stop it and what they're trying to

2027
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:36,741
do.

2028
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,280
And,

2029
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,850
and you feel like,

2030
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:38,630
Oh God,

2031
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,830
like this is kind of a,

2032
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,450
this is an arena that I'm getting it

2033
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,303
to.

2034
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,320
What would you do?

2035
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:45,750
I mean,

2036
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,080
I think more conversation
needs to happen now less.

2037
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,590
Yeah.

2038
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:50,910
So I think you're right.

2039
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,360
I just,

2040
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,560
I want more information.

2041
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:53,550
I want from the government,

2042
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:54,840
from the corporations,

2043
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:55,590
from the trolls,

2044
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,610
from the trolls.

2045
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,740
I mean,

2046
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,120
yeah,

2047
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,631
I,

2048
01:00:59,631 --> 01:00:59,910
you know,

2049
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:04,910
I feel like I have a pretty good ability
to discern what is and is not troll

2050
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:07,141
behavior.

2051
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:09,780
I think help people understand how,

2052
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,053
how to read,

2053
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,950
how to absorb information.

2054
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,150
Like just banning an
account that is trying to,

2055
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,650
has an agenda is everyone has an agenda.

2056
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,100
It's a propaganda back and
forth between everybody.

2057
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:26,550
I don't,

2058
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,150
I mean,

2059
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,870
just because somebody
posts a Jill Stein meme.

2060
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,393
Okay,

2061
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,960
what's your point?

2062
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,140
Like their intention.

2063
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,003
Okay.

2064
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,510
I'm not saying that,

2065
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,140
you know,

2066
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:45,000
regime change behavior
is positive and negative.

2067
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,860
I don't know how we sort of switch gears.

2068
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:47,261
No,

2069
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:47,591
we did,

2070
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:47,951
but let,

2071
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:48,280
let me,

2072
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,210
let me step in here.

2073
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:49,680
When you,

2074
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,250
when you're saying a Jill Stein meme,

2075
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:55,000
there's absolutely nothing wrong
with you posting a Jill Stein meme.

2076
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:57,100
Like say if you have a
joke about Jill Stein,

2077
01:01:57,101 --> 01:01:58,360
you wanted to post it in a meme.

2078
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

2079
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,030
What's weird for people is that people
were being hired to make these memes and

2080
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,151
they,

2081
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:07,600
these memes may not have anything to
do with her own personal ideology.

2082
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:09,100
They must just might just decide,

2083
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:09,281
hey,

2084
01:02:09,281 --> 01:02:11,850
I'm going to collect this
check and I'm going to end.

2085
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,220
They make apparently according to
Renee and this podcast you did with Sam

2086
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:15,430
Harris,

2087
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,320
they make really hilarious memes.

2088
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:18,730
Like some of them are really fun.

2089
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,740
I listen to that podcast.

2090
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,010
Yeah,

2091
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,411
it was great.

2092
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:20,990
She said that she,

2093
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:21,830
she started laughing.

2094
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:22,231
Yeah.

2095
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:23,064
Yeah.

2096
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:23,460
And she,

2097
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,890
you know,

2098
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,070
she had to go through thousands
and thousands of them.

2099
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,351
That's weird.

2100
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,300
There's this idea of a web of trust,

2101
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,230
which is interesting.

2102
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,820
Sort of like a peer to peer.

2103
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,620
It's not like a Chinese social score,

2104
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,180
but it's like if you,

2105
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,150
the people that you're connected with

2106
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,680
show a certain account
to be untrustworthy,

2107
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,431
then you know,

2108
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,040
because you trust your little network.

2109
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,790
So there it's sort of
like a peer to peer score.

2110
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,770
We were looking at different ideas.

2111
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:53,604
I think that

2112
01:02:55,110 --> 01:03:00,110
transparency and understanding what's
going on with different accounts and if

2113
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:01,651
it's the real person,

2114
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:03,660
that's all important stuff.

2115
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,171
We don't,

2116
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,640
we don't want frauds,

2117
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,170
we don't want to send foe,

2118
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,330
but you know,

2119
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,200
we just have to really step back and
think about how we're doing it rather than

2120
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:16,500
letting AI and algorithms run the show.

2121
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,513
Right.

2122
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,450
I see what you're saying.

2123
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:18,930
Um,

2124
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,210
do you think that there is a,

2125
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,500
I don't want to say there's a market,

2126
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:24,300
is there a demand for this?

2127
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,750
Like are a lot of people responding in
a positive way to the way you guys are

2128
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:28,650
approaching the game?

2129
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:29,641
Yeah,

2130
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:30,091
for sure.

2131
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:33,750
Every time there's a
big scandal every time,

2132
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:34,980
whether it's,

2133
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,250
you know,

2134
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,320
data manipulation or,

2135
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:38,490
you know,

2136
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:43,490
our first big growth spurt was during
the Snowden days when he released all the

2137
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:44,470
information,

2138
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,760
right.

2139
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,150
People are really upset
with what's happening.

2140
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,320
It's just,

2141
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,153
you know,

2142
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,570
where are they supposed to do?

2143
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:54,000
Like this is what they're
using for their communication.

2144
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,650
It's not easy to just achieve,

2145
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,161
you know,

2146
01:03:56,161 --> 01:04:00,960
a multibillion person network overnight
so that everybody's there and so we're

2147
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:01,794
stuck.

2148
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,820
But again,

2149
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:07,821
I think that supplementing just
installing these alternative apps,

2150
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:08,580
not just us,

2151
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,380
it's like the whole open source market.

2152
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:14,670
I'm not even here trying to just
talk about what we're doing right.

2153
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,840
It's like if you don't have those apps
on your phone and you don't use those

2154
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:19,674
browsers,

2155
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,911
I'm sorry,

2156
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:21,744
you just,

2157
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,770
you're not helping.

2158
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,590
And people just want to
vote with their energy,

2159
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:26,130
I think,

2160
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,240
and vote with their time.

2161
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,150
So it's more of an education thing.

2162
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,020
People just don't know that this matters
and that this can help change the whole

2163
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:37,110
Internet simply by logging
into an app once in a while.

2164
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,353
It's like,

2165
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:39,720
it's,

2166
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,890
it's like organic food.

2167
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,380
I mean we want to put things into it.

2168
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:45,480
We want to support
things to have integrity.

2169
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,940
So when you click something,

2170
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,830
you are supporting that thing.

2171
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,870
When you're sitting on an app all day,

2172
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:54,160
you are feeding that APP.

2173
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,930
That's how the apps get all the money.

2174
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:58,210
That's where they get all their funding.

2175
01:04:58,211 --> 01:04:59,020
That's that.

2176
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,500
That's where it's all based,

2177
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:02,980
is in user retention and energy.

2178
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,730
And do you think that most
people were even aware of this?

2179
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:08,590
Do you think they're just using
it because it's convenient?

2180
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,010
The biggest shariah going on right now?

2181
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,050
Most people don't know that
Facebook owns Instagram.

2182
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,950
They think Instagram's like cool
because you know it's Facebook,

2183
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:20,411
right?

2184
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:21,790
It's one giant umbrella.

2185
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:22,420
Yeah.

2186
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,253
Yeah.

2187
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:23,860
Um,

2188
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,693
what is,

2189
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,290
what is the difference between the two?

2190
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,740
Obviously with Instagram
it's just pictures mostly.

2191
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:31,720
And then whatever the post
is below the pictures.

2192
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:37,110
But with Facebook it's a lot more
commentary and long verbose statements on

2193
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,400
Shit.

2194
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,320
And then people arguing
in the comments about it.

2195
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,393
[inaudible]

2196
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:43,900
yeah,

2197
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,500
they're all the Instagram
founders left abandoned ship.

2198
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:49,150
The whatsapp founders abandoned ship,

2199
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,760
the oculus founder abandoned ship,

2200
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,140
all because of the privacy stuff.

2201
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:53,551
Really?

2202
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:53,891
They're like,

2203
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:55,840
you took this good thing.

2204
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:56,111
Well,

2205
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:56,921
it was proprietary.

2206
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,760
So I would argue if it was ever
actually a fully good thing,

2207
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,050
but at least it wasn't,

2208
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,500
you know,

2209
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,970
completely corrupted by Facebook.

2210
01:06:03,971 --> 01:06:06,910
But all of the founders of those companies
left because they hate what's going

2211
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,744
on.

2212
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,390
What the whatsapp guy joined signal,

2213
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:15,220
which is a really cool opensource
anti and encrypted messaging APP.

2214
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,440
So you know,

2215
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,810
these people know to what
happened with whatsapp.

2216
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:20,980
It's not the same anymore.

2217
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,020
WHATSAPP is owned by Facebook.

2218
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,000
I don't know this.

2219
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,250
Oh sorry.

2220
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:26,830
Hey,

2221
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,401
come on Bro.

2222
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,840
Get with a gang of jungle man.

2223
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,750
Well you're deep into this man.

2224
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,740
That's why I want to talk to you.

2225
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:33,100
Yeah.

2226
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:33,933
It's,

2227
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,520
and they're all buying up companies and,

2228
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,280
and using the same sort of ideas.

2229
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:39,800
Yeah.

2230
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,370
Now they're talking about integrating
the messages between what?

2231
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:42,821
WHATSAPP,

2232
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:43,780
Instagram and Facebook.

2233
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:46,720
So it's all one system rule.

2234
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,440
Yeah.

2235
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,273
Yeah.

2236
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,300
Centralization.

2237
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,773
It has happened.

2238
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,460
It hasn't been turned on yet,

2239
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,480
but I believe it's happening.

2240
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,290
Like,

2241
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,820
doesn't like your dms on Instagram.

2242
01:06:57,821 --> 01:06:59,500
You're going to have to
download the Facebook messenger.

2243
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,640
So what is,

2244
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,140
what are the challenges
for something like minds,

2245
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:03,670
uh,

2246
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,951
when you,

2247
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:05,170
you're trying to take off,

2248
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:06,160
like there was a,

2249
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:06,431
uh,

2250
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:11,431
social media Instagram type thing
that was around a little while ago.

2251
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:16,990
I remember I used it like once and I
posted about it and what was that called?

2252
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,370
But then Vero,

2253
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:19,383
is that what it was?

2254
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,280
But then a lot of people were saying it
was bullshit and they're proprietary,

2255
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,000
which you don't know.

2256
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,050
It's closed source.

2257
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,880
No idea what's going on behind the scenes.

2258
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:28,870
Same as the other one.

2259
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:33,430
A lot of apps try to say that
there are alternatives and that,

2260
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:33,910
you know,

2261
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,721
they support x,

2262
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:35,071
Y and z.

2263
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:36,880
No privacy or free speech or whatnot.

2264
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:37,743
But

2265
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,060
I don't think it's any new paradigm if
they're not showing their source code so

2266
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:44,440
that people can see the algorithms,

2267
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:45,280
the people who care.

2268
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:45,670
You know,

2269
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,950
obviously most people aren't
going to go and inspect the code,

2270
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:52,900
but just the principle that the
experts could cause they will,

2271
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:53,141
you know,

2272
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:56,740
there's all kinds of think tanks and
whatnot that they would love to dive into

2273
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,310
the source code to understand how
these companies were actually behaving.

2274
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:01,144
So,

2275
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:01,630
you know,

2276
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:06,630
waving the privacy flag without being
open source or this is getting a little

2277
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:08,441
bit into the weeds,

2278
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:11,620
but a lot of this comes
down to licensing of,

2279
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,090
of content or code.

2280
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,070
So the,

2281
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:19,820
the license that we use for our code
is called the general public license,

2282
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,350
the Agpl v three,

2283
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,410
which means that anyone can take our
code and do whatever they want with it.

2284
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,280
They can sell it,

2285
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:25,971
they can do anything,

2286
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:27,410
but if they make changes,

2287
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,420
they have to show them
with everybody else.

2288
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,370
So it's sort of like,

2289
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:31,700
uh,

2290
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,140
the creative Commons,

2291
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,370
Cheryl like license,

2292
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,500
which is essentially says the same thing.

2293
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,390
Take my video photo,

2294
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:39,081
remix it,

2295
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:39,914
do whatever you want,

2296
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,810
but you have to share the
result with everybody else.

2297
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:46,100
Open source basically means you
can do whatever you want with it.

2298
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,050
You can take it,

2299
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:49,400
make it your own,

2300
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,031
you know,

2301
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:52,430
keep your own little secret sauce
of what makes you feel good.

2302
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:58,540
They get conflated because you know free
software sounds like free as in free

2303
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:00,410
beer,

2304
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,670
not free as in freedom.

2305
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,430
So you know,

2306
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,040
licensing is really what this all
coalesces into [inaudible] and it's been

2307
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:18,250
proven that you can make a lot of money
with free and open source software.

2308
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:19,810
I mean look at wordpress,

2309
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:24,811
it's a hugely successful
technology corporation and
multibillion dollars people

2310
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:27,370
share the code.

2311
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,250
That's how it,

2312
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,640
it created a network effect
because they did that.

2313
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:35,110
It's like the grateful dead would let
everybody record their music and how it

2314
01:09:35,111 --> 01:09:35,651
spreads.

2315
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:40,420
So it's actually a good marketing
tactic and it also gives transparency so

2316
01:09:40,421 --> 01:09:42,940
people can see what the
hell is going on right now.

2317
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:45,010
When you started this,

2318
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:45,830
what,

2319
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:50,830
what was your objective and where are you
thinking about it as a potential large

2320
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:55,390
scale source of revenue or were you just
thinking this is something that I would

2321
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:58,840
like to do and do correctly because I
don't think anybody's doing it this way.

2322
01:09:58,841 --> 01:09:59,710
Open source,

2323
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,880
you know,

2324
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,880
pro censorship or pro a freedom
of speech anticensorship and to,

2325
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:06,490
you know,

2326
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:10,780
to just do the bare minimum
amount of managing content.

2327
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,330
I think everyone should
be able to make money.

2328
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,030
I don't think it should have
to be mutually exclusive.

2329
01:10:18,031 --> 01:10:21,510
Like you do something for free for
everybody and you also can't make money.

2330
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,070
That's a big misconception.

2331
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,670
We're trying to give people
the tools to make money.

2332
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,930
I mean I w w we have like a monthly
recurring subscription system,

2333
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:35,670
sort of like a crypto patrion type
tool so you can subscribe to people.

2334
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:40,530
We had the ability for creators
to accept Fiat dollars,

2335
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,100
but we took it out because it's stripe
and stripe is a closed source system,

2336
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:50,640
which we just didn't
have longterm faith in.

2337
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,970
So stripe was a,

2338
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:55,560
and some sort of an extension to your
site if we were using their API to

2339
01:10:55,561 --> 01:10:57,000
facilitate peer to peer payments.

2340
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,210
Oh,

2341
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:02,210
this is why I'm really patrion most likely
band Carl because Argon of a car Gunn

2342
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:07,471
who,

2343
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,304
um,

2344
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,090
yeah,

2345
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,430
because the payment processors
went to them or like,

2346
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:12,264
look,

2347
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:12,481
you know,

2348
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,010
stripe has strict terms

2349
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,360
and we didn't want to be,

2350
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,613
you know,

2351
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,110
talking to straight.

2352
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:22,770
Like we don't want to be subject to
overlords in our company decisions.

2353
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,490
So you know,

2354
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:29,190
you think that that's what happened with
Carl that is most likely what happened.

2355
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,450
So they stepped in and said,

2356
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:31,050
hey,

2357
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,850
we don't want this guy
to be a part of the site.

2358
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:33,421
Yeah.

2359
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:36,960
And I think that stripe probably stepped
in with a lot of explicit content,

2360
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,010
controversial content.

2361
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:38,191
I mean,

2362
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:41,550
it's in their policy that you can't
facilitate payments dealing with that type

2363
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:42,210
of content.

2364
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,010
And now we're seeing banks actually go,

2365
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:45,090
go after people.

2366
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:49,890
Well the thing about Carl doe was that
his content that there was questionable,

2367
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,070
wasn't even related to patriarch
had nothing to do with it.

2368
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:54,930
It was on another person's podcast.

2369
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:59,020
It was from six months prior and that
other person's podcast was on youtube.

2370
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:00,240
It had nothing to do with patron.

2371
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,800
And they had specifically said that they
were not going to act on content that

2372
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:06,270
was outside of their network.

2373
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:09,930
They were only going to react
to things that were on Patrion.

2374
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:10,970
Right.

2375
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:13,020
Cause you can make little
blogs and stuff on Patrion.

2376
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:13,440
Right.

2377
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,610
They do have some content.

2378
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,210
Yeah.

2379
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,043
Yeah.

2380
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:16,973
So,

2381
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,240
but that's not what patron said.

2382
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,650
Obviously the processors,

2383
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:19,950
Pr,

2384
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:20,790
I don't want to,

2385
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,600
who knows.

2386
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:21,901
Yeah.

2387
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:22,800
I didn't want to act like,

2388
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,760
I also don't want it to seem like I
have an ideology that I'm trying to push

2389
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:27,660
right now.

2390
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,660
Like I'm very open to moving
in the direction that makes
the most sense for the

2391
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:34,741
community.

2392
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:35,490
I'm not,

2393
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,920
I'm not attached to what I'm thinking.

2394
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,180
Good.

2395
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,380
So I liked that.

2396
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,220
I wish,

2397
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,400
I wish more people would do that.

2398
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:43,650
That,

2399
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,760
I mean I tried to do that.

2400
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:46,800
I'm really getting way better at it,

2401
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,150
but it's something I actively work on.

2402
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,810
Like these ideas that I have,

2403
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,820
I'm not fucking married them.

2404
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,750
Don't argue them.

2405
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,613
Look at them,

2406
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,201
look at them.

2407
01:12:56,201 --> 01:12:57,510
And if someone says something different,

2408
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:57,631
go,

2409
01:12:57,631 --> 01:12:58,380
Huh.

2410
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:58,890
All right.

2411
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,340
They'll go,

2412
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,100
no man.

2413
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:00,211
All right.

2414
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:01,070
I brought bro.

2415
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:01,320
You know,

2416
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:01,651
cause that,

2417
01:13:01,651 --> 01:13:06,651
that natural instinct to argue and to
claim some sort of a personal identity

2418
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,091
with your,

2419
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:09,301
uh,

2420
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,290
with your ideas.

2421
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,000
That's,

2422
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,600
that's part of the problem that we have.

2423
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:12,900
Yeah,

2424
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,733
I think it's,

2425
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,800
it's a main conflict issue with social
media is one of the things that I see a

2426
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:20,064
lot of that,

2427
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,581
look,

2428
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:22,710
I used to do it way back in the day.

2429
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:24,330
If you go back to the
early days of Twitter,

2430
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:25,560
I used to argue with people.

2431
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,450
I used to argue with
people on social media.

2432
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,640
Then I realized some long time ago,

2433
01:13:29,641 --> 01:13:32,580
like there is no good
that comes out of that.

2434
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:36,750
I might correct someone if someone
said something that's incorrect,

2435
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:38,850
but I'm not going to argue
and I'm not going to insult.

2436
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:39,060
And um,

2437
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,840
I just,

2438
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,620
I'm just not,

2439
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,170
I don't even,

2440
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,830
doesn't work.

2441
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:42,690
It doesn't work.

2442
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,400
It just makes people argue back and
insult your back and nothing ever gets

2443
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:47,881
accomplished.

2444
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,890
Occasionally a dunk on
people and it's fun.

2445
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,121
But Rhea,

2446
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:51,811
in reality,

2447
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:52,591
especially me,

2448
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:52,891
I mean,

2449
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:54,570
I kind of dunk on people for a living.

2450
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,800
So I'm just gonna,

2451
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,140
I'm not going to engage and I don't,

2452
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,970
this is going to sound corny as fuck.

2453
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,290
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.

2454
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,213
I really don't.

2455
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,490
I don't want to be in some argument
where someone is looking at their phone

2456
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:05,650
like,

2457
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,720
fucking fuck you.

2458
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:07,201
Fuck you.

2459
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,034
I don't want that.

2460
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:08,873
I don't want that.

2461
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:09,773
I get that.

2462
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,003
I know what it is.

2463
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,033
I know what it is,

2464
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,700
but it's,

2465
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,580
it's in this flat medium.

2466
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,091
Okay.

2467
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,060
This two dimensional medium of typing,

2468
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:22,870
text and then sending taxed
and you type tax and San taxed,

2469
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:28,240
the conflict that arises through that
is never beneficial in my opinion.

2470
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,070
I don't get anything out of it.

2471
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,210
So what,

2472
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,020
you know,

2473
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,850
if I'm expressing something,

2474
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:34,840
almost always,

2475
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:34,961
uh,

2476
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:36,870
try to express something
about shit I like,

2477
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,300
like,

2478
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:37,451
Oh,

2479
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,380
I love this new show.

2480
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,640
All this movie was great.

2481
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,181
Oh,

2482
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,080
this is amazing.

2483
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,310
Like check out this picture.

2484
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,620
You might want to check this out.

2485
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,160
It's,

2486
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:45,993
it's tone.

2487
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:46,420
Yeah.

2488
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:46,931
Honestly,

2489
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:47,480
like I,

2490
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:47,800
I,

2491
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,401
same with me.

2492
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:53,401
Like I was much more trying to convince
people about what I thought was right.

2493
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:54,671
You know,

2494
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:55,510
coming out of college,

2495
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:57,160
you think you're all high and mighty.

2496
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,780
It doesn't work.

2497
01:14:59,050 --> 01:14:59,883
People just,

2498
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,460
you know,

2499
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,020
are allergic to I'm allergic to,

2500
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:03,160
I cannot handle it.

2501
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,253
Like it's not,

2502
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,460
no one wants to to talk like that.

2503
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,080
It's one thing if you're
having a good time.

2504
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:08,261
Yeah.

2505
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:10,420
And trying to just like show someone up.

2506
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:10,921
Yeah.

2507
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:11,080
And,

2508
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,621
and it just,

2509
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:12,431
you can have fun with it.

2510
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:13,540
It's more comedic.

2511
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,090
But when you're actually
taking yourself seriously,

2512
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:18,550
like it's not going to work.

2513
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,300
No.

2514
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,140
It's not going to work.

2515
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,530
And it actually has the
exact opposite effect.

2516
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,431
That's like,

2517
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:25,264
um,

2518
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:26,680
the expression,

2519
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,060
what w how's expression?

2520
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:33,160
Like a jealousy is like a poison.

2521
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:33,460
That,

2522
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,001
how does it go?

2523
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:39,001
Jealousy is like a poison that you take
yourself because you don't like what

2524
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,930
someone else's accomplishing.

2525
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,050
I forget the terrible job
paraphrase Matt and I,

2526
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,201
my,

2527
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:48,250
my worst paraphrasing of all time
mumble mouth motherfucker than I am.

2528
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,210
But uh,

2529
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:52,000
but the idea is that it has
the exact opposite effect.

2530
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,480
Like [inaudible] jealous about someone
that actually makes you feel bad instead

2531
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:56,170
of them feel bad.

2532
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,910
It also makes them not
want to hang out with you.

2533
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:58,540
Well,

2534
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:58,751
you know,

2535
01:15:58,751 --> 01:15:59,800
they probably don't want
hanging out with you anyway,

2536
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:00,634
let's be honest.

2537
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:01,623
But,

2538
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:02,790
but the,

2539
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:03,620
the,

2540
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:07,300
you know what you're doing
by back and forth on.

2541
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:07,781
So I know,

2542
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:11,320
and I know people who do engage in
it and sometimes they have these,

2543
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:11,740
uh,

2544
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:15,850
anxiety moments where they don't sleep
for days because they're involved in

2545
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:16,870
these Twitter feuds.

2546
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,681
I mean,

2547
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:20,280
I know people that have done this where
they've gotten involved in Twitter feuds

2548
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:20,351
in,

2549
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,570
they'll wake up three o'clock in the
morning to check their Twitter feed and

2550
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:22,780
like,

2551
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:23,860
oh Christ man,

2552
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:25,600
like you gotta go,

2553
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,081
go,

2554
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:26,440
uh,

2555
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,880
go on a yoga retreat or something.

2556
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:28,080
Like,

2557
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:28,990
he can't do this.

2558
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:30,280
You can't live your life like this.

2559
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:35,910
I think there may be
some value to the debate.

2560
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:38,260
Have it should be there.

2561
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:40,150
It's just be there debate and it's like,

2562
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:40,601
okay,

2563
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,660
I'm not going to spend my
time doing it that way.

2564
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:45,550
Some people want to spend
their time doing it that way.

2565
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,500
And if there's cool mechanisms for,

2566
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:47,680
you know,

2567
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,410
the most voted content to be seen.

2568
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:50,800
So the,

2569
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,220
I mean,

2570
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:51,551
okay,

2571
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:53,310
that's interesting to
check out sometimes too,

2572
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,370
to look at feedback,

2573
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:56,230
but it's,

2574
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:57,064
uh,

2575
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:57,750
it's,

2576
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:02,650
it's not nearly as an effective way of
communicating your ideas as like making

2577
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,300
something more personal.

2578
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:05,980
It's more,

2579
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:06,581
I mean,

2580
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:07,414
even video is,

2581
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:07,740
is,

2582
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,100
is more effective than that
because people actually

2583
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,740
have a chance to look at
you or obviously in person.

2584
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:13,653
Yeah.

2585
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,493
You met her.

2586
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:14,811
Yeah.

2587
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:14,961
Well,

2588
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:16,580
in person is obviously the best.

2589
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,300
Um,

2590
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:21,020
and I think my concern
really about the futures.

2591
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,490
I'm holding back a sneeze right now.

2592
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:23,324
Sorry.

2593
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,980
I'm trying to keep it together.

2594
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,133
I don't think I can,

2595
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,820
it's one of those borderline ones.

2596
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,610
What he's supposed to do.

2597
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:31,520
Suppose stare at the light.

2598
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,770
Are you trying to resist?

2599
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:34,750
Nah,

2600
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,360
I'm trying to get,

2601
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:35,750
okay.

2602
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,200
We're good.

2603
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,033
We're out of the woods.

2604
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,963
Um,

2605
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:38,870
uh,

2606
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,800
I lost my train of thought.

2607
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:40,191
What was it?

2608
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:40,870
What were we just saying?

2609
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:41,021
Hey,

2610
01:17:41,021 --> 01:17:41,854
I something,

2611
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,800
no jealousy quote.

2612
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:44,960
You're talking to your,

2613
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,741
we want to get past that.

2614
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:46,100
And Jamie,

2615
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,960
I know we for days I was
looking for it and then

2616
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:51,890
I lost it.

2617
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:52,760
I lost it in my,

2618
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:53,030
uh,

2619
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,580
holding back a sneeze that,

2620
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,181
oh,

2621
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:57,800
that's what I was worried about Ai.

2622
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,200
I'm not AI augmented reality.

2623
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,250
That's what I'm really worried about.

2624
01:18:01,251 --> 01:18:02,480
Not Artificial but augmented.

2625
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,440
And uh,

2626
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:03,980
Mike,

2627
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,850
my concern is at what we're experiencing
right now in this flat form of two

2628
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:12,710
dimensional taxed is something that is
very overwhelming to a lot of people's

2629
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:13,191
time.

2630
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:15,980
And you're looking at some kids
that are online social media,

2631
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:16,311
eight,

2632
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:18,860
10 hours a day just
staring at their phones.

2633
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:19,850
Um,

2634
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:24,380
I'm extremely concerned and I have some
jokes about it in my act about the next

2635
01:18:24,381 --> 01:18:29,381
wave because I think that we are
overwhelmed by this incredibly attractive

2636
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,520
medium where we're,

2637
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:33,530
we're attracted to,

2638
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:38,290
our phones were attracted to this
style of engaging and information,

2639
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:40,010
receiving information
and passing it from it.

2640
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:42,500
And then an online
arguments and debates and,

2641
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,830
and looking at pictures
and this constant stream,

2642
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:46,610
which,

2643
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,443
you know,

2644
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,040
just looking at your phone,

2645
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,110
it's not that thrilling.

2646
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:51,970
It's just like,

2647
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:52,580
hmm.

2648
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,110
It's not that thrilling and just like,

2649
01:18:54,111 --> 01:18:54,530
okay,

2650
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:54,830
yeah,

2651
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,870
but it's still getting you all day long.

2652
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:01,310
Like there's nothing really crazy
happening when my concern is if something

2653
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:03,080
really crazy does start to happen,

2654
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:08,150
when you really can have experiences that
are a hyper normal like that are that

2655
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:13,151
are more powerful than anything you can
experience in this regular carbon based

2656
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,890
physical touch and feel world.

2657
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,980
And once we start experiencing
augmented reality,

2658
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,160
the integration between humans and
technology and then the ability to share

2659
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:26,540
augmented reality like to shit.

2660
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:30,980
Like if you were at work and you have
these fucking goggles on and your

2661
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:34,090
girlfriend is at work on the
other side of town and you,

2662
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:39,120
you guys both have like these similar
video pets that are with you and dancing

2663
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:44,420
around and providing you with fucking
advertisements and giving you things

2664
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:44,901
there.

2665
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:45,320
There's,

2666
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:50,030
there's next levels to this stuff that
I'm trying to like see the future,

2667
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,060
but I'm too fucking stupid and I don't
really know anything about technology,

2668
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:56,930
but I know that they're going
to get deeper into our lives.

2669
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,580
I know that these technologies,

2670
01:19:58,610 --> 01:19:59,780
not they liked the government,

2671
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:01,070
but these technologies,

2672
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:05,840
they're going to get deeper into your
life and that they got you by the balls

2673
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:08,070
and the clit with a fucking phone

2674
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,840
and it doesn't even do much.

2675
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,400
Take some pictures,

2676
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,600
look at some pictures,

2677
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,620
look at some text,

2678
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,640
watch some videos.

2679
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:18,180
That's all it does and access
to most human knowledge.

2680
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,990
That's true,

2681
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,130
but how many people are using that?

2682
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:20,570
Right?

2683
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:20,871
Was He,

2684
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:21,121
you know,

2685
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:22,170
they are for sure.

2686
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,890
They definitely are.

2687
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,240
There's a lot of googling going on.

2688
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,050
I'm sorry,

2689
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:26,740
what does the other one just duck,

2690
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:26,941
duck,

2691
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:27,360
go,

2692
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:27,601
duck,

2693
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:27,781
duck,

2694
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:28,550
go and going on.

2695
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:28,690
I,

2696
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,630
I'm holding out for fair.

2697
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:31,260
Another one,

2698
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:35,100
and we might start working on search
more being as a god damn ghost town,

2699
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:35,610
isn't it?

2700
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:36,520
I bet if you go to bing,

2701
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:41,190
you got to blow fucking dust off your
keyboard as soon as you open it up like no

2702
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:42,024
one's in there.

2703
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:42,923
Who's in bing?

2704
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,970
Bang is just Microsoft's.

2705
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:45,810
I know,

2706
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,040
but who's who's using that?

2707
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:48,300
Oh ladies.

2708
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:52,860
I think that youtube is the number
two search engine on the web.

2709
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,300
Youtube.

2710
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,133
Yeah.

2711
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:55,710
Wow.

2712
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:56,400
Yeah.

2713
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,370
That's what really makes so many videos
about somebody weird topics and it's

2714
01:20:59,371 --> 01:20:59,820
just like,

2715
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,060
oh,

2716
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,380
it'll pop up and you get,

2717
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,970
I don't think we can stop it,

2718
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,910
but you know,

2719
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,141
cause look,

2720
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:08,280
it would be fun to,

2721
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,180
you know,

2722
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:09,750
the,

2723
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,000
with the frequency that
you go to like an arcade.

2724
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,420
Like I would go and do some crazy ar,

2725
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:16,740
VR stuff.

2726
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:17,461
I mean it would be fun.

2727
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,310
It's like a rare
entertainment thing to do.

2728
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:24,090
I just want to make sure that like see
even with the robots that we're carrying

2729
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:26,970
around now do is,

2730
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:30,030
is it respecting my freedom
is this thing on my side?

2731
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,230
It's not,

2732
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,380
I don't think it is right now because
I'm using android is open source.

2733
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:35,700
Are you an android guy?

2734
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,201
Of course you will.

2735
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:36,510
Yeah.

2736
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:39,330
But all this crypto guys,

2737
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:40,270
they're all android.

2738
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,800
It's just more freedom.

2739
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:49,330
But now Google's version of android
is just as bad as ILS whose version of

2740
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:50,220
android to use.

2741
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,330
I am,

2742
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:52,730
yeah.

2743
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:53,100
I'm,

2744
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,320
no,

2745
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,210
I'm not telling him,

2746
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:54,391
no,

2747
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:55,021
I'm not perfect.

2748
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:55,441
I'm on,

2749
01:21:55,441 --> 01:21:56,940
I'm on the Google android right now,

2750
01:21:56,941 --> 01:21:58,410
but there's a version called replicant,

2751
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,273
which is,

2752
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,970
which is a fully free version
of android that I'm probably,

2753
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:05,040
because I just cracked
my phone like a day ago,

2754
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:05,910
so I might get a new one.

2755
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:06,744
What do you use him?

2756
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,490
What phone do you use as eight?

2757
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:09,541
Oh,

2758
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:10,374
look at you.

2759
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:10,810
Yeah,

2760
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:11,643
kind of retro.

2761
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,650
Is it like a year ago,

2762
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,970
there's this one called the black phone,

2763
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:15,840
which I'm looking into,

2764
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:16,470
which is,

2765
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,930
it's like a hyper encrypted phone,

2766
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:19,611
but I don't know.

2767
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,670
I don't know if it's,

2768
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,170
if it's fully free.

2769
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,860
So isn't there a blockchain based phone
that there were coming out with and the

2770
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:26,910
theory and base phone?

2771
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:27,600
Isn't that,

2772
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,110
I don't know.

2773
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,421
I don't know.

2774
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:29,550
Isn't that something Jamie?

2775
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,201
Sure.

2776
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,280
I definitely got announced,

2777
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,750
but I don't know that
it's still in development.

2778
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,330
You can't run everything on a blockchain?

2779
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,780
No.

2780
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,030
Blockchains are pretty slow.

2781
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,270
Um,

2782
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:40,520
we,

2783
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,920
we use it even to publish
to the ethereum blockchain.

2784
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:46,380
Like when you send each
other payments on mines,

2785
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:47,940
it costs like,

2786
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,121
you know,

2787
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:48,960
there's a gas fee.

2788
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:54,290
So the way that the network is powered
is that the miners get paid with gas with

2789
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:55,254
a little bit of ether.

2790
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,670
So cost like a buck to do a post.

2791
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:59,430
Like there's fully
decentralized social networks.

2792
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:00,750
There's one called a PP,

2793
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:04,110
which you have to pay for
everything you do right on on it.

2794
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,430
And so this is why it's,

2795
01:23:05,431 --> 01:23:06,520
it's a cool experiment,

2796
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,290
but it's really not scalable.

2797
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,610
So you know,

2798
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:11,110
it's gonna be a combination of,

2799
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,520
of decentralized technology.

2800
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:15,070
Like not just blockchain.

2801
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,443
People like to,

2802
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:16,960
you know,

2803
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,870
say the blockchain is going to
solve all the problems and it's,

2804
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,110
it's gonna solve a lot of problems.

2805
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,400
It's an incredible tool.

2806
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,630
But yeah,

2807
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,250
I am a,

2808
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,361
what does this,

2809
01:23:25,361 --> 01:23:25,721
Jamie,

2810
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:28,570
is this it the Finney one that's out now?

2811
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:28,781
Yeah,

2812
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:29,320
just,

2813
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,190
just what I'm saying,

2814
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,150
like a month ago or pretty siren.

2815
01:23:33,151 --> 01:23:33,300
Oh,

2816
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,260
s which I'm not exactly
what does that jazz,

2817
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,180
good luck getting the
fucking app with that.

2818
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,420
Then in some of those android apps,

2819
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:40,671
they're,

2820
01:23:40,671 --> 01:23:41,381
they're sneaky,

2821
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:41,710
right?

2822
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,000
Don't they steal bitcoin?

2823
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,560
There was an android app that,

2824
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:44,830
uh,

2825
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,620
got in trouble for
stealing cryptocurrency.

2826
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,200
It was a stealing it in the background.

2827
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:50,561
While you,

2828
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:53,410
while you had your app open and
it was on the Google play store.

2829
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:54,100
See if that's true.

2830
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,000
I'm not have made something up.

2831
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:55,834
I could get sued.

2832
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,423
I don't think I did though.

2833
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:01,390
I think it might've been mining
and I think it was stealing.

2834
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:02,410
Yeah,

2835
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,820
we'll pull that up so we could see it.

2836
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:05,710
Um,

2837
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,000
I have an android phone as well.

2838
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:08,380
I have a note nine.

2839
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,313
I really like it.

2840
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,150
It's giant.

2841
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:10,930
Huge screen.

2842
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,770
Great battery life.

2843
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,580
Beautiful.

2844
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,540
So you use both?

2845
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:13,960
Yes.

2846
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,040
Bitcoin scam warning over fake android
APP that steals cryptocurrency from your

2847
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:18,341
phone.

2848
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:18,521
Yeah,

2849
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,354
I use both.

2850
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,253
Um,

2851
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,490
Andrew is very good now.

2852
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,383
It's very good.

2853
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:22,700
I,

2854
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,590
I was an early adopter and it was like
clunky and shitty and then I would go to

2855
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:27,170
my iPhone.

2856
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:27,401
I was like,

2857
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:27,731
oh my God,

2858
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:28,564
this is so much better.

2859
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,411
What?

2860
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:33,340
Iphone is great with his integration
with like Apple TV integration with a

2861
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:33,971
laptop.

2862
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:36,530
But I also have a windows
laptop that I use a lot of.

2863
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,361
I really like a,

2864
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:39,820
I have a Lenovo think pad for,

2865
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:42,220
as for writing the keyboards better.

2866
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:42,641
In fact,

2867
01:24:42,641 --> 01:24:47,641
I actually bought an older Mac book just
for the keyboard because as a writer

2868
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,310
you,

2869
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:51,130
you want tactile feedback
as you're writing.

2870
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:51,964
It just helps.

2871
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:54,970
It makes it easier for you to
recognize where the keys are.

2872
01:24:55,330 --> 01:25:00,330
And Apple has decided to go so far towards
design and just for aesthetic beauty

2873
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,850
that they've ruined the
tactile feedback to you.

2874
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,670
Remember that though when
the old smart phones,

2875
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,240
you could,

2876
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,290
they still had the keyboard.

2877
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,410
I thought I would never leave
that because he's tactile.

2878
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:15,303
Right?

2879
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,330
Ultimately left.

2880
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:17,081
That's true.

2881
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:18,550
But that's a different experience.

2882
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,780
That's just yams.

2883
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,230
I can do that with my thumbs and I kind
of know where everything is and I'm not

2884
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:24,160
writing a novel.

2885
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,851
You know,

2886
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:28,000
when I'm writing a material or
essays or something like that,

2887
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:28,540
I need,

2888
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,650
I need a fucking keyboard.

2889
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:32,410
You don't think that the
holographic screen that's just here,

2890
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:35,350
you don't think if it just like auto
corrects everything you do and you could

2891
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:37,540
just like maybe,

2892
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,050
but there's,

2893
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:38,650
there's a,

2894
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,700
I liked the tactile too.

2895
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,180
I'm just,

2896
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,580
there's a feeling I like
mechanical keyboards.

2897
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:43,390
In fact,

2898
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:44,930
there's a feeling of knowing.

2899
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,773
Could you,

2900
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,320
did you test out that facetime bug?

2901
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,920
Can you hear about face time bug
and there was a facetime bug where?

2902
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,843
What was it?

2903
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:55,903
You didn't see that?

2904
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,741
I heard about it,

2905
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:58,030
but I didn't look into it at all.

2906
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:01,210
We didn't test it out and play with
basically you could call someone and hear

2907
01:26:01,211 --> 01:26:02,650
them without them picking up.

2908
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,620
Oh yeah.

2909
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,100
Without

2910
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,830
them picking up.

2911
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,330
Then picking it up.

2912
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,900
Yeah,

2913
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:10,900
so the thing is ringing on facetime and
they don't even have to pick up and then

2914
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:12,980
you're on the other end
talking shit about them.

2915
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,150
Yeah.

2916
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:14,480
He's basically surveil anybody,

2917
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,040
Bill and fuck minds.

2918
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,390
That guy's full of shit.

2919
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:18,950
As soon as the big companies come to him,

2920
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:22,100
he's going to stick his ass in the air
just like all of them to the camera can

2921
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:24,350
be turned on to make sense.

2922
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,820
I was thinking about that
when I'm beating off,

2923
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:27,763
don't you?

2924
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:28,963
You should.

2925
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,523
They,

2926
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,020
apple acts like it cares about privacy,

2927
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,680
which maybe it doesn't turn
certain overthinks the FBI,

2928
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,480
I don't know exactly what's,

2929
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:41,300
but we don't know what the
apple phones are doing.

2930
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:41,960
Right.

2931
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,180
Apple is all locked down,

2932
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:45,043
closed source.

2933
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:50,710
And additionally there was a creepy speech
that Tim Cook just just gave creepy.

2934
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,920
Did you see it?

2935
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,340
No.

2936
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,090
Let's listen to it.

2937
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:53,241
Yeah,

2938
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:53,941
let's listen to his show.

2939
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:54,980
He plays folky music,

2940
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:56,810
Adl speech.

2941
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,330
Do you have any spooky music you could
play in the background while he's doing

2942
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:00,164
the speech?

2943
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,900
We might get in trouble for that.

2944
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:04,880
So again,

2945
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,260
it's good intentions.

2946
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:09,440
Like people who want less hate speech,

2947
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:11,100
we all want less h beach.

2948
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,850
Of course we want people
to get along better.

2949
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,103
Right?

2950
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,340
But this idea that I don't
want to give too much away,

2951
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:19,821
but you know,

2952
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:24,821
he's acting as if they are going to be
the moral authority about the types of

2953
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,460
content that can exist on the APP store.

2954
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,413
Yeah.

2955
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:32,630
So I just don't know how that's scalable.

2956
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:33,591
Yeah.

2957
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:34,424
What does that mean?

2958
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,770
Like let's hear what here.

2959
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,380
I was just hoping this
is the right one is,

2960
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:38,150
is it?

2961
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:43,150
It says CEO Tim Cook Banning Hate
Division is the right thing to do.

2962
01:27:43,761 --> 01:27:44,481
12 three,

2963
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:45,680
2018 is that it?

2964
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,520
December.

2965
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:46,910
That's it.

2966
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:47,241
Okay.

2967
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:48,074
Let's hear it.

2968
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,161
Hello,

2969
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:49,994
Tim.

2970
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,553
Volume please.

2971
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:57,110
Devices connected to the
humanity that makes us us.

2972
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,890
We do that in many ways.

2973
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:06,580
What are the most important is how we
honor a teaching that can be found in

2974
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:08,264
Judaism,

2975
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,720
but is shared across all
faiths and traditions.

2976
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,860
It's a lesson that was carried
forward by the late Elie Rizal.

2977
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,170
May his memory be a blessing.

2978
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:27,460
It's a lesson put into practice by
America's Muslim community who raised

2979
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:30,860
thousands for the victims of
the tree of life killings,

2980
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,540
Lowe,

2981
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,410
Tom Mode.

2982
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,030
I'll dom ray ACA.

2983
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:39,260
Do not be indifferent to the
bloodshed of your fellow man.

2984
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:42,770
Do not be indifferent.

2985
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,560
This mandate moves us to speak up
for immigrants and for those who seek

2986
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:53,870
opportunity in the United States.

2987
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,090
We do it not only because
they're individual dignity,

2988
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,170
creativity,

2989
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,190
and ingenuity,

2990
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:05,130
the power to make this
country and even better place,

2991
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,940
but because our own humanity commands us
to welcome those who knew need welcome.

2992
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:19,230
It moves us to speak up for the Lgbtq
community for those whose differences can

2993
01:29:20,531 --> 01:29:23,350
make them a target for violence and scorn.

2994
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,151
We do so.

2995
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:30,151
Not only because these unique and uncommon
perspectives can open our eyes to new

2996
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:32,260
ways of thinking,

2997
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:38,190
but because our own dignity moves
us to see the dignity and others,

2998
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,160
perhaps most importantly,

2999
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,430
it drives us not to be bystanders.

3000
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:46,511
Bystanders,

3001
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:50,860
as hate tries to make its
headquarters in the digital world

3002
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,650
and apple,

3003
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:58,210
we believe that technology needs to
have a clear point of view on this

3004
01:29:58,211 --> 01:29:59,080
challenge.

3005
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,410
There is no time to get tied up in knots.

3006
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,720
Okay?

3007
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,720
That's why we only have one message for
those who seek to push hate division and

3008
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:12,900
violence.

3009
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,820
Yeah.

3010
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:18,420
You have no place on our platforms.

3011
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:23,930
[inaudible]

3012
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:32,710
you have no home here from the earliest
days of Itunes to apple music today.

3013
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,260
We have always prohibited music
with a message of white supremacy.

3014
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,011
Hold on.

3015
01:30:40,011 --> 01:30:40,844
Sorry.

3016
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:43,813
Um,

3017
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,120
what,

3018
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,710
what do you think they're signaling here?

3019
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,040
Like are they signaling that they're
about to start censoring things?

3020
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:51,690
Like what do they already,

3021
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:53,430
are they okay?

3022
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,231
I agree.

3023
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:57,480
The shit you probably shouldn't
put white supremacy music on,

3024
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,050
but there's a lot of like really violent
stuff that you can get on iTunes.

3025
01:31:01,051 --> 01:31:01,350
Right?

3026
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,960
I mean if you go back
to the old Nwa albums,

3027
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:05,940
there's some that's available,

3028
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:06,600
right?

3029
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:06,961
Sure.

3030
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:07,794
I guess I would,

3031
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:08,611
I'm assuming.

3032
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:09,270
Yeah,

3033
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,110
that it is for sure.

3034
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:10,680
But yeah,

3035
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,990
like straight Outta Compton,

3036
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:12,560
uh,

3037
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,580
some violin shit.

3038
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,770
And then how about the
films that they have?

3039
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,620
How about the films that you
can get on the iTunes store?

3040
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,940
There is a lot of very,

3041
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:21,331
very,

3042
01:31:21,331 --> 01:31:23,010
very violent films,

3043
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:24,870
like extremely violent.

3044
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,910
There's a lot of films that like,

3045
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:31,680
is it that they're making the distinction
between something that's fiction that

3046
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:33,300
although it may be disturbing,

3047
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:37,980
you understand that this is a movie and
this is something someone wrote versus

3048
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:42,480
someone art versus versus
someone with commentary,

3049
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:43,470
their commentary say.

3050
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:44,730
And then here's the other thing.

3051
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,780
Well he was saying hate and division.

3052
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,180
They won't promote division,

3053
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,440
but that's a weird one.

3054
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:52,621
Yeah.

3055
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:53,221
That means like,

3056
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:54,000
what does that mean?

3057
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,540
People who disagree with you and what
does division has good intentions.

3058
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:58,740
You can sort of steal it.

3059
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:59,080
Yeah.

3060
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,190
The problem with this,

3061
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,170
that it's,

3062
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:05,170
he's not allowing the
conversation to take place.

3063
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:10,171
So this is in direct conflict with the
Daryl Davises with confronting these

3064
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,310
issues so we can kill it.

3065
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,241
But I think,

3066
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:16,850
uh,

3067
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,900
w w when,

3068
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:21,280
when he's saying you have
no place on our platform,

3069
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:25,090
they probably feel like
you can go somewhere else.

3070
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,890
He's building a wall.

3071
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:27,903
Yeah.

3072
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,661
I mean,

3073
01:32:28,661 --> 01:32:29,590
but this is what I'm saying,

3074
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,480
like everybody kind of feels
like you can go somewhere.

3075
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,500
That's what happens though.

3076
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:35,050
And that's how things get more
radicalized and everybody goes to Gab.

3077
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,470
So I don't know.

3078
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,100
Look,

3079
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,990
the conversation needs to take place.

3080
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,780
People on the lap,

3081
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:42,520
he,

3082
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,630
he's acting like he's
speaking for all Lgbtq people.

3083
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:46,990
Yeah.

3084
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,823
He's not,

3085
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:53,040
there's lots of people on the left and
Lgbtq people aren't always on the left,

3086
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,750
and not all of them want that.

3087
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:55,991
Well,

3088
01:32:55,991 --> 01:32:56,824
not only that,

3089
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,720
there's division in LBG,

3090
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:01,150
t and Q,

3091
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:02,291
like there's a,

3092
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:05,920
there's a big issue right now with Martina
Navratilova that was going on about

3093
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:10,950
her discussing the reality of Trans Women
competing against biological women and

3094
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:16,720
that she opposes it and she thinks
is there some fundamental advantages,

3095
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:21,280
which is leading to a lot of weightlifting
world records being broken by Trans

3096
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,280
Women.

3097
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,641
And she's like,

3098
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:23,050
this is fucking preposterous.

3099
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,230
And including Trans Women with penises,

3100
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:27,040
now they're attacking her
for being trans phobic.

3101
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:32,041
So there's not even a United and United
opinion in the Lbgtq community for sure.

3102
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:35,740
And that's why that uh,

3103
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,350
Megan Murphy I think,

3104
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:38,020
yes,

3105
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:38,853
the,

3106
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,380
I go to this restaurant in Bridgeport,

3107
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,090
Connecticut called blood root,

3108
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,750
which is like sort of an old school
feminist like vegetarian Vegan spot and in

3109
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,610
Bridgeport.

3110
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:49,443
In Bridgeport.

3111
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:50,310
Bridgeport,

3112
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,610
yeah.

3113
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:51,230
Kind con.

3114
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:51,550
No,

3115
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:52,300
no offense.

3116
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,330
I know it's kind of a dot.

3117
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:54,183
Wild place.

3118
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,730
We would have a gathering of the vibes,

3119
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:57,603
music festivals.

3120
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:58,990
I helped organize,

3121
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,770
I used to do stand up in
Bridgeport and I said,

3122
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,410
please call the joker's wild.

3123
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,850
It was a comedy club.

3124
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,880
So only beat a guy with a shoe there,

3125
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,670
a beat a guy in the face with a shoe,

3126
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:11,350
pull the shoe off and to intervene.

3127
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,820
I was 24 I know what
the fuck was going on.

3128
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,021
So anyway,

3129
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:17,770
though,

3130
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,180
that restaurant that you know,

3131
01:34:19,181 --> 01:34:20,050
they get called,

3132
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:20,884
um,

3133
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,460
what is it?

3134
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,800
Turf Turfs.

3135
01:34:23,801 --> 01:34:24,280
Yeah.

3136
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,980
Trans exclusionary radical feminist.

3137
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,440
And so again,

3138
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:29,720
you know,

3139
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,990
they're the old school
ones and they're saying,

3140
01:34:31,991 --> 01:34:32,321
look,

3141
01:34:32,321 --> 01:34:32,771
you know,

3142
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:34,150
we're not against your,

3143
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,013
your battle.

3144
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,700
We're not against trans rights.

3145
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:36,900
I mean,

3146
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:37,130
who,

3147
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:38,260
who would be against trans?

3148
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,720
But they're just saying
that's not our thing.

3149
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:41,554
So again,

3150
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:46,000
there's diversity and they're trying to
clump everyone together and the whole

3151
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:47,590
intersectional world.

3152
01:34:47,591 --> 01:34:48,610
And I look,

3153
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:50,110
people want to band together.

3154
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,300
The oppressed groups
want to band together.

3155
01:34:52,301 --> 01:34:53,070
They should.

3156
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:53,410
Yeah.

3157
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,243
But like,

3158
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:55,510
it's not that simple.

3159
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,230
Well,

3160
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,160
there's always going to be

3161
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,480
differing opinions.

3162
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:01,370
And especially when you
have something like,

3163
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,330
you know,

3164
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:07,160
Trans Women competing against
biological women and you know,

3165
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:09,950
you have someone like Martina
Navratilova that made her,

3166
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:13,820
her life's work and her career
competing as a biological woman.

3167
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,290
Um,

3168
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,910
she's gonna have some opposition to that.

3169
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:20,060
And then the idea that everyone's supposed
to be lumped in together with some

3170
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:24,710
mandate that no one has really openly
discussed and you're supposed to agree and

3171
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:26,510
it fluctuates and moves like the tide,

3172
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,680
you know,

3173
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,750
like what is in his and
moves like the Todd,

3174
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,390
it just changes.

3175
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:34,460
It's like this court of public opinion.

3176
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:34,701
It's,

3177
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:37,590
it's constantly rendering
new verdicts and you,

3178
01:35:37,591 --> 01:35:39,350
you have to keep up and catch up.

3179
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:43,130
Things that were acceptable just a few
years ago are totally unacceptable.

3180
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:45,590
It mean comedy is,

3181
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:47,150
is the key area too.

3182
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:47,751
Yeah.

3183
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:49,430
It is not what,

3184
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,780
what's happening on social media now.

3185
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:53,870
Not Sustainable for
comedy because it's fine.

3186
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,890
Oh really?

3187
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:55,520
Yeah,

3188
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,353
it is.

3189
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,320
It is.

3190
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:57,860
How?

3191
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,320
Because it creates
outrage and then comedy,

3192
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,390
it relieves that pressure.

3193
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,260
Like,

3194
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,093
believe me,

3195
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,440
there's a lot of blow back and believe me,

3196
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:08,000
there's a lot of debate and discussion,

3197
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:08,451
but also,

3198
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:09,284
believe me,

3199
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:13,400
when someone does do some
politically incorrect,

3200
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:14,151
really good,

3201
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,190
stand up people go fucking bonkers.

3202
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,053
They love it.

3203
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:18,050
It's going,

3204
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,110
it's like one of the best times
ever right now to do stand up.

3205
01:36:21,111 --> 01:36:22,750
People go fucking April.

3206
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,211
Yeah,

3207
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:23,481
no,

3208
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:24,770
it's incredible material.

3209
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:27,630
But I'm just saying for you know,

3210
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,110
comics that are running into issues
with getting banned or when not,

3211
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:32,953
I mean,

3212
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:33,231
well,

3213
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:34,850
who's running into issues
with getting banned?

3214
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,303
I mean,

3215
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:37,971
I think,

3216
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:38,241
you know,

3217
01:36:38,241 --> 01:36:39,190
one Oh,

3218
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:39,590
when,

3219
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,010
yeah,

3220
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:40,550
yeah.

3221
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,690
Owens had some issues.

3222
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,680
Yeah.

3223
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:43,513
Um,

3224
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:44,691
and you know,

3225
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:47,240
you could make some arguments at
Owens not doing so well right now.

3226
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:48,493
Um,

3227
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,890
but he's also developing his
following because of the factors.

3228
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,620
People that don't agree
with him being banned.

3229
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:55,281
He's,

3230
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:56,900
he's a very specific example.

3231
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,070
Um,

3232
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:00,080
other people that are being banned.

3233
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,361
Do you know of,

3234
01:37:02,361 --> 01:37:02,470
uh,

3235
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:03,590
other who,

3236
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,410
what other standup comedians
and a bunch of comics on,

3237
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,480
maybe they haven't been
fully band from social media,

3238
01:37:08,481 --> 01:37:09,890
but they've had their performances,

3239
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:11,300
uh,

3240
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,120
shutdown.

3241
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,400
Who was that one guy who was like,

3242
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:13,651
oh,

3243
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:14,484
new mash.

3244
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:15,020
Tell,

3245
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,370
but that was at a college.

3246
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:17,360
See,

3247
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:17,991
do the same.

3248
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:19,790
It's the same thing.

3249
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,510
Yes.

3250
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:24,020
But universities have been
bad for that for a long time.

3251
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:24,780
Uh,

3252
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:29,600
they're the most sensitive of all
audiences and they're the ones who are the

3253
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:30,171
most,

3254
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:30,980
uh,

3255
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,850
they believe the most,

3256
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:36,410
that they're going to change the
world and that their ideals are there,

3257
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,890
their ideals are rock solid and they
have to push back against anything that

3258
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:40,580
opposes them.

3259
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,320
Ari was temporarily banned.

3260
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,640
That was an accident.

3261
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:44,390
Yeah.

3262
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:47,900
The Ra thing was he was joking around
and they thought he was making legitimate

3263
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:48,730
death threat.

3264
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:48,980
Could it,

3265
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:49,371
that could happen,

3266
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:50,720
but joking around with
a good friend of ours,

3267
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:51,400
the,

3268
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,440
the algorithms are our key in the
moderators are just not right.

3269
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,303
We can't

3270
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,700
just be having this happen all the
time and then they just keep saying,

3271
01:37:59,701 --> 01:37:59,851
oh,

3272
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:00,570
sorry,

3273
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:01,403
sorry.

3274
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,620
There has to be a new approach completely.

3275
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,000
It can't just be,

3276
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:06,211
oh,

3277
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,260
let them back on and,

3278
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:10,530
and just keep doing what they're doing.

3279
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:15,830
Like we need to completely reapproach
how moderation is happening.

3280
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:18,930
The whole policies situation,

3281
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,280
the transparency situation.

3282
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:21,330
It's not just a matter of

3283
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,780
going to the overlords and saying,

3284
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,080
Hey,

3285
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:25,500
can I,

3286
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,730
can I please come back?

3287
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:27,220
Right.

3288
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:27,510
It's,

3289
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,343
that's not,

3290
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:33,780
that's not suitable for the communication
structure of the planet earth.

3291
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:34,731
Well,

3292
01:38:34,731 --> 01:38:39,731
I think what's not suitable
is that commerce should not
dictate how human beings

3293
01:38:39,771 --> 01:38:41,510
are allowed to openly
communicate with each other.

3294
01:38:41,511 --> 01:38:45,140
And one of the things that Jack said
that's kind of contrary to his company's

3295
01:38:45,141 --> 01:38:48,770
actions was that he believes that the
ability to communicate as a fundamental

3296
01:38:48,771 --> 01:38:49,310
right,

3297
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,900
like the ability to get electricity.

3298
01:38:50,901 --> 01:38:52,130
Like if you're in the KKK,

3299
01:38:52,131 --> 01:38:53,600
you could still order electricity,

3300
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:54,441
you know?

3301
01:38:54,441 --> 01:38:57,980
So should you be able to just
distribute information if people say no,

3302
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,911
then you have to say,

3303
01:38:58,911 --> 01:38:59,241
okay,

3304
01:38:59,241 --> 01:39:03,350
well who's to decide what can
and cannot be distributed?

3305
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:06,680
And then who's to decide if
they can go somewhere else.

3306
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:09,560
And then what happens if you tell
a person they can't go anywhere,

3307
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:10,910
then things get really weird.

3308
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,620
We're looking at more of a

3309
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:18,150
community moderation structure so that
we've even been considering like a juror

3310
01:39:19,301 --> 01:39:24,130
system so that if we make a bad
decision in someone appeals it,

3311
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,160
then the community can potentially make
the decisions as opposed to us or you

3312
01:39:29,501 --> 01:39:29,770
know.

3313
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:33,460
But then when you go further enough for
far enough into the decentralization

3314
01:39:33,461 --> 01:39:34,030
world,

3315
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:35,230
it just becomes impossible.

3316
01:39:35,231 --> 01:39:36,880
So we sort of have to decide.

3317
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,130
I think that's where it's going to go.

3318
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,713
So

3319
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,113
I don't know.

3320
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,193
I don't,

3321
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,813
that's,

3322
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:51,330
that's the uncensorable Internet and
this idea that we can do things and then

3323
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:52,901
just delete them.

3324
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:54,490
Like in the Gdpr,

3325
01:39:54,491 --> 01:39:57,970
the European privacy laws have this
whole idea of the right to be forgotten

3326
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,073
online,

3327
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:03,430
which is very difficult because
deleting things from any database,

3328
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:06,760
specially a blockchain is not easy.

3329
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,800
So the idea that you
can go on the internet,

3330
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,480
do crazy shit,

3331
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,060
and then just have it taken away.

3332
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:19,500
It's a paradox because
privacy means control,

3333
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,640
but you know,

3334
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:22,040
it,

3335
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:27,040
it doesn't jive with the way that
technology works to just be able to delete

3336
01:40:27,311 --> 01:40:31,510
things like you're writing to a database
that's not even how the universe

3337
01:40:31,511 --> 01:40:32,440
probably really works.

3338
01:40:32,441 --> 01:40:33,310
Like you can't just say,

3339
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:33,971
oh,

3340
01:40:33,971 --> 01:40:36,760
I just went and punched that guy in
the face and the bar and I just want to

3341
01:40:36,761 --> 01:40:38,470
delete that from having happened.

3342
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:38,790
Right?

3343
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,623
Like,

3344
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,203
yeah.

3345
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,290
Yeah.

3346
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:44,123
Um,

3347
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,383
and again,

3348
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:49,620
I think that what we're
dealing with now is like,

3349
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:51,450
you have to interface with it,

3350
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,080
right?

3351
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,890
You have to interface with your computer.

3352
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:56,920
You have to interface with your
phone to access all this stuff.

3353
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:02,490
My real concern is that that's just a
temporary step and that we're going to

3354
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:07,030
just consistently and constantly be
interfaced with all of each other.

3355
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:07,601
You know,

3356
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:09,910
Ilan brought something up
when he was on the podcast,

3357
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:11,080
um,

3358
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,290
called neuro link and he didn't want
to fully describe it cause he said he

3359
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:14,591
couldn't,

3360
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:16,300
but he said it's going to be live within,

3361
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:16,541
you know,

3362
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,160
a matter of x amount of months.

3363
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:22,600
And he was talking about it increasing
the bandwidth between human beings and

3364
01:41:22,601 --> 01:41:25,780
information in a radical way
that's going to change society.

3365
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:28,410
That is what I'm talking about.

3366
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,070
He's talking about an
injection you basically do in
like your throat and it's a

3367
01:41:32,071 --> 01:41:34,110
neural lace and it just,

3368
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:34,620
you know,

3369
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,300
threads around your brain,

3370
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,530
watts and yeah.

3371
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:38,161
You serious?

3372
01:41:38,161 --> 01:41:38,341
Yeah,

3373
01:41:38,341 --> 01:41:38,730
that's,

3374
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:39,270
yeah,

3375
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:40,110
that's what he's talking about.

3376
01:41:40,111 --> 01:41:40,390
Yeah.

3377
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:41,223
Yeah.

3378
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:44,370
So damn alien trying
to turn us into robots.

3379
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,570
So the question is,

3380
01:41:45,571 --> 01:41:47,160
what's the nature of those robots?

3381
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,950
Robots are going to exist and they exist,

3382
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:50,250
right?

3383
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:54,240
But should you shoot them into your
brain if you're dying of cancer?

3384
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:55,613
Would you,

3385
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:56,370
yeah,

3386
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:58,860
I'd want to see God and see what's up.

3387
01:41:58,980 --> 01:41:59,850
So like,

3388
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:01,140
do the nanobots,

3389
01:42:01,141 --> 01:42:01,350
you know,

3390
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:02,730
the Kurzweil talks about like,

3391
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,290
do we have control as a
community over those robots?

3392
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,710
What's,

3393
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:11,070
what's the code running those
saying are they infallible?

3394
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:11,731
I mean,

3395
01:42:11,731 --> 01:42:12,291
what if they crack?

3396
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:12,481
I mean,

3397
01:42:12,481 --> 01:42:15,130
our fucking tricaster
crashes every other podcast.

3398
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:15,330
Yeah.

3399
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,280
Whether it's open source or free or not,

3400
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,070
makes no difference to whether
it can fuck up your brain.

3401
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:20,281
Right.

3402
01:42:20,281 --> 01:42:23,160
What if somebody puts that shit
in and then for whatever reason,

3403
01:42:23,161 --> 01:42:26,790
they have a blown fuse and they stomp
on the gas and drive right into a tree.

3404
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,100
It depends on the level of
risk you're willing to take.

3405
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:29,370
I mean,

3406
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,480
you see some of those videos I like,

3407
01:42:30,481 --> 01:42:31,890
I've cried at those videos where like,

3408
01:42:31,891 --> 01:42:32,490
the,

3409
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,250
the woman like here for the first time,

3410
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:34,560
you're like,

3411
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:34,840
oh,

3412
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,330
yeah,

3413
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:35,631
yeah,

3414
01:42:35,631 --> 01:42:35,941
yeah.

3415
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:38,280
That's something people seeing
color for the first time

3416
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,350
and putting on certain glasses
that allow them to see car.

3417
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:41,131
Yeah.

3418
01:42:41,131 --> 01:42:42,300
All this stuff's amazing.

3419
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:42,871
I mean,

3420
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,610
that did all that stuff is very cool.

3421
01:42:44,611 --> 01:42:45,240
And,

3422
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:45,720
um,

3423
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,390
in talking to David Sinclair
and he was talking about,

3424
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:48,690
uh,

3425
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:53,690
emerging technologies in with reversing
aging and age related diseases.

3426
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:55,100
I mean we're,

3427
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:59,770
we're anting are entering into an
incredibly strange time for the,

3428
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,780
the influence of technology
and innovation on,

3429
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:03,840
on human beings,

3430
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,670
on our bodies and our brains.

3431
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:07,380
And we're going to have to decide,

3432
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:07,990
you know,

3433
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,823
how,

3434
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,370
how far you want to go on
this ride next top far rock.

3435
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,670
Like when are you getting now?

3436
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:13,504
I lived there,

3437
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:15,601
I lived on the beach.

3438
01:43:15,601 --> 01:43:16,920
Then I'm going,

3439
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:18,280
well no,

3440
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:18,660
I don't know.

3441
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,300
But you know what I'm saying?

3442
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:20,420
It's like one of those things like what,

3443
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:21,510
where do you get off?

3444
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:22,050
Like when,

3445
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:22,351
what,

3446
01:43:22,351 --> 01:43:23,071
where do you go that?

3447
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:23,251
Okay,

3448
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:24,084
that's enough.

3449
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:25,021
You know,

3450
01:43:25,021 --> 01:43:25,621
like with you,

3451
01:43:25,621 --> 01:43:26,760
you're deleting Facebook,

3452
01:43:26,761 --> 01:43:30,870
you lead to delete Instagram and you
go just going to be on mines and that's

3453
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:31,350
enough.

3454
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:32,310
And going other places,

3455
01:43:32,311 --> 01:43:33,300
I mean these,

3456
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,440
there are alternatives that
are getting very big yes.

3457
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,770
And together like what?

3458
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,840
Like signal has tens of millions of users.

3459
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,680
I don't know what that is.

3460
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,400
I've never heard of it.

3461
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,800
That's like the encrypted
messaging app that,

3462
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:47,663
do you know it,

3463
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:49,950
it's open source.

3464
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:50,521
What is it?

3465
01:43:50,521 --> 01:43:51,354
Snow

3466
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,810
is on their advisory board or whatnot.

3467
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,650
What is signal?

3468
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:55,670
It's just a messaging APP.

3469
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,880
So a message but like a
whatsapp or like a Twitter,

3470
01:43:59,240 --> 01:43:59,690
whatsapp.

3471
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,570
So you have to know the person
and then contact them through it.

3472
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:03,130
Yeah,

3473
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:03,851
but we're talking,

3474
01:44:03,851 --> 01:44:04,071
we're,

3475
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:04,980
we're considering a,

3476
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,740
using the signal protocol
for our messaging system
cause our messaging system

3477
01:44:08,741 --> 01:44:09,431
needs an upgrade.

3478
01:44:09,431 --> 01:44:12,320
But all of us together are going to be,

3479
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,830
be able to create sort of like a,

3480
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:20,160
a group of apps that are like sort of
a more open freedom supporting privacy

3481
01:44:22,961 --> 01:44:24,190
alternative and like,

3482
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:24,820
so it's,

3483
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,890
we're not gonna solve it by ourselves and

3484
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:32,980
it would be way easier if one of these
big companies would just switch gears and

3485
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,210
start doing things the right way.

3486
01:44:34,211 --> 01:44:37,870
I mean we've spent eight
years building this.

3487
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,360
If one of the big companies,

3488
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,230
Google,

3489
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:43,750
Facebook had just been
free and open source,

3490
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:48,130
we would have spent the last seven
years building on top of them.

3491
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:49,001
Right.

3492
01:44:49,001 --> 01:44:50,080
Because you know,

3493
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:52,300
they already did something cool
that they're sharing with everybody.

3494
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,650
So it's,

3495
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:58,650
it's actually closed source project
stifle innovation because if you think we

3496
01:44:58,691 --> 01:44:59,530
had to reinvent the wheel,

3497
01:44:59,531 --> 01:45:00,040
we literally,

3498
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:03,100
we went and built an alternative with
much of the similar functionality.

3499
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:08,320
Think about how how much further the
world would be if everyone was building on

3500
01:45:08,321 --> 01:45:10,000
top of more common.

3501
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:14,890
But you are looking at it in terms
of your own personal benefit.

3502
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:17,830
You're looking in terms of
mine's personal benefit.

3503
01:45:17,831 --> 01:45:19,000
I mean you created this thing,

3504
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:21,460
it's not just pure for altruistic reasons.

3505
01:45:21,461 --> 01:45:22,294
It's a business,

3506
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:22,750
right?

3507
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:27,750
So if they had established this open
source network that was Facebook and he

3508
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,790
just came along and built yours,

3509
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:31,091
well that,

3510
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:31,271
yeah,

3511
01:45:31,271 --> 01:45:32,260
that would be great for you.

3512
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,760
But why would that be great for them?

3513
01:45:33,761 --> 01:45:34,070
I mean they,

3514
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,840
they're obviously in a business now
the problem with the businesses,

3515
01:45:37,841 --> 01:45:41,530
this business is the business
of distributing information
and then we have to

3516
01:45:41,531 --> 01:45:42,130
decide,

3517
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:42,431
okay,

3518
01:45:42,431 --> 01:45:47,431
at what point in time do we allow these
air quotes overlords to dictate what can

3519
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:49,480
and cannot be distributed?

3520
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:50,770
And how did this happen?

3521
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,000
Because in the beginning,

3522
01:45:52,001 --> 01:45:53,110
I bet it didn't happen.

3523
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:56,920
I bet in the beginning you can just put
it on whatever the fuck you wanted and

3524
01:45:56,921 --> 01:45:59,170
then they had to deal with that and then
they had to figure out after a while,

3525
01:45:59,171 --> 01:45:59,560
okay,

3526
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,060
maybe we shouldn't have this on like,

3527
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:01,450
hey,

3528
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:03,550
if if we're going to sell advertising,

3529
01:46:03,551 --> 01:46:05,410
we really should maximize
the amount of clicks.

3530
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:05,980
Okay,

3531
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:06,880
how do we do that?

3532
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:08,380
While we put things in people's feeds,

3533
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,223
they want to see,

3534
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:12,910
we put things that people want to debate
about and argue about and political

3535
01:46:12,911 --> 01:46:15,670
things and all sorts of different things
that excite them and get them to be

3536
01:46:15,671 --> 01:46:17,860
engaged with the platform that's,

3537
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,000
that's their business.

3538
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:19,840
The businesses,

3539
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:25,350
I mean it's no different in a lot of ways
than Amazon or then any other business

3540
01:46:25,661 --> 01:46:26,530
that wants to grow.

3541
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,340
Like how does,

3542
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:28,750
how do they grow while they grow?

3543
01:46:28,751 --> 01:46:33,751
By maximizing their profits and by
maximizing the amount of eyes that get to

3544
01:46:34,541 --> 01:46:37,960
their advertising so they get more
clicks and more people get engaged.

3545
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,480
That's what their businesses,

3546
01:46:39,490 --> 01:46:42,790
you're deciding by saying
if they were open source,

3547
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,620
look how much further along
in the world would be.

3548
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:45,910
They would be further along to,

3549
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,260
I don't know if they
would agree with that.

3550
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:50,190
I don't think they're there worth
fucking cajillions of dollars.

3551
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,180
So they figured it out.

3552
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:55,980
Well it just depends on whether or not
you think that people have a right to

3553
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:58,170
know what is going on.

3554
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:58,501
It's,

3555
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:00,060
I mean it's like food transparency.

3556
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:00,541
Well yeah,

3557
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:00,930
we were.

3558
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,161
Yeah.

3559
01:47:01,161 --> 01:47:01,290
We,

3560
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,220
so I'll talk about that.

3561
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:02,810
I like,

3562
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:07,810
I will talk about that till the end of
the time you were interfacing with this

3563
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:09,630
and it's affecting us.

3564
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,380
I agree.

3565
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:10,830
Yeah.

3566
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:12,240
I fully agree with what you're saying.

3567
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:15,900
I'm playing devil's advocate by saying
that in their position they have a

3568
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:20,220
business and their business is to make
money and they're going to lose because

3569
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:25,221
of what they're doing because it's not
even half post losing active users,

3570
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:26,220
are they?

3571
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:26,670
Yeah,

3572
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:29,110
but I thought their business
went up after the hearing.

3573
01:47:29,111 --> 01:47:30,000
We did it,

3574
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:31,020
but it's not going to last.

3575
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:31,290
I mean,

3576
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:31,540
look,

3577
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:32,373
you say that

3578
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:35,370
it's just the game's over.

3579
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:39,120
It's going to take a long time
for us to build it up as you know,

3580
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:41,760
all of these different organizations
and companies working together.

3581
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,593
But

3582
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:45,780
Linux for instance,

3583
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:48,600
is the operating system that most banks,

3584
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:50,260
it is the most popular operating system.

3585
01:47:50,261 --> 01:47:50,610
The world.

3586
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:50,830
It's,

3587
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,390
it's,

3588
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:51,630
it's,

3589
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:51,920
yeah,

3590
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:52,240
it's open.

3591
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:53,790
So it's in your phone.

3592
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:55,230
It's in everywhere.

3593
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,720
It got there because of that,

3594
01:47:57,721 --> 01:48:00,690
because everyone used it and
incorporate it into their product.

3595
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:01,710
Facebook,

3596
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:06,540
they are all using free and open
source software in their stacks.

3597
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,030
They're just not sharing their
product with everybody else.

3598
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:11,190
So they're benefiting from
it but not giving back.

3599
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:13,220
And you know,

3600
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,580
I almost feel like I shouldn't even
be saying that they should just pivot

3601
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:18,870
because you know,

3602
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:22,290
that's their only chance to survive.

3603
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:26,160
So this is based on your
estimations of the future?

3604
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:27,751
Yeah,

3605
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:32,520
it just seems like things are becoming
more open and if there's that possible

3606
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:36,720
because you engage with a lot of other
super nerds and you guys all have the

3607
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:37,740
similar ideas.

3608
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,170
You just have to look at
what's happening with bitcoin.

3609
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:42,150
I don't know what's
happening with bitcoin.

3610
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:45,420
It's become a bitcoin and
ethereum and you know,

3611
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:47,410
lots of other blockchains are,

3612
01:48:47,411 --> 01:48:47,590
are,

3613
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:49,290
are growing really fast.

3614
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:49,920
Maybe the,

3615
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,101
you know,

3616
01:48:50,101 --> 01:48:51,180
the price is separate,

3617
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,430
the development energy,

3618
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:57,240
the number of people who are building
apps on top of bitcoin and ethereum is

3619
01:48:57,241 --> 01:48:58,560
growing massively.

3620
01:48:58,590 --> 01:48:58,860
There's,

3621
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,250
there's,

3622
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:04,250
it's a whole new infrastructure that's
like a common protocol that people can

3623
01:49:04,951 --> 01:49:05,784
build on.

3624
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,860
So that is growing rapidly.

3625
01:49:07,861 --> 01:49:09,420
The price is secondary.

3626
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:12,240
That's not even what bitcoin
and ethereum are really about.

3627
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,033
It's,

3628
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:14,340
it's,

3629
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,470
it's a decentralized database.

3630
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,890
So this is just where the Internet,

3631
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,690
the Internet is meant to be decentralized.

3632
01:49:21,691 --> 01:49:23,070
It sort of started out that way.

3633
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:28,190
And then we moved into this like web to
silo system with like just these massive

3634
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:30,750
companies that are controlling everything.

3635
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:31,860
But it's gonna,

3636
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,180
it's gonna keep waving.

3637
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,080
Okay.

3638
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,471
Again,

3639
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:35,580
to play devil's advocate,

3640
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:38,730
the vast amount of users are
not using those platforms.

3641
01:49:38,731 --> 01:49:42,720
A vast amount of users are using these
controlled platforms like Facebook and

3642
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:43,620
Instagram and Twitter.

3643
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:45,240
Like if that's,

3644
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:45,571
if you're,

3645
01:49:45,571 --> 01:49:46,740
if you're talking about,

3646
01:49:46,741 --> 01:49:47,381
I'm just guessing,

3647
01:49:47,381 --> 01:49:48,430
but if you talking about the,

3648
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:49,360
the,

3649
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,320
the gross number of human beings that
are interacting with each other on social

3650
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:53,890
media,

3651
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:56,560
they're mostly uncontrolled networks.

3652
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:58,960
You're saying this is not gonna last,

3653
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:01,980
but there's no evidence
that it isn't going to last.

3654
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:03,160
There's tons of evidence.

3655
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:04,000
What does the evidence,

3656
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,900
Wikipedia,

3657
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,120
what is happening in card?

3658
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:09,130
I remember that desk you
put in your computer,

3659
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:10,390
that was your encyclopedia.

3660
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:12,573
Where is that?

3661
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:13,870
No one uses it.

3662
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:14,770
It's okay.

3663
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:15,190
That's,

3664
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:16,023
that's different.

3665
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:17,740
This is not a social media network.

3666
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:21,610
The social media networks that people
are using are almost all controlled,

3667
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:22,480
right?

3668
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:22,990
Yeah.

3669
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:23,620
No it's not.

3670
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:25,120
It's going to take a very,

3671
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,500
very long how long?

3672
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:31,090
I would say 10 years.

3673
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:33,580
And what do you think is
going to be the catalyst?

3674
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:36,930
Like what's going to cause these people
to make this radical shift to open

3675
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:37,764
source?

3676
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,250
I think we have to be,

3677
01:50:39,251 --> 01:50:42,040
we have responsibility to
be competitive functionally.

3678
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:43,500
Like you know one's does.

3679
01:50:43,501 --> 01:50:43,640
Yeah.

3680
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,473
We just saying we do,

3681
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,281
we're getting,

3682
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:46,240
we're moving there fast.

3683
01:50:46,241 --> 01:50:50,830
Like we just hired a ton of new
developers and it's going to take time.

3684
01:50:50,831 --> 01:50:51,700
We're not there yet.

3685
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,180
Right.

3686
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:57,180
But once we have functionally competitive
products that you wouldn't even know

3687
01:50:58,391 --> 01:51:00,250
the difference and there's
enough people there,

3688
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:01,960
then it's basically the decision of,

3689
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,213
uh,

3690
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:03,970
you know,

3691
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:07,480
am I going to choose the one that respects
my privacy and freedom or are the one

3692
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:07,991
that doesn't?

3693
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:08,500
And people,

3694
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,560
our kids don't like Facebook,

3695
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:12,250
right?

3696
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:12,670
No.

3697
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:13,840
Everyone is sick of it.

3698
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:15,250
We're just drug addicts.

3699
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,163
Hmm.

3700
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:18,513
Um,

3701
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:22,340
is that what it is that just
sucked into this thing where you,

3702
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:25,630
you constantly want to check
and see who's writing what and,

3703
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:25,991
yeah,

3704
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:27,160
and there's monopolies,

3705
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:27,880
arguably.

3706
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:28,713
Yeah.

3707
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:29,710
Yeah.

3708
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,130
Right.

3709
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,690
Especially when Facebook owns Instagram.

3710
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:32,524
Right.

3711
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:34,570
What if they bought Twitter as well?

3712
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:35,831
They almost did.

3713
01:51:35,831 --> 01:51:38,890
I think Google almost an attorney
who steps in and buys everything.

3714
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:40,300
Then you look,

3715
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,500
oh no,

3716
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:42,281
they probably could.

3717
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:43,114
Right?

3718
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:44,290
Yeah,

3719
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:45,123
they easily could.

3720
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:48,130
They could probably buy
everything apple code with cash.

3721
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:48,880
Yeah.

3722
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,420
Yeah.

3723
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:51,700
Tim Cook had come in with
a big purple pimp suit on,

3724
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:54,250
just slap down a briefcase pitch.

3725
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,840
I just wonder and like,

3726
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:56,170
look,

3727
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:56,561
all the,

3728
01:51:56,561 --> 01:51:57,910
all these executives,

3729
01:51:58,860 --> 01:51:59,693
you know,

3730
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,480
Jack seems like a cool person.

3731
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:02,350
He's a very nice guy.

3732
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,243
It's not,

3733
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:07,660
I just sent so much
inconsistency and you know,

3734
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,930
he's talking about Bitcoin,

3735
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:14,860
like it's this important new
internet money simultaneous,

3736
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:15,371
which is,

3737
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:18,490
he knows the infrastructure is open,

3738
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:22,510
but then his platforms are the opposite.

3739
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,060
Why is he so inconsistent?

3740
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,511
It's like there's,

3741
01:52:25,511 --> 01:52:28,960
it's just hypocritical to the maximum.

3742
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:32,260
I think it's partly because
it's a giant business,

3743
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:32,951
you know?

3744
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:37,060
And I think when you have an obligation
to your shareholders and to maximize

3745
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:39,700
profits and when you're trying
to maximize profits too,

3746
01:52:39,701 --> 01:52:40,481
and there's the,

3747
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:43,600
this universal growth model where
every year just has to get a little bit

3748
01:52:43,601 --> 01:52:43,931
bigger.

3749
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:45,650
Otherwise you're fucking up as a CEO.

3750
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,680
Like you don't have to
experience that with mines.

3751
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,240
We're one of the cofounders.

3752
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,860
How many people are involved?

3753
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:54,470
It's like 15 of us now.

3754
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:59,050
And do you have like a board we sit around
when you make critical decisions such

3755
01:52:59,130 --> 01:52:59,963
stressful as fuck.

3756
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:00,903
Yeah.

3757
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:03,610
Luckily we've started off from
the point where we're saying,

3758
01:53:03,611 --> 01:53:03,881
okay,

3759
01:53:03,881 --> 01:53:07,180
we're embedding principles
into how we're doing things.

3760
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:12,700
So we're not in a position
where we would ever change that,

3761
01:53:12,701 --> 01:53:15,520
that that's for us to do.

3762
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:18,700
That would just be a total waste of time.

3763
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:19,563
Right.

3764
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:24,160
So we're making it harder for ourselves
to make money in the beginning.

3765
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:29,730
We're making it harder for ourselves to
grow because we are not gonna compromise

3766
01:53:29,771 --> 01:53:31,930
people's privacy in
order to do those things.

3767
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:34,870
And so we're just going
to build up slowly,

3768
01:53:34,871 --> 01:53:36,630
steadily finding it.

3769
01:53:36,631 --> 01:53:38,050
Just get there when we get there.

3770
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,730
How much time a day is this?

3771
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:42,340
How much of an obligation is this for you?

3772
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:46,720
Same as any job.

3773
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:47,021
I'm,

3774
01:53:47,021 --> 01:53:47,251
it's,

3775
01:53:47,251 --> 01:53:48,940
it sucks because you know,

3776
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,340
my wife Allie would say like,

3777
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,760
it's too blurred my life because
it's like what is pleasure?

3778
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,030
What does,

3779
01:53:58,030 --> 01:53:59,230
I mean it's probably happens with you too.

3780
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:02,080
Like when you're on your phone,

3781
01:54:02,110 --> 01:54:07,110
like your family doesn't know if you're
working or if you're doing something for

3782
01:54:09,281 --> 01:54:10,114
fun.

3783
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:12,520
It's like your work is sort
of in the digital realm.

3784
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,770
Partially a lot of them.

3785
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:17,980
So it's like I just need to put
it down like no phones in bed.

3786
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:21,280
These kinds of things like strict lines.

3787
01:54:21,630 --> 01:54:22,463
Yeah,

3788
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:23,220
that is,

3789
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,053
that is huge.

3790
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,290
Strict lines are huge.

3791
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,520
Um,

3792
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:27,000
yeah.

3793
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,610
Putting your phone in a physical
place and pushing it away.

3794
01:54:30,150 --> 01:54:30,660
You know,

3795
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:31,493
like that's,

3796
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,611
it's huge.

3797
01:54:32,611 --> 01:54:33,370
It's just the,

3798
01:54:33,370 --> 01:54:35,970
the compulsion to look and check,

3799
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:38,790
like Instagram feeds to see
if there's any cool pictures.

3800
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:40,530
Like what the fuck am I doing?

3801
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:42,660
Like why am I compelled to do this?

3802
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:43,980
There's no benefit.

3803
01:54:43,981 --> 01:54:45,870
Like occasionally if I'm bored,

3804
01:54:45,871 --> 01:54:46,950
like I'm in the dentist's office,

3805
01:54:46,951 --> 01:54:47,551
you have 10 minutes.

3806
01:54:47,551 --> 01:54:47,860
All right.

3807
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:50,100
What could see what the
fuck's going on in the news?

3808
01:54:50,490 --> 01:54:52,020
Like maybe occasionally,

3809
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:55,290
but there's so much of your time,

3810
01:54:55,291 --> 01:54:56,400
it's dedicated to that.

3811
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,570
So much of it,

3812
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:03,320
it's so taxing and it's so involved
and so many people are doing.

3813
01:55:04,771 --> 01:55:04,921
I mean,

3814
01:55:04,921 --> 01:55:07,650
I went to a restaurant the other day
and I was looking around and fucking

3815
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:10,890
everyone was sitting at a
table looking at their phone.

3816
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,671
It's,

3817
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:13,200
we've ever did this stack game.

3818
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,100
What's that?

3819
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,720
Just like if you're out to
dinner with a bunch of people,

3820
01:55:15,721 --> 01:55:19,870
just everyone's put their phone in a
stack in the middle when you could do it,

3821
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,753
then you pay.

3822
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:21,930
Oh,

3823
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:22,710
I'd rather just,

3824
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:23,543
just not,

3825
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,230
not,

3826
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:25,063
yeah,

3827
01:55:25,230 --> 01:55:28,680
people's people wipe their butts
and don't fucking wash their hands.

3828
01:55:28,681 --> 01:55:29,730
And touch their phone.

3829
01:55:29,731 --> 01:55:30,031
And you know,

3830
01:55:30,031 --> 01:55:32,370
your phone is filled with
all kinds of dirty shit.

3831
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:37,380
They like done these a swab tests of
phones are covered with Ecolab and Pete

3832
01:55:37,381 --> 01:55:38,214
were gross.

3833
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,383
I'm not [inaudible],

3834
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:40,570
I'm a little Germaphobe.

3835
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:42,120
My fucking hands clean pro.

3836
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:42,930
I'm not,

3837
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:46,860
but I know your phone probably has your
butt all over it to just be honest.

3838
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:48,530
That's true.

3839
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:49,350
How long have you don't have to,

3840
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:50,250
but I know what you're saying.

3841
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:51,084
Like it's a good idea.

3842
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:51,721
You know,

3843
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:52,260
um,

3844
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,080
uh,

3845
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:53,310
the,

3846
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:54,143
um,

3847
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,420
the guys who run Joe beef in Montreal,

3848
01:55:57,421 --> 01:55:58,680
it's this amazing restaurant,

3849
01:55:59,210 --> 01:55:59,551
uh,

3850
01:55:59,551 --> 01:56:00,780
Fred and Dave and they were,

3851
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:01,830
they were talking about it,

3852
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,180
but when they go to dinner,

3853
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:04,380
they shut their phone off.

3854
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,580
Like I'm going to,

3855
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:05,851
I'm a,

3856
01:56:05,851 --> 01:56:07,170
I'm a good guest,

3857
01:56:07,171 --> 01:56:08,040
a good table guests.

3858
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:09,420
I shut my phone off.

3859
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:10,381
I don't,

3860
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:11,700
I don't engage it on check it.

3861
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:12,450
It's so,

3862
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:12,661
you know,

3863
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:13,470
it's a,

3864
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:18,470
it's a similar thing to a podcasting in
a way in that one of the good benefits

3865
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,090
of podcasting is that for
three hours or two hours,

3866
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:21,960
whatever the fuck you're doing,

3867
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:26,100
you're going to sit down and you just can
engage with a person to see you and I,

3868
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:27,090
me and bill,

3869
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,590
we're just talking right.

3870
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:30,270
And that we're not checking our phone,

3871
01:56:30,271 --> 01:56:31,770
we're not looking at the television,

3872
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:35,100
we're not looking at the
laptop is no distractions.

3873
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:38,250
And that is one of the rare moments in
life where you get to talk to someone for

3874
01:56:38,251 --> 01:56:39,011
several hours.

3875
01:56:39,011 --> 01:56:41,250
And over the last,

3876
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:42,030
you know,

3877
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,160
nine years that I've
been doing this podcast,

3878
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,023
I've,

3879
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:50,060
it's benefited me tremendously just
just in having real conversations with

3880
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:51,270
people.

3881
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:53,400
We're just sitting across
from somebody for hours.

3882
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,420
Just talking to them,

3883
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,780
like getting better at
understanding how people think,

3884
01:56:57,781 --> 01:56:58,390
getting better.

3885
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:59,011
Understanding how,

3886
01:56:59,011 --> 01:57:02,610
I think getting way better
at communicating in that,

3887
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:03,180
you know,

3888
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:07,080
knowing when to talk and when not to
talk and what questions to ask and try to

3889
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,070
understand the thought process that
another person has and you know,

3890
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:12,690
you walk out of that with some lessons,

3891
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,920
like real legit,

3892
01:57:13,921 --> 01:57:14,880
tangible lessons.

3893
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,410
Those fucking don't happen.

3894
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:18,360
We staring at your phone while
you're talking to people,

3895
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,850
they like cuts all that
off the conversation.

3896
01:57:20,851 --> 01:57:21,870
Stay shallow.

3897
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,430
You Miss Important points like,

3898
01:57:23,431 --> 01:57:23,471
oh,

3899
01:57:23,471 --> 01:57:23,821
I'm sorry,

3900
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:24,690
what were we saying?

3901
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:27,540
You do that kind of shit and like
then the other person knows you're not

3902
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,180
engaged.

3903
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:29,013
It's just,

3904
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:29,903
it's weird.

3905
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:30,361
Yeah,

3906
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:31,290
it's all shades of gray.

3907
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:35,970
I mean it's done incredible things for
like democratizing the ability to share

3908
01:57:35,971 --> 01:57:36,570
information.

3909
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:40,800
So it's not just these juggernaut media
companies are the only places that can

3910
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:41,820
share information.

3911
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:44,460
So it's incredible.

3912
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:46,110
It's crucial.

3913
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:50,100
We need everyone to have the ability
to share and so that you can check in

3914
01:57:50,101 --> 01:57:53,850
because maybe you're more likely to get
the reality of what's going on in the

3915
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:56,400
world from your newsfeed
then then the big companies.

3916
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,893
But um,

3917
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,160
we need management skills.

3918
01:57:59,350 --> 01:57:59,700
Yeah.

3919
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,930
Personal management skills.

3920
01:58:01,110 --> 01:58:01,943
Yeah.

3921
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:02,730
And we,

3922
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:06,270
I think we need to look at them the same
way we look at like alcohol consumption

3923
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:07,950
and you know,

3924
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,870
even poor food choices.

3925
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:13,830
Like you can have a cheat day and eat a
bunch of pizza and some ice cream like

3926
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:14,664
the rock does.

3927
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:15,750
No one's going to get hurt,

3928
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,913
right.

3929
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,890
But most of the time he's probably
take care of your meat vehicle.

3930
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:22,380
I think the same thing
can be said of your mind.

3931
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:23,411
Like you can have a day,

3932
01:58:23,411 --> 01:58:25,020
like I have a day a week,

3933
01:58:25,021 --> 01:58:25,231
well,

3934
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:29,310
I will fucking plop down on the
couch and I don't give a fuck.

3935
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:34,311
I just watch bullshit on TV and just relax
because I know that I'm red lining it

3936
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:37,230
six days a week,

3937
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:37,921
you know,

3938
01:58:37,921 --> 01:58:40,050
and I'm doing three
different things at a time.

3939
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:42,010
I have three different jobs
and working out and I'm trying

3940
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:46,390
to take care of my family and writing
comedy material and then let me see some

3941
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,760
document around some
wacky fucking cult or,

3942
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:50,380
or whatever the hell I'm going to watch.

3943
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,910
And I don't feel guilty when I do that
because I know that I've kind of air

3944
01:58:54,911 --> 01:58:55,810
quotes earned it,

3945
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:56,960
you know.

3946
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,600
But I think that that's,

3947
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:02,380
that's mental management and
I think we certainly need,

3948
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:04,180
we need personal management.

3949
01:59:04,181 --> 01:59:06,310
It comes to the use of electronic devices.

3950
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:07,780
Yeah.

3951
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:08,890
Personal challenges.

3952
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,843
Yeah.

3953
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:13,990
Challenge psychology is really
fucking interesting to me.

3954
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:16,420
Like you guys do the Doc Tobar thing.

3955
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:18,850
We're thinking about
doing it twice a year now.

3956
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:20,560
I did this one with,

3957
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:22,780
with some of my friends
just going to watch shit.

3958
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:25,900
You are you in it to we,

3959
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,550
it doesn't get in.

3960
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:29,350
We did one called uh,

3961
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,360
the hundred burpee challenge.

3962
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:33,160
How did,

3963
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,100
I haven't done burpees and I did
them today because I was coming.

3964
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:36,371
I was like,

3965
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:36,641
oh,

3966
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:37,750
I can do burpees tonight,

3967
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,560
but uh,

3968
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:43,560
a hundred for time everyday for
a hundred days straight and it's,

3969
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:47,410
you are drenched after going for time.

3970
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:48,280
100 burpees.

3971
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:49,113
Oh yeah.

3972
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:49,871
Ridiculous.

3973
01:59:49,871 --> 01:59:51,400
So it's hard when it was the best,

3974
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,210
most has been have ever been working
out and it was like me and five friends.

3975
01:59:55,211 --> 01:59:58,990
My friend's mom did it too
and it was changed my life.

3976
01:59:59,440 --> 01:59:59,770
Really.

3977
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:02,170
It was ridiculous how to change your life.

3978
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:05,770
I felt better than I
have ever felt by far.

3979
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:06,640
And I have it.

3980
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,080
That was like a year ago and I've,

3981
02:00:08,081 --> 02:00:08,890
I've trailed off,

3982
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:10,930
but I think like,

3983
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:14,350
but not just physical challenges
like digital ones too.

3984
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,910
And like with the ice bucket thing,

3985
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:18,010
that was crazy shit.

3986
02:00:18,850 --> 02:00:20,490
I didn't get in them either.

3987
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:20,790
I'm like,

3988
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:25,790
just get watching it happen
was just really powerful.

3989
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:26,531
I'm like,

3990
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:30,970
I'm going to throw water on my
head during a fucking drought stop.

3991
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:31,510
Yeah.

3992
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:32,343
Everybody stopped.

3993
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:33,790
It's not fixing anything.

3994
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:34,840
How about I just write a check.

3995
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:36,363
I'll give you some money.

3996
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:36,670
Yeah.

3997
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:37,241
Film Yourself.

3998
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:38,074
Writing the check.

3999
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:39,030
Stop.

4000
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:39,350
Yeah.

4001
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:41,350
Throw a glass of water in my face
when I'm done with the chuck.

4002
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,843
Just stop.

4003
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:49,050
But getting communities to sort of
pressure each other into doing things in a

4004
02:00:50,261 --> 02:00:50,831
positive way.

4005
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:51,590
In a positive way.

4006
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:52,423
Yeah.

4007
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:52,631
Well,

4008
02:00:52,631 --> 02:00:56,110
that was what the sober October
thing kind of turned out to be about.

4009
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:58,780
And there's a lot of
lessons learned in that too.

4010
02:00:59,350 --> 02:00:59,621
You know,

4011
02:00:59,621 --> 02:01:02,630
you learn lessons about
your reliance on um,

4012
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:05,770
either substances or things.

4013
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:09,380
And one of the things that I learned
from the sober October challenge,

4014
02:01:09,381 --> 02:01:14,350
the last one was that when you engage
in really rigorous physical activity,

4015
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:15,610
six and seven days a week,

4016
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:16,660
you don't give a fuck.

4017
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:18,190
Like you don't give a fuck.

4018
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,640
Like all the chatter,

4019
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,710
the internal chatter,

4020
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:21,550
it just goes away.

4021
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:23,590
All the negative chatter.

4022
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:25,480
Like it's like taking a pill.

4023
02:01:25,481 --> 02:01:27,100
Like I don't give a fuck pill.

4024
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:27,970
It's amazing.

4025
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:31,660
It's really a mate because I think a lot
of personal anxiety that people carry

4026
02:01:31,661 --> 02:01:32,620
around with them is,

4027
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:37,950
is a physical energy that's not being
expressed because I think the body has

4028
02:01:38,141 --> 02:01:40,070
certain demands and certain

4029
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,903
potential.

4030
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:44,690
And in order to have
this certain potential,

4031
02:01:44,691 --> 02:01:46,640
like your potential for athletic output,

4032
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:48,800
you have to have this,

4033
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,270
you have this energy source,

4034
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:50,660
right?

4035
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:53,570
And this is body energy
source when not expressed.

4036
02:01:53,571 --> 02:01:55,160
And when you're sitting
in a cubicle all day,

4037
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:56,120
day after day after day,

4038
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,360
they build this like internal anxious
feeling intention and that becomes your

4039
02:02:03,051 --> 02:02:04,100
normal,

4040
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:04,910
the,

4041
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:05,151
the,

4042
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:06,530
the normal line,

4043
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:08,480
the normal frequency in which you operate.

4044
02:02:08,481 --> 02:02:12,770
You operate under this intense sort
of anxious state and you feel like,

4045
02:02:12,771 --> 02:02:13,580
well this is life.

4046
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:14,600
God Damn and I'm depressed,

4047
02:02:14,601 --> 02:02:15,170
or God dammit,

4048
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:15,921
I'm anxious guy.

4049
02:02:15,921 --> 02:02:16,581
I got anxiety,

4050
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:17,780
I've got to see a shrink or got to this.

4051
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:21,530
If you just blow that shit out every day,

4052
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,341
every day,

4053
02:02:22,341 --> 02:02:22,641
you know,

4054
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:27,300
you burn off 2000 calories and you fucking
run for five miles and you do kettle

4055
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:30,410
bells and Chin ups and fucking
hit the bag for five rounds,

4056
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:32,150
do that shit goes away.

4057
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,590
You don't give a fuck.

4058
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:35,780
And then you get to look at
things with real clarity.

4059
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:39,530
So there was a lesson learned in that
and then did that lesson was only learned

4060
02:02:39,531 --> 02:02:42,740
because we decided to challenge
each other and push ourselves.

4061
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:47,090
Do you think it would be too
draconian to have like a,

4062
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:47,900
a company,

4063
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,340
a hundred burpee a day?

4064
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:50,203
Yes.

4065
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:50,691
Yeah.

4066
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:51,530
You know why man?

4067
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:53,270
I just don't think you should
tell people what to do.

4068
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:54,030
They,

4069
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:54,201
their,

4070
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:54,441
their,

4071
02:02:54,441 --> 02:02:57,620
their job as the job and then
everything else is like a cult,

4072
02:02:58,430 --> 02:02:59,210
you know?

4073
02:02:59,210 --> 02:02:59,571
It's like,

4074
02:02:59,571 --> 02:02:59,811
no,

4075
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,580
we're all going to wear white robes.

4076
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:02,950
We don't need anything about white robes.

4077
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:03,803
Okay.

4078
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:07,490
When do you start fucking everybody and
taking their money because that always

4079
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:08,241
comes next.

4080
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:08,361
Yeah.

4081
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:09,470
Cause it's in vain.

4082
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:10,550
Yeah.

4083
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,030
You can't,

4084
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:11,661
you can't force people.

4085
02:03:11,661 --> 02:03:12,560
It's like being convinced,

4086
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:14,210
but it wouldn't be a bad,

4087
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:14,601
well,

4088
02:03:14,601 --> 02:03:16,070
the problem is if you were,

4089
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:17,533
you could,

4090
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:20,240
you could have some sort
of a companywide challenge.

4091
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:22,380
We're giving bonus site if you do know,

4092
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:27,050
because that's what I'm saying is like
you would shame them into doing it or you

4093
02:03:27,051 --> 02:03:27,621
would,

4094
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:28,250
uh,

4095
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:28,671
you know,

4096
02:03:28,671 --> 02:03:33,671
somehow or another make it seem like
they would advance in the company more if

4097
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:35,200
they played along.

4098
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:36,103
Could be,

4099
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:37,213
yeah.

4100
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,443
I'm not gonna do it

4101
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,460
because it feels so good.

4102
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:43,970
Yes.

4103
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:44,540
Yes.

4104
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:44,661
Well,

4105
02:03:44,661 --> 02:03:45,530
you should encourage it,

4106
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,420
but I almost feel like,

4107
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:48,303
um,

4108
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:49,940
yeah,

4109
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,230
but you don't want to shame people.

4110
02:03:51,231 --> 02:03:53,600
Like there's some brilliant
people that don't work out at all.

4111
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:54,553
They're brilliant,

4112
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:55,491
but they just,

4113
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:55,760
whatever,

4114
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,690
for whatever reason,

4115
02:03:56,691 --> 02:03:57,524
that's their choice.

4116
02:03:57,790 --> 02:03:58,011
You know,

4117
02:03:58,011 --> 02:04:00,590
it should be your choice to go
out like Christopher Hitchens,

4118
02:04:00,591 --> 02:04:03,320
it just fucking drink every day and smoke
cigarettes and one day he get cancer

4119
02:04:03,321 --> 02:04:03,621
and you're like,

4120
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:04,454
well,

4121
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,151
you know,

4122
02:04:05,151 --> 02:04:07,310
I mean this is like,

4123
02:04:07,870 --> 02:04:08,421
he mean he,

4124
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:09,380
the way he described it,

4125
02:04:09,381 --> 02:04:11,030
like burning the candle at both ends,

4126
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:11,580
it gave,

4127
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:11,950
uh,

4128
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:12,860
a beautiful,

4129
02:04:12,861 --> 02:04:13,694
brilliant light.

4130
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,181
Yeah.

4131
02:04:14,181 --> 02:04:16,610
He wouldn't have had those ideas
if he had done it another way.

4132
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:17,601
It's very possible.

4133
02:04:17,601 --> 02:04:21,630
That's true in most of the
madness that we see in,

4134
02:04:21,631 --> 02:04:22,880
in brilliant artists.

4135
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:23,801
Like it's very,

4136
02:04:23,801 --> 02:04:27,770
it's very possible that that madness
would not be expressed if they had their

4137
02:04:27,771 --> 02:04:28,604
shit together.

4138
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:33,830
There was something that Sam Harris was
saying the other day on your show just

4139
02:04:33,831 --> 02:04:34,640
about,

4140
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,600
about the freewill stuff.

4141
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:36,230
And I think that it,

4142
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:37,980
that connects to this information

4143
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,390
theory kind of thing.

4144
02:04:39,391 --> 02:04:44,391
So if we're just sort of a conglomerate
of these actions and words like flowing

4145
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:49,280
the,

4146
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,720
the actions through our
body in unique ways.

4147
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:53,813
I mean,

4148
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:56,370
do you accept his theory on freewill?

4149
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:57,271
Um,

4150
02:04:57,271 --> 02:05:01,230
well it's not his theory or
it's a conventional theory
of termism that a lot of

4151
02:05:01,231 --> 02:05:06,150
people are embracing and I think
there's definitely some merit to it.

4152
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:07,381
However,

4153
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:11,310
you and I both know that you choose
whether or not you decide to do something

4154
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:11,791
right.

4155
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:13,120
You choose whether or not you did.

4156
02:05:13,150 --> 02:05:14,970
Like someone says,

4157
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,600
someone says something to you that's
kind of Shitty and you choose whether you

4158
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:20,310
decide to email them
back something shitty.

4159
02:05:20,311 --> 02:05:21,960
Like you have that initial
impulse like a little,

4160
02:05:21,961 --> 02:05:22,321
hey man,

4161
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:23,154
fuck you.

4162
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,630
You have that initial impulse,

4163
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:25,770
you think on it,

4164
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:26,550
you sleep on it,

4165
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:28,290
but why are you thinking
on it and sleeping on it?

4166
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:30,090
Are you doing that because of determinism?

4167
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:33,030
Are you doing that because you're
trying to be a better person and are you

4168
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:36,600
trying to be a better person because of
all the factors that played out in your

4169
02:05:36,601 --> 02:05:37,050
life?

4170
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:38,610
Like environment,

4171
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:40,740
Jean's life experience,

4172
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:41,580
all those things,

4173
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:41,910
right?

4174
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,200
It means it's really good.

4175
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:45,060
It's a really good discussion.

4176
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:47,200
So do you own the words that
you're saying right now?

4177
02:05:47,230 --> 02:05:48,063
It's a good question.

4178
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:49,331
Larry Lessig,

4179
02:05:49,331 --> 02:05:50,350
who's on here the other day.

4180
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:50,750
Yeah.

4181
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:51,910
You guys didn't even talk about this,

4182
02:05:51,911 --> 02:05:54,940
but he basically is one of the founders
of creative Commons and this whole

4183
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:56,710
licensing structure for content.

4184
02:05:56,711 --> 02:05:57,730
Like what we're saying right now,

4185
02:05:57,731 --> 02:05:58,870
you know this is going to be licensed,

4186
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:02,560
I dunno how you and I'm form right here.

4187
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:04,840
This discussion is going
to be licensed you.

4188
02:06:04,870 --> 02:06:05,470
Yeah.

4189
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:05,830
Okay.

4190
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:06,490
I mean you're,

4191
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:08,410
I think you're licensing
it in a certain way.

4192
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:09,180
Okay.

4193
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,290
Well you have the ability to
license a however you want,

4194
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:11,610
right?

4195
02:06:11,610 --> 02:06:12,071
You could say,

4196
02:06:12,071 --> 02:06:12,281
hey,

4197
02:06:12,281 --> 02:06:15,190
anyone can take this and
cut it up and remix it.

4198
02:06:15,191 --> 02:06:17,020
Or You could say now it's locked down.

4199
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:23,130
But he helped create this whole licensing
array of like six different licenses.

4200
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:29,140
One says you can do absolutely anything
you want with this and other says you

4201
02:06:29,141 --> 02:06:29,651
can share it,

4202
02:06:29,651 --> 02:06:30,640
but you can't make money off it.

4203
02:06:30,710 --> 02:06:31,900
There's a handful.

4204
02:06:31,901 --> 02:06:36,901
And so the free will stuff is connected
to how we're dealing with information.

4205
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,380
And like if you,

4206
02:06:41,381 --> 02:06:42,214
cause if you,

4207
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:44,870
if you think realistic,

4208
02:06:44,871 --> 02:06:46,210
we don't own what we're saying,

4209
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:47,170
we're a part of it,

4210
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:47,620
right?

4211
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:50,500
We're a conduit where unique conduit.

4212
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:52,890
So it,

4213
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:57,930
I don't think it aligns with how the
universe works to really be locking down

4214
02:07:00,011 --> 02:07:01,000
information.

4215
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:05,950
I think that it makes sense probably
in certain short term business,

4216
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:08,830
but you know,

4217
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:12,100
I think we have to open it
up to what's really going on.

4218
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:16,990
What do you mean by like locking
down information like source code,

4219
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,420
like classified files,

4220
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:21,370
like our content,

4221
02:07:21,371 --> 02:07:22,091
like music,

4222
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:23,800
like video and now how does it,

4223
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:27,310
how does this connect to determinism
and whether or not you have free will

4224
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:31,100
because it's are,

4225
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:34,620
are you the creator of your information?

4226
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,603
Mm.

4227
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,010
Well

4228
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,850
you are certainly,

4229
02:07:36,851 --> 02:07:37,631
if you put in the work,

4230
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:39,340
like let's say you
decided to write a book.

4231
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:45,210
I mean you put hundreds and hundreds of
hours into this book and edit this book

4232
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:47,860
and then you release the
book and someone says,

4233
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:48,490
no,

4234
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:48,941
you didn't.

4235
02:07:48,941 --> 02:07:49,960
You didn't create that.

4236
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,380
You are,

4237
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:53,500
you're a product of determination and
I'm going to just steal your book.

4238
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:55,390
That's intellectual theft.

4239
02:07:55,420 --> 02:07:56,620
Intellectual theft is real.

4240
02:07:56,621 --> 02:07:56,821
It's,

4241
02:07:56,821 --> 02:07:59,410
it's certainly real in terms
of like creation of content,

4242
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,280
right?

4243
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:05,280
If you're a standup comedian and someone
takes your countless hours of work and

4244
02:08:06,641 --> 02:08:07,474
steals it,

4245
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:09,430
that's intellectual theft for sure.

4246
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:13,090
And then they try to pawn it off as their
own through their own selfish needs.

4247
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:14,560
There's a selfish means.

4248
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:18,500
That's why attribution is the key
part of the creative Commons licensing

4249
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:19,363
structure.

4250
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:21,360
Always saying if you come up with a joke,

4251
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:21,880
you know,

4252
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:22,840
came from here,

4253
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:24,880
but what if it's a profit?

4254
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:27,880
Like say if you wrote a book and I say,

4255
02:08:27,881 --> 02:08:28,061
Hey,

4256
02:08:28,061 --> 02:08:29,760
this is a great book
written by Bill [inaudible],

4257
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:32,440
give me five bucks for it and putting
it up on my site and you to it.

4258
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:33,101
Fuck that.

4259
02:08:33,101 --> 02:08:33,491
I mean,

4260
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:34,240
here's the thing.

4261
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:35,470
I don't,

4262
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:37,840
somebody makes all the money off of
your book because they have a better

4263
02:08:37,841 --> 02:08:40,000
platform to sell your book and
they don't give it to you at all.

4264
02:08:40,001 --> 02:08:41,260
And you wrote the book,

4265
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:42,700
you spent all the time,

4266
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:43,780
you did all the work.

4267
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:45,430
I would for certain

4268
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:48,400
and content that I create
completely give it away.

4269
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:50,170
That sounds like the guy
was never written a book.

4270
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,520
I've written a book.

4271
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:52,480
Did you?

4272
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,260
I mean,

4273
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:53,590
I've,

4274
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:55,810
I've written a lot of content.

4275
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:56,170
Yeah.

4276
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:56,711
But if you've written,

4277
02:08:56,711 --> 02:08:57,191
I give away,

4278
02:08:57,191 --> 02:08:58,024
I give,

4279
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:59,680
I've not published,

4280
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:01,150
but the book that you sell,

4281
02:09:01,151 --> 02:09:02,050
like if you were an author,

4282
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,040
but say if you were,

4283
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:06,640
I'm not saying people
should be forced to do this.

4284
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:11,730
I can just sometimes I'm just saying that
this I think is how creativity happens

4285
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,800
and I just,

4286
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:15,673
I just don't,

4287
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:19,870
people deserve to make
money on their content.

4288
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:20,920
Right.

4289
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,930
And you deserve to own your stuff.

4290
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:27,990
But I don't think that that's actually
how the universe works and I don't think

4291
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:29,560
it's acceptable to say,

4292
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:29,951
Oh,

4293
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:30,370
free.

4294
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:30,790
You know,

4295
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:31,840
free will doesn't exist.

4296
02:09:31,841 --> 02:09:32,830
I own your content.

4297
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,570
But yeah,

4298
02:09:34,571 --> 02:09:36,640
that's why I'm struggling to
see how they're connected.

4299
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:42,230
Because if you're not the originator,

4300
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:43,730
then you're not the owner.

4301
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,550
That's a weird argument
because you are the originator.

4302
02:09:46,551 --> 02:09:48,530
Stephen King wrote all Steven Qr.

4303
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:50,390
You're the unique conduit.

4304
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:56,860
You are the originator of that specific
configuration of information and you

4305
02:09:57,021 --> 02:09:59,060
deserve to be able to do
everything you're saying with it.

4306
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:01,130
I'm just saying that

4307
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:03,960
Aye.

4308
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:04,390
I Dunno.

4309
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,580
It's,

4310
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,820
it's complex.

4311
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:06,390
Well,

4312
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:07,650
it is complex.

4313
02:10:07,651 --> 02:10:10,560
If you're saying that all human beings,

4314
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:11,423
essentially,

4315
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:16,850
all of your actions have been determined
by a lot of factors that are outside of

4316
02:10:17,971 --> 02:10:18,804
your control.

4317
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,070
Whether it's genetics,

4318
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:20,430
again,

4319
02:10:20,430 --> 02:10:21,270
life experience,

4320
02:10:21,271 --> 02:10:22,140
education,

4321
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:23,820
all the different factors,

4322
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:25,103
your environment.

4323
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,220
Um,

4324
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:29,070
is that what's causing you to,

4325
02:10:29,071 --> 02:10:29,520
uh,

4326
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:30,360
put out,

4327
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:31,480
okay.

4328
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:33,010
A fucking brilliant record.

4329
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,113
It's part of it,

4330
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,050
right?

4331
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:37,610
But maybe you have 50,

4332
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,900
maybe you have 50%.

4333
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:41,210
Everything else has 50% or there's weed,

4334
02:10:41,211 --> 02:10:42,860
I don't know what the percentages,

4335
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:47,630
but if you're a musician and someone
like Spotify comes along and says,

4336
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:49,070
boot didn't even make that dude,

4337
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:52,550
so we're just gonna put it on Spotify
and make millions and give you pennies.

4338
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:54,110
That's not what I'm advocating.

4339
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:55,190
I'm,

4340
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:59,540
I'm saying sampling uses the blues died.

4341
02:10:59,541 --> 02:10:59,751
Well,

4342
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:00,351
more than that.

4343
02:11:00,351 --> 02:11:01,070
More than that.

4344
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:01,311
There's,

4345
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:01,730
yeah.

4346
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:02,250
Yeah.

4347
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,350
It was a real plagiarism.

4348
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:04,783
So,

4349
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:06,350
but that doesn't,

4350
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:09,410
that doesn't mean that
those aren't great records.

4351
02:11:09,411 --> 02:11:10,244
That's true.

4352
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,510
It is true.

4353
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:11,781
Yeah.

4354
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:12,160
I mean,

4355
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:13,760
it's a led Zeppelin,

4356
02:11:13,761 --> 02:11:15,080
this legit gray area.

4357
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:16,130
You know,

4358
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:17,090
I found out this,

4359
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:17,360
uh,

4360
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:20,270
Bill Burke called me up and left
us really disturbed message.

4361
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:22,610
He was like really bummed
out when he watched.

4362
02:11:22,611 --> 02:11:23,900
And Bill's a musician,

4363
02:11:23,901 --> 02:11:24,734
he's a drummer.

4364
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:29,920
And when he saw videos of led Zeppelin
music played and the band that used to

4365
02:11:30,621 --> 02:11:33,230
open for led Zepplin we
played it on the podcast.

4366
02:11:33,231 --> 02:11:33,471
We were like,

4367
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:34,970
Holy Shit.

4368
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:38,060
Like they just stole stuff.

4369
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:42,020
They just stole giant chunks
and rifts and you know,

4370
02:11:42,021 --> 02:11:42,161
and,

4371
02:11:42,161 --> 02:11:45,800
and I mean they made it better I guess,

4372
02:11:46,590 --> 02:11:47,420
but,

4373
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:47,751
but yeah,

4374
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:49,880
but that's a different thing
than Stephen King's book.

4375
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:50,690
Why?

4376
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:55,690
Because Stephen King had
to spend countless hours in
front of his laptop trying

4377
02:11:57,141 --> 02:12:01,880
to go over each and every sentence and
each and every paragraph and suck you in

4378
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:03,590
all this work.

4379
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:04,041
No,

4380
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:04,940
they stole stuff,

4381
02:12:04,941 --> 02:12:05,241
dude.

4382
02:12:05,241 --> 02:12:06,560
They sold certain phrases.

4383
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:11,561
But you think he didn't use
a single phrase anywhere
in any of his books that he

4384
02:12:12,231 --> 02:12:13,970
didn't pull from something?

4385
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:14,833
We certainly has.

4386
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:15,190
Yeah.

4387
02:12:15,190 --> 02:12:16,023
He certainly has.

4388
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:16,730
Um,

4389
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:17,930
I don't think it's the same though.

4390
02:12:19,190 --> 02:12:21,080
I think it's similar led Zepplin what?

4391
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:25,220
They also had to spend countless hours
recording that performance to get it to

4392
02:12:25,221 --> 02:12:28,690
the level of awesomeness that we heard.

4393
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:29,690
Sure.

4394
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:30,800
That wasn't easy to do.

4395
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:33,380
They just did a bitch ass move
and they didn't pay those people.

4396
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:35,023
Yeah.

4397
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:36,980
No matter what you should be attributing,

4398
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,330
if you're taking ideas,

4399
02:12:38,331 --> 02:12:39,320
put in the footnotes,

4400
02:12:39,321 --> 02:12:39,951
why does it hurt?

4401
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:43,490
It doesn't make your art worse because
then they'd have to admit they stole the

4402
02:12:43,491 --> 02:12:45,920
riff for Stairway to heaven
from their opening band.

4403
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:46,910
And then people would go,

4404
02:12:46,911 --> 02:12:47,744
what?

4405
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:48,831
And then they would see it.

4406
02:12:48,831 --> 02:12:50,570
Then they would look at
led Zepplin differently.

4407
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:52,100
But you know,

4408
02:12:52,101 --> 02:12:54,740
human beings are fucking severely flawed.

4409
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:55,400
Um,

4410
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:58,730
I don't know if I buy that with this,

4411
02:12:58,731 --> 02:13:02,630
this idea that you're saying in terms
of like a authors creating content.

4412
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:04,820
I'm not trying to sell something.

4413
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,211
No,

4414
02:13:05,211 --> 02:13:06,044
I know.

4415
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:07,430
But if they are,

4416
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:10,460
I don't think someone should be able
to copy their stuff and sell it.

4417
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:11,990
I don't think they should either.

4418
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:16,010
But what do you think
it should be able to do?

4419
02:13:16,011 --> 02:13:16,400
You think?

4420
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:16,641
Okay.

4421
02:13:16,641 --> 02:13:17,474
You should be able to decide.

4422
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:17,901
So if you,

4423
02:13:17,901 --> 02:13:18,830
the content creator,

4424
02:13:18,831 --> 02:13:19,100
you should.

4425
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:19,371
Okay.

4426
02:13:19,371 --> 02:13:19,971
I agree with that.

4427
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:20,804
Yeah.

4428
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,200
Yeah.

4429
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,033
It's,

4430
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:22,491
it is.

4431
02:13:22,491 --> 02:13:22,761
I mean,

4432
02:13:22,761 --> 02:13:24,770
obviously I play devil's advocate a lot,

4433
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,100
but that's how you get to the bottom.

4434
02:13:26,101 --> 02:13:26,901
And these conversations.

4435
02:13:26,901 --> 02:13:28,700
But it is a very complicated issue,

4436
02:13:28,701 --> 02:13:32,070
the complicated issue of
who you are and why you are

4437
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,460
who you are and who you are at this
moment versus who you are a decade ago or

4438
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:36,330
two decades ago.

4439
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:37,010
It's,

4440
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:38,400
it's all very weird,

4441
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:39,263
you know,

4442
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:39,841
I mean,

4443
02:13:39,841 --> 02:13:42,450
you go back and think about stuff
from high school and you're like,

4444
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:42,901
Jesus,

4445
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:43,830
what am I really,

4446
02:13:43,831 --> 02:13:44,670
even that person?

4447
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:46,043
Like I think about,

4448
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:46,431
like I've,

4449
02:13:46,431 --> 02:13:49,380
I've talked to my sister about stuff that
happened when we were in high school.

4450
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:49,621
Hey,

4451
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:50,341
you remember that guy?

4452
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:51,840
And he said to say hi and like,

4453
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,400
how's that even me?

4454
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:54,540
Do I ever know that person?

4455
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,500
Like is that really me?

4456
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:55,980
Cause I,

4457
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:56,490
if I,

4458
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:58,380
if I see them again I'll be like,

4459
02:13:58,410 --> 02:13:59,280
oh yeah.

4460
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:00,031
Oh yeah,

4461
02:14:00,031 --> 02:14:01,950
we had a 10th grade science together.

4462
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:02,820
Oh yeah.

4463
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,780
Huh.

4464
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:04,350
Crazy.

4465
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:07,290
Like I ran into a guy from my high school
like a couple of weeks ago and it was

4466
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:08,243
weird.

4467
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,270
It was so weird.

4468
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:09,991
You know,

4469
02:14:09,991 --> 02:14:12,690
he remembered some strange story
from English class and I was like,

4470
02:14:12,691 --> 02:14:13,111
wow,

4471
02:14:13,111 --> 02:14:13,980
you remember that?

4472
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:14,813
Like how weird.

4473
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:16,000
And while he was talking me,

4474
02:14:16,010 --> 02:14:16,830
I'm like,

4475
02:14:16,830 --> 02:14:18,660
is that even really me?

4476
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:19,161
Like,

4477
02:14:19,161 --> 02:14:23,610
cause even really talking about me
because I don't have any connection to the

4478
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:25,500
stuff that he's saying and
I understand that he has,

4479
02:14:25,501 --> 02:14:26,430
it's a vague,

4480
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:30,420
distant ghostlike memory
in his mind of some,

4481
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:35,840
some slide images that he's pieced
together that he recognizes as a past

4482
02:14:36,601 --> 02:14:37,440
interaction.

4483
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:40,590
I mean it's fucking strange.

4484
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:43,440
It's super strange to like in,

4485
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:43,860
you know,

4486
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:44,641
50 or 20,

4487
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:45,241
45,

4488
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:45,910
whatever,

4489
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:46,170
you know,

4490
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:50,880
if your body can be replaced
one piece at a time,

4491
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:51,480
yeah.

4492
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,680
As time goes on,

4493
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:55,860
then your body literally
you could survive,

4494
02:14:56,430 --> 02:14:58,890
but your body is going to be
like almost completely deaf.

4495
02:14:58,891 --> 02:14:59,641
Exactly.

4496
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:00,061
It's like,

4497
02:15:00,061 --> 02:15:00,570
um,

4498
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:00,950
the,

4499
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:01,720
the boat,

4500
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:02,280
uh,

4501
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:03,113
analogy,

4502
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:03,640
what was,

4503
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:04,500
was it Graham Hancock?

4504
02:15:04,501 --> 02:15:05,820
They use that analogy.

4505
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:11,220
Somebody uses the analogy of a certain
boats that are like really ancient boats

4506
02:15:11,221 --> 02:15:14,100
that are on display in every single
piece of them from the original boat has

4507
02:15:14,101 --> 02:15:16,320
been replaced because they
rotted away and you're like,

4508
02:15:16,321 --> 02:15:16,531
okay,

4509
02:15:16,531 --> 02:15:17,364
what am I looking at?

4510
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:18,690
What is this really?

4511
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:19,830
Yeah.

4512
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:21,720
And that's kind of us in.

4513
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:24,060
And once that becomes a physical thing,

4514
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:25,973
you know,

4515
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:28,050
I met the guy who got his uh,

4516
02:15:28,051 --> 02:15:31,080
arm and his leg a bitten off by a shark.

4517
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:31,651
You're see,

4518
02:15:31,651 --> 02:15:32,970
that guy's got carbon fiber,

4519
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:33,804
arms and legs.

4520
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:35,700
John Joseph brought him
to the comedy store.

4521
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:38,010
I met him at the UFC when
you gave him tickets.

4522
02:15:38,070 --> 02:15:38,521
Oh,

4523
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:39,354
shook his hand on,

4524
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:40,680
oh shit.

4525
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:41,670
Weird.

4526
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:42,121
Super,

4527
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:42,901
Super Nice Guy.

4528
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:44,100
But he's got this uh,

4529
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:45,150
uh,

4530
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:50,150
let's like a carbon fiber hand and
forearm that moves around like,

4531
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:54,480
like a hand and he shakes your hand
and then he walks with no limp.

4532
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:56,840
He's got this carbon fiber audit.

4533
02:15:56,841 --> 02:15:57,210
I mean,

4534
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:59,550
I think from the knee down
the shark bit his leg off.

4535
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,230
It's fascinating.

4536
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:01,661
You know,

4537
02:16:01,661 --> 02:16:01,951
you're like,

4538
02:16:01,951 --> 02:16:02,470
okay,

4539
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:03,660
you're still a person.

4540
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:04,643
You're still here.

4541
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,540
And what there is,

4542
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:07,530
there's a gentleman right there,

4543
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,400
Paul de Gelder,

4544
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:09,270
Paul de Gelder,

4545
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:10,110
Super Nice Guy,

4546
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,340
but is a,

4547
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:16,400
that is a fake arm that he's got from
his arm being chopped off by a fucking

4548
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:17,304
shark.

4549
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:21,330
So from a see where it
is from his right thigh,

4550
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:25,440
like mid thigh down and
his right elbow down,

4551
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:28,890
all that shit chewed off by a
shark and he's still jacked.

4552
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:29,783
Look it up.

4553
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,083
No excuses.

4554
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:33,400
And that's going to keep
becoming more biological,

4555
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:33,860
right?

4556
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:37,490
Well with the real concern is
I remember a $6 million man.

4557
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:39,410
Do you remember that television show?

4558
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:39,700
No.

4559
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,533
Well you're younger than me.

4560
02:16:40,910 --> 02:16:44,300
There was a show called the $6
million man and the $6 million man,

4561
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:49,130
he had been in some sort
of a pilot accident and uh,

4562
02:16:49,131 --> 02:16:49,820
the gentlemen,

4563
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,690
we can rebuild him,

4564
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:51,950
we can make him better than,

4565
02:16:51,951 --> 02:16:53,030
he was better,

4566
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:54,080
stronger,

4567
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:54,740
faster.

4568
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:56,120
And they given these bionic parts,

4569
02:16:56,121 --> 02:17:00,260
he gave him a bionic arm and they gave
him bionic legs and he could run like 60

4570
02:17:00,261 --> 02:17:01,094
miles an hour.

4571
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:02,930
You would run like crazy fast.

4572
02:17:02,931 --> 02:17:06,230
And he had these artificial
arms and aren't artificial
leg and they had a bionic

4573
02:17:06,231 --> 02:17:06,561
woman,

4574
02:17:06,561 --> 02:17:07,394
same shit,

4575
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:11,210
except she was hot and she had artificial
legs and I think she could see things

4576
02:17:11,211 --> 02:17:13,530
and other people couldn't
see like one day.

4577
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:13,761
I mean,

4578
02:17:13,761 --> 02:17:14,511
that was cool.

4579
02:17:14,511 --> 02:17:15,580
Would you would look at that you're like,

4580
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:16,161
wow,

4581
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:16,371
look,

4582
02:17:16,371 --> 02:17:18,830
we could do like he got in a fight
with big foot on the TV show.

4583
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:19,783
It's really stupid,

4584
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:24,200
but one day people are going
to be given the option.

4585
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:28,250
Do you want to now maybe you want to keep
your legs or do you want to get these

4586
02:17:28,251 --> 02:17:29,750
legs that allow you to
jump over a building?

4587
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:35,370
I'm curious if there's really
like superhuman projects
that are going on where,

4588
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:40,320
where people actually can
have these abilities that,

4589
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:41,213
you know,

4590
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:46,400
we know that with classified information
it's just we know what that their stuff

4591
02:17:46,741 --> 02:17:49,770
we don't know that are
extraordinary projects.

4592
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:52,680
So you know,

4593
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:54,720
this being in the future,

4594
02:17:54,810 --> 02:17:59,100
I feel like there's a disconnect between
the state of technology on the planet

4595
02:17:59,101 --> 02:18:03,450
earth right now with like what the
public has access to with what the,

4596
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:03,990
you know,

4597
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:08,990
black projects have access to and that
is really not cool because it's not fair

4598
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:17,480
for humanity to not
understand what is going on.

4599
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:19,390
I think that's true,

4600
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:23,650
but I also think that most of
the state of the art stuff is,

4601
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,080
it's peer reviewed,

4602
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:26,471
right?

4603
02:18:26,471 --> 02:18:26,741
I mean,

4604
02:18:26,741 --> 02:18:30,220
there's so many different people working
on these different technologies like

4605
02:18:30,221 --> 02:18:31,054
cern,

4606
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:31,391
you know,

4607
02:18:31,391 --> 02:18:33,670
they're working on the large
hadron collider or anything else.

4608
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:36,010
There's so many different
people working on it.

4609
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:38,740
The people that are the forefront
of the technology and let's,

4610
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:40,960
they're all gobbled up
by the dark government.

4611
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:41,730
They're,

4612
02:18:41,730 --> 02:18:42,100
you know,

4613
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:42,480
they're,

4614
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,400
they're the people at the head of
the line kind of understand where the

4615
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:48,100
technology is that
currently for sure for you.

4616
02:18:48,101 --> 02:18:48,640
And I,

4617
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,840
we don't know what the fuck's going on,

4618
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:51,250
but I think you're right.

4619
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:54,830
I think there's probably some government
programs where they scoop up the,

4620
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:55,131
the,

4621
02:18:55,131 --> 02:18:55,380
the,

4622
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:58,040
the wisest and the brightest and you know,

4623
02:18:58,041 --> 02:18:59,230
like they're got Oppenheimer,

4624
02:18:59,440 --> 02:18:59,741
you know,

4625
02:18:59,741 --> 02:19:02,410
and got him to develop
the Manhattan project.

4626
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,690
There's probably some
shit going on right now.

4627
02:19:05,210 --> 02:19:06,043
What do you think's happening?

4628
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:08,031
What do you know,

4629
02:19:08,031 --> 02:19:08,241
Bill?

4630
02:19:08,241 --> 02:19:09,074
Tell me.

4631
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:14,410
I want there to be huge freedom
of information act reform.

4632
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:16,600
Eh,

4633
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,570
they're there.

4634
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:19,910
We know that there are trillions
going into the black budget.

4635
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,393
So,

4636
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:21,890
uh,

4637
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:24,260
Trevor Paglen wrote a cool book called,

4638
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:27,140
I think it was him called
blank spots on the map.

4639
02:19:27,770 --> 02:19:28,180
And it's,

4640
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:29,380
it's just talks a lot about the,

4641
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:30,440
the black budget.

4642
02:19:30,441 --> 02:19:31,310
And I mean,

4643
02:19:31,311 --> 02:19:31,551
we,

4644
02:19:31,551 --> 02:19:32,840
so we know it exists.

4645
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,333
We know.

4646
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:36,373
I don't know,

4647
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,640
but it's,

4648
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:39,650
it's holding us back.

4649
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:43,790
But maybe I'm not saying everything
should be shared because what if you have

4650
02:19:43,791 --> 02:19:44,630
like a bio weapon?

4651
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:45,260
Right,

4652
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:45,530
right.

4653
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:45,710
You know,

4654
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:46,850
so we need to understand,

4655
02:19:46,851 --> 02:19:51,230
I think that we need to push the threshold
with what the public has access to.

4656
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:52,970
Like we need to go way deeper.

4657
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:54,020
It's complicated.

4658
02:19:54,021 --> 02:19:54,320
Yeah.

4659
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:54,831
It really is.

4660
02:19:54,831 --> 02:19:55,664
Right.

4661
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:56,720
You know,

4662
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,500
it really is.

4663
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:58,333
Um,

4664
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:02,060
I really appreciate your perspective and
I really appreciate your point of view

4665
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:04,910
and I really appreciate
your ethics and what you're,

4666
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:06,500
what you're working towards with minds.

4667
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:08,270
And that's one of the reasons
why I wanted to talk to.

4668
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,720
I think it is important and as much as
I fuck around and play devil's advocate,

4669
02:20:11,721 --> 02:20:12,620
I do that to try to get to,

4670
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:13,190
to,

4671
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,880
you know,

4672
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:17,060
how you're thinking and why and whether
or not you've had these arguments in

4673
02:20:17,061 --> 02:20:17,894
your own mind.

4674
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:18,651
But,

4675
02:20:18,651 --> 02:20:19,484
um,

4676
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:24,580
I think ultimately I've said this before
and I'm don't know if it makes sense

4677
02:20:24,621 --> 02:20:24,981
because again,

4678
02:20:24,981 --> 02:20:26,120
I'm not that smart.

4679
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:29,600
I really wonder if there's,

4680
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:33,560
there's bottlenecks for progress that
are going to be that we're going to run

4681
02:20:33,561 --> 02:20:34,394
into.

4682
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:34,980
And I think,

4683
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:35,813
um,

4684
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:41,420
ultimately information is one of the big
ones and information also in a lot of

4685
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:44,060
ways is money.

4686
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:45,140
You know,

4687
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:45,973
I mean,

4688
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:49,440
when we think of money we're,

4689
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:53,390
we're thinking of ones and Zeros that
are being moved around on bank accounts.

4690
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:55,010
It's data.

4691
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:55,940
I mean,

4692
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:59,180
it's attributed to different people and
you'd get to do more things because you

4693
02:20:59,181 --> 02:21:01,280
have more of these numbers
and more of these things.

4694
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:02,930
But what is it really?

4695
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,640
It's not gold based anymore.

4696
02:21:04,641 --> 02:21:05,740
It's not a physical material,

4697
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:10,770
a material ODG object that you're coveting
now it's some weird thing and it's

4698
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:12,950
kind of like information on a database.

4699
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:15,980
And what if we get to a
certain point in time,

4700
02:21:15,981 --> 02:21:16,151
and I,

4701
02:21:16,151 --> 02:21:16,550
I,

4702
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:18,590
I sort of feel like in this weird,

4703
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:19,131
vague,

4704
02:21:19,131 --> 02:21:22,340
abstract way we're moving
towards this with all,

4705
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:25,640
it's one of the things that I want to
really step back and wonder about this

4706
02:21:25,641 --> 02:21:27,300
trend towards socialism and,

4707
02:21:27,550 --> 02:21:29,360
and social democratic thinking.

4708
02:21:29,361 --> 02:21:30,380
I wonder what that is.

4709
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:30,690
And I,

4710
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:34,130
I honestly think that we're
moving towards this idea that,

4711
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:34,670
hey,

4712
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:34,821
you know,

4713
02:21:34,821 --> 02:21:39,470
we've got a lot of fucking problems that
could be cured if you move some of that

4714
02:21:39,471 --> 02:21:41,540
money around and,

4715
02:21:41,541 --> 02:21:41,870
but,

4716
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:44,270
but should you be able to move
some of that money around?

4717
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:45,260
And when,

4718
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:50,260
what happens if that money
becomes something different
than what if people start

4719
02:21:51,081 --> 02:21:56,081
developing social currency instead of
financial currency would have your ability

4720
02:21:57,651 --> 02:22:00,200
to do things was based on
how much you actually put in.

4721
02:22:00,201 --> 02:22:00,381
I mean,

4722
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:01,370
we're assuming,

4723
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:01,910
right?

4724
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:06,200
We assume that the way we do things
now where if you want to buy a car,

4725
02:22:06,201 --> 02:22:09,800
you have to have $35,000 that's how much
a Mustang costs and you've got to bring

4726
02:22:09,801 --> 02:22:11,090
it to the bank and this and that.

4727
02:22:11,091 --> 02:22:12,440
And you can prove alone.

4728
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:17,570
But what if we get to a time in the future
where it's not these pieces of paper

4729
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:22,571
that gives you material objects but
rather your own actions and deeds provide

4730
02:22:23,241 --> 02:22:27,240
you with social currency that allows you
to on vacations or allows you to eat at

4731
02:22:27,241 --> 02:22:27,900
restaurants.

4732
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:31,380
It allows you to do things and there's
this running tally that's not outside of

4733
02:22:31,381 --> 02:22:32,520
the realm of possibility.

4734
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:33,691
No,

4735
02:22:33,691 --> 02:22:34,580
I think it really

4736
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:39,670
award systems within everything that
we're using are gonna are gonna rise up.

4737
02:22:39,891 --> 02:22:40,341
I mean that,

4738
02:22:40,341 --> 02:22:42,620
that's it's what we're
already kind of doing.

4739
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:43,041
I mean we,

4740
02:22:43,041 --> 02:22:45,290
we reward tokens for,

4741
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:46,580
for activity.

4742
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,260
We're going to see that
rise up in more things

4743
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:51,870
doing.

4744
02:22:51,870 --> 02:22:53,880
But what I'm saying is
if we're doing it in,

4745
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:58,470
if it's a social currency and that your
own personal behavior allows you to

4746
02:22:58,471 --> 02:23:00,090
access more freedoms or,

4747
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:02,610
or more goods or more things,

4748
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:07,940
it would encourage positive behavior and
community based behavior because that

4749
02:23:08,551 --> 02:23:10,110
would be the only way to advance.

4750
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:10,680
I mean,

4751
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:13,140
obviously this is a
long time down the line,

4752
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:14,640
but when the first cave man,

4753
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:15,360
you know,

4754
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:18,570
traded the first fucking shiny
rock for the first spearhead,

4755
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:19,231
you know,

4756
02:23:19,231 --> 02:23:22,650
whatever it was that they did that started
this whole inevitable trend towards

4757
02:23:22,651 --> 02:23:23,484
money.

4758
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:26,760
This is not something that
has to be this way forever.

4759
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:27,541
You know?

4760
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:31,410
And I wonder when we're looking at
the distribution of information,

4761
02:23:31,411 --> 02:23:33,810
which is arguably not arguably,

4762
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:34,853
it's never,

4763
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:36,990
never been like what we have today.

4764
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:41,070
There's never been a time in human history
where everyone had so much access to

4765
02:23:41,071 --> 02:23:42,660
information that you
used to have to pay for.

4766
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:44,550
He used to have to go to schools.

4767
02:23:44,551 --> 02:23:48,210
You have to use to have to earn your
way to the position where you could open

4768
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:50,850
the very books that had all
this information in it night,

4769
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:51,840
get it off your phone.

4770
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,153
It's instant.

4771
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:54,060
And I,

4772
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:58,110
this is a whole different
way of interfacing with
information and I think this

4773
02:23:58,111 --> 02:24:00,030
is going to affect higher
learning institutes.

4774
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:01,800
I think it's going to affect
a lot of different things.

4775
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,600
But I wonder if this all can
be applied ultimately some day,

4776
02:24:06,601 --> 02:24:06,991
maybe not.

4777
02:24:06,991 --> 02:24:07,711
In our generation,

4778
02:24:07,711 --> 02:24:12,711
but someday to money that people start
using social currency and that social

4779
02:24:14,371 --> 02:24:17,850
currency is going to be almost
like we have some sort of a,

4780
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:20,520
a database of social
currency in this country,

4781
02:24:20,860 --> 02:24:21,870
distributed database.

4782
02:24:22,310 --> 02:24:27,310
As long as the government can
be running on open systems.

4783
02:24:28,790 --> 02:24:29,350
I think the,

4784
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:30,710
the reason we struggle with,

4785
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:31,400
you know,

4786
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:33,770
trusting the government to
distribute wealth is because it's,

4787
02:24:33,771 --> 02:24:34,670
it's so inefficient.

4788
02:24:34,671 --> 02:24:36,560
We want to be deciding where it goes.

4789
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:36,761
Well,

4790
02:24:36,761 --> 02:24:38,200
they're also corrupt as fuck.

4791
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:40,120
I mean there's no,

4792
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:41,350
no doubt about that.

4793
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:42,590
I mean,

4794
02:24:42,590 --> 02:24:43,450
at the end of the day,

4795
02:24:43,451 --> 02:24:44,950
that's a giant problem period.

4796
02:24:44,951 --> 02:24:49,180
If the people that are deciding what
we can and can't do with information or

4797
02:24:49,181 --> 02:24:50,140
also corrupt,

4798
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:54,820
which it means there's laws that allow
them to be corrupt but doesn't mean that

4799
02:24:54,850 --> 02:24:55,900
they're not corrupt.

4800
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:59,320
I feel like every politician,

4801
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:02,320
the only politicians that I
would support at this point,

4802
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:07,410
I want to be pulling us in a direction
like that is making their own position

4803
02:25:08,321 --> 02:25:09,154
irrelevant.

4804
02:25:09,490 --> 02:25:11,860
Basically building open,

4805
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:16,920
secure voting systems that
allow the planet or the
country to decide and vote on

4806
02:25:20,711 --> 02:25:21,520
what we're doing.

4807
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:21,791
I mean,

4808
02:25:21,791 --> 02:25:22,624
I,

4809
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:23,543
you know,

4810
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,120
I just think that we need more accurate
representation of the consciousness of

4811
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:37,141
the communities and it just shouldn't
just be these singular people deciding for

4812
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:39,330
everybody when we should have,

4813
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:40,450
we have the tech right.

4814
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:41,890
And by the time they get in there,

4815
02:25:41,891 --> 02:25:45,730
they're so compromised by the special
interest groups that are helping them out

4816
02:25:45,731 --> 02:25:48,430
and all the different people that are
contributing to their campaign funds.

4817
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:50,140
MMM.

4818
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:52,300
Do you see anybody like
that on the horizon?

4819
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:57,280
I think that there are not
specifically right now,

4820
02:25:57,310 --> 02:25:57,581
I don't,

4821
02:25:57,581 --> 02:26:02,581
I don't see anyone talking about open
systems and secure voting and completely

4822
02:26:06,611 --> 02:26:09,730
changing the way that
we're making decisions.

4823
02:26:10,650 --> 02:26:12,760
But I think that's probably just
because they don't know about it.

4824
02:26:12,761 --> 02:26:14,710
I think there will be a
lot of politicians who,

4825
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:18,730
who would be okay with that or
want us to move in that direction.

4826
02:26:18,731 --> 02:26:20,470
But I think we need more technologists,

4827
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:25,420
scientists in these positions
building the things that we're using.

4828
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:26,841
Yeah.

4829
02:26:26,841 --> 02:26:29,600
And with an ethic of freedom.

4830
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:30,230
Yeah.

4831
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:31,063
Yeah.

4832
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:32,223
All right,

4833
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:33,450
dude,

4834
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:34,340
that's great conversation,

4835
02:26:34,341 --> 02:26:34,670
man.

4836
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,503
I really appreciate it.

4837
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,780
Okay.

4838
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:36,140
Um,

4839
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:38,570
tell people how they can get on mines,

4840
02:26:38,571 --> 02:26:39,680
how they can check it out.

4841
02:26:40,370 --> 02:26:41,203
And uh,

4842
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:41,561
you have,

4843
02:26:41,561 --> 02:26:41,720
uh,

4844
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,340
do you guys have an app as well as,

4845
02:26:43,341 --> 02:26:44,174
uh,

4846
02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:45,171
we have an APP.

4847
02:26:45,171 --> 02:26:47,690
You go to [inaudible] dot com
slash mobile to get the APP.

4848
02:26:47,691 --> 02:26:48,740
We're now on Google play.

4849
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:50,240
We are still in the apple store.

4850
02:26:50,330 --> 02:26:51,380
Google play won't let you in?

4851
02:26:51,470 --> 02:26:51,890
No.

4852
02:26:51,890 --> 02:26:52,670
How come?

4853
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:53,480
Uh,

4854
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:54,280
had issues.

4855
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:55,940
They're scanning the nipple,

4856
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:56,900
but uh,

4857
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:57,350
you find me?

4858
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,520
[inaudible] dot com slash shop man,

4859
02:26:58,550 --> 02:26:59,530
hopefully we'll get you on there.

4860
02:26:59,740 --> 02:26:59,880
Well,

4861
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:00,341
I'm on,

4862
02:27:00,341 --> 02:27:00,720
I just,

4863
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:00,951
yeah,

4864
02:27:00,951 --> 02:27:01,850
I haven't posted anything.

4865
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:02,390
All right.

4866
02:27:02,390 --> 02:27:03,450
You sent me my tower.

4867
02:27:03,451 --> 02:27:03,940
Ogun yeah.

4868
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:04,430
Thank you.

4869
02:27:04,430 --> 02:27:05,263
Appreciate it.

4870
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:06,020
Thanks buddy.

4871
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:06,430
Thank you.

4872
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:07,101
I asked her coming on,

4873
02:27:07,101 --> 02:27:07,251
man.

4874
02:27:07,251 --> 02:27:07,791
It was really fun.

4875
02:27:07,791 --> 02:27:08,780
I think we've got a lot out of it.

4876
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:09,703
Thanks.

4877
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:17,110
Great.
