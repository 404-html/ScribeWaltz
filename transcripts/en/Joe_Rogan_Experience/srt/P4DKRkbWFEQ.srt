1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
Hello

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,610
bitches.
Yeah,

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,121
Dad,
dad.

4
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:07,780
Dad is a real sweeping brush that people
from both sides like to use,

5
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:08,950
right?
The people in the right,

6
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:09,784
like do you use it on the liberals?
The liberals like to use it on 

7
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:12,694
conservatives.
We like to paint people like real 

8
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,820
obvious,
put up,

9
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,180
you know,
put them in a box,

10
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,390
make sure we can categorize them.
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,313
So mean.

12
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,240
I swear I said,
I said,

13
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,410
well,
I think I got,

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,333
I think I might have accidentally 
started a little bit of it because I 

15
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,464
said,
look,

16
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,423
all you have to realize is there's just 
a disenfranchised part of America that 

17
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,450
feels like they're not being 
represented.

18
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,960
And then immediately I think Sarah got 
jumped on me and she was like,

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,670
Oh,
you're talking about the racist?

20
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,440
And I was like,
I don't know.

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,740
You can't say that.
You can't say that I voted.

22
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,561
I'm not now,
by the way,

23
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,394
I voted for fucking Hillary.
So I'm just seconding what ha what I'm 

24
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,290
noticing out of an election.
So I,

25
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,951
but I,
you know,

26
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,784
I,
I thought it was good of her to stand 

27
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,314
her ground and to,
and to whole end just say her point and 

28
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:53,200
not tried to back pedal and,
and I,

29
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,200
I appreciate that,
but well,

30
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,034
you know,

31
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,923
problem is the problem with that saying 
that anybody that voted for trump is a 

32
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,021
racist.
The real,

33
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:00,854
the real problem with that is because 
the only other alternative is Hillary 

34
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:06,530
and Hillary was very flawed.
That's just the way it is.

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,430
You know,
it's not,

36
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,473
it's not an anti woman thing to think 
that someone who has all the ties to 

37
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:13,784
corruption that she apparently does.
I mean you can go into it all day long 

38
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,264
if you want to.
Do you want to like look at the Clinton 

39
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,443
Foundation or any of the other crazy 
shit that those people are involved 

40
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:23,540
with?
It's kind of legal,

41
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,450
you know what I mean?
It's not really breaking any laws.

42
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,280
So like you can get away with doing all 
that stuff,

43
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,020
but all of it is learned.
Oh,

44
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,313
deleted emails and all that.
Like why did you doing like what is 

45
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:34,870
this?

46
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,160
Yeah.
And I think,

47
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:36,994
I think there was a large portion of 
America who just didn't want to share 

48
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,680
their opinion cause they didn't want to 
be called a name.

49
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,030
So

50
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,790
there's real concerns too.
And people don't want to say this.

51
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,430
There's real concerns about her health.
Really.

52
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,070
She hurt her head in 2012 because she 
blacked out.

53
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,080
She,
she blacked out,

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,610
fell,
fainted,

55
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,430
and hit her head really bad,
like really bad.

56
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,863
And um,
apparently she was fucked up for like 

57
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,930
six months and this was 2012.
That's only four years ago,

58
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,764
man.
And that's a really significant head 

59
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:08,434
trauma.
And she was very eloquent and the 

60
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,370
debates,
she's really articulate.

61
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,110
I thought she kicked his ass and the 
debates,

62
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,630
I honestly did.
I thought she came off smoother,

63
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,643
especially that second one.
Like he would say some crazy shit and 

64
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,374
she would smile.
I thought she handled it great and she 

65
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,850
was so much more eloquent and so much,
uh,

66
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,670
so much more so much better economy of 
words.

67
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,650
The problem is,
is just,

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,993
it's so hard to,
to trust that she's telling you the 

69
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,344
truth.

70
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,303
You know,
there's just too many things that she's 

71
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,160
been like.
The difference between that Komi Guy,

72
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,994
what he said she had done with her email
and what she said she had done and you 

73
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:43,774
play them back and forth.
You ever seen the video when they do 

74
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,780
that,
it's pretty shocking.

75
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,740
You know what he says is very different 
than her descriptions of what he says.

76
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,963
You know what he says is like she 
violated some laws and what most people 

77
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,400
thought in the,
apparently in the FBI,

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,473
it's one of the things that people got 
upset Komi apparently from this article 

79
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,384
I read at least they were saying that 
the people in the FBI were very 

80
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,130
disappointed because they thought that 
he should have pressed charges.

81
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,253
They thought that when they looked at 
all the evidence and all the stuff that 

82
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,004
he talked about,
that he admitted that she had done that 

83
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,160
you can't do it with classified data.

84
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,280
She had violated all these laws,
like if you were a regular person,

85
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,143
if you were real regular enlisted person
and you violated those same amount of 

86
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,871
loss,
dude,

87
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,270
you'd be fucked.
You would be fucked fill.

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
They'll really puts you in a Goddamn 
cage.

89
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,620
100% looks like,
I know this sounds silly,

90
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,270
but she just like,
they said,

91
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,051
hey,
we'd like to see her emails,

92
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,720
and then she just got rid of them all.
She deleted them all.

93
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:38,800
She deleted 30,000
emails and she did it after a subpoena.

94
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,250
At least some of them have to say,
I didn't know it was after a subpoena to

95
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,030
see how many find out how many emails 
she deleted after the subpoena.

96
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,460
I don't know the absolute specifics of 
it,

97
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,294
but it's just,
it's my point is it wasn't like she was 

98
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,460
this awesome alternative,
you know,

99
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,294
so people that wanted change and they 
felt like what Hillary represented is a 

100
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:07,090
part of that big system as well as she 
says her words and is a stately,

101
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:07,924
she is,
and she's a much better representative 

102
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,270
of America in some ways than he is,
but she's just too tied to corruption.

103
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,860
Like all of this stuff that she's done,
like all the,

104
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,800
the,
the experience she has in government,

105
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,290
all that should be on her favor in her 
favor.

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,303
But for a lot of people it wasn't this 
time for a lot of people that would 

107
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,644
like,
this government is just too intertwined 

108
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,560
with these businesses that support it 
and pay it money and they,

109
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,663
they're going to all these different 
foreign countries and getting paid 

110
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
exorbitant sums of money to talk.
It's like Bill Clinton was getting like 

111
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:44,700
a half a million dollars to fly to these
countries that are all these like,

112
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,140
like serious like civil rights 
violations on,

113
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,680
on their people.
Yeah.

114
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,780
There was like some thing that Clinton 
had done.

115
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,183
We kept trying to push this one through,
see if he could find that there's this 

116
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:01,800
one like dictatorship that he wanted to 
go into it.

117
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,150
He wanted to go and do speeches and they
were like,

118
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,500
no,
you can't go there.

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,690
Like you're not supposed to visit that 
place.

120
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,524
These,
these people are doing things we don't 

121
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,530
look we don't agree with.
And he's like,

122
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:11,870
yeah,
yeah,

123
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,020
I gotta go over there and I'm going to 
do due to speech.

124
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,750
So let's just try to get like,
he just wanted to do that speech.

125
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,630
He just wanted that Cheddar.
That's,

126
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,110
I think it's,
what's interesting to me now is,

127
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,930
is the,
the population on twitter,

128
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:26,764
at least of people,
my friends that voted for hilary that 

129
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,220
are now just saying,
fuck,

130
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,680
fuck the rest of the country.
Fuck,

131
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm out.
This sucks.

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,860
It's like,
like,

133
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,910
did you see that the Canadian website,
the immigration website broke.

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,430
It crashed.
Brokes all the Americans were like,

135
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,410
fuck this,
I'm moving to Canada.

136
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,010
Has anyone ever done that though?
Fuck yeah.

137
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,470
You think fuck yeah.
Especially Vancouver.

138
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,190
Oh yeah.
Warm blankets like Seattle.

139
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,100
It's basically just

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,360
like Seattle,
seattle.

141
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,780
But I mean like weather wise is pretty 
similar.

142
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,670
Probably identical.
But there was something different about,

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,190
about Vancouver that Seattle doesn't 
have.

144
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,980
What's that like a,
I almost like this,

145
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,740
um,
like colonial,

146
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,410
like richness,
this European richness that,

147
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,244
do you know that bridge driving into 
Vancouver was kind of big lions and 

148
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,251
yeah.
And you're like,

149
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:21,890
oh,
this just looks like Lord of the Rings.

150
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,590
He like,
it looks like it could be in Germany and

151
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,590
that everything's a little more lush or 
a little more overgrown.

152
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,720
I don't know if Seattle,
see I like sad.

153
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll love Seattle,
but the downtown's look similar,

154
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,980
but even still like the downtowns in 
Vancouver,

155
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,140
the food's always seems just a little 
bit better than Seattle.

156
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,430
Did you ever do?
How?

157
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,080
Man,
that's a tough call.

158
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,943
They're both pretty fucking awesome.
You can't have shitty food and the 

159
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,180
Pacific northwest.
Yeah.

160
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,550
You know like Oregon,
like Portland,

161
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,580
Portland,
and other places.

162
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,080
They have some fucking bang banging 
food.

163
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,133
Do you ever go to that?
You ever do a go to that little taco 

164
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,540
trucks?
The has?

165
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,330
Yes.
Do they have a

166
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,540
ty cheeseburger?
It's a cheeseburger with that like satay

167
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,950
sauce,
that peanut butter sauce.

168
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,100
Holy Shit,
and it's super spicy.

169
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,470
It's got Serratia and it to fucking 
love.

170
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:08,101
God.
Damn.

171
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,250
It's good.
Bill Clinton sought State Department.

172
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,020
Okay.
For paid speeches related to

173
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,140
North Korea and the Congo.
He wanted Congo.

174
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,423
He's an animal.
They're cutting kids' hands off in the 

175
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,170
Congo.
I respect his game.

176
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,790
I respect his game.
He's like,

177
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,890
there's a lot of paper for me over 
there.

178
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,960
I get to go get it.
I guarantee you when he,

179
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,160
when she got elected,
he was like,

180
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,994
fuck,
I guess she'll be around my house a lot 

181
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,280
more.
Look at this.

182
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,114
It says

183
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,973
the FBI about the deleted emails between
March 25th and March 31st three weeks 

184
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,153
after the subpoena.
The campaign now says it only learned 

185
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,450
when the emails were deleted from the 
FBI report.

186
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,130
Hmm.
Wow.

187
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,140
How many emails?
Oh my God.

188
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,980
30,490
work related emails on December 5th,

189
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,460
2014 and chose not to keep 31,830
emails.

190
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,660
She deemed personal.

191
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,430
Well,
that's interesting.

192
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,181
She,
by the way,

193
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,630
do you know how difficult that would be?
I have 33 unopened emails.

194
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,640
33,000
on the open emails and my thing.

195
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,953
And sometimes I try it,
it's just like spam and I try to clean 

196
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,330
it out and it's a fucking nightmare.
Yeah.

197
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,690
It's not an easy to clean that out.
Yeah.

198
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:25,800
You're like select all,
delete.

199
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:29,130
But then you still the only taste where 
they're like 800 yeah.

200
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,400
So if you've been paying attention to 
all these people's reactions,

201
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,770
everyone's trying to like figure out 
why,

202
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,370
why trump won.
It's really fascinating.

203
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
It's fascinating to see people freak 
out.

204
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,660
It's fat.
People at crying,

205
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,933
people are fucking cry.
Oh they stormed out of a school in 

206
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,344
Arizona.
The kids marched out of a school to 

207
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,810
protest the president elect.
Whoa,

208
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,660
Whoa,
this is,

209
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,480
no,

210
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
but there is a weird,
like there was a weird energy when trump

211
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,010
gave his speech last night.
It was almost like the bully saying stop

212
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:03,390
hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

213
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,770
Like he was like,
he was like,

214
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,604
now we can be like,
it was kind of weird cause he has not 

215
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:10,470
been like super inclusive.
And then all of a sudden he's like,

216
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,510
we need to heal together.
And you're like,

217
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,350
hey,
you totally feel that way.

218
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,184
But like part of me goes out there.
Is there a part of him that fucking 

219
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,230
hates everyone that doesn't like him?
Yeah,

220
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,380
for sure.
Yeah.

221
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,770
He certainly mean he's,
look,

222
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,260
he's a super businessman and super 
businessman there.

223
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,730
They're like their game players that 
play in a game.

224
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:32,160
So if you move towards them,
you know,

225
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,230
and you make a move,
they want to make a move to county,

226
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,250
you're moving fuck you up.

227
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,970
Like that's Donald Trump's personality.
That's why he sues all those people that

228
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:39,361
uh,
you know,

229
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:43,140
he's involved in altercations with.
He just fucking squash this shit.

230
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,520
He doesn't,
he doesn't like,

231
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,620
you know,
if people are talking shit about him,

232
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,530
but that's when once he become 
president,

233
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,490
like you got to let all that go.
Like you have to.

234
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah,
you got to let all that,

235
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:56,970
you can't be tweeting johns to it at one
30 in the morning calling him a pussy.

236
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,980
She watched that video.
God,

237
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,620
yet it's hilarious.
He can't be tweeting johns to her at one

238
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,960
30 in the morning calling him a pussy 
when you're in your sixties.

239
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,330
What the can't,
he can't do that.

240
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,580
Can't do that anymore.
You definitely now,

241
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,500
now that you're the president,
please stop doing that.

242
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,100
Don't do it.
You can think it,

243
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,200
but don't do it.
And even if you think it,

244
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,820
why even bothering?
What'd he care?

245
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,380
They've got to get rid of his twitter 
immediately.

246
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,920
Nope.
He No.

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,390
Please bleeding.
He's get 'em keep tweeting.

248
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,560
Who Cares?
Why not?

249
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,693
Oh Dude.
Political correctness just took a 

250
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:30,210
missile to the Dick.
Now,

251
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,044
do you think,
do you think that's good or bad per 

252
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,230
standup on unquestionably good.
Unquestionably good in every way.

253
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,370
Shape or form.
Really?

254
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

255
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,653
Yeah.
It's good because he's going to do some 

256
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,620
goofy shit.
He's going to say some ridiculous things

257
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,630
a week.
I mean it right now.

258
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,760
If someone,
if you said something like,

259
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,350
I like to go up and grab them by the 
posies,

260
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,240
everyone would be like,
I,

261
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:55,290
that has to be acceptable because half 
of America is not offended by that.

262
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,400
You seat,
I'm a believer in that.

263
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,263
The president in a lot of ways shapes 
the mindset of the country because it's 

264
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,530
just a natural thing that happens in 
tribes.

265
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,723
You know?
If you have one fierce tribal leader in 

266
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:11,844
a tribe,
guarantee you the warriors that are in 

267
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,490
that tribe will also be fierce because 
they'll be under the guidance of the,

268
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:19,170
the one wild fucking guy.
I mean,

269
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:20,520
that's how,
I mean,

270
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,680
that's how like fierce armies get put 
together.

271
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,390
You have to have a bad ass fucking 
general.

272
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,003
Well,
when your president is this guy who 

273
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,530
rarely gets riled up about anything,
he's not emotional at all.

274
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,400
He's super articulate and really well 
spoken and he's a great orator.

275
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,120
That's Barack Obama,
right?

276
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,033
I mean,
that's what you would think of when you 

277
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:39,594
think of like a presidential person.
He's probably the most presidential guy 

278
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,200
we've ever had as president.
But then you go with trump,

279
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,920
like he's not doing that at all.
Like he's,

280
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,020
he's just rocking it at a totally 
different way.

281
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,160
100% yeah.
He's

282
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,290
doing it like a businessman.
He fuck with him.

283
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,580
He's gonna fuck with you back.
You know,

284
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,860
you fucking piece of shit.
Jon Stewart,

285
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:04,861
you pussy to it.
It's real name is Lima was one 30 in the

286
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,004
morning.
But that's the kind of guy that can 

287
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,440
fucking finance campaign for president 
all on his own and when,

288
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,570
yeah,
that's crazy.

289
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,880
A month.
I mean,

290
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,463
forget about whether you think it's a 
good thing for the country or bad thing 

291
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,313
for the country.
It might be the greatest success story 

292
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,303
ever.
It might be like the greatest upset of 

293
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,960
any contest ever.
100%.

294
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,780
There's no bigger upset ever.
Right.

295
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,110
Like what do you think the odds were 
when Donald Trump first entered the race

296
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:35,944
in Vegas?
That he would eventually become 

297
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,140
president?
What do you think the odds were?

298
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,880
I remember watching,
um,

299
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,820
Seth Meyers State of the Union address 
and he said,

300
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:43,654
Donald Trump's here,
Donald Trump said he's voting as he's 

301
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,870
running as a Republican.

302
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,830
I thought he was running as a joke and I
doubled over and I thought,

303
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,350
I remember thinking to myself,
what,

304
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,790
what,
what an idiot.

305
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,660
Hilde,
he could never be pres.

306
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,040
I literally thought he could never be 
president.

307
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,610
And then to think that that's a fucking 
reality.

308
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,040
Yeah,
it's interesting.

309
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,830
Has any celebrity other than um,
well Ronald Reagan,

310
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,040
Ronald Reagan's one I was curious about 
because they said that,

311
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,860
I don't remember the election,
I was too young,

312
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,760
but they were saying that despite the 
fact that he had already been governor,

313
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
cause that was like kind of like he who 
he had been an office,

314
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,040
they were shocked that anyone would vote
for Reagan.

315
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,260
They thought he was a fucking joke.
And Dude,

316
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,094
he destroyed Mondale.
Like I look at those county by county 

317
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:33,010
polls where they show you what the 
counties voted.

318
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,140
It's really fucking interesting cause 
you like,

319
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,640
look at Ohio,
it's all red,

320
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,530
but Cleveland's blue and like Columbus 
is blue and Toledo's blue.

321
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,440
And so,
but the,

322
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,060
but the thing is all the,
just outside the city,

323
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,700
everyone's voting for trump,
but in the city,

324
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,700
people are voting for the brewing 
Democrat.

325
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,590
But you look at,
if you look at Reagan's,

326
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,100
it's the,
I mean literally it's all fucking red.

327
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,383
Okay.
