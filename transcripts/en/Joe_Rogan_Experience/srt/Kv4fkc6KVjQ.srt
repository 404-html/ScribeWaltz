1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,810
The joe rogan experience.
Oh fuck.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,450
That's just gives me such anxiety
watching this.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,210
How big is that wave?
Uh,

4
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,870
I dunno.
Probably 60 feet on the face.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,880
This start damn son.
Oh,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,520
what does that feel like right there
when it's over there's parts.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,070
Cool.
Watch it.

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,480
I get air on the way down.
Oh my God.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,240
See my board gets completely in the air
right there.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,350
Oh,
do you are so high.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,380
That is so high.
Wave is so giant.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,900
It's like 40 feet above your head right
now.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,330
Oh my God.
This gives me anxiety.

14
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,160
You know what's cool about surfing is in
those moments,

15
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:39,210
like there's very few things in the
world other than like,

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,890
I dunno,
I dunno how to relate that,

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,450
but I'm like that moment right there for
me,

18
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:46,830
it was like the pinnacle of like who I
am,

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,100
what I do best.
That moment,

20
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,740
that wave coming in at that,
at that minute in my life where I was in

21
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,180
a right square foot of the ocean,
when that wave came in,

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,700
that was the best.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,340
That was one of the best days in history
at that surf spot.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,820
Wow.
Um,

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,100
and I was there,
I was prepared,

26
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,900
I was healthy at the right board,
the right equipment,

27
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:05,610
the right energy level.
It wasn't sick.

28
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,200
I didn't have any,
you know,

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,710
everything was just lined up and the
waves are lined up and the swell was

30
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,380
lined up and the wind was lining up and
the tide is lined up and I was in the

31
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:16,230
perfect spot when that wave came in.
Do you watch the video all the time?

32
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,870
No,
but every time I do I remember all those

33
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,250
things because it seems so much so,
so much luck had to do with it.

34
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,470
It's just like a line in the stars
aligning and it almost seems like

35
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,900
something I'd want to watch every day.
Like brick get,

36
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,560
get the day going.
You know your first kiss from a girl.

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,570
That's what that is.
Wow.

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,410
That like mind blown.
Whoa,

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,870
this is,
this is like an important moment in my

40
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,180
life.
I need to like have this moment in time

41
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,500
frozen.
That's what that is right there.

42
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,790
And so I think as an adult you very
rarely have those moments left.

43
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,710
I mean I like a really like mind
expanding and exploding moments.

44
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:53,640
We were like,
Holy Shit,

45
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,130
this is life hundred percent life right
now.

46
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,920
And that's,
that's what I think we're all chasing.

47
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,810
You know what I mean?
Those people sitting in traffic outside

48
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,270
right now driving the freeway,
they're not having those moments.

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,790
Not right then.
That's a real problem.

50
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,860
Yeah.
It's a real problem with life is that

51
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,280
people aren't having enough of those
moments and when you're a 75 yards away

52
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:15,600
from that elc a few weeks ago and you
had an hour to,

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,000
to really think about what you're doing
and where you,

54
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:22,320
where in your life and you know how you
got to 75 yards away from this animal,

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,640
the whole year of practicing on the
target and all the millions of arrows

56
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,900
you shot and all the preparation that
is,

57
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,980
and then this thing stands up and time's
ticking and that moment is there for the

58
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,710
taking and it's so easy to fuck up and
it,

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,830
it all happens the way that you,
you hope to visualize it though.

60
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Those moments don't happen very often,
man.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,500
Anyway,
I got an email about the 10th,

62
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:51,501
the 12th of October from some lady at
snap fitness in Shawnee,

63
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,070
Kansas saying,
hey,

64
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,590
just so you know,
you were actually registered for my gym

65
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,240
and we are doing an October challenge.
Yeah.

66
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,980
Um,
so I think I should take

67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,790
your off.
Currently you're in third place and then

68
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,540
what did you say?
I was at relieves me first place third.

69
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,270
At the time
I was like,

70
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,650
I can take you out,
but I'm in a pot.

71
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,690

00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,321

00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,154

78
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,320

really puts it out there.

Men from jail.

And there's an animated version of it.

So it started a flurry of animated try

Good question.
One more time.

109
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,021
Ready to go.

My mom.
What does,

114
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,590
we'd have to go through that like the
Zapruder film.

115
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,760
Okay,
well

116
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,700
what do you,

117
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,710
Like a man out,

118
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,940
Ho Ho Ho man out.
Fuck me for some,

119
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,260
you'd beat me a home,
Ya know,

120
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
right heartland now.

121
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,520
Hello.
Hello Matt Ho a man out is one potential

122
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,880
in here that again,
maybe that's it.

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,690
Fuck me.
Piss.

124
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,920
Somebody beat me at home.
You know it could be anything.

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,993
Oh Man.
Now,

126
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,100
oh man.
Maybe it's another language.

127
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,730
Whole menu.
We were like working for the government

128
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,380
and we're trying to decipher like a
tape.

129
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,760
Like we have to find out where the
kidnappers being held home and now you

130
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,000
have to like strip the audio.
I hear a train in the distance,

131
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,220
right?
We'd be audio experts in a room

132
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,570
somewhere.
We've got it.

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,500
We've got whole man out.
Whole man out whole man.

134
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,750
Oh Man.
Oh Man.

135
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:48,500
Out.
It could be or it could be.

136
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm home.
I'm home here now because he gives out

137
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,640
his address.
He goes,

138
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,170
no,
one more time at 2195 and we cut it off.

139
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,460
We cut it out.
Beat me on me.

140
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,540
I know.
These can be anything I'm home,

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,100
homey on now.
So you felt calm while it was flipping?

142
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,020
Oh yeah.
I always,

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,720
well,
I've seen cars flip,

144
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,100
right?
I've seen it for years,

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,750
right.
And so I know it's possible.

146
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:18,340
So I get in there and I got turned
around at a race in 1998.

147
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:21,180
I was racing at Daytona and,
uh,

148
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,270
I got turned around and the car,
so I'm flipping for the first time in my

149
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:29,500
life and this car is like over 3000,
3000 pounds.

150
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,334
So it's,
it's,

151
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,440
but it flies up in the air.
Like it's paper,

152
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,030
man.
It's the craziest thing in the world.

153
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,470
It's so you're weightless,
you know,

154
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,040
and what it felt like to me cause so the
car rolled on its side and uh,

155
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,480
came down kind of on its side.
It felt like somebody rolled a prop wall

156
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,480
of grass up against the car.
You know what I'm saying?

157
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,730
When I was on my side and I could see
the ground,

158
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,890
I felt like I was right side up.

159
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,190
Because as you're flipping,
the force pushes you down in the seat so

160
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:02,170
you feel it turned ugly.
You feel gravity all the time.

161
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,220
Like you're,
you know,

162
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,610
as a cars flipping,
you're,

163
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,910
you're pushed into the seat so you feel
great,

164
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,210
you feel weight of yourself in the seat.
That never changes.

165
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,400
You never kind of come up out of the
scene like that,

166
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,980
you know?
And so it's like somebody wrote a prop

167
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:16,990
wall,
the grass up against the side of the car

168
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,820
and then against the roof and then
against that side,

169
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,410
and then this,
you know,

170
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,650
it kept doing that.
And I'm like,

171
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,220
it's just the weirdest feeling and you
feel completely safe.

172
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,840
You know,
you feel like,

173
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,090
you know,
nothing's going to harm me,

174
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,650
but this,
any,

175
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:30,250
you know,
just,

176
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,940
you,
just,

177
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,530
one of the things we always talk about,
it's like,

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,770
get your hands,
uh,

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,150
owned to something because the spinning
makes your arms just go like this.

180
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,970
And if you watch a lot of old wrecks
from the sixties and seventies,

181
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,640
you'll see the guy's arms come flying
out the window and they're just kind of

182
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,100
flopping around.
They can't pull it.

183
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah.
It's spinning so fast,

184
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,800
you can't pull it in and,
uh,

185
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,080
your arms would go like that.
So as soon as you know you're going

186
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:55,470
upside down and he grabbed the bottom of
the steering wheel and Kinda,

187
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
you know,
watch.

188
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,630
But um,
I'll flip my pickup truck one time on

189
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,010
Christmas Day and I wasn't holding on
the steering wheel and my arm went out

190
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,390
the window,
you know,

191
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,690
for like a split second.
It banged around in the,

192
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,020
in the,
in the window seal and I was like,

193
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,801
man,
you know,

194
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,070
I got it back in and grabbed a hold of
the steering wheel with both my hands.

195
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,250
And so ever since then I've like,
you know,

196
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:24,210
now I know like anytime I'm in a crash
you got to have your hands a hold of

197
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:24,690
something.

198
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,300
Cause that's the one thing that you
can't control your,

199
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,700
you're strapped in with your seatbelt
and everything but your arms are and you

200
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:31,920
know,
can go anywhere.

201
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,340
And in that moment when the car's
rolling or barrel rolling or flipping

202
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,340
you,
it's so fast.

203
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,590
Like you can't,
your arms just go this way.

204
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,640
The craziest thing in the world.
That's the only fear I guess is that

205
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:47,280
your arm could get outside the window
and get crushed or something.

206
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,340
Cause you guys have had that happen.
I mean the discourse in this country has

207
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,860
completely collapsed and I love it.
Why do you love it though?

208
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,640
This course is cloud because my rights
are enough for discussion,

209
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,100
let alone a vote.
So whenever people sit down and have a

210
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,430
talk about my life and freedom,
it's going to end badly for me.

211
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,470
So if people can't talk to each other
about this,

212
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,270
maybe we'll go our separate ways and
live peacefully.

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,050
So you'd rather not talk about it and
just go peacefully.

214
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:13,050
Is that what you're saying?
Someone's political opinions and

215
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,650
preferences should have as much impact
in my life as their sexual preferences.

216
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,990
You want to fuck dudes,
you want to have a threesome?

217
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't.
I care if you're my friend and that I'm

218
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,280
interested,
but it's not going to impact me and it

219
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,690
shouldn't impact me.
And same thing with,

220
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,220
oh you want more welfare?
Great.

221
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,750
Go live your life that way instead of it
becoming some shouting match on your

222
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,210
front door and exactly.
Yeah.

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,450
Instead of you and your buddies coming
up and scare the shit out of my kids.

224
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,070
Yeah.
I mean,

225
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,900
no one,
I mean very few people deserve that.

226
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,820
I was going to say no one,
but very few people deserve that.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah.
So the disengaging from political

228
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,730
discourse as a strategy for just overall
civility,

229
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,610
but also worsening political discourse
on purpose to make it so that people

230
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,710
can't actually form coalitions and get
anything done.

231
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,210
But it is amazing how personal people
take other people's opinions on things.

232
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,010
Crazy.
It's like the people jet it,

233
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,800
you know what it is like when you're
dating and you think,

234
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:05,160
oh,
this,

235
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,870
this girl likes the same kind of music I
do.

236
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:09,720
So we're going to get along.
That is a very weak correlation.

237
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,370
And there's lots of people who are right
wing who are good people and there's

238
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:17,610
lots of people who are left wing,
who are good people and there's lots of

239
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,110
people who are right wing who are bad
people.

240
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,570
There's a very weak correlation between
this.

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,640
Uh,
it's a cultural signifier.

242
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,250
You probably came from the same culture
because people just take the culture of

243
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,890
what they grew up with.
But if you're going to just dismiss it,

244
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,440
it's higher schools of thought just
cause they vote differently from you is

245
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,610
as a personal level that's you're
missing out a lot of quality people.

246
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,220
So perhaps Erickson did before him,
I don't know.

247
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,080
Anyway,
you,

248
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,000
you,
you take an automatic process and you

249
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,160
interrupted in the middle.
So like when you're shaking hands with

250
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,390
somebody that's such a familiar process
that when you start,

251
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,141
you're not thinking,
okay,

252
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm going to grip this person's hand now
and I'm gonna move my hand up and down

253
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,420
with them a few times,
then I'll take my hand away.

254
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,070
What?
You just kind

255
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
of do it automatically and there's
something about interrupting that that

256
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:04,270
leaves people
really flummoxed and the world it,

257
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,770
cause they're really,
it really caught off guard.

258
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:09,460
Like if you imagine somebody comes up to
you in the street and says it's not half

259
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,490
past seven,
you know,

260
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,540
your reaction isn't to go,
yeah,

261
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,470
yeah.
I know it's 20 past nine.

262
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,790
Your reaction is to,
is a sort of,

263
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,940
you think like you've missed something,
like you're trying to make sense of it.

264
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,730
It's a strange
kind of,

265
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,300
puts you on the back foot.
And at that point if you to,

266
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:27,280
if you've got somebody who's fairly
suggestible and people coming up on

267
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,290
stage,
it's such an odd moment for them anyway.

268
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:34,291
They're naturally very suggestible that
a clear instruction to sleep or whatever

269
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,990
you want to give them tends to be taken
very deeply and very often than you'll

270
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,260
see.

271
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,080
I'll shake hands and I'll break the
pattern to the handshakes.

272
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,030
Well,
I'll often take their hand and lifted up

273
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,590
to their face and say sleep and show
them their hand like that and they just

274
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,320
sleep and well,
it's not sleep that it's a kind of,

275
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,970
um,
it looks like,

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,690
I mean,
they,

277
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,650
they'll do anything from eyes closed,
head drops down to just drop like a,

278
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,420
like a dead weight on the floor.
You know,

279
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,650
what I found is most interesting
actually,

280
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,484
it was,
um,

281
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,310
like applying this in slightly more
useful everyday situations was as a sort

282
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:10,210
of like a self defense technique.
I was walking,

283
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,760
uh,
between,

284
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,760
so I was like,
must have been like 20 or something.

285
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,450
And I was at a magic convention and I
was walking from one hotel to another

286
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:24,140
and I'm dressing like a three piece
velvet suit as this skinny British law.

287
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,210
I might as well have,
you know,

288
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,460
punched me in the throat,
tattooed across my face.

289
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,430
And this guy comes up and he's like,
uh,

290
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,300
he's drunk.
He's about three in the morning,

291
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,280
drunk,
aggressive is with his girlfriend,

292
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,720
clearly looking for a fight.
And uh,

293
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,130
he sort of,
he comes up to me and he says,

294
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:39,731
well,
what do you,

295
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:41,050
what do you fucking looking at when
you're looking at?

296
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,000
And because I had spoken about this,
how to deal with this sort of thing,

297
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,680
but it never found myself in this
situation.

298
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:50,470
I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed.
So I said to him,

299
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,120
I said,
the wall outside,

300
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:57,121
my house isn't four foot high.
And I guess there's an equivalent of

301
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,530
this with a sort of adrenaline dump.
I think it's called,

302
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,580
and uh,
in martial arts.

303
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:01,130
But there's,
uh,

304
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,010
it,
it just like he's got all this

305
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,830
adrenaline and then a thing like that
for me,

306
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,150
which is just out of context.

307
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,280
Like it makes sense.
I'm not like talking gibberish.

308
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,080
It makes sense,
but it's just out of context.

309
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,060
Right.
So now suddenly his thinking that I've

310
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,500
what?
I've missed something.

311
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,810
So now he,
he was hitting,

312
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,420
you went what?
And I said his girlfriend walked off and

313
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,170
I said,
the,

314
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,150
the wall outside,
my house isn't full for high.

315
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,700
I spent some time in Spain,
the walls that were very high,

316
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,440
but if you look at the ones here that
they're tiny,

317
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,390
then nothing.
And then he just sort of broke down.

318
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,510
He sort of went,
wow,

319
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,830
ha and uh,
start crying.

320
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,641
What you eat?
No,

321
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:34,960
it wasn't quite crying,
but it was just,

322
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,600
it was like all the adrenaline and
everything just,

323
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,740
just flooded out of him.
And he sat down and I ended up sitting

324
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,830
next to him on the,
uh,

325
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,180
like,
you know,

326
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,480
on the road side,
I'm asking him,

327
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,533
you know,
so what I was,

328
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,260
the plan was I was going to try and
stick his feet to the floor and I had

329
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,070
his whole plan.
He just kind of collapsed and sat down.

330
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,980
Yeah.
That was the,

331
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,710
cause I knew it'd be like,
this is highly suggestible state and

332
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,410
like either way,
the moment of aggression in past,

333
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,390
but I ended up,
ended up weirdly sitting with them,

334
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,180
asking him what had happened that
evening and his girlfriend did.

335
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:07,280
I think she'd bottled somebody or
something horrible had happened.

336
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,990
She said we'd got out with all this
aggression,

337
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,940
but it's a,
it's a good one,

338
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,000
isn't it?
If you just have like,

339
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,190
um,
it could be just a song lyric or just

340
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:16,100
some,
some weird kind of thing that you can

341
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,410
just go into it in those situations.
I mean,

342
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,490
if someone's running at you with a
knife,

343
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,740
it's a bit difficult,
but you just,

344
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,260
you,
you're kind of strangely taking control

345
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,603
of a situation.

346
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:34,890
Okay.
