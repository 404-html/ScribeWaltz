1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,590
Boom,
Jamie's fast today.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,210
Damn.
How are you brother?

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm going to see you,
man.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,310
What's up man?
How you been?

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,830
I've been good.
Glad to be back.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,480
D was the last time you were here was
after all the cars be craziness or

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,650
before?
No,

8
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,640
it was last time I was here.
Was In 2014,

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,370
early 2014.
It was before March 24.

10
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:24,690
Two.
Damn.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,510
You got it.
I was doing the press for live from

12
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,830
Chicago,
my last special.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,580
Oh,
that's right.

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,290
Yeah.
What was that on?

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
That was on comedy central,
but we're getting it on Netflix.

16
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,290
It advanced or this special.
Me Too.

17
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,570
I'm doing.
I'm doing that flux now from now on.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

19
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,180
It's just so easy.
It's easy for people to get.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,380
They can watch it wherever they can,
you know,

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,190
deck and find that month.
They can watch it the day of.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,180
They can watch it months later.

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,900
It's wherever you can promote it
whenever it's just A.

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,450
I'm really excited for this.
Yeah,

25
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,570
no Netflix.
I'm.

26
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,410
I become a netflix junkie over the last
couple of months.

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,890
I always looked to as that narco show.
Have you seen narco saw the first

28
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,410
couple.
Pretty good.

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,510
God damn good show is really good stuff.
I'm seven,

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,630
seven episodes in and every episode I'm
white knuckling,

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,130
just grabbing the couch.
Like I gotta get back.

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,810
But yeah,
I watched the first couple and it was,

33
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,460
it was dealt with.
They have so much fucking money now.

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,160
They can do whatever they want and they
can make like tv shows that are like

35
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,390
movies.
Yeah.

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,980
Sort of like how hbo does,
you know.

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,780
Yeah.
They make some good stuff man.

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,020
And they're easy to work with two.
Who's the kid on your shirt?

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,280
Uh,
some,

40
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,530
you know,
I did an interview yesterday,

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,240
uh,
with this,

42
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,260
it was a thing for vice and so she gave
me some,

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,980
some shirts.

44
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,630
She brought me some shirts from the
store.

45
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,250
She had got them for free or whatever.
And so this is just my favorite shirt

46
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,110
out of the three,
just a cute little kid.

47
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,340
Just
it looked like it could maybe be me.

48
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,700
That's what I sorta like high and it
could be given maybe a little bit.

49
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,460
The other shirts I did,
it was one other shirt.

50
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,820
It was a,
a woman pulling down,

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,030
like it was a sketch of a woman pulling
down her pants,

52
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,860
standing over a dog.
That's a bit weird.

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,030
And then there's another one that it's
had the tech set,

54
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,850
young Republican,
and then it was a person in a,

55
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,490
in a Klan outfit.
And I'm like,

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,900
all right,
I get what you're going for,

57
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,600
but I'm still not rocking.
So this was the winter out of the three.

58
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,270
That one that's wearable.
That's a cute kid.

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,700
Yeah.
No young Republican.

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,590
Stop.
Yeah,

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,100
stop.
Everybody stop.

62
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,021
Um,
so what,

63
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,130
what has it been like,
man,

64
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,470
this you sunk the Cosby,
raped,

65
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,380
shipped.
I mean,

66
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:42,381
I didn't expect to still be talking
about it now I saw you in January of

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,520
last year at a UFC.
Uh,

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,280
and yeah,
so I didn't expect it to still be.

69
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,380
It's not about me,
you what I mean,

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
but people made it.
It's just about.

71
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,910
I did a joke and,
and,

72
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,220
and people kind of rare,
but it's not really.

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,280
Has nothing to do with you.
It's not about me at all.

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
But uh,
that's,

75
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
that makes the story better for people.
But it's not a is not about me because

76
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,600
that's a good way of putting it.
It makes the story better.

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,860
They'd make it.
Makes the.

78
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,401
Yeah.
He's like,

79
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,181
oh,
he said it,

80
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:27,181
but it's like everybody was saying it.
But it is strange though that just you

81
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,900
saying it on stage for whatever reason,
it getting into a video and then all of

82
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,520
a sudden everybody was like,
yeah,

83
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,600
is that shit true?

84
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,660
Because everybody had heard about it.
It was one of those things that

85
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,000
everybody had kind of heard,
like you had heard rumors,

86
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,910
but it was never anything like concrete,
you know,

87
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,070
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

88
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,190
And then all of a sudden,
oh yeah,

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,550
that was the match that lit the fire.
You know,

90
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,670
what really what really,
uh,

91
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,910
people forget about this part of it
because I remember being,

92
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,911
I was on tour in November 2014.
I remember being on my tour bus and,

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,350
and that he put out this thing.
Cosby meme.

94
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,830
Yes.
And then he,

95
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,560
it,
it actually had died down a little bit.

96
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,320
This was,
let's say November

97
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,540
10th,
this 12 fish around that range.

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,790
And he put out cause me,
me,

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,713
me,
me,

100
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,150
and you could go on his site and
different images and then people started

101
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:34,720
saying stuff about it and then that's
what made it take off again.

102
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,040
People forget about that really.
And it's actually because I remember

103
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,570
that being like Google analytics about
it.

104
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,600
Where peaked for a little bit in mid
October,

105
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:51,601
somebody show and then it dipped and
then the causeway meme is what set it

106
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,000
back off again.
The Internet is so fascinating.

107
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,580
Yeah.
Because nobody knows how to manage that

108
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,740
kind of shit.
Like if you're like a PR person,

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,450
there's nothing you can do.
First of all,

110
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,660
whoever did the meme thing,
I'm convinced that the dude who did what

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,210
I would imagine whoever did the main
thing was probably somebody works on his

112
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,941
website,
right?

113
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:13,630
Yeah.
So somebody works on his website is like

114
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,350
a web culture person.
Someone who understands the Internet.

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Some tech dude or woman at tech person
is going to know what the fuck is going

116
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,510
to happen when they do that.
I almost think they did it on purpose.

117
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,000
That's my conspiracy theory.
Yeah.

118
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,990
Yeah.
I think they thought he was a piece of

119
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,310
shit and they said,
look,

120
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,520
I got an idea.
I don't know man.

121
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,130
That's what it was.
It's definitely weird,

122
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,140
but I'm trying to,
you know,

123
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,860
move on,
move on.

124
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,100
And I mean,
it's not his,

125
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,570
uh,
his is as I continue to is not really

126
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,450
about me,
you know,

127
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:50,451
I talk about the reaction to it in my
speech because it was really a crazy.

128
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,990
It was stressful too just to be in the
just casually,

129
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,590
you know,
going on social media or going on a site

130
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,580
how I normally would.
And then just seeing my name,

131
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,410
you know what I mean?
Now looking for it,

132
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,840
like Gnats,
googling myself but just go onto a site

133
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,690
and I was like,
Oh shit.

134
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,810
Yeah.
And originally,

135
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,610
initially at least people were mad at
you.

136
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,490
Yeah,
some still are really?

137
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,810
Yeah,
that's crazy.

138
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,720
People just,
they like,

139
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,630
yeah,
they,

140
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,100
they think I'm part of a,
it's,

141
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,940
it's a small amount of people like vocal
but vocal online.

142
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:32,060
So it seems like it's more.
Do you see that Bob Dude thinks that the

143
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,320
earth is flat?
Yeah.

144
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,450
There's a lot of fucking strange people
out there,

145
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:39,980
but that's one of the big conspiracies
was that bill cosby was trying to buy

146
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,250
NBC and that they didn't want bill cosby
to buy NBC.

147
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,400
So they came out with all these.
Yeah.

148
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,510
Fake charges.
Yeah,

149
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:52,030
and then they gave me a road.
They gave me my own TV show and reward.

150
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,330
Yeah,
they gave you a TV show,

151
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:58,331
but you already had the TV show that I
had to deal in in mid 2014.

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Luckily you're a very funny,
talented guy so this isn't going to fuck

153
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:09,650
you over and it was fun.
I could like as far as leaning into it,

154
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,600
dude,
like dozens and dozens of media requests

155
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,280
that I didn't do good.

156
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,490
I came to my place one in looking at,
been on the road for a couple of weeks.

157
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,420
I'll come back to my apartment.
It's an inside edition.

158
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Business cards slipped under my door.
It got into my building as if I would

159
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,870
come home.
Oh,

160
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,750
inside the district?
Yeah.

161
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,510
I'm gonna go on there now.
They're very resourceful for getting

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,700
into my building.
But uh,

163
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,170
that's creepy.
It was,

164
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:43,520
it was really creepy,
like people getting my cell phone out of

165
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,770
nowhere there you want to come in and
talk about a job.

166
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:46,604
It's like,
Eh,

167
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,470
no,
but um,

168
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,070
yeah,
just how good bob thanks to world is

169
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,730
flat
with Neil Neil degrasse Tyson.

170
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,290
So he wrote a dis song.
Did you hear this?

171
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,490
Oh I can't bring myself the song is
because Bob is a pretty.

172
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,540
It's funny because the song,
even though it's full of fallacies and

173
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,900
runs the song sounds good.

174
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,830
And then Neil degrasse Tyson,
his nephew or somebody who's also in the

175
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:20,210
science,
he put out a song and his song sounds

176
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,240
garbage but it has the facts in it,
but it sounds horrible,

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,290
horrible rap voice.
His voice sounded like,

178
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,930
is this guy rapping?
This guy can teach me something.

179
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,170
He could do a youtube video about why,
you know,

180
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:41,171
mintos explode in a goddamn coke color,
but I don't want to hear this guy rap.

181
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,650
It was horrible.
So it was weird.

182
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,570
That's unfortunate.
But truth gets a shitty voice.

183
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,840
Internet is weird,
man.

184
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,650
I wonder how much,
if Bob really believed that if he just

185
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,920
just cause strategy,
the people know how to manipulate

186
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,510
people.
You just say you could say something

187
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,180
contrary in an empirical response.
That's,

188
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,160
I mean that's the nature of when you
know,

189
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,340
people,
like I got fans that say,

190
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,000
and you probably had to say with fans
will just be like,

191
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,890
fuck you,
you piece of shit and you're like,

192
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,690
what's going on man?

193
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,481
He's like,
I'm a huge fan.

194
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,820
I just wanted to get your attention.
That does have.

195
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,050
And so one.
If it's the same thing with like Bob,

196
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,410
I know this will get people go and
because out of nowhere he doesn't tell

197
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:29,130
you.
I mean I haven't checked his history,

198
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:33,300
but I don't know if he has posed any
other scientific theories outside of

199
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,590
this,
but out of nowhere he's like,

200
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:38,340
you know what?
I'm about to post 10 tweets about the

201
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,440
world potentially being flat.
It's like,

202
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,510
ah,
I think he just wanted.

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,040
But there's a lot of people that believe
it.

204
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,170
That's what's fucked up Tila Tequila.

205
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,110
But I mean,
come on when it's,

206
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,680
when it,
you said to us Akila when's the last

207
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,890
time you said Tila?
Tequila?

208
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,650
Before she said the world is flat.
That's true.

209
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,620
That's here.
Tequila popped off my space.

210
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,860
Yeah.
We did a gathering of the Juggalos the

211
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,410
same year.
You did the gathering of the Juggalos

212
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,990
gathering of the Juggalos in 2010.
How was that?

213
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,011
It went.
Well.

214
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,950
I just did.
I did it for the stories and just for

215
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,840
the experience and,
and because they offered me more for one

216
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,090
show that anybody that was offered to me
at that time

217
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,420
till Tequila did porn.
Yeah.

218
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,870
Yeah.
She did a good job.

219
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,820
She did a good job.
Good job.

220
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,580
She got,
she got potential in that market.

221
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,870
I went to the AVN.
Oh,

222
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,733
did you?
Yeah.

223
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,600
What's that like this year?
I just went,

224
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,190
yeah,
I went this weekend in Vegas.

225
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,053
How was it?

226
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,150
It was interesting.
I went and just walk the convention

227
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:45,870
floor.
At first I was a little bit trying to

228
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,830
um,
play.

229
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,950
I was actually was self conscious about
Vietnam.

230
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,360
It's just bad.
Is it like not a good look for me to be

231
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,010
here,
so people that's going to take pictures

232
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:56,844
like,
no man,

233
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,070
you didn't see me here.
Oh,

234
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,050
you told people know,
people know.

235
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,840
But then afterwards I loosened up and
the ship,

236
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,920
it was just,
you know,

237
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,510
talk to some porn stars and just
interesting vibe and walking around the

238
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,030
convention floor.
I felt comfortable being amongst other

239
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:12,864
creeps.

240
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,440
Everybody's Gawking and
uh,

241
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,470
it was,
it was,

242
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,580
it was fun though,
man.

243
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,940
Sat in the front row at the awards.
Did you really?

244
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah.
Next to Dana.

245
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,450
Dr Maran.
Oh yeah.

246
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:31,470
I Know Dana and Ron.
Jeremy was to the left to her than some

247
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,940
other porn lady was next to me.
And then Lexington still in me.

248
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,940
I think I was the only non porn person
in the first few rows.

249
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,450
I didn't.
Doug Benson,

250
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,400
was that somewhere?
Oh,

251
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm that blowing his bought up
obviously.

252
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,220
No,
I'm sure everybody knows he's a creeper,

253
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,860
but it was not in the best way.
It was an interesting vibe,

254
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:53,560
man.
Just,

255
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,050
you know,
he's walking out with rockwood around

256
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:59,950
with test it out and it was a.
yeah,

257
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,330
it's weird,
right,

258
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,440
because everybody loves sex.
I mean sex is what.

259
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,870
It's one of the favorite things that
people do.

260
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,870
Yeah.
But the idea of filming it,

261
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,040
there's something fucking real taboo
about it.

262
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,370
Real locked down and taboo and,
and even like the admission that you

263
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,150
enjoy it is controversial.

264
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,650
Right?
Even though it's a multibillion dollar

265
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:31,420
business still with his own award show,
so it's definitely still a moment.

266
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,550
Billion dollar business and it's all
free now.

267
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,940
That's what's fucked up about it because
it used to be a multibillion dollar

268
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,310
business and it made sense because they
were selling dvds,

269
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,450
but now the multibillion dollar
businesses mostly paper view in hotel

270
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,020
rooms.

271
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,790
Oh,
that's where they make a lot of money

272
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,280
to.
One time I was playing xannies and St

273
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,010
Charles,
which is about good gig.

274
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,690
It's a outside of Chicago.
Yeah,

275
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,320
about 45 minutes,
an hour or so.

276
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,930
And so,
you know,

277
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,940
if I had a car I would have just went to
the Gig and went home every night,

278
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,430
but I didn't have a car so I got a ride
out there and I stayed there for the

279
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,510
weekend.
I remember I didn't have a laptop,

280
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:17,170
I didn't own a laptop at a time,
it was like 2007 or some shit to the

281
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,100
other.
And so,

282
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,130
um,
I was like,

283
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:25,131
I gotta order some hotel porn,
but the stuff I kept ordering,

284
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,370
I ordered,
it was soft porn,

285
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,980
so it was showing no penetration and no
anything.

286
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,940
It was just the grind it and this
fucking sucks.

287
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,530
I ordered another one and it was still
soft poop it.

288
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,580
I ordered a third one,
soft porn just spent 10 bucks a pop on

289
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:49,291
south point and I kind of wanted to
go to a call the front desk and be like,

290
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,010
these movies aren't what I thought they
were,

291
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,660
but I just,
I just ate the chart.

292
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,710
That's how it used to be in hotel rooms.
They'd show no penetration and they'd

293
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,120
showed no cum shots.
Yeah,

294
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,400
yeah.
They would show like scenes of people on

295
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,650
top of it didn't.
Bill Hicks used to have a bit about it.

296
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,820
You Bill,
Bill Hicks,

297
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:11,350
you save a bit about hotel porn,
about [inaudible].

298
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,710
They used to do apparently the way they
used to film scenes as they would film a

299
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:20,480
hardcore scene and a softcore version,
so they would have like soft core scenes

300
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:23,420
where they shot angles where they knew
you couldn't see anything and they did

301
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,860
it specifically just for for hotel rooms
like those,

302
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,590
all those hotel chains,
like the marriotts and all those.

303
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,500
Those are the biggest porn sellers in
the world.

304
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,230
You don't think about it,
but they're all in the porn business.

305
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,330
They make a fuck load of money off of
porn because they're charging now.

306
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,430
How much is it now?
Like 20 bucks or something?

307
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,530
Probably.
I haven't looked in a long time.

308
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,370
I know I go on the Internet and looked
at that stuff.

309
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,420
I think it's like 20 bucks or somewhere
close,

310
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,940
so I guess that's the move you want to
watch porn on tv if you,

311
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,350
if you want a big screen,
but sometimes you can't even reride now

312
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,240
knows that's a problem.
Yeah.

313
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,860
Or pause.
Yeah,

314
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,430
it's a very restricted.
What do you think,

315
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,410
because I got.
The thing about this at the,

316
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,580
at the awards was they had awards for
everything.

317
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,670
It's just best director.
What do you.

318
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,450
What makes a good porn director?
I feel like I could direct.

319
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,760
I think.
I think I could jump into porn direct

320
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:26,570
and kind of easy.
It was just if you just give me 12 hours

321
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:30,770
to watch a bunch of different porn,
give me the point and gave me the

322
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,930
screeners for the best director
nominees.

323
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,320
I was like,
I could mimic what they do within my

324
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,750
third directed.
Well you gotta think

325
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,270
not a whole lot to it because it's just
sex.

326
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,080
It's not like a direct in some car chase
on a bridge and as a fucking monster

327
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,780
coming after the people.
Now this is a real simple.

328
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,620
It's just fucking so.
Yeah.

329
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,500
But if you talk to the porn people,
they take that shit super serious.

330
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,190
I wrote a piece on my blog a long time
ago about a porn party because I had a

331
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:03,080
buddy that I used to do Jujitsu with who
is a director for a porn company and he

332
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:06,970
held a party for the release of this
film that he made that he was.

333
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,180
It was like an art film and what he
wanted to do was make a real movie with

334
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:15,930
a real plot and real dialog,
but have people fucking it and we,

335
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,600
we didn't know what it was,
was just a bunch of guys from Jujitsu

336
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,670
invited us to the party.

337
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,560
We all went,
what the fuck is going on here?

338
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,650
So they have this projection screen and
they start playing the scenes.

339
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,160
So they play this movie and he gets out
there and he's talking about it.

340
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:32,450
Like they said this couldn't be done.
That said that what I was doing was just

341
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,910
the industry wouldn't accept it,
but I did it.

342
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,510
I'm here and not the porn people.
This is backward.

343
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,350
Porn made money.
We're talking like early 2000,

344
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,710
2001 or something like that.
So then

345
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,480
like we're watching the scene right?
This seems ridiculous.

346
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,060
This is asked to mouth seen.
There's dudes banging this,

347
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,360
his chicken the ass then fucking her
mouth and she's making these,

348
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,480
he's gagging noises.
Like

349
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,950
then someone says she's here in his car,
pulls up and the girl gets out,

350
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,580
the girl who's in the scene and she gets
out with a dude and the dude gets out,

351
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,800
looks at the screen,
looks at her,

352
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,080
raises his hand like this.

353
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,000
And she's like.
And he's like,

354
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,500
you know,
he's a,

355
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,280
he's making these like we can't see what
he's saying.

356
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:21,114
And he's like,
Whoa,

357
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,450
why didn't you tell me?
And she's like,

358
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,180
I was gonna I was gonna tell you.
And so we're like,

359
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,890
do you think that he didn't know that
she was a porn star?

360
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,320
Like,
do you think he didn't know,

361
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,180
maybe he didn't know.
So we had to figure it out.

362
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:32,961
Right?
So I go,

363
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:33,830
hey man,
I go,

364
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,560
come here for a second.
So the dude comes over and I go,

365
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,200
did you not know that,
uh,

366
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,910
that she was going to be in film?
He goes,

367
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,560
dude,
I thought she was a hairdresser.

368
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,270
I go,
come on.

369
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:44,751
He goes,
yeah,

370
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,550
she told me she does hair,
dressing and makeup.

371
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,390
Are you fucking kidding me?
And she took him to this party.

372
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,590
She took him there.

373
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,860
She lied.
She met him at like some some bar.

374
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,930
How long ago?
How long before the party?

375
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,610
I think like the day before.
Oh,

376
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,380
okay.
Yeah,

377
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,510
I mean Shit,
all of them.

378
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,730
Shit,
that's true.

379
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,040
That's true.
She tried.

380
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,220
She tried to show him what she's capable
of,

381
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,990
what he could have.
I wish I knew specifically how long they

382
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,460
knew each other.
I don't think it was very long.

383
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,520
I think was real sleek.
She's trying to show him what's up I

384
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:20,130
guess and just try to surprise him.
It was more like,

385
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:23,230
hey look what the fuck.
I'm up to some of that.

386
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,920
But he came at the right time because it
was just asked mouth ass mouth.

387
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,690
The way I describe it was like the
dude's ball slapping against her ass was

388
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,950
like to chalk erasers,
like chocolates

389
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,130
and then he would go from that to our
mouse over

390
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,340
and that's right where homeboy walked
in,

391
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,070
got out of the car and was like,
what in the fuck?

392
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,380
I got pictures of them together.
I got pictures of him and us.

393
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,510
It's all online.
You can find it on.

394
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,320
Um,
her name,

395
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,130
her name is Jia poloma.
It was like a famous porn star back in

396
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,720
the day.
I think she's since retired.

397
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,420
So short life,
those young gals,

398
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:08,520
they.
It's not like something you could do,

399
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,320
like Meryl Streep deep into your
fifties.

400
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,311
Well,
this,

401
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,710
I'm Nina Hartley because she's still
doing.

402
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,240
She,
I saw her at the convention.

403
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:18,030
She had a long line of people waiting
for her.

404
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,990
She's a rare one.
A rare one.

405
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,530
Especially for girls.
Right?

406
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,420
Yeah,
she's odd though,

407
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:25,680
man.
She did.

408
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,130
Kevin Pereira was podcasts and I was
there for a little bit because I just

409
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:30,560
happened to be.
It was at the,

410
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,970
at the Ice House and get me sit in with
her for a little bit,

411
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,220
but she was talking about how it went.
Whatever she fucks.

412
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,300
She doesn't just make people wear
condoms.

413
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,000
She makes people wear gloves.
What do you put?

414
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,590
Oh,
you found the pictures?

415
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah.
She doesn't say this is all true.

416
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,563
Oh,
that's true.

417
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,760
That's the girl.
That was the.

418
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,790
What's the caption?
I don't know,

419
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,450
man.
Just to do.

420
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,610
And the little.
Not even that hot.

421
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,850
That's not my.
No,

422
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,440
that's from a cliff notes.
Oh,

423
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,100
this.
You talked about it on one before.

424
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.
Okay.

425
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,400
Well there's a blog.
The blog should still be up on my

426
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:08,610
website.
I found it on a bodybuilding message

427
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,930
board.
Someone like copy and paste the whole

428
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,460
blog.
Follow up with them at all.

429
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,360
Any.
Any,

430
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,980
any update?
No,

431
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:18,240
but I did run into the dude one day at
Chipotle,

432
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,250
a [inaudible] like way back in the day.
We're not one of them Mexican joint,

433
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,760
but it was,
but that,

434
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,550
that is 100 percent true little fresh
face.

435
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,260
Young Fella.
He looked like a,

436
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,510
just a,
you know,

437
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,520
innocent young kid from the valley,
had no fucking idea.

438
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,050
He was a nice guy.
He,

439
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,750
he had a great sense of humor.
I'll tell you that man,

440
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,440
because he was definitely dumbfounded by
the experience,

441
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,170
but laugh and a lot.
He was laughing.

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,170
He wasn't upset.
Like,

443
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,080
Damn.
I was gonna marry

444
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,130
him.
Laughing,

445
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,310
laughing.
It wasn't like nervous.

446
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,040
Well,
there was bolts.

447
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,550
We'll shoot.
You know,

448
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,180
it's,
that's not a good picture of her.

449
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,220
She's attractive girl.
You probably thought,

450
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,720
hey,
this girl's cool man.

451
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,140
We're going to get our free guns.
Meanwhile,

452
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,600
slap,
slap,

453
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,261
slap,
slap,

454
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,300
ticky.
Ticky probably still went for it.

455
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,250
I couldn't.
Could be.

456
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,980
You never know.
You never know how to.

457
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:18,940
Weird conversation with a dude who is
there too because he was a male porn

458
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:22,510
star and was talking very serious about
how he has to keep his edge.

459
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,890
And I was like,
what do you mean?

460
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,040
So you gotta keep your edge.
You got to,

461
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,120
you can't,
can't relax when you're on the set and

462
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,950
you got to keep your edge.
And I go,

463
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:30,880
well,
what do you mean by that?

464
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,980
He's like,
you got to always be ready to fuck.

465
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,050
Go.
Always be ready.

466
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,190
Like want to go?
Like right now I'm like,

467
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:38,300
really?
Like that's how you like you,

468
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,200
like on the set,
sort of like there's probably suck.

469
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,133
Get caught.
Yeah.

470
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,370
I mean some mental stuff too.
That man,

471
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,380
of course this is pre Viagara yeah.
When we're talking about 2000,

472
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,030
2001,
I don't think they had Viagra back then.

473
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,420
I really don't think they did.
I don't know what type of stuff they say

474
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,980
to themselves in their head what it went
back down.

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,290
But let's find out.
Find out when they invented Viagara.

476
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,990
Jamie back was,
I feel like nineties,

477
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,810
mid nineties
and then.

478
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah,
I feel like Friday night 98 ish a look

479
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,770
at you fucking nailed it.
Twenty seven slash 98.

480
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,340
Jesus Christ.
Hannibal.

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,980
Good.
Are you,

482
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,660
how did you nail it?
Like that?

483
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,410
I just remembered been,
I just remember the stories in

484
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:25,450
highschool and shit around it.

485
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,640
I just remember it being,
you know,

486
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,430
uh,
everybody was making those late night

487
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,810
jokes about it.
Oh,

488
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,680
that's true,
right?

489
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:34,750
That same joke.
Yeah.

490
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:39,340
The overnight get the director for five
hours,

491
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:43,900
call a doctor.
I was another girl.

492
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,030
A call that up.
Yeah.

493
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,290
That's one of those jokes that nobody
could say they got ripped off that.

494
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,020
That was a joke.
They fucking everybody did.

495
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,720
What is your take on all this?
Amy Schumer?

496
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,040
Shit.
I don't know.

497
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,010
I've been looking at it.
I've been looking at it.

498
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,500
I don't think she would take jokes.
I don't think she will take and a lot of

499
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,880
jokes that
they've been talking about like that.

500
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,620
Have you seen the most recent ones?
Was the most one?

501
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,460
It was a gang of them.
They put together some compilations.

502
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,640
There's a few of them that are there.
Definitely suspicious,

503
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,750
but the problem is when you're looking
like this,

504
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,810
you know when you like go and scouring
all the hours of standup that I'm sure

505
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,290
she's done places you can find similar
premises and she'll like that.

506
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,940
I think the real issue is whoever wrote
for the sketch show,

507
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,900
whoever wrote those sketches,
at the very least there's an originality

508
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,870
problem at the very least,
but there's.

509
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,850
There's,
there's like,

510
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,900
like the Kathleen Madigan one is a real
egregious one because you could totally

511
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,840
come up with the same idea that Kathleen
Madigan had about someone slapping food

512
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,550
out of your mouth.
As a matter of fact,

513
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,280
someone said I think should fear said
that that used to be on the flintstones.

514
00:23:56,281 --> 00:24:01,130
So there was an episode of the
flintstones where Fred was trying to

515
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:06,131
lose weight and so we had like a robot
that would slap food out of his mouth or

516
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:08,750
something along those lines.
You see if you could find that.

517
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,210
But um,
but the fact that it was the same two

518
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:18,380
bits back to back like Kathleen had that
and Kathleen had,

519
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,820
you know,
I would hire somebody.

520
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,330
Kathleen Madigan's bit was about Oprah.
How Oprah so rich.

521
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,250
Like how could she be so fat if I was
that rich,

522
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:27,140
I'd have people slap food out of my
mouth.

523
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,330
I would hire someone to,
to exercise me while I slept like a baby

524
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,380
with cerebral palsy.

525
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,040
So yeah.
And then so they go from the slap thing

526
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,350
right to the exercise.
You while you're asleep,

527
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,620
back to back.
It's,

528
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,520
it's too close.
Then there was this one from college

529
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,590
humor that was a,
a,

530
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,870
a sketch about the audition for two
girls,

531
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:50,360
one cup,
and it's exact same setup.

532
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,730
The,
I mean the fucking Fred.

533
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,511
Oh,
look at that.

534
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:56,390
See he's got a,
like someone.

535
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,330
He hired someone to knock food out of
his mouth.

536
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah.
Like that's not the most original idea.

537
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:06,590
Like people thought that before.
The real problem is they're back to back

538
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,270
the same thing.
Back to back.

539
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,890
Yeah.
Then there's this,

540
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:11,240
uh,
the college humor one,

541
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:14,120
which is the fucking exact same setup
there in the office.

542
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,160
They're a,
they're going through the audition

543
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,020
process for two girls.
One Cup.

544
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,990
I mean it's the same fucking thing and
there's a couple of other ones.

545
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,210
So it,
there's an originality problem with

546
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:26,840
somebody you know,
and I didn't know that college humor

547
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,090
bit.
So like say if I was doing a sketch show

548
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,080
and someone came to me what we were
doing,

549
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,030
the sketch show and said,
hey,

550
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,110
how about we do a sketch about the
audition process for two girls,

551
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:36,801
one cup.
I'd be like,

552
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,060
that's fucking great.
Yeah.

553
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:39,020
What do we do?
How we do it,

554
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,330
so she might not have had any knowledge
at all that there's other bits existed.

555
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,080
Like there's so much content out there
today to be aware of.

556
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,930
Every premise in every bit is almost
impossible.

557
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,380
It's tough man.
And it was,

558
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,230
I tried to,
when I was doing my show,

559
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,270
I would get pitched stuff and,
and uh,

560
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,390
I will try to.
Adam,

561
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,570
no,
all comedy obviously,

562
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:04,490
but sometimes I think like I would try
to remember the stuff,

563
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,050
but you can't remember everything,
you know,

564
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,280
in a day I think we kicked people from
in living color out of the comedy store

565
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:14,790
I should say.

566
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,850
We had nothing to do with it.
But when I was there,

567
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,770
like the comics were complaining so
much.

568
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:21,470
So they got him kicked out.
Actually I had nothing to do with it,

569
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,780
but I remember like being like,
wow,

570
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,490
this is cool.
They kicked the writers out because they

571
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,960
had these writers that would come and
they would hang out at the,

572
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,160
in the back of the comedy store.
And then they would,

573
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,770
those sketches would appear on
television,

574
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,590
like they would take people's premises
and turned them into sketches.

575
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,800
It was a real problem.
Was like,

576
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,560
this is in the nineties,
the early nineties.

577
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,940
Yeah.
And um,

578
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,340
so it has happened in my friend Kevin
Genius showcase

579
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,120
for all these writers.
And he did this bit about muffins.

580
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,060
He used to have this closing bit that he
should do about muffins,

581
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,280
that if someone wants a piece of your
Muffin,

582
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,760
you don't give them the muffin top,
you can have all the muffins teams.

583
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,840
He,
uh,

584
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,050
had a bit that he did.
He had a showcase for NBC at development

585
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,440
deal with NBC stump you want but you
can't fight.

586
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,360
It was a funny bit.
And in with Kevin,

587
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,920
he's a funny guy,
you know.

588
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,180
And Kevin is an,
I mean,

589
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,390
first of all,
his bit was way before the Seinfeld

590
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:14,330
episode,
but I mean he's not a thief at all.

591
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,020
So then that bit came out like in the
exact form on an episode of Seinfeld and

592
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,360
this is NBC writers who went to see him
live.

593
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,650
That shit happens all the time.
Those guys have to produce and some of

594
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:26,484
them aren't that good.

595
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,860
I've had fucking,
I've had some development deals with

596
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:32,760
writers and or some development deals.
And then you meet with writers and you

597
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:34,410
read some of the stuff they write and
these guys had.

598
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,700
This is in the nineties,
right?

599
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,460
So this is like the sitcom boom friends
and shit.

600
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:42,630
This is when I was on news radio and
these guys had big deals where they were

601
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,020
getting a lot of money and they were
fucking garbage.

602
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,390
Terrible writers,
terrible.

603
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,540
And they get,
they get desperado man and they need

604
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,060
premises and they'll go to comedy clubs.
No fucking steel.

605
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,360
And it was a huge problem.
It's been a huge problem for a long

606
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,650
time.
So.

607
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,860
So you take away those sketches and you
go,

608
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:02,431
well,
you know,

609
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,100
I don't necessarily think you can make
her responsible for those sketches

610
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,140
because there's no way.
Like if you were going to do your show

611
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,210
and you had a premise that somebody
pitched you,

612
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:09,600
what are you gonna do?

613
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,770
You're gonna go online and say,
Hey,

614
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,410
has anybody heard this premise before?
You're not going to do that.

615
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,250
Uh,
you've,

616
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,010
you have to ask around your friends and
your friends might not know.

617
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:20,370
You could ask me and I've been doing
standup for 26 fucking years.

618
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:24,270
I might not know.
You might ask 10 people and those 10

619
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:27,090
people don't know.
But then that big guts on television,

620
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,620
someone goes,
Jesus Christ,

621
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:30,780
I saw that on mad TV.
That was another one.

622
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,750
There was a mad tv one,
there was a mad TV tv one.

623
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,160
It was the exact same premise.
It was about a woman.

624
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,370
It was about amy talking to a woman at
the counter of a store and someone had

625
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,260
helped her.
The person who helps her gets

626
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,060
commissioned and she couldn't say it was
a black guy.

627
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,870
So she was trying a way to say it
without saying it's a black guy.

628
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,070
She's like,
um,

629
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,960
he had dark eyes.
Um,

630
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,790
you know,
and like it's put the same exact premise

631
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,490
as mad TV.
Right.

632
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,100
Did she know about the manatee viewing
the fuck watched mad TV.

633
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,480
I never watched it.
If you ever watch it,

634
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,760
I watched some of it,
but not maybe twice,

635
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,653
right?
Yeah,

636
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,910
yeah.
I mean how they were on for 100 years,

637
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,350
man.
TV was on forever.

638
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,423
Like how could you.

639
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,720
I like the sketches.
I didn't realize how racist it was when

640
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:21,700
I was watching it.
But the nail lady sketch.

641
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,810
That's a good sketch that made that girl

642
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,660
no.
Nat Bunk.

643
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,860
The Bunk Quique we.
Oh No,

644
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,280
I was telling them about the one,
the lady that ran the nail shop.

645
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,550
Uh,
Angela Johnson.

646
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,580
No,
no,

647
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,433
no.
This was early.

648
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,880
I think this is even before Angela
Johnson was on the show.

649
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,350
This was like early in mad TV.
It was one of their signature sketches

650
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,590
to.
Yes.

651
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,680
I forget what her catchphrase was.
Man.

652
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:56,470
I'm getting old man.
I don't remember shit anymore.

653
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,950
Do you smoke weed?
Occasionally.

654
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,470
That's probably the occasionally,
but not know nat.

655
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:05,890
I definitely don't smoke as much as you
and a,

656
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,410
you some Alpha brain.
So

657
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,270
we're out of here.
I'll give you.

658
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,480
I got.
I got instant.

659
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,700
Okay.
Can I keep this shit handy?

660
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,190
This is without this.
I'm Ricardo.

661
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,250
I smoke.
I sometimes it's,

662
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,260
but it has to be the last thing that I
do.

663
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,930
I really,
I can't be out and about like I can't

664
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,650
smoke and do an interview.
Really?

665
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,450
Yeah.
That's my favorite way to do interviews

666
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,590
because I can't,
I,

667
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,850
uh,
I did this thing a snoop dogg has this

668
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,000
turfed up like,
oh yeah,

669
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,330
I did it a Monday and uh,
just

670
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,180
he had shot what episode as I got there.
I'm supposed to be on the second

671
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,640
episode,
his producer,

672
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,460
he's about it,
trying to wrangle them so he could,

673
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,900
we could start shooting my segment.
He just leaves for 45 minutes.

674
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,020
So I go into the trailer.
He has a legitimate,

675
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,110
is a half pound bag of weed
and so he,

676
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,420
he's welcome to download.
I can't smoke with y'all man.

677
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,590
It'd be a totally different interview.
Let me get out of there before I catch a

678
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
contract.
But he didn't,

679
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,270
he just did a whole show in a panel
show.

680
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,370
How fucking high as fuck
though.

681
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,650
Actually you expect it.
But it's still amazing when you see it.

682
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,630
I mean obviously I know,
but he's just like,

683
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,370
yeah,
he's just,

684
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,910
you know,
talking shit,

685
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,350
holding court,
cracking jokes.

686
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,550
Funny.
Like he's like,

687
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,430
he is like you when you're around him.
Like yeah,

688
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:49,000
that's,
it was motherfuckers star operates like

689
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,140
a star,
you know what I mean?

690
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,230
Yeah.
Snoop's a bad motherfucker.

691
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,780
He works his ass off.
I'm sure.

692
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,730
So many shows.
Shit.

693
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah.
He's always got something going on.

694
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:02,500
Then the tour and still dj gigs.

695
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,660
Three different web series and shit.
So what is he doing?

696
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,110
Things,
things on youtube or something like

697
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:10,000
that.
I think this is going to be on youtube.

698
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:10,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

699
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,260
So anyway,
back to the Amy Schumer thing.

700
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,280
Um,
yeah.

701
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,050
I don't know man.
It's not good.

702
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,010
It's not good.
But it's also this,

703
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,900
there's like this momentum that's a part
of it now.

704
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,720
It's like a feeding frenzy.
Yeah.

705
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,160
You know,
and you got like Ari Shaffir had

706
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,530
something like that.
Remember when those people were mad at

707
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,450
him because he did a bit and one of his
specialist about a girl with one arm and

708
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,530
everyone's mad at him.
He's sitting at the center name shows

709
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,680
name,
comedy central.

710
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:41,030
Shouldn't let them,
let them say her name.

711
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,880
Why the fuck would they don't know how
that slipped through the cracks because

712
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,170
when I,
um,

713
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,200
one of my specials I uh,
did a joke about my ex girlfriend was

714
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,480
ladies and gentlemen,
I talked about having an introduced my

715
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:58,070
ex girlfriend at an open mic after
because she was a poet.

716
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,480
I hadn't seen her.
She just Kinda goes to me and didn't

717
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,560
stop calling me.
So it was just.

718
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,090
The joke was,
ladies and gentlemen,

719
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,730
please welcome to the cold hearted bitch
broke my heart.

720
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,510
You may know her from that returning my
phone calls also given out mediocre Joe

721
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,510
blow jobs.
Please welcome to the stage blank,

722
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,140
blank.
And.

723
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,480
But I was a,
it was a couple times I would say her

724
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:20,930
name on stage and they were like,
you have to change the name.

725
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,750
What I'm.
I changed it to something that's close

726
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,020
to the name,
but they were adamant about I had to

727
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,760
change it.
Yeah.

728
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,340
I don't know what happened.
I think they didn't see the problem is

729
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,450
he didn't make that special for them.
He made that special on his own and sold

730
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:38,450
it to comedy central.
So I think comedy central just bought it

731
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:41,540
and they didn't have to do any work,
so they just bought it and then edit it

732
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,370
and then someone just didn't do their
job

733
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,570
that.
So it was like,

734
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,340
thanks.
It was a fat person smelled.

735
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,200
It was just
very angry named mostly unknown person.

736
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,710
I was like,
God damn heart,

737
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,240
her name is.
I was like,

738
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,180
that's her full name.
Yeah,

739
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,480
that was rough.
While you live,

740
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,150
you learn.
We all make mistakes.

741
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,920
But what he was saying was that there
was a fire and you just got to stay

742
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:20,510
away.
Just let it burn out.

743
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,920
Yeah,
let that fire burn out.

744
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,820
Right.
You know,

745
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,140
and I think there's a fire right now
after her and a lot of it is,

746
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,790
look,

747
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,820
you got to be honest about what's
happening in her life.

748
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,680
She's a movie star now.
All of a sudden

749
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,900
had one of the biggest years never in a
that a comedian to seven.

750
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:40,890
Yeah.

751
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,580
So she went from a year and a half ago
to someone who would do.

752
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:48,420
Well she probably sell out a weekend in
Phoenix or some shit.

753
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,890
You know what I mean?
Like she did well,

754
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,950
right?
She was sued theaters.

755
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:55,690
I think she was just doing okay.
So let's say theater.

756
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,980
She's doing like a 1500 seat or
something like that.

757
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,730
Now she's doing 20,000 seats.
She's doing arenas,

758
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,200
man.
She's doing arena tours.

759
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,480
So there's got to be.
Some of it is the tall poppy syndrome,

760
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,790
right?
To people want to knock her down because

761
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:15,810
she's taken off so high.
But objectively stay away from that.

762
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,790
Look it up,
look at the whole thing objectively.

763
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,370
There's an originality problem.
One hundred percent.

764
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,960
There's definitely an originality
problem.

765
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,600
The problem is whose problem is that?
You know,

766
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:25,680
like here's,
here's,

767
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,250
here's something that someone said.
Someone said she's put out 15 hours of,

768
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,860
uh,
of sketches in one year.

769
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,190
Of course there's going to be some,
some originality problems.

770
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,300
What,
what,

771
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,970
what about that show?
Key and Peele

772
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,030
peele key and peele show like an old man
on purpose.

773
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,200
Watch it.
I watched it.

774
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,210
I don't even know how to say.
Key name key.

775
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,570
A pellet plants doing sketch comedy,
Peele,

776
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,820
Peele,
key and Peele.

777
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,360
Those guys are fucking hilarious.
And really original.

778
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,940
Really original.
They do some crazy shit you ever seen

779
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,770
that bit?
They do about slap pass about the guy

780
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,380
who slaps acids and the locker room.
He's got an addiction to slap in the

781
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,580
ass.
I haven't seen that.

782
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,390
It's fucking funny man.
And it's some shit that I've never seen

783
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,070
before.
Like whenever I see one of their

784
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:17,220
sketches,
it's always so out there and weird and

785
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:20,790
fun into a very dark direction a lot of
times too.

786
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,860
Yeah.
But original has.

787
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:24,930
Fuck,
it's all original.

788
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,720
So like that show's been on for years
and no one's,

789
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,020
no one's coming at them for,
for not.

790
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,470
So it can't,
it's not just the tall poppy syndrome.

791
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:37,260
There's definitely an issue and it
sucks,

792
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,990
man.
It sucks to watch all the blood in the

793
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:40,711
water,
you know,

794
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:41,180
it's,
it's,

795
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,150
it's,
it sucks to see like her big moment.

796
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,600
All this great shit happened to her and
all of a sudden now it's all this chaos.

797
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,700
Uh,
I mean,

798
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:54,360
I think it's just more,
it's one of those things which seems

799
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:59,361
like it's a crazy,
but isn't that as crazy because we,

800
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,620
just to say we deepen it with deep edit.
It as our world,

801
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,550
you know what I mean?
Maybe like my,

802
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,980
my mom.
Is it like,

803
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,880
hey,
didn't you.

804
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,850
That's what it is big.
It is to be your mom.

805
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,940
It hasn't found out yet.
It's only been around for a week.

806
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,710
Yeah,
I mean it's still only been going on for

807
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,750
a week.
This is approved fresh thing.

808
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,940
I mean think about like when like that
caused me video came out,

809
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,090
that fucking dude was still doing giant
theaters.

810
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,280
He was doing like 10,000 seat places
within a year.

811
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,380
All that shit was over.
Like,

812
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,960
you know,
people don't like when they find out a

813
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,380
comedian's a plagiarist,
they don't like it.

814
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:43,380
They get angry.
And I think someone wrote an article

815
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:44,650
about this recently,
you,

816
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,300
you,
uh,

817
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,540
you tweeted it and who was the guy that
wrote the article?

818
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,070
But the guy had a real good point and he
said if someone does something in a

819
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,600
movie and it turns out that,
that,

820
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,850
that scene had been in another movie
like,

821
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,380
Oh,
you stole that from blazing saddles or

822
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,750
some shit.
That doesn't offend people because they

823
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:02,880
know that you're just reading some lines
from a movie,

824
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,440
but if someone goes to see Hannibal,
they know that your shit is your

825
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,480
thoughts like they,
they want to see what is Hannibal?

826
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,660
Think about this,
you know,

827
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,080
when I go see Hannibal buress,
what,

828
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:14,800
what is,
what is,

829
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,730
what are his thoughts on blank?
You know,

830
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,920
what,
how does he feel about this?

831
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,620
How does he feel about.
I expect that,

832
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,240
you know,
you're an interesting,

833
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,730
intelligent guy.
You're going to have your own point of

834
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:29,520
view like you go to see.
Bill Burr is a perfect example.

835
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,270
Bill Burr.
You can count on bill burke,

836
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,890
kind of humor from Bill Burr,
like you go see him.

837
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,510
He's got like that.
Betty did about Arnold Schwartzenegger.

838
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,580
Oh great man.
Like you ever see that bed?

839
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,420
Is it a bit about a is fucking gold
digging?

840
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,170
We've got an epidemic of gold digging
whores.

841
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,810
She took down a great man.
He's a great man.

842
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,630
It's,
it's such a bill burr bit.

843
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:53,380
I fucking love that bit,
but my point is you're not going to get

844
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,610
anybody to write that for you.

845
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,860
He's not going to steal that from
somebody that's.

846
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,070
It's so obvious when you see the bit
that it's his sense of humor and when

847
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,950
you're not doing that,
when you doing just a bunch of like

848
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,700
patchwork bullshit that some other
people wrote for you or some clunky

849
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:14,110
premises that you may or may not have
lifted from somebody else and reworded.

850
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,860
It offends people.
Yeah.

851
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,800
Because you're a faker.
Right?

852
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,100
So that's what happened with Mensa.
People were offended,

853
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,590
you know,
they found out it's fake.

854
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,020
You're fake and you're not.
You're not doing what you're saying

855
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,360
you're doing.
You're saying here's the world through

856
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:30,340
my eyes,
but it's not really the world through

857
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:31,600
your eyes.
You just,

858
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,430
you're just trying to push buttons and
Fucking Bang on things and make.

859
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,410
You're trying to make things happen.
You know,

860
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:43,411
you're trying to use bits that work.
You're not necessarily showing people

861
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:48,030
the way you think about stuff and I
think that's what's unique about standup

862
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,210
as opposed to anything else.

863
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,510
Like if you found out that Jay Z had
writers,

864
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,730
would it offend you?
I wouldn't offend me.

865
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,370
It wouldn't bother me at all if I found
out that,

866
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,040
you know,
the rolling stones hired some guy to

867
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,830
write their new album.
It's not,

868
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,450
I'm not offended,
but if I find out that Lucy case,

869
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,460
new special was written entirely by a
team of writers and you know,

870
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,030
and he,
you know,

871
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,750
just sort of like rehashed all the shit
that they wrote down.

872
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,260
Then I don't feel the same way when I
like when I watched Louis,

873
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,770
I know that I'm going to see Louis ck
thoughts on stuff.

874
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,710
Every time you see them,
you know that that's Louis thinking

875
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:29,590
about shit and it's so obvious when you
hear it on stage.

876
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:33,730
It's like it's coming from his voice.
So that's the difference I think.

877
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,060
Yeah.
Would stand up definitely.

878
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,810
What's the guy's name here?
Wow.

879
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,200
Okay.
That's not even a real person.

880
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,820
How dare you person whoever you are,
why joke thieves are bad by someone who

881
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,800
doesn't believe in intellectual
property.

882
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,760
Yeah.
Well,

883
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,400
I believe in intellectual property and I
definitely jokes if you.

884
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,670
Have you ever been swiped anybody's
swiped from you.

885
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,680
I've heard about it.
I hear about somebody.

886
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,910
I'm trying some that opened Mike,
it has been lines where maybe they took

887
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,600
that idea.
I think that certain things or

888
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,290
commercials and shit like that,
but I haven't really,

889
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,010
uh,
I take kind of portray [inaudible].

890
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,600
Patrice O'Neil had a philosophy about
that.

891
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,630
Like somebody take a joke for me then
that means they needed it way more than

892
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:32,280
I do and I'm just gonna write more jokes
because I got,

893
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,370
you could take I'm a right.
Alright.

894
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,900
20 more.
You know what I mean?

895
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,860
So I've seen,
I've heard about comics tryma shit or

896
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,950
trying or doing different things,
but I don't really engage it because

897
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:46,210
it's just like,
ah,

898
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,620
if you,
if you try my shit,

899
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,250
I'm probably gonna just,
you know,

900
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,163
good luck with it,
man.

901
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,190
The problem with that theory,
I know what if someone does it and they

902
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,010
become like men Sia,
they become huge and they do that shit

903
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,230
on television and then you're like,
what if it's like a bit.

904
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,820
That's something you have a very unusual
bit about fucking skittles.

905
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,440
It's like a signature pit and it's
hilarious whatever.

906
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,870
Pick a subject,
but it's like something that's really

907
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,980
near and dear to your heart and maybe
worked on it for a long time.

908
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,480
You know,
there's,

909
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:18,050
there's bits that you work on like the
day I don't fucking work right away and

910
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,130
try to figure out how to.

911
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,260
You figure out how to make them work and
then someone comes along and just swipes

912
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:25,460
it.
You're not going to just accept.

913
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,630
Well,
I guess that theory,

914
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,980
my theory applies to people what they
saw less famous than when they started.

915
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,060
Yeah,
of course.

916
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,631
Yeah.
Yeah.

917
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:37,970
You just assume they're never gonna make
it,

918
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,340
but I don't know,
man.

919
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,870
It's a,
it's definitely dice.

920
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:43,900
I mean,
amy's a close friends.

921
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:46,670
Soda is dicey to exactly that.
That is just a weird,

922
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,100
weird.
Yeah.

923
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,320
Because I like her a lot.
I think she's hilarious.

924
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,130
She's very funny and sharp in interviews
and on the radio,

925
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,930
you know,
doing podcasts.

926
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,700
He's fucking funny.
She's sharp,

927
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,190
she's smart,
she's ambitious as fuck.

928
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,420
But this is a very unfortunate.
It's very unfortunate.

929
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,310
You know,
there's also a problem with,

930
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,270
uh,
apparently she burned through a shitload

931
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,560
of material doing that show,
like doing their show,

932
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,270
like a lot of her standup premises she
did in the show,

933
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,950
the show was very important and then
right afterwards just got to do the HBO

934
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:20,510
special,
you know,

935
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:21,710
and the,
and the HBO special.

936
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,410
There's only the one bit.
It was only the Wendy Liebman joke,

937
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:25,670
right?
Well there's a Mark Marin,

938
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:28,460
one to the bulb at the Mark Marin one
that people are saying.

939
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:32,420
It's like,
well that's a pretty obvious premise,

940
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,010
but you know,
I dunno man.

941
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,870
Who the fuck knows,
you know,

942
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,000
who knows?
It's not good that

943
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,630
that's it.
We'll leave it there,

944
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
leave it there.
It's not good.

945
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,320
She'll rebound because she's talented
and I really think she is.

946
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,500
But if she was anybody else though,
how about this?

947
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,180
This is true.
If I didn't care about her,

948
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:55,160
if I wasn't friends with her,
she was anybody else?

949
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,460
People would want her head if she was
some asshole,

950
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,600
you know,
like if it was seeing,

951
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,370
like if,
if it came out that car had a new show

952
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,940
and all this shit was on,
people would want his head,

953
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,270
there will be blood in the water,
but she's strong woman's feminists,

954
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,050
you know,
this whole deal.

955
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,780
Like it's like people are and people
like her,

956
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,780
like comics,
like her,

957
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,220
there's,
there's definitely a more kid gloves

958
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:27,050
approach from the comedy community
except for the girls that she stole from

959
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,710
or allegedly stole from or they believe
she stole from they.

960
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,760
They went after her and then they pulled
back like Wendy Liebman and Kathleen

961
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,470
Madigan.
They went after and then they pulled

962
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,680
back.
So is unfortunate.

963
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,990
Definitely.
Look at you,

964
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,500
be backed out of the whole conversation
back.

965
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,210
Pulled your chair,
vice chair back.

966
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,500
She'll be fine.
She'll be fine.

967
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,680
But you know,
that's why it's important to have

968
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,710
original material like Palae and Kiki.
What is the name key?

969
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,630
Keenan?
Keenan,

970
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,360
impale.
Writers.

971
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:11,250
Men.
Writers are a fucking problem.

972
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,160
If you don't know those dudes.
If you hire a bunch of writers,

973
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,500
you just don't know.
You don't know what their ethical

974
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:19,290
processes,
you don't know what their,

975
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,240
how their creative process works,
you know,

976
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,970
you don't know man.
Fucking and those guys have to produce,

977
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,470
right?
They have to produce.

978
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,880
I knew a girl who was a,
uh,

979
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,480
a writer on,
um,

980
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,890
she was a writer on like a,
a crime show or something like that and

981
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,600
she apparently had plagiarized some
shit.

982
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,230
She got busted,
you know,

983
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,450
she had just cut and pasted or came up
with some,

984
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,550
some shit that somebody else had already
done.

985
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,400
And that was it for her.
Later,

986
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,590
later in the season it might show,
uh,

987
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,760
so we know,
we'll send out,

988
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,780
I'll send out requests for jokes about a
certain thing.

989
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,310
And it was some writers,
you know,

990
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,160
eat subject.
They have to crank it up,

991
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,190
crank out 10 a bunch of jokes,
and he was one right close to the.

992
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,060
He just started just send in like one
week has joked.

993
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,400
It don't want to be like,
you,

994
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,243
uh,
you,

995
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,740
I never said anything about it because
the season was winding down with a part

996
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,310
of me wanting to say,
are you depressed as

997
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,160
fuck?
Give me one joke,

998
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,120
one of I'm a bad boss because I didn't.
I didn't say step it up.

999
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,130
Yeah,
I knew him before,

1000
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,800
but I want to put a comic.
Yeah,

1001
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,180
that's a problem.
But he's a writer.

1002
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:43,520
He wrote a lot too.
He was sitting in one like one joke.

1003
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,850
The problem with comics is if I'm
working on your show and I come up with

1004
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:52,260
a fucking bang as premise,
I'm going to Tuck that shit away and I'm

1005
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:57,150
going to give you some half ass shit
because like,

1006
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,560
if it's going to be in your act,
you're like,

1007
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,101
oh,
holy shit,

1008
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:01,680
this could be my new closer rescued.
Make me this.

1009
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:05,060
Could be it.
I can't give this to an animal that

1010
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:05,903
happens.
Right?

1011
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,880
With comics,
I mean I could see it.

1012
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,110
I can see it.
Avenue.

1013
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,153
Fuck.
Yeah,

1014
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,900
that's definitely what happens with
comics.

1015
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,540
If you,
if you're a writer,

1016
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,370
just a writer,
that's a different thing.

1017
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,630
They didn't want to be known for your
writing.

1018
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,520
Right?
But if you're a writer and a comic,

1019
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,300
Tuck it,
Tuck it,

1020
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,350
tuck it.
It's just interesting,

1021
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:29,530
man.
This whole thing is,

1022
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:29,980
is

1023
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,140
an interesting time because,
uh,

1024
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,840
the accountability accountability is so
high now.

1025
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,640
Yeah,
I think that's good.

1026
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,160
I really do.
Because I think,

1027
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,270
you know,
excuse amy and say it wasn't her fault

1028
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:44,770
and you know,
it's all writers and everything like

1029
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:45,660
that.
Whatever the.

1030
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,840
Obviously there was an originality
problem obviously.

1031
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,290
I mean there's no getting around that.
I think that's a good thing,

1032
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:57,100
man.
It's his forces people to to be as

1033
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,510
original as possible and even then
you're going to have some mistakes or

1034
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,720
some parallel thinking.
Parallel thinking is so common,

1035
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,820
like a Viagra thing,
right?

1036
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,100
Like when you,
if you have an erection for more than

1037
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:10,570
five hours,
seek medical help.

1038
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,700
Dad Joke writes itself.
That's over.

1039
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:13,534
That's,
that's,

1040
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,010
you know,
everybody

1041
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,800
thing I got,
I got two kids.

1042
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:19,020
I've got a boy and a girl.
The boy is an idiot.

1043
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,790
The girl is so sweet and smart boys
doing this dumb shit.

1044
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,480
The girl is over there doing this.
Yup.

1045
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,150
My wife is pregnant out.
I joke about wanting to have a kid just

1046
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:36,980
so I can get 20 to 30 minutes of
material because then I get it with

1047
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,130
that,
I get the uh,

1048
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,270
I get the trying to get my girl pregnant
material.

1049
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:45,320
Then the wife is pregnant material,
what's going on?

1050
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,950
She's pregnant,
she's all of this shit.

1051
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,030
Then I got the,
the delivery,

1052
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,290
the delivery of the baby material,
like,

1053
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,970
oh shit,
fellows,

1054
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,350
if you'd let me tell you in there,
do not look at the pussy.

1055
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,050
The pussy is going to be ruined.
That joke.

1056
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,020
And then you get the having a newborn
baby.

1057
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,260
It doesn't do anything.
It's just there,

1058
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,380
blah,
blah blah.

1059
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,380
And then you got all of the toddlers.
There's plenty of material in the jokes

1060
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:13,580
have been done.

1061
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,640
Dave been done.
There's no way around that.

1062
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,660
There's no way around those.
There was a seat.

1063
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,600
You do.
You remember in the early two thousands,

1064
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,630
while Bush was still an office,
there was a Chinese fighter jet collided

1065
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:31,820
with an American fighter jet and the
Chinese fighter jet pilot.

1066
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,800
The pilot's name was Wong Way.

1067
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,450
No.

1068
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,740
Yes.
His name was Wong.

1069
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:39,930
Way Long Way.

1070
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,230
W E I

1071
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,860
w o n g w e I

1072
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,373
really?
Yep.

1073
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,530
Oh Man.
That joke at the comedy store that night

1074
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,460
should fear like it's tells about it
because he worked the door and the,

1075
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,060
you know,
the comedy store starts at nine.

1076
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,850
It goes till two.
You said guys who would go on at 11

1077
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:03,240
didn't know that someone had already did
it at nine,

1078
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,170
9:30,
10,

1079
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:08,940
10,
15 guys would show up five minutes

1080
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:10,260
before they sat.
They have no idea.

1081
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:13,340
They say it and the audience is like a
weekend and punk is the same fucking

1082
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,000
joke over and over and over again.
I would love a DVD of that night that

1083
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,590
pitching,
pitching guys,

1084
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,230
pitching guys that had written.

1085
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,180
Wow.
Lisa.

1086
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,390
It was like,
Oh shit.

1087
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:26,540
There's one way to
kill it.

1088
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:31,541
I'm feeling creatively inspired.
One way guys have ever written a while

1089
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:33,980
ago,
I got this one.

1090
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,270
This is it.
This is it.

1091
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,770
Yeah.
Some road itself.

1092
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,600
Sometimes I'll search a joke it before I
tweet something that's about something

1093
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:46,601
topical.
I'll search that on twitter to see if

1094
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:50,030
somebody else said it already.
That's a good move.

1095
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,980
That's smart and it's some stuff where
I'm like,

1096
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:53,690
oh,
because there's some stuff that's easy.

1097
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:55,820
First thought that anybody can come up
with.

1098
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,200
I was like,
Oh yeah,

1099
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,040
I'm not that creative.
I didn't have a hot take on this

1100
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,630
cavaliers game,
but it's weird because it's your thought

1101
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,700
like,
shouldn't you just express yourself?

1102
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,450
You have to go looking to make sure
someone didn't express a similar idea

1103
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,450
first.
You don't have to,

1104
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:15,470
but it's just tricky.

1105
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,320
I'd rather do that then.
Yeah.

1106
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,410
Sweet.
The exact same thing as somebody 30

1107
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,390
followers just tweeted.
Yeah.

1108
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,343
You know what I mean?
Yeah,

1109
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,970
yeah,
yeah.

1110
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:26,900
It's tricky.
Right?

1111
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,970
And mediums,
man.

1112
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:30,950
That was another one that Wendy Liebman
got pissed at.

1113
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,520
Someone had taken one of her bits and
turned it into a meme,

1114
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,380
but without her face.
So credit.

1115
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,190
Yeah.
It was a car.

1116
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,400
They used a cartoon image instead of,
um,

1117
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,630
instead of her.
And uh,

1118
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,730
she was pissed.
Yeah.

1119
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,520
If it was her faith,
I mean if they'd done it a bunch of

1120
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,520
times to me,
I'm sure to you too with your actual

1121
00:51:49,521 --> 00:51:52,820
face and a bit that you said,
I have zero problem with that.

1122
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:53,890
I like it.
It's good.

1123
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:55,880
It means they like you.
They think you're funny.

1124
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:58,810
And they,
they took the time to say something that

1125
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,280
you said that they enjoyed and they put
it in a picture.

1126
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,330
I'm kind of upset that I never made blam
blam weeding him tee shirts.

1127
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,280
Shit.
It's not too late.

1128
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,800
Not too late.
Especially if I take you pig finding.

1129
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,830
If I take you pig hunting then we can.
We can go out there and with them.

1130
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,110
Yeah.
But people had that mean like

1131
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,970
immediately,
like why we're doing the podcast bland,

1132
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,540
Bland Wheaton Ham,
blam blam eating ham.

1133
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,990
Like Dan was one of the big complaints
about that fat Jewish guy was that he

1134
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:27,200
would take standup bits and they would
put them in memes.

1135
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:30,770
They would steal someone's stand up
jokes and turned into a meme.

1136
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:31,850
Yeah.
That was,

1137
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:32,980
uh,
you know,

1138
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,740
and it became the single.
Is he stealing jokes because he's just

1139
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,220
putting up memes on Instagram,
like what is that?

1140
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:41,540
You know,
but yeah,

1141
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:45,260
it is dealing jokes because he wasn't
crediting people and he was also taking

1142
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:49,550
people's memes from their site and just
reposting it without crediting them and

1143
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:53,540
then getting all of the new followers
and likes exactly somebody I went out

1144
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:58,541
with this girl in New York who works
with his management or something.

1145
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,060
And uh,
I don't know how true this is or if this

1146
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:10,061
is just a one off instance,
but she said that he got booked to do

1147
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:15,110
somebody prime or a sweet 16 and she
said he got a hundred $50,000.

1148
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,150
I was like,
what?

1149
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:24,984
It was a bar Mitzvah

1150
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,600
event.
I was like,

1151
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:29,340
what?
Well,

1152
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,540
if you're some fucking hedge fund guy
and you've got a son who's really into

1153
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,650
the Internet.
Yeah,

1154
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,230
that's what he wants you to get me the
fat Jewish.

1155
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,230
Alright son.
That's what you want.

1156
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:43,410
That's what you'll get.
Because like beyonce will do gigs like

1157
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:44,610
that.
And she'd go to Bahrain,

1158
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,380
dance for some prints.
Yeah.

1159
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,020
Make a couple million bucks at home on a
private jet.

1160
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,190
They do shit like that.
Yeah.

1161
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,100
They'll do people's parties.
I know a dude and uh,

1162
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,930
at his party,
he's some insanely wealthy guy.

1163
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,970
He had sting,
sting performed and someone else like

1164
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:04,200
that,
like some other,

1165
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:07,770
like big name dude.
And my friend went to this party and I

1166
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:09,150
was like,
what the fuck was that?

1167
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,691
Like?
They go,

1168
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:12,540
dude,
we're watching sting performed for 50

1169
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,090
people at this guy's house.
Like death.

1170
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,920
Fucking crazy.

1171
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,540
It's very crazy.
At Dana White's birthday party.

1172
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,460
I'm stone temple pilots.
Played

1173
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:27,020
Stone motherfucking temple pilots in a
small ballroom in Vegas at a hotel and

1174
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:29,790
date.
I'll tell you what,

1175
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:30,480
man,
that dude,

1176
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,900
he's dead now.
He just died of a heroin overdose.

1177
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:37,380
I guess we're just just fucking his body
up until it quit.

1178
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,950
But I'm.
That mother fucker could perform.

1179
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,320
Yeah,
I won.

1180
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,100
It was,
there was maybe a.

1181
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,320
nobody was paying attention.
Here's the part of the problem.

1182
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:48,400
Yeah.
We had to get everybody up like we were

1183
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:49,630
like,
people feel bad.

1184
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:52,200
So they're like getting people up other
seats and getting them towards the

1185
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,170
stage.
Watch this huge band is doing,

1186
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,110
hey,
who the fuck knows how much they had to

1187
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,630
pay them?
It must have been an ungodly sum of

1188
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,010
money,
but I'm.

1189
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,360
That fucking dude rocked out.
Like there was 100,000 people in that

1190
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:07,194
audience.

1191
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,960
He went full on.
I mean full on.

1192
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:11,370
It was.
It was really impressive.

1193
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:15,660
It made me want to be better at standup.
It made me want to work at my standup.

1194
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,450
Was is easy.
I think it's easier to do that when

1195
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,790
you're doing music because you got the
music.

1196
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,980
Yeah.
You don't need momentum.

1197
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,040
It helps me,
but it's easy to have the wind taken out

1198
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:32,730
of your sails when you perform foot.
A inattentive crap,

1199
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:35,850
like it's tough to just really get into
it.

1200
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:39,600
I guess you can,
but it takes a different for doing

1201
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,770
standup and doing stand up if you do it
in front of people that are.

1202
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,240
Half of my eating,
10 of them I texted and a few people

1203
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,730
paying attention and given polite
circles.

1204
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:52,470
Like it's tough to be like,
okay,

1205
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:55,900
I'm going to go all the way because
you're so dependent on it reacts a

1206
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,960
little music.
You get through band behind you.

1207
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,880
You can be like,
I'm going to rock this shit out.

1208
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,010
And cassius checking,
that's true.

1209
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,190
But in comedy acts with guitars too.
They could do the same shit.

1210
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,140
Yeah.
And then they still need the labs.

1211
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:12,170
The labs is what builds into,
into being able to really rock that

1212
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:14,530
shit.
Yeah.

1213
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,690
And be a pro.
But I found some that people if you,

1214
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,510
because I've done some gigs that a
horrible.

1215
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,340
I did this Gig so nice paying gig.

1216
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,380
Uh,
in Chicago.

1217
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,020
It was horrible.
As,

1218
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:30,910
as wide ballroom.
Most people talk at some people

1219
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:34,600
listening and usually I would call out.
It was like,

1220
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:37,930
this shit sucks.
This is horrible.

1221
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:40,270
This is a horrible performance
situation.

1222
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,610
But something in my head that said,
you know what,

1223
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,520
just due to time,
go a few minutes short

1224
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,730
and just don't acknowledge it and just
power through due to time.

1225
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,500
Goodnight everybody,
get the money and go and if you don't

1226
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,570
sometimes you don't acknowledge that
you're behind me.

1227
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,110
People think it went
well.

1228
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,250
They might just be nice to,
you know,

1229
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,630
they might've just been night,
who knows,

1230
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,830
whatever.
I hated the meet and greet afterwards at

1231
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:12,780
the meet and greet with like some of the
people with the organization or whatever

1232
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:17,180
can take a bunch of pitches and it's
like FDA did after.

1233
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,750
Yeah,
it wasn't necessarily eat but it wasn't

1234
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,140
an ideal gig.
It was just a,

1235
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,970
it was a cash grab,
a cash grab.

1236
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,650
But uh,
yeah,

1237
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:29,080
it was like the meet and greet
afterwards.

1238
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,700
I hate doing the meet and greet after a
social show because I'm like,

1239
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,030
I'd rather be amongst myself and my
friends.

1240
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,080
I don't know any of you and you were in
the crowd that I hate it

1241
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,740
as a group.
I wanted to talk to you but I'm glad you

1242
00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:48,741
brought that up because I remember you
and I were at the same casino that to

1243
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:53,860
your lip casino up in a.
it's like an hour north of Seattle.

1244
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,270
Yeah.
I know that gigs suck for you because

1245
00:57:57,271 --> 00:58:00,390
that Gig suck for me and it sucks so bad
for Patton Oswald,

1246
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,960
that he did a fucking bit about it.
It's on his last CD.

1247
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,120
It's on his last fucking you live.
I have never performed for a place where

1248
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:12,000
people were more drunk and rowdy and
crazy.

1249
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:14,430
It is the most.
I mean I had a good time.

1250
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,740
It was fun,
but I did an hour.

1251
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,030
I might have done 10 minutes of material
and I might be exaggerating,

1252
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,430
you know,
it wasn't that bad.

1253
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:28,020
Like they did see a bunch of people.
I'm trying to remember if this was a

1254
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:31,060
right,
but I don't remember being horrible lot.

1255
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:36,470
They just see a lot of people up front
that obviously weren't fans of mine that

1256
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:40,200
just they got casino comps or whatever.
They lose a lot of money.

1257
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:41,520
There is.
And so they got.

1258
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,340
So it was weird having these,
you know,

1259
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,090
middle age 50,
something like the first couple of rows

1260
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:53,091
full of these Asian ladies that
obviously nothing against Asian ladies,

1261
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:55,770
but I don't think they were familiar
with my work

1262
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,750
and they will in the front row.
And so that was.

1263
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,820
So I commented on that,
but it wasn't that,

1264
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,400
that bad of a Gig.
Yeah,

1265
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,811
it was.
But yeah,

1266
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:09,450
it wasn't,
it was way better than the Gig I was

1267
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:10,120
talking about.

1268
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,980
That's a,
that's another interesting thing about

1269
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:16,981
that Gig is that Gig was where this was
way before all the cosby stuff came out.

1270
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,160
The woman who was the manager came up to
us and we're talking in this and then I

1271
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:25,310
always ask people,
I said,

1272
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,080
what's the,
what's the weird shit you've had to deal

1273
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,150
with?
Like what's the most annoying comedian

1274
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,080
you had to deal with?
Like what's the worst thing you had to

1275
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:32,360
deal with?
And uh,

1276
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,760
she goes,
Bill Cosby was the weirdest.

1277
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,690
I go,
why?

1278
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,620
She goes,
first of all,

1279
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,520
he made us a sit down.
He made the staff poffle Jamie with the

1280
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,920
beer ready.
You.

1281
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,930
Very powerful.
I was about to ask foot another one.

1282
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,900
Um,
can I get one of those two?

1283
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:50,600
I'm sorry.
I feel bad with him drinking by himself

1284
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,750
though.
He made the audio.

1285
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:57,320
Not The audience.
The staff sit and watch him eat curry.

1286
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,190
They just sit and watch him eat.
He wanted everybody that was working

1287
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:03,690
there to sit down and watch him eat
what?

1288
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,730
Yeah,
yeah.

1289
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:06,620
Apparently this is his thing or was this
thing.

1290
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,420
Thank you.
So he would,

1291
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:09,590
uh,
he would make cheers,

1292
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,510
brother.
Cheers.

1293
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,590
Good.
Heavier man.

1294
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,423
Yeah.

1295
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:19,250
New Way by Cerveza.
He would make the who made the staff

1296
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:21,430
like the people that ticket people.
People,

1297
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,360
the ushers.
Security.

1298
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,970
They sat down.
They came into his dressing room and

1299
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:28,040
they,
they watched him eat curry.

1300
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,870
He sat down and ate and they just
watched him.

1301
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,450
That was his.
He wants people to be around him while

1302
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:34,520
he's eating.
Maybe talks to you.

1303
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:36,320
Maybe it doesn't,
but he wants you to be there while he's

1304
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,900
eating his curry.
Then I've been doing that for five

1305
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:43,520
years.
Then at the end of the night,

1306
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,580
he wanted the security guard to tuck him
in like he lays in bed.

1307
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,040
He wants a security guard to tuck him
in.

1308
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,050
Put the blanket over him.
Tuck,

1309
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:54,943
Tuck,
Tuck,

1310
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,431
Tuck,
Tuck,

1311
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:58,490
tuck.
Shut the lights out and leave.

1312
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,451
No please.
No,

1313
01:01:00,451 --> 01:01:01,284
no.
Yes,

1314
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,520
yes,
please.

1315
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:05,300
No,
man.

1316
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,880
There's some weird shit going on.
There was some weird shit going on with

1317
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:08,714
that dude.

1318
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,260
Just now.
You just put me on another headline and

1319
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:17,070
Shit just because just probably be in
here.

1320
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,120
Joe Rogen had a boat.
Weird bill cosby story.

1321
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,490
I've heard the curry thing from someone
else too.

1322
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,700
I've heard it from someone else.
Like it was someone else had a similar

1323
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:30,260
story that he had.
Did that,

1324
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,060
that he makes a people that work in
these,

1325
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:33,490
uh,
these places.

1326
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,520
Sit and watch me eat
some weird shit.

1327
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:39,110
Man.
People in a weird chest that the

1328
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,290
weirdest thing.
It's not,

1329
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,530
it's not awful.
It's just weird.

1330
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,930
It's just weird.
Yeah.

1331
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,970
Wasn't doing weird shit on the road.
You're very straightforward.

1332
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,170
I'm pretty straightforward.
I'd take pictures with everybody after

1333
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:52,004
the show.
Yeah.

1334
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,880
That's the weird thing.
Go out and I'll just,

1335
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,150
I'll do it for hours.
Yeah.

1336
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,190
Yeah.
How do you,

1337
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,020
do you pal?
I do enjoy it.

1338
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,670
Are you piloting through after like the
10th one or do you just appreciate what

1339
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:07,390
it means to people?
I appreciate it and I.

1340
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,420
What I do is I reset,
so like every person I don't go man,

1341
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:12,500
another one,
another one.

1342
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:14,570
Like if you think that way it'll fuck
you up,

1343
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,540
but what I do is I,
I just reset.

1344
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,170
This is me meeting this person for the
first time and now

1345
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,330
me is me meeting this person for the
first time and it's not the hardest

1346
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:27,480
thing to do for an hour or two.
No big deal.

1347
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,090
That's my weird thing.
A weird.

1348
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,940
It's appreciation.
Things appreciate a pay money.

1349
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,610
Yeah.
Excited to see blend.

1350
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:40,611
It's 3,700 people may usually.
It's not all of them that do the picture

1351
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:43,050
thing,
but it might be a thousand.

1352
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,410
Yeah.
The one in Chicago was nuts lined

1353
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,730
up around the top all the way down the
stairs.

1354
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:55,850
That took fucking forever with that
builds because people post that Joe

1355
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,530
Rogan,
Joe Rogan is.

1356
01:02:58,531 --> 01:02:59,850
Some people may not even know.
They were like,

1357
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,840
oh,
that seems cool.

1358
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:04,740
Let me check out Joe Rogan is and then
they listened to the podcast so I'll

1359
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:07,110
come to a sharp.
The weird part is when some people,

1360
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,360
even though there's a giant line,
they got to talk to you.

1361
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,580
They got to tell you some fucking story
that takes forever.

1362
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,550
You know there's a.
there's a giant line behind you.

1363
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:17,310
I can't.
I need some advice on this is the wrong

1364
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,960
place.
Wrong place for advice.

1365
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,270
How to like when people ask me to do
some goofy shit and the pitcher like,

1366
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,900
can you just do.
Let's make a weird.

1367
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,470
Let's make weird faces.
Can I jump on your back?

1368
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,400
Let's just.
Let's just look at this camera.

1369
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:33,234
This is.
Get this shit.

1370
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,360
Can I tell this?
I'm like,

1371
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:38,340
Nah man,
I'm that dude.

1372
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,590
I'm happy to take the picture.
Which he was stopped.

1373
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:42,720
I'm traveling around the country with
this garden gnome.

1374
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,940
Want you to hold it up?
Hold it up.

1375
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,830
Come on Bro.
I got everybody.

1376
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,581
Come on,
man,

1377
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:49,630
I got more or less weak.
He held up the garden.

1378
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,870
Yeah.
Well it only takes one person to weird

1379
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:00,900
you out for the rest of the night in his
garden.

1380
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:05,901
Oh Man.
I get thrown off easily by people not

1381
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,780
thrown off,
but I can just get put in a weird spot.

1382
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,440
Did you get put in a lot of weird spike
like after the whole cosby thing

1383
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:15,690
happened?
Did you get heckled about it at all?

1384
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,340
No,
not really.

1385
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,620
No.
I think one time I was talking about the

1386
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,450
reaction to it and then some guy was
like,

1387
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:23,880
that's all you talk about.
And I was like,

1388
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,000
I did like 40 minutes before I even
brought this up.

1389
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:30,750
But besides that,
not really because the people that want

1390
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:33,720
to heckle me about it aren't the people
paid 30,

1391
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,410
$35 to see me do a dank.
Yeah.

1392
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,740
But you never know.

1393
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,440
Some people just get drunk and they just
can't fucking handle themselves.

1394
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,060
They just don't know what to do.
It is an interesting thing where people

1395
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,340
sometimes think,
I would.

1396
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:53,940
I did ice house and I popped into.
It was a show in a small room,

1397
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,410
uh,
last Saturday and uh,

1398
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,590
I did a set and it was just the most
talkative crowd.

1399
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,510
I started out as a,
uh,

1400
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:04,081
so,
uh,

1401
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:06,670
I don't know if you've ever been in
Japan and there's like six people,

1402
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:07,111
like.
No,

1403
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:07,801
no,
we haven't.

1404
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:08,634
No,
no,

1405
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,770
no.
I wasn't asking you.

1406
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,100
This is not a dialogue.
No,

1407
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,830
we haven't been to Japan really.
I ended up yelling at them and roasting

1408
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,130
people for about eight minutes.

1409
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,550
Did two jokes and then got up out of
there.

1410
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,090
You were in the small room in a small
room.

1411
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,380
Small Room.
So intimate.

1412
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,030
It's only like 80 people.
Yeah,

1413
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:26,780
it was.
And it was packed and it was just

1414
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,170
talkative.
Yeah,

1415
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,350
that was probably a bad show.
It was.

1416
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,720
It was,
yeah.

1417
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,750
It was just,
I think they just wanted it to be

1418
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,780
roasted and yelled at and they were all
they probably day drunk.

1419
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,120
Yeah.
That'll happen.

1420
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,280
What are you doing tonight?
You got to.

1421
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,920
Scott will do meltdown tonight.
Oh yeah.

1422
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,570
What time is that?
Eight 30.

1423
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:51,280
What time you done?
Probably a nine.

1424
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,650
Thirty or 10 at the latest.
If you want to come down to the ice

1425
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:54,580
house,
sold out,

1426
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:58,680
show me Bill Burr crystally,
uh,

1427
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,950
uh,
and Tony inch cliff,

1428
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,780
just saying the big room.
There'll be a huge crowd show up to the

1429
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:07,630
big room is the shit at the ice house.

1430
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,240
That's the greatest room in the country.
They did perfect.

1431
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,890
Perfect Room.
Can't be wrong.

1432
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,650
And it's the oldest,
oldest comedy club in the world.

1433
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:15,603
Really?
Yup.

1434
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,740
Since when it's from 1960,
1960 as the oldest comedy club.

1435
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:24,320
Comedy Club on Earth.
The Richard Pryor performative.

1436
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,710
I'm sure he did.
We lived in La.

1437
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,000
I do have.
Everybody did.

1438
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,800
George Carlin did because so many
fucking pictures on the wall.

1439
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,430
Steve Martin perform there.
Yeah.

1440
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,810
I mean,
fill in the blank.

1441
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,810
Steven Wright performed.
That means there's so many fucking

1442
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:42,580
pictures on the wall.
People that were there.

1443
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,610
It's one of the most classic comedy
clubs on Earth.

1444
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,010
Maybe the most classic next to the store
has like a greater history because it

1445
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,070
was more greatness.
Like if you go to the store on any given

1446
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:58,270
night,
like the other night it was a Chris rock

1447
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,640
and Dave Chapelle.
Dave Chappelle went up and then Chris

1448
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,910
rock went up just totally out of
nowhere.

1449
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,420
I mean,
that doesn't happen anywhere else where

1450
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:07,930
the seller sometimes.
Yeah,

1451
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:08,800
maybe.
Yeah.

1452
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,970
Those,
those two clubs,

1453
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,030
like we're,
they'll,

1454
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,640
someone will pop in,
you know,

1455
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:14,680
like bill barrel pop in Louisville,
pop in,

1456
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:19,090
someone will pop in and if you're there
for a show on a random Tuesday night,

1457
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,190
you might get to see one of the best
comics ever.

1458
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,200
Just randomly.
I was there a lot.

1459
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,660
Did a show with Chappelle and in rock
last Thursday,

1460
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,260
this past Thursday.
Right.

1461
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,170
Pop there.
Was He doing?

1462
01:07:31,171 --> 01:07:33,140
He was doing this stuff about the Oscars
and everything was.

1463
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,740
I was gone by then.
I went up earlier.

1464
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,770
I brought up Joey Diaz.
Joey Diaz brought up,

1465
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:40,990
Chappelle,
Chappelle brought up.

1466
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,030
No,
jody has brought up someone else.

1467
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,760
And then that person brought up
Chappelle.

1468
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,090
And when Joey got off stage I went home.
Uh,

1469
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,470
so I missed it.
But Dave was there the other night.

1470
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,810
Man,
fucking hilarious.

1471
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:56,470
He showed up out of nowhere.
I brought him up and he smoked like six

1472
01:07:56,471 --> 01:08:00,240
packs of cigarettes on stage.
He can guests,

1473
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:05,290
you're allowed to smoke as performance
stage performance loophole.

1474
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:06,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

1475
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,950
It's like a part of your performance.
Yeah,

1476
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,640
like a theatrical production.
Like if you've got a cigar on stage and

1477
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:15,070
you're playing some cigar smoking guy,

1478
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,280
but fuck man.
He's fun to watch.

1479
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,900
Yeah.
There was a show.

1480
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:24,110
Was it two years ago or three?
Two years ago.

1481
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,080
It was a.
I went on,

1482
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:32,950
then Kevin Hart went on and then
Chappelle went on and brought rock on

1483
01:08:35,551 --> 01:08:37,880
stage,
uh,

1484
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,280
want to say Marlon Wayans Bill Bellamy
questlove and where the fuck was.

1485
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:50,420
This is at the comedy cellar and they
were all on stage and once just passing

1486
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:51,740
the mic,
cracking jokes.

1487
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,530
That's hilarious.
About an hour and a half.

1488
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,870
It was one of the craziest day there was
onstage at the same towel on the little

1489
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,880
comedy cellar stage at the same time,
just telling old stories and it was

1490
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,660
amazing.
The seller,

1491
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:09,400
what does that seat on it and some
change it.

1492
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,840
10 tops.
Those little clubs,

1493
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,520
man.
There's something magic about those

1494
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:17,780
little clubs.
It's funny because everybody does stand

1495
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:22,680
up specials in a big place,
but your best performances like that,

1496
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:26,300
like for me at least like the shows that
I have the most fun or like a little

1497
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:27,134
place.

1498
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,450
Well yeah,
just because you can.

1499
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,930
It's the clubs so more fun.
The people are right there.

1500
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,670
Yeah.
The energy is different.

1501
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:39,700
You can kind of,
you could take more liberties as far as

1502
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,560
working out a bit.
You know,

1503
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:44,810
you can't really,
you can try stuff in the theater.

1504
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:49,811
You can't leave work out in a theater,
but in a club you can have some misses

1505
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:52,940
and could lose the crowd,
gain them back,

1506
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:56,710
that type of thing.
So the clubs are more fun but you have

1507
01:09:56,711 --> 01:10:00,650
the theater is just a look better.
They look it,

1508
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,550
but there's some theaters that it works
out like something like the Tabernacle

1509
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:06,920
and Atlanta that places I've shopped
there before.

1510
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:10,760
Yeah,
I shot there my 2012 special and I was

1511
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:12,590
just,
there was just say a couple of weeks

1512
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,220
ago.
Yeah.

1513
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,370
That place is hot.
That is a hot theater.

1514
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,880
It's a theater,
but the acoustics in it are amazing.

1515
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:23,330
And the way it's tiered,
the people even like the people in the

1516
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:25,370
back row,
they're pretty fucking close even though

1517
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,360
it's a big place.
Yeah,

1518
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:30,620
that's a great spot.
It's a bunch of these old theaters in

1519
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:32,720
this country that when you performed
there,

1520
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,060
you're like a part of a museum or some
shit.

1521
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:35,881
You know,
like you're,

1522
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:40,600
you're performing in a place that's 100
years old and they charge you for it to.

1523
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,320
Do they charge you for the history?
Yeah,

1524
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:46,460
they do.
Yeah.

1525
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,250
Because you see a.
I didn't see it,

1526
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:51,890
but did you see,
I know you saw Rosie on snl.

1527
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:52,651
No,
I didn't say.

1528
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,500
You know what?
I didn't see it.

1529
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,730
You didn't watch it.
I didn't watch it.

1530
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,370
Joe Rogan didn't watch Ronda Rousey.
I didn't want.

1531
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:01,580
You didn't watch one of the top UFC
stars.

1532
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,370
I'm one of the top.
Those are your worlds there.

1533
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,130
I'll watch it eventually.
Comedy and fighting.

1534
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,840
I'm not into watching things while they
happen.

1535
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,490
Really?
Like to wait.

1536
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,810
Yeah.
Tell,

1537
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,260
tell me it's good and I'll watch.
It was a good.

1538
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:13,980
I haven't seen

1539
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,260
it.
I wanted to hear.

1540
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,460
I said I started out by saying I haven't
seen it,

1541
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:22,550
but I just assume you had and you would
go off about it for a few minutes some

1542
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,910
time time,
but I just wanted to hear your thoughts

1543
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:27,630
on it.
No,

1544
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,250
I haven't seen it.
I'm sure it was good.

1545
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,400
I heard it was good.
Yeah.

1546
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,580
Did you hear it was good.
Jamie didn't see him.

1547
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,740
I don't know.
She's a.

1548
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:36,210
she's a fighter.
Yeah.

1549
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,360
Do you want to see like a,
a cook racer bike?

1550
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,840
No.
No fight or fight.

1551
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,100
I would like to see a cook.

1552
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,290
You know what I mean?
I mean if someone that I really liked

1553
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,060
was doing it,
but I don't watch snl.

1554
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,340
I know I'm not a fan.
I don't think it's good.

1555
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,700
It's too bad too often for me to get
into it.

1556
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,920
Like the amount of good stuff that you
get off the snl versus the amount of

1557
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:02,754
like,
Ooh,

1558
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,100
it's way more than it is good.
There's just over the years,

1559
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,100
if you accumulate all the different
sketches want me?

1560
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:11,840
God Damn.
I mean,

1561
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,970
it's a classic show,
but on any given night,

1562
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,940
boy,
you're going to watch a lot of mediocre

1563
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,460
shit.
Tina Fey,

1564
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,540
we pulled that up so that was really
good.

1565
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:22,740
I wasn't.
I was there for that.

1566
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,570
It was a.
It has been great.

1567
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:28,140
Really great sketches in.
I also have a problem with it because I

1568
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:33,141
did news radio with Phil Hartman.
Phil Hartman had incredibly negative

1569
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:38,130
shit to say about SNL,
about the environment,

1570
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,580
about what it was like working there
about all the backstabbing behind the

1571
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:42,540
scenes shit.

1572
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,510
He hated it.
He fucking hated it.

1573
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,930
And when he came over from the yes
secretly,

1574
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,030
like,
I don't think he was public about it,

1575
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:54,290
but till now.
Well I think he's probably taught well.

1576
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:57,940
He's asleep.
Post harmoniously homeless.

1577
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,540
Is it polls harmlessly posthumous,
posthumous key and peele.

1578
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:06,350
He
post harmlessly posture posture.

1579
01:13:06,351 --> 01:13:09,990
Ms Dot Lee
posthumous.

1580
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,370
So being alive is hot.
Ms Dot know what is.

1581
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,450
I don't know.
It's just,

1582
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:16,530
that's it.
You know,

1583
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,480
but that.
Am I saying it wrong now that he's dead

1584
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,120
now that he's dead leaked out.
Well,

1585
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,830
you know,
what happened was he came over when he

1586
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,790
did a news radio that was the first
sitcom that he'd ever done and when he

1587
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,680
came over,
like he had this sort of like

1588
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:35,070
standoffish sort of an attitude,
like everybody's competing against

1589
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:36,870
everybody else.
It was like every man for himself,

1590
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,390
but then when he realized it wasn't like
that,

1591
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,980
he relaxed and then when he relaxed he
and I became friends and he would talk

1592
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,990
and you tell me about it and tell me
about like,

1593
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,070
what it was like over there.
He was a funny dude,

1594
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,840
man.
He used to like to get high.

1595
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,590
Whoo.
Yeah.

1596
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,300
Yeah.
He would,

1597
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,410
he would get barbecued,
get high,

1598
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,290
start rapping.
He would get high and go sailing.

1599
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,920
That's you'd like to do.
He'd be like,

1600
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,220
what would you do this weekend?
Oh,

1601
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:05,220
I got high and I got on my boat.
I went to Esalen.

1602
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,980
Yeah,
he liked to go New York out here.

1603
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:08,873
Out here.
Yeah,

1604
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,290
yeah,
yeah.

1605
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:11,950
He was a,
he was an interesting dude.

1606
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:12,080
I

1607
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,930
never met anybody who was more
professional,

1608
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:18,040
like he would have these notebooks,
like when you get a script I will

1609
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,250
fucking lose my scripts.
I believe I can't find my script,

1610
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,350
but isn't any other scripts.
I get another script read off that

1611
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:26,350
script,
but his script was in a binder and he

1612
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:30,040
had like,
like a different colored tabs for

1613
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,740
different scenes,
like a yellow tab for the first scene of

1614
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:36,370
blue tab for the second team.
All of his lines were highlighted and he

1615
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,920
had notes like you like little
annotations.

1616
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,050
You little put little fucking notes on
the side of each thing.

1617
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,900
Like hit it like this or do that
emphasis on that.

1618
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,760
He was extremely professional.
Well,

1619
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,440
yeah.
Yeah.

1620
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:53,050
Like I learned a lot about discipline
and just being a professional,

1621
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:55,930
watching him work.
Like that guy was not successful by

1622
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:57,360
accident.
He was,

1623
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,470
he was a hard work and smart dude

1624
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,880
and married A.
Yeah.

1625
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:06,380
All right.
We'll be right back.

1626
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,180
While you're allowed to call someone to
come when they kill your friend.

1627
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,103
No,
definitely.

1628
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,570
No,
definitely those times when those times

1629
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,140
to ride,
we uh,

1630
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:22,470
I was uh,
in Vegas and uh,

1631
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,290
this is a weird thing to happen.
I,

1632
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:27,440
I,
uh,

1633
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:32,890
met up with a friend of a friend.
This girl and her friend,

1634
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,950
we hang out for a little bit,
go to the craps table.

1635
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,900
I couldn't explain craps to her.

1636
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,450
She could not take in the rules of
craft.

1637
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:47,480
She was a little drunk,
but still the,

1638
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,210
not the whole craps table,
but the basic,

1639
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,140
the seven slash 11 on the first rule is
good.

1640
01:15:54,141 --> 01:15:54,471
Two,
three,

1641
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:57,710
12 is bad.
If you get anything else,

1642
01:15:57,711 --> 01:15:59,930
that's your point.
You want to hit that point before you

1643
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,060
had seven new?
Probably couldn't explain it to me.

1644
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,420
I don't understand.
You know what I'm saying?

1645
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,240
No,
you get a point.

1646
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,010
If you have five,
four or five,

1647
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,210
six,
eight,

1648
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:09,500
nine or 10,
that's your point.

1649
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:11,270
And you want to hit that before you hit
seven.

1650
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,223
Okay.

1651
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,760
But I said this to her eight times and
I,

1652
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:18,470
and she was watching the table also,
so she was just like,

1653
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,990
is that good?
Is that

1654
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,780
good?
If the guy is handing me money,

1655
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,370
it's good.
If he's taken away,

1656
01:16:28,371 --> 01:16:30,110
my money is bad.
How about that?

1657
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,670
Anyway,
so uh,

1658
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,690
so we go,
we get in the back in my hotel

1659
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,200
and uh,
her friend was there too.

1660
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,570
Long story short,
her friend and I believe in,

1661
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,270
we,
we,

1662
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:51,270
we fuck real quick
and then I go hop in the shower.

1663
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,750
I'm about to head downstairs to the
awards,

1664
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:58,680
to the porn awards and then she,
she was trying to make me fuck her

1665
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:00,500
again.
She was like,

1666
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,570
let's do it.
Let's do it again.

1667
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:05,040
I didn't come and I was like,
we were done.

1668
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:08,300
She was trying to.
She was like,

1669
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,100
just,
I'll write you was like,

1670
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,100
no,
we already finished.

1671
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,560
I guess I didn't get what I was like,
is that a.

1672
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:19,250
and I was like,
am I being a Douche bag?

1673
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,731
He was like,
no,

1674
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:23,930
she was being demanded also.
That doesn't feel.

1675
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:27,230
It doesn't feel good.
It didn't really like I'm wondering

1676
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,801
like,
okay,

1677
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:30,890
let's go again.
Like also I'm almost 33.

1678
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:33,170
It takes a long time to build back up to
that.

1679
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,060
Like the second round is too much for me
right now.

1680
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,020
Well,
it depends entirely on how attractive

1681
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:45,290
she is or how attracted you are to her.
That as a human being and physically

1682
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,110
like what she looks like and like it
sounds like she was annoying a little

1683
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:49,600
bit.

1684
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,810
Yeah.
Going to the porn awards was definitely

1685
01:17:52,811 --> 01:17:55,690
more appealing.
And then have sex with her for a second

1686
01:17:55,691 --> 01:18:00,691
time.
She was just really.

1687
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,030
Is it harder for drunk girls to come
because it's hard for drunk dudes to

1688
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:08,864
come.
Right.

1689
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:10,490
So is it hard for drunk girls to come?

1690
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,840
Uh,
so know

1691
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:16,190
there all night and just pounding away.
I don't know.

1692
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,250
Are we done yet?

1693
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,030
Not yet.
She was.

1694
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:24,740
She was a mess.
That happens.

1695
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,200
Does that make some bad decisions?
Sometimes.

1696
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,440
Hey,
we all do.

1697
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,870
It's part of life.
Especially with alcohol.

1698
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:35,250
It's amazing how many good decisions get
made when you think about all the booze

1699
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:36,530
is flowing around.
Yeah.

1700
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:39,150
Especially in Vegas.
It's amazing.

1701
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,110
Like when you go to Vegas,
it's amazing that it's not just chaos

1702
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:46,710
and fucking street fights and bottles
breaking over people's heads.

1703
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:51,780
If you just look at that,
look at a casino is a fucking 100,000

1704
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:53,040
people in there or whatever the hell it
is.

1705
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:56,160
Everyone's boozed up.
It's amazing.

1706
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:01,070
Not losing money.
People fucking up their lives.

1707
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,010
Definitely people fucking up their
lives.

1708
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,580
My friend Andrew,
he had this dude that used to work with.

1709
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:09,700
He used to work at a restaurant.
This dude saved up his money for 10

1710
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:11,860
years,
10 fucking years.

1711
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:16,810
He had a savings account when he put
together like 20 grand in a savings

1712
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:20,080
account over 10 years is chipping away.
It wasn't making much money.

1713
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:22,390
He's working in a restaurant,
goes to vegas.

1714
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:25,200
He blew it all in one weekend,
pop up,

1715
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,510
all gone.
I'll go.

1716
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,110
Came back.
Just devastated.

1717
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,920
Ten years of working overtime.
Put money away.

1718
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,440
Hundred here,
200 there.

1719
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,620
Thinking about all those hours that he
spent washing dishes and cleaning up and

1720
01:19:40,811 --> 01:19:43,030
all that shit.
Just to blow it on

1721
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:45,130
a weekend.
A weekend.

1722
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,150
Still hasn't recovered.
Gone probably killed him.

1723
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:51,430
So he said they're real casual.
Like people do it.

1724
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,060
People do do it.
Definitely do.

1725
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:55,030
Do it.
Shouldn't do it over money though,

1726
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:57,670
right?
Unless you owe somebody else money.

1727
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,390
We've been paying.
I think Robert Deniro owe somebody

1728
01:20:01,391 --> 01:20:03,340
money.
That's why it's doing this shitty

1729
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:06,630
movies.
The intern.

1730
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,020
Come

1731
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:08,341
on,
dude.

1732
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:11,010
That was a work of art.
How did that shit because of integrity.

1733
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,010
I heard the intern actually.
Did you see it enter?

1734
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,390
Yes,
I watched part of it.

1735
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,410
Did you like it?
Nope,

1736
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,990
I didn't see it.
I heard that.

1737
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,150
I heard some people at the intern.
Good,

1738
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:24,570
decent reviews maybe,
but so did like.

1739
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,450
There's a lot of shitty movies.
I get good reviews,

1740
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:33,020
but I feel like as far as the law,
like compared to this dirty grandpa one

1741
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:38,040
is like,
have you seen the trailers for this

1742
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,310
song?
Like a brief second of it where I sobbed

1743
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:43,680
in neural mechanisms,
Omega narrow face and it said dirty

1744
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:46,320
grandpa.
That's all I saw was like bad owes

1745
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:50,430
people money.
Like with this maybe does move each like

1746
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:55,431
doing a movie like that at one of the
best actors of all time of all time.

1747
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,330
Or maybe he doesn't give a fuck.

1748
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,060
No,
I think he owes somebody millions.

1749
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,200
Well,
there's a lot of people that they get

1750
01:21:04,201 --> 01:21:07,710
that lifestyle going and they want to
feed that lifestyle.

1751
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,580
They just have to chat.
They want private jets,

1752
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:15,300
they want that house in Spain or
wherever the fuck they like to vacation.

1753
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,430
They want a boat,
they wanted this,

1754
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:20,370
they wanted that.
They want to fat apartment in New York

1755
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,110
City.
They want a home in Beverly Hills.

1756
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:24,360
They want to pop up.
When you do that,

1757
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:27,720
you need to generate a lot of income and
when guys get older,

1758
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,060
especially the money drops
substantially.

1759
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:33,540
That was a big thing that I'm Robin
Williams is experiencing.

1760
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,330
He was talking about that before he
died,

1761
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:38,700
that the money just wasn't there
anymore.

1762
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,070
There was no.
There's no big money gigs.

1763
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,860
Like he would get interesting roles and
these independent films,

1764
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:45,250
but they paid nothing.
Yeah,

1765
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,640
and that's why I did that CBS show.

1766
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:52,620
Remember he did that CBS show,
the crazy ones just needed to generate

1767
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:55,920
some money and he had some craziest
state.

1768
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,340
He's got some amazing place in northern
California,

1769
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:02,850
like $24,
million bucks actually like hundreds of

1770
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,470
acres.
Just giant mansion on it.

1771
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:07,410
Just like the total great gatsby house,
you know,

1772
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,650
keep my costs low,
keep your cost low,

1773
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,620
cost low,
that's a good move to what?

1774
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,560
Until 30 years from now,
30 years from now and then you will off.

1775
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:20,340
When I'm.
When I become the host of family feud,

1776
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:28,680
then it was nice spending that shit
about the price is right.

1777
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,600
Family feud is.
I feel like family feud has more room

1778
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,120
for humor then prices,
right.

1779
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:39,510
Price is right.
You can get some jokes.

1780
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:40,710
That's true.
But family,

1781
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:42,990
few you can crack.
You got a bunch of different people.

1782
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,510
You get jokes off and you know what I
mean?

1783
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,670
It's true.
Yeah.

1784
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,800
Steve Harvey gets a lot of good laughs
off a lot of jokes.

1785
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:52,770
You got people setting you up.
Softball player.

1786
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

1787
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:57,420
And it's set up in the questions to,
you know,

1788
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:02,150
a lot of the questions are like they're
just innuendo question.

1789
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,440
Oh just fuck.
And you know,

1790
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:07,420
clean jokes.
If they came to you tomorrow with a

1791
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:08,191
family feud,
they go,

1792
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,990
look Wayne Brady,
he just doesn't want to do it anymore if

1793
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,810
will.
When doing it.

1794
01:23:12,811 --> 01:23:16,030
Now he's doing something.
He's doing prices right,

1795
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:16,660
right.
No,

1796
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,870
Wayne Brady.
Gary's doing prices right now.

1797
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:23,290
Some show me let's make a deal.
He does.

1798
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,540
Let's make a deal.
Oh,

1799
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,610
it's weird.
They did rehash these old shows.

1800
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,020
Shows a bit around the thirties.
Cheap to make tape,

1801
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:33,100
whatever.
How many.

1802
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:35,290
They taper the day in a day.

1803
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,600
They just keep taping them.
Man.

1804
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:45,870
They came to me today with an offer for
now.

1805
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:50,950
I don't know if I could go into it.
It would have to be a nice offer for me

1806
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,920
to go on and game show world now.
Yeah,

1807
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,200
I,
I did it.

1808
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,450
I don't think I could do it again.
I mean,

1809
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,190
I definitely could do it again if I was
broke,

1810
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,770
but I didn't.
I wouldn't want to do it again unless it

1811
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,650
was something unbelievable.
They pitched fear factor to you or you

1812
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:06,820
fear factor?
It existed.

1813
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,660
It was a show in Holland.
It was called now or never land.

1814
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:13,990
Oh.
And then they came to me because I had a

1815
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:19,020
development deal with NBC to do a Sitcom
and it came to me and they said,

1816
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:20,980
hey,
there's this thing,

1817
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:22,420
you know,
we want you to come in and have a

1818
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:22,870
meeting with it.

1819
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:26,010
And I started with making fun of it when
I went in there daily.

1820
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,810
They didn't want me at first because I
wasn't making fun of it because I was.

1821
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,560
Because they were a second dogs on
people and making them eat animal dicks

1822
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:32,380
and shit.
I was,

1823
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,160
I was mocking it.
And then the purdue,

1824
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,040
one of the producers was like,
listen,

1825
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,240
this guy's not going to work.
He's like,

1826
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:39,340
he's not taking it seriously.
We need these people to be scared.

1827
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,500
And then the other producer,
my friend David Horwitz,

1828
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:42,010
was like,
Whoa,

1829
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:42,400
Whoa,
Whoa,

1830
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:42,731
whoa,
Whoa,

1831
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:45,430
whoa.
Look at what we're doing this.

1832
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,640
We need someone to mock this.
This is fucking ridiculous.

1833
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:51,970
It shows ridiculous.
Like if it's going to be successful,

1834
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:55,750
we probably need a comedian and you
probably need someone to mock it.

1835
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,990
And I wound up doing it,
but I never thought I thought it was

1836
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:00,380
going to be canceled in June.

1837
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:03,210
When did,
how many seasons was 600,

1838
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,960
48 episodes.
Which,

1839
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:08,110
uh,
episodes should we look for if we want

1840
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:11,410
to see you dead in the eyes while I
wasn't dead in the eyes.

1841
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:15,100
I did way better than that.
It was right around episode three or

1842
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:18,970
four.
I started getting high as fuck.

1843
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:24,010
I would get so high that I,
I could feel the earth spinning it.

1844
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,130
I would,
I would take pot lollipops with me to

1845
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:31,720
the set and I would just suck on pot
lollipops and that because that's a slow

1846
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:35,950
release and the pot lollipops will kick
in like an hour into the show.

1847
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,860
But I'm functional,
like I know how to do it.

1848
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,920
I can operate hot.
Were you married to a fear factor now?

1849
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,900
Did you ever hook up with a contest?
No.

1850
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,471
No,
no.

1851
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:45,960
That's not a smart move.
Yeah.

1852
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:48,180
Doesn't seem smart.
But we just,

1853
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,860
we both agree that we do dumb things
sometimes.

1854
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,760
The dumbest Shit that you've ever done
because of your Dick

1855
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,430
was a bad question.
No,

1856
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:00,940
no,
no,

1857
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,430
the dumbest shit.
You just look down at your Dick and you

1858
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:08,240
go,
how dare you put the fuck did you do to

1859
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:11,210
me man fucking position.

1860
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,940
It's definitely.
I mean girl in Vegas,

1861
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,950
that wasn't a good decision when I was
just like,

1862
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,420
it doesn't seem like the worst decision.

1863
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,860
Worst case,
worst thing happened as she wanted to

1864
01:26:20,861 --> 01:26:22,000
come and she didn't come

1865
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:25,470
and but she is now.
I just,

1866
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:30,471
I don't like when I end up where I'm
like,

1867
01:26:30,481 --> 01:26:32,640
oh,
this chick is just hit for the story

1868
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:39,290
I was in when I was in San Jose.
I was a for.

1869
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:43,770
I brought this girl but I brought her a
couple of friends but I have friend.

1870
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:47,100
The dude leaves,
her friend crashes on the couch.

1871
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:52,670
It's a sweet girl called it to the room
with me and it happens and then I wake

1872
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:54,990
up,
I look over,

1873
01:26:54,991 --> 01:26:59,991
she kinda fucking with her phone or
something and I'm like,

1874
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,660
I am an instinct.
Let me see your phone.

1875
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:09,740
And then I scroll through the pictures
and she had taken like selfies with me

1876
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:17,871
sleeping in the background
and then I scrolled through some more.

1877
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:23,130
She had posted a snapchat the night
before,

1878
01:27:23,131 --> 01:27:25,320
like hanging out in Hannibal.
Buress is room.

1879
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,060
I cut my face,
wasn't in the sleep and pitched it.

1880
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:31,430
But that would have been the implication
if you were following her.

1881
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,460
See I don't,
I don't have a snapchat.

1882
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,560
Yeah.
So I don't.

1883
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,540
It was just pitches with

1884
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:42,230
on the camera law on like these cameras.
I wasn't on her,

1885
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,860
but that's like you,
if you do a snapchat,

1886
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:47,320
I guess you could save the image that
you put on snapchat.

1887
01:27:47,321 --> 01:27:50,050
You can save it to your right to your
phone.

1888
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,390
And so I deleted all that shit and I was
just like,

1889
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:54,820
get outta here.
What did she say?

1890
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,270
She knew she,
she knew she was at it,

1891
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,000
like fuck else.
She doesn't say she was like,

1892
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,230
she was young and Goofy,
but it was just,

1893
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:07,480
Oh my God,
what am I doing?

1894
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,190
He's fucking goof nuggets.
But I also,

1895
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,970
but also don't want to data famous
chicken.

1896
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:20,020
Then had everybody in my business.
You know what I mean?

1897
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,960
Yeah.
It doesn't seem like a good moat.

1898
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,920
You know the problem with that too,
it's like a famous person is not more

1899
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,740
attractive to a guy.
Like if you meet a hot girl and she's

1900
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:36,880
just interesting and cool and she's not
famous or you meet a hot grows,

1901
01:28:36,881 --> 01:28:38,990
interesting and cool and his famous.
They don't.

1902
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:42,580
There's no one.
One's not better than the other.

1903
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:45,130
Matter of fact,
the famous one carries a lot of baggage.

1904
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,140
Whereas for a girl,
I think she meets a guy like you,

1905
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:48,821
like,
oh,

1906
01:28:48,821 --> 01:28:52,210
he's funny and he's smart and he's
famous.

1907
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:56,000
He's famous.
Like the fame means something to them it

1908
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:58,810
doesn't.
Fame doesn't necessarily mean things to

1909
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,340
mostly.

1910
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,160
Let me some.
The,

1911
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,420
some guys just the EU.
If you watch tv or you see a girl in a,

1912
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:07,380
in a magazine or you see in the video,
you will.

1913
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:11,070
If you just saw a bunch of dope ass
instagram pages,

1914
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:11,904
you like,
Yo,

1915
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:17,660
that is that attainable to them
because you know,

1916
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,180
I heard,
I heard stories about old school movie

1917
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:23,370
stars or whatever.
Like in the eighties,

1918
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,100
they just flipped through a magazine
like her go get her for me and that's

1919
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,410
how they would pull,
like that was their tender

1920
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,270
flipping through a magazine,
like who was that or shit like that.

1921
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:41,040
So I think definitely think those,
those models and it's something to that

1922
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,110
for,
for some guys.

1923
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,160
It's an excitement to that.
Yeah.

1924
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:48,580
But.
And they saw that girl at a club for it

1925
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:50,070
be just as excited about her.
Yeah.

1926
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:51,710
Without knowing about.
Yeah.

1927
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,420
But maybe you know,
I mean I've seen,

1928
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,360
you know,
some that I'm like,

1929
01:29:56,361 --> 01:29:57,330
man,
I liked that.

1930
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,330
I liked that song.
Right.

1931
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:03,210
And someone's talented.
But then I do feel it feels iffy.

1932
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:07,410
So it feels just weird sometimes.
Oh well there's that whole world of,

1933
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,660
you know,
when you get in that red carpet world

1934
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:13,710
within that world of they follow your
relationship because you put your

1935
01:30:13,711 --> 01:30:16,440
relationship out there and all your
photos.

1936
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:19,410
I never did.
Even when,

1937
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:25,070
even in 2008 to two where I had a
girlfriend,

1938
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:31,410
like I didn't even put in a relationship
on facebook and it wasn't to like mess

1939
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:33,660
around with other guys.
It was just because I didn't feel like

1940
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:37,530
strangers because I had some facebook.
I didn't feel like strangers should know

1941
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:40,770
who my girlfriend is unless you see me
out and about,

1942
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:43,860
but you shouldn't just be able to go on
my facebook page and like,

1943
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:44,694
oh,
he's dating her.

1944
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,940
I'm here for the majority of people.
It'd be no problem at all,

1945
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:52,941
but it's just a few creepers that it
wouldn't be a problem happen.

1946
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,220
This thought the whole world is very
strange when it comes to that shit.

1947
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:01,480
It's very social media's a totally new
landscape that our parents didn't have

1948
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:02,850
to deal with.
Their parents had never.

1949
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:06,870
Nobody had to deal with it until this
generation is the first generation ever

1950
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,000
that's put their whole life out there.
I said,

1951
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:10,500
I have friends who put their fucking
kids.

1952
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:13,230
They put their kids pictures all over
the internet and everything like that.

1953
01:31:13,231 --> 01:31:14,480
I'm like,
okay,

1954
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:15,510
maybe.
I guess.

1955
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,640
I guess you could do that,
but it seems like.

1956
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,760
Did you ask the kids?
You know what I mean?

1957
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,123
Like

1958
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,140
are you gonna know what your kids look
like?

1959
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:26,300
Yeah.
That is weird and I mean with some

1960
01:31:26,301 --> 01:31:27,690
people that's how you get,
you know,

1961
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,900
I mean I guess you would add,
you could make it private but that's how

1962
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:34,250
you share it with family members that
you just put it on facebook and you

1963
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,280
said,
but there's also some people like to put

1964
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:40,190
that image out there.
That was one of the things that Phil

1965
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:43,040
Hartman and I talked about when he was
trying to break up with his wife.

1966
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:46,670
He was like,
I think that if I got divorced I

1967
01:31:46,671 --> 01:31:48,680
wouldn't get the same movies.
And I said,

1968
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:50,840
why?
He goes because my,

1969
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:53,340
my image is the family man.
Like I,

1970
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,260
I need

1971
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,980
like that.
Those are the movies I get.

1972
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,230
I need my wife and my kids and all that
stuff.

1973
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:00,220
That's like a part of like what I'm
selling.

1974
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,540
And I was like,
wow,

1975
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:02,800
I never even thought of that,
you know,

1976
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:05,290
because I was young and single and I was
like,

1977
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,280
oh,
okay.

1978
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,300
Yeah,
I guess.

1979
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:11,080
But some people look at it that way.
They want to sell a package.

1980
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:12,040
Like,
hey look at me.

1981
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:13,570
I'm a good guy.
Hey,

1982
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:15,340
here I am.
At my kid's birthday party,

1983
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:16,360
look,
I'm holding a baby.

1984
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:21,310
You know,
comedians would known to be degenerates.

1985
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:24,700
You know,
we're known to be dirty people,

1986
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:27,130
so much so that when somebody is that
they like,

1987
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,740
Holy Shit,
we liked this guy.

1988
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,590
Gaffigan come before the poem.

1989
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,790
I was just going to say gap.
Regan,

1990
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,330
where are you fry?
Every

1991
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,680
comp before him.
Before the pope?

1992
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,720
Yeah.
Gaffigan perform in front of the pump.

1993
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:52,600
It was the most fucked up about that.
He was on the Colbert show.

1994
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,570
Okay.
Colby,

1995
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:57,010
if you don't know it was a Catholic,
like a serious Catholic and he's on the

1996
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,790
Colbert show with Maria Shriver and
they're talking about how great it is to

1997
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:03,310
be a Catholic and they're,
they're on there and I'm like,

1998
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,860
am I?
Is this real life like you guys are

1999
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:10,070
talking about a cult.
You're in an ancient cult kid fuckers

2000
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,270
and you're going to go see the,
the head kid fucker.

2001
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:17,230
He's the king of the kid fuckers and you
guys are pretending that this is all

2002
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:19,420
fun.
This is all great stuff being a

2003
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:20,560
Catholics.
Wonderful.

2004
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:23,260
It's amazing.
It's just like such a great tradition

2005
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:24,160
and history to it.

2006
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:26,470
Like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2007
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:29,800
I was raised Catholic.
I went to Catholic school when I was a

2008
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:31,720
little kid.
Fuck all that.

2009
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:36,750
That is key to put my kids through that
as an adult to be an adult and to

2010
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,600
somehow another promote that it's
madness.

2011
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,540
That is madness is.
I mean,

2012
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:44,500
yeah.
I don't.

2013
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:48,790
I'm not a religious person at all.
I don't,

2014
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,800
I don't need it.
I think,

2015
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,230
you know,
it's cool when they give people food and

2016
01:33:53,231 --> 01:33:57,610
shit.
Churches when they donate.

2017
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:59,180
I think churches are great.
Yeah.

2018
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,030
I think church is a great.
And communities,

2019
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:03,640
I think it's a good thing where people
get together and just be nice to each

2020
01:34:03,641 --> 01:34:04,750
other on Sundays.
Yeah.

2021
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,150
Regardless of songs.
Yeah,

2022
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:10,990
there's a lot of good to that,
but Catholicism as a religion,

2023
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:14,740
like growing up in it and seeing all the
damage that it does and the guilt,

2024
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:17,970
all the fucking guilt and weirdness that
it came to us.

2025
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:22,030
Oh Man.
Catholic school was horrible.

2026
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:23,860
Yeah.
Horrible Shit Man.

2027
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,320
You to go to Catholic high school?
No,

2028
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,154
no,
no.

2029
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,090
It's great.
No,

2030
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,190
when I was early,
I only went to first grade.

2031
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:35,260
We stuck with you that much.
They would just this,

2032
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,510
this woman,
her name is sister Mary Josephine.

2033
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,840
Just fucking,
she was a monster.

2034
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,910
She was just the meanest lady.
First of all,

2035
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:46,030
I didn't go to kindergarten,
so that was my first time in school at

2036
01:34:46,031 --> 01:34:48,190
all.
So like first grade was the first time

2037
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:50,410
in school and um,
you know,

2038
01:34:50,411 --> 01:34:53,830
as she was mean Jo,
because she wasn't getting no Dick,

2039
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:57,810
man,
Catholic ladies don't be fucking it all.

2040
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:01,790
So they angry does death definitely that
nuns don't be fucking,

2041
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:04,520
they need the fuck and then they'll
loosen up a little bit.

2042
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:07,310
You know what,
stop and the dude's,

2043
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,590
what are they doing?
That's why they fuck kids.

2044
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,080
They're all bent up and fucking
tightened up.

2045
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,100
We had a kid that,
uh,

2046
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,440
in my high school that became a priest,
he was gay as fuck.

2047
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:18,260
Everybody knew he was gay.
We knew he was gay and he's going to

2048
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:20,120
become a priest.
And I remember thinking,

2049
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:23,870
this is so bizarre.
I guess this guy is avoiding pussy by

2050
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:26,910
becoming a priest because we're like,
hey billy,

2051
01:35:26,911 --> 01:35:28,340
you when are you going to have a
girlfriend hold?

2052
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:32,900
The Lord's got me wrapped up and he
became a Catholic priest.

2053
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:33,920
I mean,
I don't know if he ever went.

2054
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,480
I mean I didn't talk to them after high
school,

2055
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,610
but I'm assuming he went with it,
but he was.

2056
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:39,440
That was the whole thing and he was
going to be a.

2057
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:41,930
He was going to be a father.
Billy was going to be a father,

2058
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,310
father billy.
Oh,

2059
01:35:43,311 --> 01:35:44,144
there he goes.

2060
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:49,670
The fact that they think that there
needs to be new people to teach religion

2061
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:52,190
at all.
We need new people like now why don't

2062
01:35:52,191 --> 01:35:54,350
you just.
Do you need somebody else to say this

2063
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:59,090
shit has been being said.
It's nothing new to be added to it.

2064
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,970
What's an organization?
Yeah.

2065
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:04,160
This is an organization that needs,
needs members to grow.

2066
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:07,220
It's a spooky organization that the
amount of.

2067
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,320
Like.
One of the things that happened when

2068
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:12,980
ratzinger was the pope,
the glass guy who stepped down.

2069
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:16,160
One of the reasons why stepped down,
it was revealed that that guy had

2070
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:19,470
relocated child molesters and one of
them that have relocated walnut

2071
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:24,520
molesting a hundred deaf kids,
a hundred deaf kid likes this guy was

2072
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:27,950
they relocated them,
some new place in rats.

2073
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,170
They knew he was a pedophile.
I mean,

2074
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:31,940
this isn't,
it's not a new thing.

2075
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,250
I mean,
pedophilia in the Catholic church is

2076
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:35,330
fucking bananas.

2077
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,760
It's so rampant.
Yeah.

2078
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:39,440
I mean,
if you had that many pedophiles say like

2079
01:36:39,441 --> 01:36:42,130
in Nascar,
how long would it take for the shutdown

2080
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,230
NASCAR?
Nascar is a fucking crazy pedophile

2081
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:48,850
ring,
but because it's the Lord the Lord's

2082
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:51,410
attached all this kid fucking at somehow
or another,

2083
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:54,470
that guy's not in jail.
They just moved that guy to some new

2084
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:57,020
place and you know,
now you don't see him anymore.

2085
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,210
But he,
he can't.

2086
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,580
He was one of those guys.
They were trying to cry.

2087
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:04,280
They were trying to try him for crimes
against humanity.

2088
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,870
There was all these,
um,

2089
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:10,100
these people that were,
that were petitioning while he was the

2090
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:13,420
pope to get him tried.
And uh,

2091
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:16,070
then he had a step down.
This new guy stepped in,

2092
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:17,390
this new guy.
He's pretty cool.

2093
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:21,170
It's like as far as pope's go,
gotta like he got rid of the throne.

2094
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:23,780
Got Pretty decent.
Normal Chair.

2095
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:26,630
Yeah.
That should change everything.

2096
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,760
He doesn't ride around the Pope Mobile.
Whether you ride around in a Fiat,

2097
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,970
if they shoot me,
they shoot me.

2098
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,760
Yeah.
As people.

2099
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,110
When was the last time they went after
the pope?

2100
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,920
Right?
Right before they built the Pomo bill

2101
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,930
shot the pope.
I mean people shot the pope before.

2102
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,820
Look,
you know it was going to shoot the pope.

2103
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,590
Someone who got fucked by a priest.
Yeah,

2104
01:37:48,591 --> 01:37:52,400
probably.
And you're talking about thousands of

2105
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:54,800
people.
It is a banana's religion.

2106
01:37:54,801 --> 01:37:56,010
If you really stop and think about

2107
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,320
how many people have been molested by a
priest.

2108
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,490
When I was a kid,
I would hear about it when I was in

2109
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:05,070
Catholic school.
I would hear about it in hush tones

2110
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:09,810
amongst relatives and people that the
father did something to him and there

2111
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:13,920
there was this and stay away from father
o'malley and stay away from this guy

2112
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,300
likes.
Yeah.

2113
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:19,860
I had a friend of mine who who had the,
he had to stay over during high school

2114
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,450
for like a track and field thing and
they,

2115
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:25,800
they made them stay at the church
because he was in Catholic school and

2116
01:38:25,801 --> 01:38:28,760
he's like,
I'm literally fighting this old guy off

2117
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:29,281
of me.
He goes,

2118
01:38:29,281 --> 01:38:30,590
I'm 16 years old.
His case,

2119
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,570
reaching his hand in my pants,
he's grabbing my Dick.

2120
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:35,930
He's like,
he was drunk with wine.

2121
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:36,930
He's like,
I'm fighting.

2122
01:38:36,931 --> 01:38:39,910
This old child molester off was this
guy.

2123
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,660
He was like the old guy.
He's old,

2124
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:46,170
but my friend was like 15 high school,
14,

2125
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:46,820
15.

2126
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,310
Had to beat the shit out of it.
Olga,

2127
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,830
really behaving.
Maybe the old guy's got skills

2128
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:56,020
doing it for years.
He knows how to molest kids.

2129
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:57,910
Scott moves.
He used.

2130
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,890
I mean they must have moves,
right?

2131
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,980
Like you have moved with girls.
Everybody has moves.

2132
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:04,330
When you have your move is,
hey,

2133
01:39:04,331 --> 01:39:05,430
I'm Hannibal.
What's that?

2134
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,410
I don't say that,
but I was like,

2135
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,150
Hey,
what's up?

2136
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:07,760
Blah blah,
blah.

2137
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,750
You want to drink?
All right,

2138
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,760
second location,
blah,

2139
01:39:09,761 --> 01:39:10,150
blah,
blah.

2140
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:13,930
Let's go back.
Take him to a second location.

2141
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:18,160
Yeah,
you get them in a different environment

2142
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:20,230
or this place is great right now.
Let's go.

2143
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:21,600
Yeah,
you got to move around and moving

2144
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:23,340
around.
That makes things more activist.

2145
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:26,650
It's a full night,
a full evening like dinner and a movie,

2146
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:27,543
right?
Yeah.

2147
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:27,950
Go ahead.

2148
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,510
Dinner.
And you go to a movie like you had a lot

2149
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:31,080
of shit happening,
right?

2150
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:35,990
A show,
but I mean young guys that are trying to

2151
01:39:35,991 --> 01:39:38,120
get laid.
I mean that's why people wear nice

2152
01:39:38,121 --> 01:39:41,240
clothes and that's why people wear
jewelry.

2153
01:39:41,241 --> 01:39:43,280
They drive a nice car.
Why do they do that?

2154
01:39:43,281 --> 01:39:44,570
Because they want to show like,
hey,

2155
01:39:44,571 --> 01:39:45,530
look at me.
I'm something special.

2156
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:48,290
You've got maybe a few good jokes.
They tell maybe they,

2157
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,980
you know,
they're uh,

2158
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,920
did just a smooth talker.

2159
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:56,180
It would feel weird to,
to be able to fuck because of my car.

2160
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,490
I don't have a car,
I don't own a car.

2161
01:39:58,491 --> 01:40:03,491
But if it would feel weird,
I think that would feel more weird than

2162
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,120
fucking because of fame.
A car.

2163
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,680
Like,
look at this shit,

2164
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,330
get it,
let's go.

2165
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:13,700
What?
You have to.

2166
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:16,190
Especially in La,
you have to really come.

2167
01:40:16,191 --> 01:40:17,330
Correct.
I mean,

2168
01:40:17,331 --> 01:40:19,610
you gotTa,
you gotta come with some strong fucking

2169
01:40:19,611 --> 01:40:22,330
automobile if you want to fuck for your
car is.

2170
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:25,760
There's so many nice cars out here.
You gotta have like a Bugatti.

2171
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:31,270
You got to have some shit that's a house
to house on wheels when you can't have a

2172
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:35,520
uber sticker on that shit.
No matter how nice it is to.

2173
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:38,530
They have stickers on Hooper's.
They put stickers on carts,

2174
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:40,010
they have a you.
Well,

2175
01:40:40,011 --> 01:40:41,660
if you have a Bugatti and you have an
uber,

2176
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,880
you can say it's a goof.
I like to pick people up just to freak

2177
01:40:43,881 --> 01:40:44,840
them out.
That's a nice.

2178
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:48,410
Uber's out there.
They got like s five hundreds binges.

2179
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,200
Really try and make those payments.
Yeah.

2180
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,560
If you haven't asked 500 and you say,
all right,

2181
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:55,750
look,
I like a nice car but I can't afford it.

2182
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:58,780
But if I just work two nights a week for
Uber,

2183
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,810
that would be my car payment.
You could do that.

2184
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,060
Yeah,
I could see it.

2185
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:09,530
I can see it.
I've heard about like.

2186
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:12,480
Yeah,
I've heard a lot about just uber drivers

2187
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,390
push.
No,

2188
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,310
no,
all levels of cars.

2189
01:41:17,311 --> 01:41:22,311
But definitely going in hard on loan
limit.

2190
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,390
Did I know that in A.
I mean there's obviously been a couple

2191
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,140
stories of,
you know,

2192
01:41:28,141 --> 01:41:31,440
things happening like,
but that definitely just dim like,

2193
01:41:31,441 --> 01:41:33,880
Yo what's up and just blah blah blah
blah blah,

2194
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:37,050
and just really go on it.
That's one thing I liked about being in

2195
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:42,051
Japan
is that a taxi drivers don't say Shit to

2196
01:41:43,651 --> 01:41:46,470
you.
Uber drivers talked too much.

2197
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:51,530
Uber drivers talk to taxi drivers too.
But Uber drivers or drivers like pro.

2198
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,450
I just want to.
I,

2199
01:41:54,451 --> 01:41:57,390
uh,
when I was in Chicago,

2200
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:01,380
I was heading for my hotel.
My hotel is downtown.

2201
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:06,180
Had an old hair.
It's about 40 minutes early in the

2202
01:42:06,181 --> 01:42:09,720
morning,
a little bit hung over and over.

2203
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:15,830
It's a comic from that sort of knew
maybe 10 years back in Chicago driving

2204
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:21,780
an uber.
And he started pitching me.

2205
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:22,873
Yes.

2206
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,290
And I hadn't seen him in years.
I didn't even,

2207
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:30,340
we weren't that close when I,
when I did a,

2208
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:35,570
when I was in Chicago and he was like,
I got these ideas,

2209
01:42:35,571 --> 01:42:38,060
man.
Can you link me with Stephen Merchant

2210
01:42:38,061 --> 01:42:41,570
and Baba Baba who?
Stephen Merchant.

2211
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:45,500
Stephen merchant is a the tall guy from
the office.

2212
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,670
Okay.
That was in the original art and extras

2213
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,650
is Ricky Gervais work with Ricky
Gervais'.

2214
01:42:51,651 --> 01:42:53,230
Okay.
So He's just like,

2215
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:53,950

2216
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:57,860
Just hadn't seen this dude in 11 years
or some shit.

2217
01:42:58,070 --> 01:43:01,850
And I'm like,
hostage on the way to the airport for 40

2218
01:43:01,851 --> 01:43:03,870
minutes.
Did he know that it was gonna be you or

2219
01:43:03,871 --> 01:43:05,870
was it just totally random?
He didn't know what's going to be me

2220
01:43:05,871 --> 01:43:07,180
because I have a fake name.
Uber.

2221
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,260
Oh.
So uh,

2222
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:10,490
yeah,
it just,

2223
01:43:10,491 --> 01:43:11,930
it was totally random.
It's like Oh,

2224
01:43:11,931 --> 01:43:15,350
what's up are recognized me.
But it was just like I'm getting pitched

2225
01:43:15,351 --> 01:43:15,820
right now.

2226
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:19,360
It's like six in the morning.
Oh No.

2227
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:24,270
And you're tired of 40 minute ride.
You can't tell him to shut the fuck up.

2228
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,330
Getting that was just like,
yeah man,

2229
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:31,331
it sounds like a real cool idea.
See that's why I stopped using car

2230
01:43:33,711 --> 01:43:36,920
services to take me to the airport
because I just didn't want to talk to

2231
01:43:36,921 --> 01:43:39,650
anybody.
I'd rather just listen to podcasts and

2232
01:43:39,651 --> 01:43:41,630
just chill,
drive myself.

2233
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:45,560
And then when I get to,
like when I do clubs or colleges or

2234
01:43:45,561 --> 01:43:48,440
whatever,
or a colleges will never do colleges

2235
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:50,840
when I do theaters or whatever.
I just rent a car.

2236
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,100
Yeah,
I liked that better

2237
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,210
man.
I mean,

2238
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:56,330
most of the time you run into cool
drivers most of the time.

2239
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:00,500
But the problem is if you don't,
it's a pain the ass.

2240
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:03,110
Like if you run into one dude who just
talks too much,

2241
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:05,930
does take it.
Takes your mental energy.

2242
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:08,330
Like it's really.
I mean it's a,

2243
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,970
you know,
a bit of an exaggeration to say it like

2244
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,100
this,
but it's like food,

2245
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:12,741
like,
you know,

2246
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:16,160
15 minutes,
somebody can kind of steal your soul a

2247
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:21,770
little bit.
Like Tony Hinchcliffe were in the car

2248
01:44:21,801 --> 01:44:24,440
once and this fucking dude just joined
in on our conversation.

2249
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,420
Like we're talking about some important
shit,

2250
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:28,380
you know.
And Tony's asking me some question,

2251
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,950
he's asked me for advice and I'm like,
well I think in the guys like,

2252
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:32,030
what you should do is,
well,

2253
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:35,000
you gotta tell her to mama talking about
a girl.

2254
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,120
I'm like,
Whoa,

2255
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:36,680
Whoa,
whoa.

2256
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:40,940
Hold on dude.
You're not even supposed to be here like

2257
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:41,950
you're,
you're just in.

2258
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:43,880
You're like,
you're here,

2259
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:45,860
but you're not supposed to be in this
conversation.

2260
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:47,720
This is a conversation like,
this is my friend.

2261
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:49,970
He's asking me advice.
You don't even know him.

2262
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:55,760
And so like the whole rest of the day
was just bizarre because this dude was

2263
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:59,300
driving us around and just chimed in.
No matter what we talked about,

2264
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:01,940
just looking at the looking at you in
the rear view,

2265
01:45:01,941 --> 01:45:04,120
Mike got eyes on the road,
motherfucker.

2266
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:04,790
That,
that,

2267
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:08,660
that thing is to see cars behind us.
It's not to have conversations when

2268
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:09,440
you're looking,
when you're.

2269
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,780
When the guy's driving and he's looking
at you in the rear view mirror,

2270
01:45:12,781 --> 01:45:16,220
he that motherfucker's holding your
attention hostage because anything can

2271
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:19,730
happen now because he's not necessarily
paying attention to the road and you're

2272
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:20,870
like,
oh Jesus Christ,

2273
01:45:20,871 --> 01:45:21,770
what does this guy's playing?

2274
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,950
You might as well be texting right now.
He's still at the rear view mirror.

2275
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:30,870
Was that I got in the car no lot.
This dude was a.

2276
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:35,030
He had like a,
either his phone,

2277
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:40,031
a bigger phone or a tablet like in the
middle and he was watching some type of

2278
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,880
scientology youtube video here in la
while he was driving and he just kept.

2279
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,790
He was driving and kept on like glancing
at it and I and as I said,

2280
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:50,490
hey man.
I said,

2281
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:51,530
hey,
turn it off.

2282
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:54,740
Yeah,
because he was for real,

2283
01:45:54,741 --> 01:45:57,000
like looking down.
Oh my God.

2284
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:57,590
The videos.
Like,

2285
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:58,340
what do you use?
Like,

2286
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:01,700
sorry about that.
I just say I get that you have a lot of

2287
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:04,330
downtime,
but now isn't that one of those times

2288
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:08,240
stopped looking down at this and he had
also,

2289
01:46:08,241 --> 01:46:10,310
he had that shit in the speakers.
That's what made it.

2290
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:14,780
It was like this weird ass youtube and
then scientology is the like,

2291
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:16,580
what the fuck are you?
Who are you meant?

2292
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:20,480
I had this dude that was texting the
entire time.

2293
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,930
He picked me up at the airport and he
was taking me somewhere and the entire

2294
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:27,380
time he's on his phone.
He's got his phone in his lap and he's

2295
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:29,810
driving and he's just doing this.
Looking down one,

2296
01:46:29,811 --> 01:46:30,260
two,
three.

2297
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,430
Look it up,
look it down.

2298
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:31,701
One,
two,

2299
01:46:31,701 --> 01:46:32,534
three.
Look it up.

2300
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:35,870
Look it down.
Once it was a fucking perilous terror

2301
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:39,920
field ride because we're on the highway
and this guy and I'm like,

2302
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:42,080
hey man,
you're making me nervous.

2303
01:46:42,081 --> 01:46:44,060
Don't worry everything.
No problem.

2304
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,350
Got It.
No problem.

2305
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:48,470
I'll stop right now and then a couple of
seconds later you get another text and

2306
01:46:48,471 --> 01:46:50,580
I've just got to this and it was locked
it down.

2307
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,600
Look it up.
Looking down,

2308
01:46:51,601 --> 01:46:52,500
looking up,
looking down,

2309
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:55,570
looking at when you're looking down your
fucking cars.

2310
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:58,590
Traveling like a hundred feet,
200 feet,

2311
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:01,590
300 feet.
Anything can happen during that time.

2312
01:47:01,591 --> 01:47:03,840
You're not looking.
Dude,

2313
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:07,200
could fuck up and come into your lane.
Some knew some shit could be on the road

2314
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:08,034
that you didn't see.

2315
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,970
Stinks.
Stinks.

2316
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:15,330
Caraway for rental.
In the few years it's going to be

2317
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:18,450
rental,
self driving cars.

2318
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:22,050
Well they already have that with
Mercedes and the Mercedes has a self

2319
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:23,340
driving car now.
Yeah.

2320
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,410
Would you get in the fucking car?
The s classes?

2321
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:27,330
Yeah.
You still get on the highway.

2322
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,780
You like press a navigation system.
Fucking get your hands off the steering

2323
01:47:30,781 --> 01:47:33,840
wheel and you sit back and that
motherfucker drives itself.

2324
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,820
It slows down,
it turns.

2325
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,790
But does Avis have that shit yet?
That's what I mean.

2326
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,750
I want to be able to go to Columbus,
Ohio.

2327
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:46,580
That's kind of.
I like to upgrade to the self driving,

2328
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:52,020
but when that happens it's going to be
more boring but more safe,

2329
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:55,740
you know,
because you wonder if you'll be able to

2330
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:59,120
like take it out of self driving mode,
but then he'll be,

2331
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:02,850
have like self driving cars and then
asshole slamming into self driving cars.

2332
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,350
Oh yeah.
That'll be a problem.

2333
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,930
So don't get weird in the next five
years.

2334
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:10,740
We're already weird stuff is going to
get really weird.

2335
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,420
You want to see weird.
Go to brody.

2336
01:48:12,421 --> 01:48:16,050
Stevens is periscope all day long.
He periscopes,

2337
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:17,400
periscopes,
everything he does.

2338
01:48:17,401 --> 01:48:19,530
He periscopes his drive to the comedy
store.

2339
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,590
He periscopes at the comedy store.
Got Arrested last night for it,

2340
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:24,420
bro.
You got pulled over and the cops pulled

2341
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:26,700
up behind him and uh,
detained him.

2342
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:31,701
I think
he was in a spot where a robbery was a

2343
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,580
reported.
I guess it wasn't him.

2344
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:38,940
He got,
he didn't get arrested for periscope at

2345
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:40,830
the same time he was periscoping.
Oh,

2346
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:42,870
that's hilarious.
They don't know.

2347
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:45,090
Obviously they don't always.
Brody motherfucking fucking.

2348
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:47,100
I step out real quick.
Oh,

2349
01:48:47,101 --> 01:48:48,570
you gotTa pee.
How dare you?

2350
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,063
Yeah,
that's pretty funny.

2351
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:51,990
Yeah.
He's sitting there talking to the,

2352
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:54,080
to like normal periscope that he does
and uh,

2353
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:56,160
you see the lights come up behind them.

2354
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:56,670
He's like,
oh,

2355
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,750
oh,
oh.

2356
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,790
And he came back up late,
like an hour later with a new periscope

2357
01:49:00,791 --> 01:49:01,740
saying like,
what happened?

2358
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:03,900
Yeah.
Every time I run into him at the comedy

2359
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:05,040
store,
he's on periscope.

2360
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,230
I've been in like five of his
periscopes.

2361
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:08,983
Yeah,
that's great.

2362
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,670
He walks in periscope and yeah,
he's a,

2363
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:14,160
he's a fucking character man.
He's such a character,

2364
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:17,550
but he's one of those guys.
It's embraced that aspect of social

2365
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:20,130
media at a ridiculous level.
Like you literally will.

2366
01:49:20,131 --> 01:49:23,630
Periscope has whole life.
Brian was doing it a lot for awhile,

2367
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,880
but he's kind of abandoned.
He still does it some,

2368
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:28,080
but yeah,
I don't do it at all anymore.

2369
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,150
I haven't periscoped in a year.
It's good.

2370
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:31,560
It's taken off a little bit more because
it's,

2371
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:33,870
it's on apps now for TV.
It's like the Apple TV.

2372
01:49:33,871 --> 01:49:37,110
It's built in there.
Something else had it built into it too,

2373
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:40,470
so you can watch it on a big screen
without having to have it just on your

2374
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:43,260
phone and having to choose what you
watch and they're giving you things to

2375
01:49:43,261 --> 01:49:44,490
look at.
Now to dude,

2376
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:48,130
I'm super suspicious about apple tv now
because my apple tv

2377
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,770
used to work great until the new apple
TV came out.

2378
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:55,810
Now my appletv fucks up all the time.
It kicks me off and reboots it,

2379
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:58,780
stops shows and goes right back to the
main menu.

2380
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,150
And then I'm,
I'm suspicious about one another beer.

2381
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,570
I'm,
I'm suspicious about the,

2382
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:07,210
um,
there's a class action lawsuit that

2383
01:50:07,211 --> 01:50:11,320
someone filed about the old phones.
They said that the old phones stopped

2384
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:14,320
working when the new operating system
would come out because the new operating

2385
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:17,260
system is designed for the new phones
and they had made it so that the old

2386
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:18,130
phones were slow.

2387
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:22,930
I wonder if.
I wonder if they would actually do that

2388
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:26,980
to Brian thing.
So Brian's convinced it could also be a

2389
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:30,770
matter of just like they're making so
much great new software that the old uh,

2390
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:33,490
processes and whatnot just aren't made
to use it.

2391
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,433
Yeah.
But that's not,

2392
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:37,270
that's not fun.
It's not fun to think like that.

2393
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,160
Not The way they sell it either though.
They sell it as the.

2394
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:40,740
You should be able to use it.
Yeah.

2395
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:45,090
Well you should be able to have an
iphone four and fucking keep the old

2396
01:50:45,091 --> 01:50:47,190
operating system and be good.
It used to work.

2397
01:50:47,191 --> 01:50:48,900
Good.
Why does it work good anymore?

2398
01:50:48,901 --> 01:50:50,330
I don't want to fucking play games on
it.

2399
01:50:50,331 --> 01:50:51,700
I don't want to watch videos.
I just want to.

2400
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,113
Goddammit,

2401
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:57,240
right is a uh,
you need an actual opener.

2402
01:50:58,330 --> 01:51:00,200
They just announced their first time for
the,

2403
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,580
I think ever the sales on iphones or
down

2404
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,420
for the quarter.
However they wonder why because

2405
01:51:06,421 --> 01:51:09,320
everybody has one.
And that's why is because everybody's

2406
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:11,580
switching to Samsung.
Are you?

2407
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:13,210
Are you switching Samsung?
Is that what you're saying?

2408
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,780
Those new samsungs are pretty fucking
slick.

2409
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:19,770
They are very slick.
The new ones are about as good.

2410
01:51:19,771 --> 01:51:23,220
Thank you sir.
The new ones are about as good as an

2411
01:51:23,221 --> 01:51:25,080
iphone.
I'm going to adjust as good with some

2412
01:51:25,081 --> 01:51:28,500
features that iphones don't have.
You know,

2413
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:30,190
I'm,
I'm,

2414
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,290
I'm being a ship.
I just did a Samsung.

2415
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:34,710
Samsung is great,
man.

2416
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,200
I have a Samsung.
I got one of those galaxies.

2417
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:37,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

2418
01:51:37,831 --> 01:51:39,540
The phone that we use for this podcast.

2419
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:42,490
They're good.
You got one right there.

2420
01:51:42,491 --> 01:51:43,870
Looking at email,
you're not fucking around,

2421
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:47,290
but do you miss certain apps that are
only iphone native?

2422
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,163
No.
No,

2423
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,630
I would.
I would like the instagram for,

2424
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,080

Bullshit.

2425
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,410
You think instagram?
Yeah.

2426
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:56,800
It sucks to update.
Oh yeah,

2427
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,780
the new one's better.
They fixed it.

2428
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,880
I think so.
The old one was dog shit.

2429
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:05,020
Don't get defensive.
I'm not defensive.

2430
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,210
I just started.
I'm having a good time.

2431
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,420
I really didn't.
I wasn't a definitive it out.

2432
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:13,330

couple of other people out.

2455
01:53:17,601 --> 01:53:19,880
They took a trip out to Japan.
I popped out there,

2456
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:25,250
got out there January third.
I was hanging out with this girl out

2457
01:53:25,251 --> 01:53:27,110
there.
We go to this bar,

2458
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:31,430
so nice bar in Japan called Jbs jazz
blues.

2459
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:36,431
So also a lot of the bars out there,
the names of them in English are very on

2460
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:39,794
the nose.

2461
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:42,800
It's a hip hop club.
It's Club Harlem.

2462
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:47,040
Shit like that shit.
Like Oh the club to play.

2463
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,100
So let's call it ebony,
like shit.

2464
01:53:49,101 --> 01:53:52,850
Like really on the nose.
So we go to jazz blues,

2465
01:53:52,851 --> 01:53:54,380
so if you haven't in Tokyo,
check it out.

2466
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,600
It's just,
it's a small bar.

2467
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:59,030
Uh,
I don't know the owner's name,

2468
01:53:59,031 --> 01:54:02,450
but it's full of vinyl records and you
can just request.

2469
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:05,840
He has all types of vital records is in
a lot of Japanese people.

2470
01:54:05,841 --> 01:54:10,841
They were Americans or it was some
Japanese people but it was in Tokyo at

2471
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:15,971
this bar in Tokyo.
In Tokyo is some but not like it.

2472
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:19,100
You don't see a lot but the bar.
But the bar itself,

2473
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:20,930
it only holds 10,
15.

2474
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,660
It's a small spot.
Ten or 15 people if that.

2475
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,280
Yeah,
pack like 10,

2476
01:54:25,281 --> 01:54:27,500
15.
Like it'll be something.

2477
01:54:27,501 --> 01:54:29,060
Yeah,
it's this room.

2478
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,200
Maybe it's my.

2479
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,090
It's smaller than this room.
Whoa.

2480
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,390
So it's a nice little
bar.

2481
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:38,900
They also had this area called the
golden guide,

2482
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,550
which is,
has a,

2483
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:44,840
it's an area full of small bars that
only hold four or five people that are

2484
01:54:44,841 --> 01:54:47,000
smaller than this.
Smaller than that place,

2485
01:54:47,001 --> 01:54:50,630
like super small places.
So at this bar,

2486
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,020
the guy just knows the collection.
It's,

2487
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,560
it's,
it's a wall full of vinyl and then his

2488
01:54:56,561 --> 01:54:58,740
son behind it.
Behind the bar also,

2489
01:54:58,741 --> 01:55:00,870
so you.
I was just saying he,

2490
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:05,090
he what you want to hear,
say a stew,

2491
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:09,950
stevie wonder songs in the key of life
and he just walks right up to the spot.

2492
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:12,920
I mean it's obviously Stevie,
but he just walks up to the,

2493
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:16,260
a bunch of records he didn't even
flipped through and nothing.

2494
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:20,060
He just knew exactly what he meant.
Foot grabbed it,

2495
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:20,894
put it on there.

2496
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:24,340
So we were hanging out and it was just
A.

2497
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:27,140
I'm with a girl who was half Japanese,
half white,

2498
01:55:27,141 --> 01:55:31,520
but she knew Japanese and English and
she saw a friend there so they started

2499
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:34,520
talking in Japanese.
There's this white chick there that's

2500
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:39,550
super drunk,
like blush on her eyes is all fucked up.

2501
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:43,290
Weird.
Like she had that stereotypical like

2502
01:55:43,291 --> 01:55:43,751
see,
look,

2503
01:55:43,751 --> 01:55:46,120
central casting drunk.
You know what I mean?

2504
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:51,240
Like she was going to an audition to be
a drunk lady right after she was at the

2505
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:54,480
bar.
So they start talking in Japanese.

2506
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:57,930
She talked to me a little bit.
I found out she lives in the same

2507
01:55:57,931 --> 01:55:59,340
neighborhood that I do.
Williamsburg,

2508
01:55:59,341 --> 01:56:01,430
Brooklyn.
She starts,

2509
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,640
they started talking to Japanese.
She's like,

2510
01:56:02,641 --> 01:56:03,540
you know what they're saying?
I'm like,

2511
01:56:03,541 --> 01:56:04,460
Nah,
she just be in play.

2512
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,150
And then she says,
is this your wife?

2513
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:07,351
I said,
no,

2514
01:56:07,351 --> 01:56:09,540
that's not my wife,
is that your wife said,

2515
01:56:09,541 --> 01:56:12,750
no,
stop my wife and snatch your wife.

2516
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:16,380
I was like,
why'd you just asked me the same thing

2517
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:19,050
three times in a row?
Because I just,

2518
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:22,890
she just asked me.
I guess he was that faded dog.

2519
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:27,891
Her face turns and she's just,
I could just see her getting upset.

2520
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,410
She starts flipping out like,
fuck you,

2521
01:56:31,411 --> 01:56:34,320
you didn't have to be disrespectful.
No,

2522
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:38,040
fuck him.
He thinks because he's without Japanese

2523
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:40,000
girl.
He's like started,

2524
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:44,310
you know,
you think you have some cool comedian.

2525
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:48,000
So then it real that she knew I didn't,
I didn't tell her who.

2526
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:51,180
I hadn't saved my job or anything to us.
So she knew me.

2527
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:53,260
She showed him,
so now I,

2528
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,650
she is in a different,
like,

2529
01:56:55,651 --> 01:56:58,010
she's a super upset.
Fuck you,

2530
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,940
you came all the way over here,
you're doing.

2531
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,670
And then she just started getting ready.
She was like,

2532
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,180
he's a monkey,
a monkey.

2533
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:07,080
I'm like,
no,

2534
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:07,680
this is great.

2535
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:12,680
Am I being called a monkey by a white
woman from Williamsburg in Tokyo right

2536
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:18,120
now?
What the fuck is why you should take

2537
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:20,070
pictures of her,
put it up all around Williamsburg.

2538
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,900
I just.
Just this dummy have you said I should

2539
01:57:24,901 --> 01:57:26,430
have.
I thought about starting to film,

2540
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:29,640
but it was just so weird that she,
for Real,

2541
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:32,320
all I did objectively,
I wasn't that fade,

2542
01:57:32,330 --> 01:57:36,300
so I'd have a clear,
a recall of a situation.

2543
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:40,770
I only just said,
why you just asked me if this is my wife

2544
01:57:40,771 --> 01:57:42,660
three times.
Like what I told,

2545
01:57:42,661 --> 01:57:47,010
you know the first two times sake.
And she just went off tilt.

2546
01:57:47,011 --> 01:57:48,060
Man.
It was the weirdest.

2547
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:50,790
It was one of the weirdest things.
What is a weird thing that happens

2548
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:55,410
sometimes when someone's famous like you
and they're not where they feel like

2549
01:57:55,860 --> 01:58:00,390
you.
It's possible that you think you're cool

2550
01:58:00,391 --> 01:58:01,410
because you're famous.

2551
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:03,480
Like you think you're better than them,
you know,

2552
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,090
so like they look for any little thing,
any little thing.

2553
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,230
Oh,
you think you're too good?

2554
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:10,080
You know that they're looking for that.
They're too good to listen to me.

2555
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:12,960
Repeat Myself.
I've listened to it,

2556
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:14,160
but I.
I'll tell you,

2557
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:18,200
I'll tell you that you're doing this.
It was the.

2558
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,040
It was so weird,
man.

2559
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,430
Alcoholism.
When someone's that blasted,

2560
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:25,240
who knows what's going on in their mind.
No,

2561
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:29,850
it definitely was.
I could tell she was because when she

2562
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:31,470
started getting raised,
it didn't affect me,

2563
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:32,790
but it was just.
I could tell she goes,

2564
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:36,180
I accidentally hurt her feelings,
but she was trying to hurt you.

2565
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:41,270
She was trying to hurt me and I could
see she was almost on the verge of when

2566
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:44,590
all I said was I stopped saying the same
thing over and over,

2567
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:47,230
which I would say to anybody if I said
that to one of my buddies,

2568
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:48,220
they were like,
Oh shit,

2569
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:49,270
I'm fucked up.
You know what I mean?

2570
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,680
But if you don't know someone,
they say that to them and then

2571
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:54,820
especially if they're dumb and no one
calls them out on their stupidity,

2572
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:57,120
it could be devastating.
Yeah.

2573
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,350
Yeah.
That sometimes people do have that sort

2574
01:58:59,351 --> 01:58:59,860
of thing.
No.

2575
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:02,140
When they meet you like,
that's that guy from TV.

2576
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:05,610
I've seen him on comedy central.
I just want to call her and talk to them

2577
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:09,720
and it was fine,
but she just was,

2578
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:12,600
she got into repetitive boat.
It was just,

2579
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,680
I just couldn't handle you checking her.
Checked her too hard.

2580
01:59:17,070 --> 01:59:20,500
It was,
it was a soft check was light work.

2581
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:27,670
But I do find that sometimes where even
like I'll joke around with people too

2582
01:59:30,061 --> 01:59:31,980
harsh.
It's like it's like a,

2583
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:36,400
uh,
it's like a fighter pilot,

2584
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:38,120
you know,
sparring with some,

2585
01:59:38,121 --> 01:59:41,580
like it's not the same.
Like you can't act the same when you

2586
01:59:41,581 --> 01:59:44,970
can,
but if people don't know you then it's

2587
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:47,470
just,
it can be kind of taken aback and throw

2588
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,840
it off because it's like,
oh,

2589
01:59:48,841 --> 01:59:50,190
this dude's ass.
So it's like,

2590
01:59:50,191 --> 01:59:52,860
no,
that's just how I talk with people.

2591
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:56,100
Well also you're a New York comic or
your comment that lives in New York.

2592
01:59:56,101 --> 01:59:58,110
Yeah,
in New York in particular.

2593
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:02,400
It's a fun place to be a comic,
fun place to interact with other comics.

2594
02:00:02,401 --> 02:00:04,920
But like people are fucking ruthless to
each other.

2595
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:08,370
Yeah.
Like what did I just tell you bitch?

2596
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,320
And you would start.
We would laugh,

2597
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:14,770
but if you said that to someone in real
life that's like super sensitive,

2598
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:16,080
like what did I just tell you?
Bitch?

2599
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,580
Be like,
you don't have to call me bitch,

2600
02:00:17,581 --> 02:00:18,870
man.
What kind of a fucking piece of shit are

2601
02:00:18,871 --> 02:00:19,220
you,
man?

2602
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:20,610
You think just because you're on comedy
central,

2603
02:00:20,611 --> 02:00:21,600
you can call me boot.
Yeah.

2604
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:25,740
Like even kind of except the seller or
key drivers in a couple of other people.

2605
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,090
Hey,
what's up?

2606
02:00:27,091 --> 02:00:30,530
Stupid.
It is stupid over here.

2607
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:33,040
Says this and that's how you toggle it.
Yeah.

2608
02:00:33,070 --> 02:00:34,830
Just like that is idiot.
Like,

2609
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:35,701
Hey,
stupid.

2610
02:00:35,701 --> 02:00:36,900
You do it.
Are you doing?

2611
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:39,750
You got to set tonight stupid.
Let me just sit down and the text and

2612
02:00:39,751 --> 02:00:42,480
it's just know it's done when it's done
with love,

2613
02:00:42,481 --> 02:00:42,910
you know?

2614
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:45,130
Yeah.
It's done with love and that's something

2615
02:00:45,131 --> 02:00:46,960
maybe we understand that other people
don't.

2616
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,093
I did a,
uh,

2617
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:53,080
a theater in Miami and Wanda,
Wanda Sykes and Keith Robinson were

2618
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:56,490
doing the early show and I was doing the
late shift fillmore.

2619
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:59,350
Um,
I think it might've been the fillmore.

2620
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,540
I don't remember what theater was,
but anyway,

2621
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:03,760
um,
when I got there I said,

2622
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:07,300
I said to them they were leaving and
then I got to my dressing room and there

2623
02:01:07,301 --> 02:01:10,660
was two napkins that they'd left.
Wanda left a Napkin.

2624
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:12,370
I hope you have a great show.
Joe,

2625
02:01:12,371 --> 02:01:13,690
you know,
kill them.

2626
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:15,940
Wanda.
And then Keith Robinson wrote,

2627
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:18,760
I hope you bomb harder than you ever
have in your life,

2628
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:19,983
your friend.

2629
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:24,640
I'd saved it.
I took a picture of it and put it

2630
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:26,260
online.
He's to me,

2631
02:01:26,261 --> 02:01:28,300
it was funny,
but like,

2632
02:01:28,301 --> 02:01:31,360
if someone's like fucking real sensitive
and they see something like that,

2633
02:01:31,361 --> 02:01:32,380
they'd be like,
well what the fuck,

2634
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:34,030
Keith,
I haven't seen you in 10 years,

2635
02:01:34,031 --> 02:01:36,730
man.
Believe me.

2636
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:39,530
But it was warm for me.
I felt good.

2637
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:42,090
They took the time to do that.
You know?

2638
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:46,010
It felt good to me,
but he keeps graded that that's.

2639
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,040
But that's not the whole New York style
of comedy.

2640
02:01:49,041 --> 02:01:52,220
It's a very different style than like La
Comics.

2641
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,440
Like la comics is not

2642
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:59,040
sort of the only.
I know there's only a handful that I

2643
02:01:59,041 --> 02:02:01,290
know well that,
you know,

2644
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,350
I'm close with like that,
but it's different.

2645
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:05,850
It is different.
Yeah.

2646
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,900
Well,
New York's a harsher environment.

2647
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:11,310
I did have a situation where somebody
joked with me,

2648
02:02:11,311 --> 02:02:16,311
it was a very specific situation with
somebody joked with me and I haven't

2649
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:22,100
talked to that person for five years
because of that joke to a,

2650
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,200
not to say the name of won't say that.
So I,

2651
02:02:25,201 --> 02:02:30,201
uh,
when I was in South Carolina,

2652
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:31,620
Charleston,
South Carolina,

2653
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:36,930
a 2011,
2010,

2654
02:02:36,931 --> 02:02:40,510
2011 the day before my,
uh,

2655
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:42,510
my,
the day before my birthday,

2656
02:02:42,511 --> 02:02:44,640
a few years ago,
I,

2657
02:02:44,641 --> 02:02:47,160
uh,
I was out there doing some shows with

2658
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:51,630
Aziz and I was hanging out with,
hanging out at bars,

2659
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:55,410
hanging out with a couple girls,
hop in the car with them to go back to

2660
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,980
wherever the fuck dude.
And then

2661
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:02,000
wake up in the stretcher.

2662
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:04,410
We got in a car accident and shit.
Oh Shit.

2663
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:06,890
Yeah.
This is where I got this scar from in.

2664
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,320
Uh,
so I had my skull fracture that had a

2665
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,370
few stitches right here.
Whoa.

2666
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:15,540
It's like the day before my birthday,
it was my birthday on a stretcher.

2667
02:03:15,570 --> 02:03:17,040
I woke up like,
I don't remember.

2668
02:03:17,041 --> 02:03:17,874
I don't remember,
like,

2669
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,220
well I don't remember.
Yeah,

2670
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:25,240
I just woke up in the hospital and uh,
so uh,

2671
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:30,600
uh,
so uh,

2672
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:32,640
it's something.
And I'm in the hospital.

2673
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:33,750
I had like,
you know,

2674
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:37,830
tweeted out a photo of my fucked up ass
face and

2675
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:43,650
to go back a few years ago,
it was a comic friend of mine.

2676
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:49,280
I had a got tickets to see the clippers
or the Lakers and I invited him.

2677
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:55,050
I pick him up my rental car out here and
I wasn't wearing my seatbelt and he's

2678
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,520
like,
I'm not gonna,

2679
02:03:56,521 --> 02:03:57,620
wear your seat back.

2680
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:58,271
And flood was like,
no,

2681
02:03:58,271 --> 02:04:00,270
I'm not wearing my seat.
I got sometimes I don't wear my

2682
02:04:00,271 --> 02:04:01,104
seatbelt,
whatever.

2683
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:04,000
And so I'm laid up after I posted this
ad,

2684
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,970
I'm laid up in the hospital but with my
scope.

2685
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:09,450
And then this was like,
I hadn't even been talking to them that

2686
02:04:09,451 --> 02:04:14,451
much around this time and had heard and
I get a text that you gonna wear your

2687
02:04:15,361 --> 02:04:16,800
seat belt now.
And I was like,

2688
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:17,753
what?
The fuck,

2689
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:23,520
but I thought I didn't think that was
the right time.

2690
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,100
My skull was fractured and I had never
been in a month,

2691
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:28,910
but I don't think he meant.
I don't,

2692
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:32,130
I don't think he meant it maliciously,
but I think it was a bit tone deaf.

2693
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:32,964
What do you think?

2694
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:36,880
It depends on who it is.
Like if it was a good friend,

2695
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:38,010
like if I got

2696
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,680
in a car accident and like Ari,
Ari Shaffir.

2697
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:43,370
If he did that I would laugh.
Right.

2698
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:47,310
Cause he's a,
he's such a close friend that he can't

2699
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:50,190
really do anything that would hurt me.
You know what I mean?

2700
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:56,030
But I think it was based off of he,
he was holding onto this seatbelt

2701
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:58,770
argument from a couple of years ago.
Oh,

2702
02:04:58,771 --> 02:05:02,310
so you guys had a real disagreement?
It might've been real on it,

2703
02:05:02,311 --> 02:05:05,610
but it was just me being more like a
seatbelt that day.

2704
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:09,500
He must not have liked that dude because
if you really liked him you'd laugh.

2705
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:11,480
Like if it was Keith Robinson,
when you laugh,

2706
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,860
don't.
I mean it's like his style,

2707
02:05:15,861 --> 02:05:18,320
like that's something you could say.
You bet you wear a seatbelt now.

2708
02:05:18,321 --> 02:05:20,510
Dummy.
Like he would say you would probably

2709
02:05:20,511 --> 02:05:24,140
laugh if you saw that man meant.
Depends on how bad your hurt too.

2710
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:26,450
When you're hurt,
you're not feeling any jokes.

2711
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:29,270
You're fucking head's pounding.
You got a fractured skull

2712
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:30,870
in late.
Yeah,

2713
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:34,400
fractious.
Go doped up is my birthday now.

2714
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:37,640
Oh,
I didn't like that job.

2715
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:45,710
I was talking about it with a mutual
friend and I think I might try to bury

2716
02:05:45,921 --> 02:05:48,290
the hatchet.
So five years later.

2717
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:49,330
Hey man,
listen.

2718
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:52,870
It takes time.
So stubborn person put A.

2719
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:54,103
Yeah,

2720
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:57,900
well I understand there's certain people
can joke with you,

2721
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:02,070
like someone may be like,
well here you and Keith or someone like

2722
02:06:02,071 --> 02:06:05,430
that joke around like that and then
they'll see you at a club and they'll

2723
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:09,060
say some stupid shit to you.
And they'll think it's funny because

2724
02:06:09,061 --> 02:06:11,250
they think they can get away with things
like that.

2725
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:13,890
But the not in with you.
Right.

2726
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:14,671
You know,
so it's like,

2727
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:16,650
hey man,
fucking settle down.

2728
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:20,410
It was neat.
I think it was because I hadn't even

2729
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:24,870
talked with that person for months and
months and it didn't even lead with you.

2730
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:28,660
Good man.
Then the joke,

2731
02:06:28,661 --> 02:06:33,661
it was just out of nowhere to joke and
the last text was like six months prior.

2732
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:35,330
It was like,
do you

2733
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,170
think that person is funny?
Yeah.

2734
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:40,620
Real funny.
Did it talented?

2735
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:41,680
Yes.
Okay.

2736
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:43,900
Yeah.
You don't like them as a person?

2737
02:06:43,901 --> 02:06:44,734
Maybe

2738
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:47,490
annoying.
Slightly.

2739
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,603
I don't,
I haven't.

2740
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:50,760
I haven't hung out with them in years,

2741
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:54,290
but yeah,

2742
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:55,790
I don't know.
I could this,

2743
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:58,390
this time and a place for everything.
Yeah.

2744
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,080
Laid up
in the hospital is different.

2745
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:05,150
It really depends on who it is,
man.

2746
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:06,790
It just depends on some.
That's uh,

2747
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:09,830
that's one of those fine lines where the
right person can send you that you'd be

2748
02:07:09,831 --> 02:07:12,350
laughing your ass off,
but the wrong person could send you

2749
02:07:12,351 --> 02:07:12,831
that.
He'd be like,

2750
02:07:12,831 --> 02:07:14,570
fuck this dude.
I'm not talking to this guy in the game

2751
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:19,280
anymore.
I don't think anybody sending you that.

2752
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:23,300
You'd be upset like a Byron Bauer sent
you that you'd be upset.

2753
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,903
Uh,

2754
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:31,680
I think in that situation I'd be upset
maybe afterwards talking shit,

2755
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:34,960
maybe talk,
I guess context,

2756
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:35,810
right?
I mean,

2757
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:36,643
yeah,
yeah,

2758
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:41,860
that's all one time about a
went out once I got a tweet when I was

2759
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:44,950
like,
I don't know why I checked my twitter

2760
02:07:44,951 --> 02:07:47,290
right before bed.
There's one time it was me and my girl

2761
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:52,291
was about to crash out and I for sorry,
I'll check my twitter and it was a good

2762
02:07:52,721 --> 02:07:55,630
show at the comedy cellar.
You got fat though and I was like

2763
02:07:57,430 --> 02:08:01,930
right before I'm out to fucking fuck my
girlfriend,

2764
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:07,000
you get fat.
If I was at the bar and I just happened

2765
02:08:07,001 --> 02:08:07,631
to check it,
I'm like,

2766
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:08,351
ah,
you get fat.

2767
02:08:08,351 --> 02:08:09,550
I'm like,
fuck off.

2768
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:12,640
But right before bed,
man,

2769
02:08:12,641 --> 02:08:16,660
this is rough time for that.
So I think it is timing and timing is

2770
02:08:16,661 --> 02:08:19,540
everything I might burn.
I don't think they meant it in malicious

2771
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:21,310
with it,
but that shit was like really?

2772
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:26,310
I'm drugged up in the hospital bit in
South Carolina of all places.

2773
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,530
Oh,
another detail that happened when,

2774
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:36,280
because this is,
it was coming into my 29,

2775
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:40,080
30.
So I think it was 2012 or 20 anyway,

2776
02:08:40,370 --> 02:08:44,200
uh,
so Aziz finds that he comes to the

2777
02:08:44,201 --> 02:08:49,201
hospital so and so he's there and so
it's like nurses and shit,

2778
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,240
like,
holy shit,

2779
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:54,760
Aziz Ansari.
And he's like,

2780
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:57,120
can you chill out with my friend is if
people are like,

2781
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:59,410
can I take a picture with you?
I love your work.

2782
02:08:59,411 --> 02:09:01,930
Is like,
you need to worry about this work right

2783
02:09:01,931 --> 02:09:04,780
here.
This TV showed the Hannibal buress just

2784
02:09:04,781 --> 02:09:07,950
get his shit smashed show where people
will.

2785
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:13,020
They will legitimately fanning out over
Aziz over my hospital bed.

2786
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:16,900
It was super unprofessional.
Yeah.

2787
02:09:16,901 --> 02:09:17,734
That's not nice.

2788
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:21,970
How fucked up were you?
Like were you,

2789
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:23,260
uh,
did you have.

2790
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:24,940
They'd have like,
you want those Halos?

2791
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:28,540
They have your head?
Not In the halo but my,

2792
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:30,830
I was fucked up my,
this,

2793
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:32,620
my forehead.
This was,

2794
02:09:32,621 --> 02:09:35,350
I had a few stitches here.
Still got the scar from that.

2795
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:39,310
Uh,
and a skull was fractured.

2796
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:42,670
Skull was fractured right here.
I think it was [inaudible] I was wearing

2797
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:47,140
glasses and the glasses went into here.
Whoa.

2798
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:49,250
But uh,
like how bad is a fraction?

2799
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,630
They have to do anything.
No,

2800
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:52,060
it was just like,
just let it,

2801
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:54,760
let it a heel.
Let it heal on.

2802
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:56,540
It's on your head.
Yeah,

2803
02:09:56,541 --> 02:09:59,480
he can't put it in Canada.
Probably if you,

2804
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:00,970
if you want to pay for that.

2805
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:08,220
We want to pay extra iron man cast.
So yeah,

2806
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:11,680
we have to push back production on.
Um,

2807
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:15,280
I think that was going into first season
of Eric Andre Show,

2808
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,240
so we have to push back production
because my face was all fucked up for

2809
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:19,871
while.
Yeah.

2810
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:22,810
It was a pretty gnarly waking up on a
stretcher.

2811
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:25,000
Yeah.
That's got to be a bizarre feeling.

2812
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:27,310
It was.
I don't remember.

2813
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:30,480
Do you think about that when you get in
cars now are getting cars,

2814
02:10:30,481 --> 02:10:31,630
do you think?
I mean that's a,

2815
02:10:31,631 --> 02:10:34,100
that's a pretty significant.
I don't think.

2816
02:10:34,101 --> 02:10:35,690
I don't really.
I didn't know.

2817
02:10:35,691 --> 02:10:38,000
I don't think about occasionally,
but I don't think about that.

2818
02:10:38,001 --> 02:10:38,751
What?
What happened?

2819
02:10:38,751 --> 02:10:40,220
Who?
Who caused the accident?

2820
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,680
I couldn't tell you man.
I couldn't tell you.

2821
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:44,720
I couldn't even know.
I don't know.

2822
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:47,870
Wow.
They're missing some missing chunk of

2823
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:49,120
time.
Just something missing.

2824
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:51,830
Chunk of time.
Fucking head injuries.

2825
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:53,420
Snow.
It was no fun.

2826
02:10:53,890 --> 02:10:55,400
Yeah,
that's scary shit.

2827
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:58,550
Yeah.
Bury the hatchet with your friend.

2828
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:03,440
I think so grown up lately.
You're growing up growing up,

2829
02:11:03,441 --> 02:11:06,860
man.
Trying to be nicer,

2830
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:10,790
more positive.
That's one thing about being more

2831
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:15,791
recognizable is that it gives me a
constant opportunities to work

2832
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:22,790
my social skills
that's fun.

2833
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:23,430
Like,
oh,

2834
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:25,810
I fucked it up with that person.
That was weird,

2835
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:28,750
so let me.
What did I learn to be more?

2836
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:33,150
Giving people more energy,
be positive to people it can help to.

2837
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:36,850
Also it's.
It takes a little time to recognize that

2838
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,580
they're going to have a different
feeling about you than you have about

2839
02:11:39,581 --> 02:11:43,990
them to get them to you.
They're a person that you've never met

2840
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:46,750
them,
but to them meeting you is all.

2841
02:11:46,751 --> 02:11:50,410
It's weighted a lot of weight to it,
a lot of gravity to the moment and

2842
02:11:50,411 --> 02:11:54,700
sometimes people just get overwhelmed by
it and they they fuck up and stumble and

2843
02:11:54,701 --> 02:11:58,990
then they call you a monkey and screen
matcha and fucking crazy bitch.

2844
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:00,330
Well,
I think I stopped doing it.

2845
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:03,430
I stopped correcting people that call me
by character names.

2846
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:05,350
Oh,
I used to do that.

2847
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:09,100
I used to be that dude I used to be
because I do the show broad city,

2848
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:13,510
probably my most popular character and
people will say,

2849
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:16,730
hey,
Lincoln

2850
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:20,770
and I used to do that.
No Lincoln as a character that play name

2851
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,940
was Hannibal.
I used to be that like that and I'm just

2852
02:12:23,941 --> 02:12:24,774
like,
fuck it,

2853
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:25,643
Lincoln.
It is.

2854
02:12:25,870 --> 02:12:27,290
Just say hi.
Hey,

2855
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:29,510
what's up?
High doing.

2856
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:32,410
Yeah,
it's tricky man.

2857
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,600
The learning how to navigate the waters
of people knowing you and you don't know

2858
02:12:37,601 --> 02:12:39,100
them.
And then also alcohol,

2859
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,080
you know,
you're out when they recognize you and

2860
02:12:41,081 --> 02:12:43,170
they're drunk.
I remember,

2861
02:12:43,171 --> 02:12:45,910
uh,
I met this a fucking God damn it.

2862
02:12:45,911 --> 02:12:48,550
This guy has been in a million movies.
I'm trying to remember his name,

2863
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:52,390
but I met him once.
It's probably good that I won't say his

2864
02:12:52,391 --> 02:12:53,380
name,
I don't remember his name,

2865
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,750
but I met him at one of those.
Um,

2866
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:58,210
you know,
they have those press junket things they

2867
02:12:58,211 --> 02:13:03,050
do where they have NBC as like all their
talent and all the.

2868
02:13:03,630 --> 02:13:05,050
Yeah,
one of those fucking things.

2869
02:13:05,051 --> 02:13:06,820
And reporters are wandering around.
They have,

2870
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:09,310
they interview people when you're
drinking and they do it.

2871
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:12,190
Pasadena,
Pasadena.

2872
02:13:12,191 --> 02:13:13,520
Yeah.
And I was going on,

2873
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:15,740
on the,
on the hallway to the bathroom and I ran

2874
02:13:15,741 --> 02:13:18,460
into this dude and I've seen him in a
100 movies and everything like that.

2875
02:13:18,461 --> 02:13:19,720
And I was like,
what's up man?

2876
02:13:19,721 --> 02:13:22,000
How you doing it?
What are you doing here man?

2877
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:23,530
And I remember he was like,
yeah,

2878
02:13:23,531 --> 02:13:27,430
a world working and he walked by me and
I'm like,

2879
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:28,480
Oh my God,
I'm an idiot.

2880
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:29,980
It just,
I just,

2881
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:32,010
I just dorked out

2882
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:36,810
drunk and you know,
and he didn't respond the way I thought

2883
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:38,840
he was gonna.
He responded like I'm a Dork,

2884
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,880
drunk dork and that was the right way to
do it.

2885
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:43,350
But I remember thinking,
man,

2886
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:46,110
I got to be aware if someone ever does
that to me.

2887
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:49,200
Like how?
Because this is a feeling when you see

2888
02:13:49,201 --> 02:13:51,410
somebody that's been in movies before
and you're like fuck,

2889
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:55,650
and you know,
just,

2890
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,690
it's just a lesson.
No,

2891
02:13:57,691 --> 02:13:59,400
definitely.
I try to

2892
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:04,710
be more appreciative in this dismissive,
you know,

2893
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:10,080
being a comic too.
Is it like constant mocking thing going

2894
02:14:10,081 --> 02:14:12,760
on?
But you got it,

2895
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:16,830
you do have to turn it off sometimes,
or at least if not,

2896
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:20,480
turn it off.
Turn it down to to,

2897
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:21,810
to,
to,

2898
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,610
to,
to,

2899
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:26,610
to mild,
mild friendly life lessons with Hannibal

2900
02:14:26,611 --> 02:14:27,630
buress.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2901
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:29,850
I gotTa wrap this pitch up.
Bring it home.

2902
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:31,141
What do you got going on?
Man?

2903
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:34,860
It's anything you promoting Netflix,
special comedy comma,

2904
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:38,850
Sido February fifth.
When it's common.

2905
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:42,990
Sato mean Casado means a military attack
that occurs at night.

2906
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,150
Yeah.
Interesting.

2907
02:14:45,151 --> 02:14:48,090
Where did you film this field?
Did in Minneapolis at the,

2908
02:14:48,091 --> 02:14:50,490
uh,
at the varsity theater.

2909
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:53,940
How big was that place?
Is places great holds about 500.

2910
02:14:53,941 --> 02:14:55,770
600 people.
Um,

2911
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:57,360
that's a good sign.
Yeah.

2912
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:59,460
Says the ceiling.
Uh,

2913
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:02,310
have those high.
Is it a high CEO?

2914
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:03,963
It was,
I,

2915
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:07,620
this is my sweatiest special bar.
I was a super sweaty,

2916
02:15:07,621 --> 02:15:09,520
so people don't think I was working.
Art I,

2917
02:15:09,610 --> 02:15:14,080
that's a good size though.
500 seats because I wanted to kind of,

2918
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:14,970
I,
I,

2919
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:18,660
instead of doing just two shows,
I did six shows total.

2920
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:21,510
Oh,
just to get comfortable in a venue

2921
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:24,000
that's smart.
And then film the last two.

2922
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:27,090
So I was there Thursday,
Wednesday,

2923
02:15:27,091 --> 02:15:31,570
Thursday,
Friday in Minneapolis and it was dead

2924
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,690
then by the end of the week it felt like
a,

2925
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:35,370
just a club Gig.

2926
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:36,031
Right,
right,

2927
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:38,640
right.
In a bigger spot in a club Gig.

2928
02:15:38,641 --> 02:15:40,430
But it was,
it was loose,

2929
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:42,020
let loose.
But it was just a,

2930
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:47,580
it was a weird thing is that
I think most times,

2931
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:50,510
at least in my experience,
uh,

2932
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:52,770
the second show is usually the better
show.

2933
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:54,870
This one,
the first show,

2934
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:59,550
knocked it out of the park it in the
second show was weird.

2935
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:05,810
We probably only used two or three
minutes from the second show.

2936
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:08,460
Really?
Everything else is from the first show.

2937
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:09,550
Wow.
Yeah.

2938
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:12,120
But it was good and I'm,
I'm excited about it.

2939
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:14,250
Excited at the other two specials in
Chicago.

2940
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:17,760
Animal furnace would be on Netflix also.
And uh,

2941
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,230
yeah man,
thanks for having me again.

2942
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:20,490
Anytime brother.
And this was,

2943
02:16:20,491 --> 02:16:21,840
this was fun.
Always.

2944
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:23,790
Anytime you've got an open invitation.
Yeah.

2945
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:24,990
Just Holler,
man.

2946
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:26,730
Come on by.
I forgot another gas you could sit in

2947
02:16:26,731 --> 02:16:29,320
and just talk shit in the background.
Do whatever the fuck want,

2948
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:30,190
man.
You're Hannibal

2949
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:31,810
verse.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

2950
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,720
that's it.
That's it for the whole fucking week.

2951
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:36,880
It's over.
Bitches will be back next week.

2952
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:41,290
A lot of entertaining guests.
I'll fill you in with details later,

2953
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:42,970
but I got some good guests next week.
All right,

2954
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:43,751
see Ya.
Bye.

2955
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:43,960
Bye.
