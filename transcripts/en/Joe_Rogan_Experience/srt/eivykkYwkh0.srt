1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,051
Try My day,

2
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,400
That'd be the best in the world.

4
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:06,234
You've seen his posters.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,250
He's the one that does
all those crazy posters.

6
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:08,790
Dope.

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,050
Dope.

8
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,070
Paul Jacobs,

9
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,780
he the one that did Conor McGregor in an
MMA glove punching Floyd in the mouth.

10
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,610
Correct.

11
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,220
Here's The New York one
with all the dope stuff.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,641
Let me tell you,

13
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,290
here's where kind of McGregor to win.

14
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,190
Here's where Conor Mcgregor,

15
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,380
he can win MMA gloves.

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,760
Let's have a boxing match with MFA groups.

17
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,190
I don't think you need to do that if
Floyd's ha at boys had some serious

18
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:30,540
problems in the past with his hands.

19
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:30,960
Correct.

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,300
And he uses those big ass
pillow gloves because of it.

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,700
And he's been known to not really
sit down and he's punching.

22
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,720
Just picks guys apart.

23
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,980
There's no doubt about it.

24
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,570
Floyd is a masterful boxer,

25
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,590
but that's a big transition for
him to fighting with small gloves.

26
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,310
He's never been as big as the transition
is for Connor to fight with bigger

27
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,144
gloves.

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,120
They're going to do boxing.

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,760
But I,

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,160
I honestly think with how Connor moves,

31
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,180
it's,

32
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,781
don't get me wrong.

33
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,950
Floyd's one of the best of all time,

34
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,784
if not the best,

35
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,440
but it's a lot for them to adapt to.

36
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,280
Connor's big.

37
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,540
He gets fucking hard.

38
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,980
He can go both ways.

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,993
We'll see.

40
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,571
We'll see.

41
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,080
I want to see what we get.

42
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,210
All of the work that he's going to have.

43
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:06,870
It's in.

44
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,991
Oh,

45
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,991
is he the one that did the fucking Joey
Diaz and me fucking collar beam has got

46
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,050
them chili with his gum flat

47
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,923
fucking cop,

48
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,620
so he's fine out of his mouth.

49
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,880
Uh,

50
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,580
he's an animal.

51
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,321
Can't really fight.

52
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:22,981
That's not going to happen.

53
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:23,340
That fight.

54
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey Dude,

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,380
it's a lot of fucking money.

56
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,243
Here's the deal.

57
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,070
You made 300,000 by.

58
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,150
Dana had a real good point.

59
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,631
He goes,

60
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,230
Connor's last two paper
views where 1.3 million,

61
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,081
1.5 million,

62
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,960
he goes Floyd's was 300,000
and it's a great poison.

63
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,080
Floyd's asking for 500
million or 400 million.

64
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,620
Rather.

65
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:40,921
He goes,

66
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,731
you're out of your fucking mind.

67
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:41,911
He goes,

68
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:42,744
here's a real deal.

69
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,400
I'll give you 25 million.

70
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,480
I'll give Connor 25 billion and then
we'll talk about paper review after you've

71
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,790
written them a thousand from Reebok,

72
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,770
you get 4,000 not a championship fight,

73
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,604
but it's a main event.

74
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,471
Oh Mom,

75
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:55,831
look at this.

76
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,280
Boom.

77
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,790
Hey Be,

78
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,930
this is why it's getting serious.

79
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:01,380
Cause Dana addresses it made
an offer on national TV.

80
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,320
Floyd was on showtime
last night and they go,

81
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,960
is there any boxer that could
bring you out of retirement?

82
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,171
He goes,

83
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:07,620
nope.

84
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,950
The only fight that would get me out of
retirement is Conor McGregor is the only

85
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:11,784
fight I want.

86
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,860
He knows there's so much
money in that fight.

87
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,820
Conor McGregor is a God
damn fucking happened.

88
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:18,391
But see,

89
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,870
the thing is that's a fight that would
transcend into the total casual person

90
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,390
the same way the Ronda Rousey fights do.

91
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,420
But this soul dump on
concrete million though.

92
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,920
This might be like 3 million because
he might be like such a freak show,

93
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,420
but he likes three,

94
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,254
four Mil.

95
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,730
I think so Andrea,

96
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,721
what would you say?

97
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,460
Like the biggest paper you fight ever?

98
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,800
Like what was the number
number one of all time?

99
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,711
This pack.

100
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,580
Y'All may one is that
the biggest of all time,

101
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,473
isn't it?

102
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,310
Before we look at the numbers,

103
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,144
let's guess,

104
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm going to say 2.5 is
that the biggest ever?

105
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,163
I'm say

106
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm saying almost three two
point it is for that fight.

107
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,840
It is for Pacquiao.

108
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,300
Mayweather,

109
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,480
yeah,

110
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,850
but I'll,

111
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,421
it's you're,

112
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,320
you're off on the numbers.

113
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,920
What's the number?

114
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
I think it's five right?

115
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,920
4.6 mil.

116
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,570
Oh,

117
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,690
Connor and them.

118
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,981
But Damn,

119
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,460
how much might it may work mother making
that fight revenue of 400 million.

120
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,840
Oh my Jesus.

121
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,260
So he probably made at least a
hundred plus million that didn't,

122
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,800
they say made 150 160 million impact.

123
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,650
Y'all made like 80 or a
hundred but him and Connor,

124
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,370
you're getting,

125
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,450
even if you hate Connor,

126
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,090
you're still getting all those
MMA fans cause he represents us.

127
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,230
Even though you hate Floyd,

128
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,550
get all those boxes and fans.

129
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,010
Even if you hate Floyd and
then the two worlds just go.

130
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,770
Good.

131
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,603
Josh,

132
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,680
do you think that he can,

133
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,010
that they can make it up to
that level that you think,

134
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:38,890
wow,

135
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,723
I want to know.

136
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,110
I want to know why Conor or
how Connor isn't concerned.

137
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,710
He'll get knocked out in the first round.

138
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,600
Nothing to lose.

139
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,060
He won't get knocked
out in the first shot.

140
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,430
No,

141
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,560
he won't get knocked down the first time.

142
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,400
It doesn't work that way.

143
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,730
As a,

144
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,150
you mean you,

145
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,670
you can protect yourself against even
somebody that could cause very high level

146
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:55,960
and quick and,

147
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,140
and also it doesn't hit that hard.

148
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,010
Con is a lot bigger,

149
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,023
right,

150
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,930
of moves different than a lot of boxers
do because he's so used to leg kicks.

151
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,690
He's still used to take downs
and he has a different stance.

152
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,100
That alone will be,

153
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,860
we'll take a little bit of time
for me where the to adjust to,

154
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,610
but Mayweather has the ability to be
in the right place at the right time.

155
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,100
Always.

156
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,410
So deceptive.

157
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,590
It's so deceptive because it doesn't
look like he's doing anything special,

158
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,060
but if you watch the way he's moving,

159
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,400
he's never had a position
and he's always popping.

160
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:29,401
You went to that chap and he's still even
at (373) 083-0930 nine or it might be

161
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,940
40 lightning fast and take it.

162
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,550
Especially lately though,

163
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,260
he doesn't take advantage
of getting out of the way.

164
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,821
He's kind of,

165
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,110
he's winning rounds with
the Jab dicon and dodging.

166
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:39,890
Get out of the way.

167
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,360
Um,

168
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,380
I just don't got it.

169
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,030
I think for common though,

170
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,840
man,

171
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,430
it's a win win for you.

172
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,640
Imagine if Connor lands the left hand.

173
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,430
I'm saying that ain't gonna happen,

174
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,171
man.

175
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:53,770
Listen,

176
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,910
Connor fought,

177
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,781
I mean rather,

178
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,100
um,

179
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,900
Floyd fought Ricardo Mayorga.

180
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,520
Yeah.

181
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,931
And no,

182
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,910
not recording my orga
you're thinking of Madonna,

183
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,500
Madonna.

184
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,310
Mark was my Donna,

185
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,990
right.

186
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,860
Donna connected at the
end of one of the rounds.

187
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,980
He connected with a big fucking right man.

188
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,780
And they had had him
sit down for a second.

189
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,270
Did he hit 100% but excuse me,

190
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,630
he still,

191
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,100
he's really hot on one shoulder.

192
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:18,260
You know,

193
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,711
there's really no,

194
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:18,790
no,

195
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,941
no,

196
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,150
no.

197
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,080
There's a really only once,

198
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:20,920
but it was the first fight.

199
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,581
The second fight,

200
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:22,510
Floyd boxes,

201
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,271
Jane Walk.

202
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,120
They will see it here.

203
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,511
See?

204
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,680
And my Donna is,

205
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,220
you know,

206
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,510
murderous puncher just,

207
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,550
and he would throw those crazy chocolate,

208
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,960
Dell style overhand rights.

209
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,070
So he's all over a Floyd here and
at the end was one of the rounds.

210
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,963
Amazing.

211
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,020
But listen,

212
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,540
this guy is way smaller than Conor.

213
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,403
Let's think of this.

214
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,970
We're talking about a guy here
that's fighting one 47 one 54 Connor,

215
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,870
although he's made it down to one 45 he's
physically much larger than this guy.

216
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,090
Connor was walking around.

217
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,030
Am I love that you guys aren't gonna.

218
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,810
He won't put a glove on him and,

219
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,150
and he will not hit him.

220
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,821
And I think floor,

221
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,210
it's going to do whatever
want you want to bet,

222
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,660
Brian.

223
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,470
If you want to bet that re lance one,

224
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:00,861
Sean,

225
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,060
you pay none of them off.

226
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,180
It's a very strange Connor.

227
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,670
He always loses a Conor McGregor
is you won't land a shot.

228
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,240
No.

229
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Can You pour me some?

230
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:09,500
No one.

231
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:09,970
Not at night.

232
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,240
He's starting to
something more on a clean.

233
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,011
She up to me and Joe.

234
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:12,780
No pouring some more.

235
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,190
Well,

236
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,760
what I do know is a great fighters have,

237
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:15,800
they haven't done it.

238
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,410
Haven't we a,

239
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:16,641
I mean,

240
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,930
I know that he may have no doubt,

241
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,910
no doubt any pat Carroll look clumsy.

242
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,571
I know that.

243
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:20,810
So,

244
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,290
sure.

245
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,070
I'll have one arm.

246
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,760
I know that.

247
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,070
Yeah,

248
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,610
look at this.

249
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,620
He's done it to everybody.

250
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,801
Oh,

251
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,330
see my,

252
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,070
I clipped him there with a left
or a right uppercut rather,

253
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,130
but at the end of a,

254
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,110
one of the Hoa dues,

255
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,050
beautiful box factory wants,

256
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,531
hey man,

257
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,100
you don't get to be 49 and now without
being fucking sensation now just don't,

258
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,930
he's the best defensive boxer of all time.

259
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,380
Right.

260
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,681
But yeah,

261
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:40,400
I would say so.

262
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,233
I would say so.

263
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,100
I mean,

264
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,390
he's two years,

265
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,510
Pernell Whitaker loss.

266
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,850
Later on in his career,

267
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,490
he wasn't able to sustain it
as long as Mayweather has.

268
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,151
So what may,

269
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:53,360
where there's been able to do is sustain
it better than anybody and also keep

270
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,130
improving.

271
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,420
Right.

272
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,960
Can mean like when he fought Canelo he,

273
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,350
a lot of people thought Canelo was gonna
give him a hard time and young Canelo

274
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,200
he's too big for him.

275
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,470
You Fuck Canelo up.

276
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,550
Okay.
