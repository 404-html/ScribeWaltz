1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,900
Ready?
Five,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,030
four,
three,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,860
two,
one.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,390
Mr.
Shock,

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,190
first of all,
thank you very,

6
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:09,630
very,
very much for being here.

7
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:13,240
I've been following your work for a long
time now and uh,

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm,
I'm very appreciative of you and very 

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,211
appreciative of everything you've done 
and I've been fascinated by the subject 

10
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:20,850
of ancient Egypt.
So,

11
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,050
um,
I really,

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,820
I'm really excited.
Very siloed.

13
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,200
Thank you.
It's a real pleasure to be here.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,240
I've heard a lot about your show.
I've heard a lot about you.

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,760
My,
of course you'd like John Anthony West I

16
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,890
think was on with you a couple of times.
Maybe.

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,960
He was very proud that I guess you did 
the only full skype interview with him.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,170
Yeah,
that's the only one I've ever done is 

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,170
with him.
Yeah.

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,631
He used to like to talk about that so.
Well I just had to talk to him and he 

21
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,110
was in upstate New York at the time and 
it was just,

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,310
he really didn't have any plans to come 
down here and I'm just,

23
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,790
I was very fortunate to one day get them
in studio though.

24
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,750
It was really nice.
So it's been wonderful.

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,890
Well,
his work,

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,250
that DVD series,
he did magical Egypt was amazing and I 

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,181
had seen your work before that in that 
mysteries of the Sphinx thing that was 

28
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,840
narrated by Charlton Heston,
Heston,

29
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,790
NBC,
1993,

30
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,791
I think in many ways it was the mystery 
of the Sphinx that really broke 

31
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,721
everything open.
It brought everything to the public 

32
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:23,940
attention.
I've had many people tell me,

33
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:28,941
I'm not trying to brag or anything,
I'm just saying it's actually that this 

34
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:30,990
really opened up a new field,
if we could put it that way,

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,490
a new way of looking at things in the 
popular,

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,480
among the popular,
um,

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,310
public popular media that people around 
the world versus the academic scholarly 

38
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,690
journals and the back and forth,
that type of thing.

39
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,790
You have to remember,
I'm a faculty member.

40
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,950
I'm at Boston University.
I'm an academic,

41
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,280
uh,
and many of the academics have poo pooed

42
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,040
should we say over the years,
bringing things to the public.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,460
But I think it's been important to do 
now what we're talking about,

44
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:07,461
for the people that are uninformed is 
the idea that some of the structures in 

45
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,291
ancient Egypt are far older than 
conventional wisdom or conventional 

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,530
modern day archeology,
modern day egyptologist.

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,740
They would like us to believe that all 
of this spawned from a very specific 

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,101
time period and people like John Anthony
West and yourself and some other folks 

49
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:30,021
like Graham Hancock are proposing that 
it's entirely possible that there were 

50
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:34,011
many different areas of construction in 
Egypt and that there are some structures

51
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,800
that are far far older than we think.
Yeah,

52
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:42,801
exactly.
And this what I was alluding to is just 

53
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:45,531
really opened up with our work on 
reading the Great Sphinx and I think you

54
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:50,781
know the story,
but maybe just to summarize in the 

55
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:51,450
smallest of nutshells,
John Anthony West,

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,980
before I met him,
he was became a followership.

57
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,650
We say I shouldn't say follower because 
that sounds wrong.

58
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,070
That sounds like it's a religion

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,070
dogma,
but he became interested in the work of 

60
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,970
the late Schwaller de Lubitsch who died 
passed away in 1961,

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,180
but he had mentioned in one line that 
the Sphinx had been weathered by rain,

62
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,570
I would say precipitation as a 
geologist,

63
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,630
not wind and sand,
so this if it were true,

64
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,660
and it is true,
would put the Sphinx back to a much 

65
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,660
earlier period which would tie in with 
Schwab Adler's work and John Anthony 

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,110
West sis subsequent work that there were
indications that dynastic Egypt as we 

67
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,040
know it,
going back to about 3000 BC,

68
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
was really a legacy of what I call now 
an earlier cycle of civilization or 

69
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,740
something that goes back much,
much earlier,

70
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:48,070
which at this point I date back to the 
end of the last ice age.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,500
Ice Age ended 9,700
BC.

72
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,840
Just to put it in perspective for 
people.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,960
So when,
when did you first get on board with 

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,170
this?
John Anthony West come to you or John?

75
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,100
Anthony West.
Okay.

76
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:05,101
So the story goes this way.
John Anthony West published serpent in 

77
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,250
the sky.
His probably most famous book,

78
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,490
First Edition Nineteen 79,
he was then looking for someone that 

79
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:17,011
could really validate or at least assess
from a scientific point of view,

80
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,610
this theory about this face,
which he had just barely sort of touched

81
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,500
the surface based on Schwaller.
That may be.

82
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,501
It could be older,
but this was really a geological 

83
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,901
question.
He mentioned that in 1979 in serpent in 

84
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,620
the sky,
John Anthony West went on to become very

85
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,460
involved with Egypt and he started 
traveling to Egypt.

86
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,461
He led tourists to Egypt.
He wrote the travelers key to ancient 

87
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,500
Egypt in 1985.
Also mentions in appendix.

88
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,680
I think it was just the older sphinx 
theory,

89
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,730
but really looking for someone to at 
least assess it scientifically.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He met a fellow at in in Egypt actually 
at the time,

91
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,970
Robert Eddie,
who is a phd in English literature,

92
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,330
I believe,
something like that,

93
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:11,110
but he was teaching in Cairo and 
American University in Cairo,

94
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,650
I believe.

95
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,360
Then he came to Boston University.
This is late 19 eighties.

96
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:20,170
I was and still do teach at Boston 
University full time.

97
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,040
Robert Eddy and myself got to know each 
other.

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Robert Eddie mentioned me as a geologist
to John Anthony West and that may be.

99
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,880
This was someone who seemed fairly 
knowledgeable,

100
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,730
fairly open minded about things,
the time.

101
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:40,390
Did you have any live on Egypt or.
Oh,

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,850
I.
I.

103
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,620
my interest in Egypt goes way back.
I was reading about ancient Egypt when I

104
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,790
was literally six,
seven,

105
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,791
eight years old.
I had a grandmother who had a wonderful 

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,720
library at the time and I would go 
through her library.

107
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,100
She had books from British Museum on

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,530
Ancient Egypt going back to the turn of 
the century,

109
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:05,531
so I.
I was prepared in the sense that I was 

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,160
open to such things,
but I didn't imagine getting involved in

111
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,200
Egypt in any way professionally.

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,550
Did you have any thoughts about the 
dating of the Sphinx and the pyramids or

113
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,320
anything back then before you looked 
into?

114
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,660
There were two things,
so there were two things going on in my 

115
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,381
head back then,
which may be prepped me for this number 

116
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:24,960
one,
I knew the conventional story.

117
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,840
I knew that the Sphinx goes back to 
2,500

118
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:32,841
BC according to the standard 
Egyptologists in 1989,

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,390
which is when I first,
I believe it was 1989,

120
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:41,391
I first actually met western person.
I had in my mind that the egyptologists 

121
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,580
must be correct because they've studied 
it.

122
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:49,581
They must know what they're doing.
I was coming from an academic point of 

123
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:49,740
view.
I,

124
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,670
I'm,
I'm not,

125
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,070
I'm just giving,
you know,

126
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,320
saying where I'm coming from.
I had gone to Yale University and get my

127
00:06:55,321 --> 00:07:00,321
phd in Geology and geophysics.
I was very well grounded in the status 

128
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:05,481
quo academic point of view.
So I thought when I first went to Egypt 

129
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:09,620
I would just prove west wrong.
I would just prove that the egyptologist

130
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,310
knew what they were talking about,
but,

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,110
and this is an important,
but I was also trained in many ways,

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,200
both as a graduate student and going 
back to my grandmother who I had great 

133
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,521
respect for and was also very,
should we say liberal and open minded 

134
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:25,860
but critical.

135
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,130
You always have to follow the evidence 
wherever it goes.

136
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:34,131
And that's always been my rule of thumb,
that not everything is always the way 

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
people say it is even if their 
authorities and something I already knew

138
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:44,571
when I went to Egypt for the first time 
was that some of the very old 

139
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:49,070
egyptologists in the late 19th,
early 20th century had actually 

140
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,290
suggested that just the way it looks,
the feel of the Sphinx,

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,010
not based on hard evidence really that 
may be,

142
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,990
it was older than the pyramids.
That may be.

143
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:02,991
It goes back earlier.
So I felt that it wasn't all said and 

144
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:08,181
done and you know,
pat and sound that the egyptologist 

145
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,751
necessarily knew what they were talking 
about in modern times because some of 

146
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,931
the earlier egyptologist who they held 
in very high respect supposedly had set 

147
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,160
different things.
Secondly,

148
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,400
and I hate to bring this up,
but I will because it's part of the 

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,400
background.

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I,
my grandmother,

151
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,610
who I mentioned a second ago,
uh,

152
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,870
was uh,
theosophy and Thea,

153
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:32,370
if you know anything about theosophy,
it also suggests that,

154
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
you know,
maybe there's things that go back 

155
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,520
earlier.
I don't theosophy theosophy it's,

156
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,890
it's a,
how do I explain it?

157
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:44,520
You have you heard of Blavatsky Madame 
Blavatsky?

158
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,180
No.
Okay.

159
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,190
Well,
I'm losing my headphones.

160
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,010
Theosophy was founded in the late 19th 
century.

161
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,160
It questioned a lot of the values,
a lot of the dogma of Science,

162
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,420
of the time,
of religion,

163
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:05,421
of the time it looked to the east in 
particular to other philosophies,

164
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,120
other world views.
So basically it was a way.

165
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,630
This is what it did for me at least.
And I'm not a theosophist I don't want 

166
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,940
to say I'm a theosophy,
uh,

167
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,100
but reading theosophical works on top of
everything else allowed me,

168
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,101
I think to expand my horizons and to see
that maybe this dogma of the day is just

169
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:32,511
that the dogma of the day,
that there are other possibilities and 

170
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,531
not that we accept something just 
because someone said it or it because 

171
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,771
it's old or because it's this religion 
or that religion or that supposed to be 

172
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:39,771
ancient culture.

173
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:43,080
But no,
you keep everything open.

174
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,110
You look at the evidence and that's 
really where I was coming from.

175
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,370
But my point is that even in late 19 
eighties,

176
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,280
early 19 nineties,
when I first got involved with this,

177
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,350
if I looked at it critically,
the evidence was not that definitive for

178
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:03,351
the age of the Sphinx.
So I was going in with openminded 

179
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,540
possibilities.
But honestly,

180
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,750
when I first went to Egypt with John 
Anthony West in 1990,

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,550
I thought before I got off the plane 
that this would be simple,

182
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,060
open and shut case.
I would prove him wrong in the sense of 

183
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,920
his assertions.
That may be the Sphinx was older.

184
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,190
I had no doubt at the time that my 
colleagues in Egyptology must know what 

185
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:33,441
they're talking about and all of that 
change literally within 30,

186
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:38,451
without exaggerating,
30 to 120 seconds of first seen 

187
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:38,451
recently.
Reasonings.

188
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,210
Yeah,
it really did.

189
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,420
What was your first impression?
Because my first impression of the spanx

190
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,720
was now that I saw on the ground in 
person,

191
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,470
there was something wrong with the Egypt
and logical dating.

192
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Because when you look at the Sphinx as a
geologist with a geological I,

193
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,920
this was not weathered by wind and sand.
This was not desert erosion.

194
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,700
And weathering that I saw on the sinks,
the body of the Sphinx,

195
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,720
which is very difficult to tell because 
it's been heavily repaired and reworked,

196
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,680
but particularly on the walls of what 
are known as the Sphinx enclosure.

197
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,010
The Sphinx enclosure is important 
because it preserves a lot of the 

198
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,211
details and if you haven't,
if the audience has not been to Egypt,

199
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,180
they should realize that when they 
carved the Sphinx,

200
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,430
it's all solid bedrock.
Only.

201
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,400
The head initially was above the ground 
surface.

202
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,550
You carved,
they carved down into the rock to free 

203
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,030
up the body,
what I call it,

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,040
the core body of the Sphinx in that core
body and the walls of the enclosure,

205
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,470
more or less the quarry around it,
if you want to use that term that showed

206
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:53,471
these ancient weathering precipitation 
erosion or features that are 

207
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:59,611
incompatible with the last 5,000
years of climatic history on the eastern

208
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,180
edge of the Sahara.

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,360
So immediately I knew there was 
something wrong geologically had to 

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,741
figure that out.
Either this was a weird geological 

211
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:14,401
anomaly or something else was going on 
and the Sphinx might go back to an 

212
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:17,740
earlier period.
Also,

213
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:22,741
I want to point out that when you look 
at the Sphinx and other geologists have 

214
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:28,171
looked at this as well,
they did not just chip away at the rock 

215
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:32,310
to carve the body more or less.
You could have chipped away at the rock 

216
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,581
with pick axes and that type of thing.
Shoveled out chips of rock in baskets.

217
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:41,161
That would've been the easy way.
What they did is they carved out huge 

218
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,790
blocks of stone.
I mean when I say huge,

219
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,070
we're talking multitenant,
tens of tons.

220
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,760
Some of them maybe over 50 tons or more 
of limestone.

221
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,060
They moved those due east of the Sphinx 
and built what is now known as the 

222
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,531
Sphinx Temple,
which is still there in ruinous 

223
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,530
condition and the valley temple.

224
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,530
So you had these two huge temples and 
what is interesting and lot of people 

225
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,760
don't realize this or they don't think 
about.

226
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,910
I think those constructions which are 
contemporary with the oldest portion of 

227
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,411
the Sphinx in some ways,
are more impressive if you think about 

228
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:19,861
the technology and what went into 
constructing them than the age of the 

229
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:21,430
Sphinx itself.
So it's not just the Sphinx.

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,640
It's also these limestone temples that 
are associated with it and we're built 

231
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,200
contemporaneously,
so jamie pulled up to photos here.

232
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,270
The first one that he pulled up was a 
computer image that showed the Sphinx 

233
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,080
and showed how I'm looking at it.
Yeah.

234
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,650
Yes.
And in this image,

235
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,651
what you can see that's a computer image
that's actually from mystery of the 

236
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:47,331
Sphinx,
and then there's a inset that's an 

237
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:47,331
aerial photograph,
the real thing,

238
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:50,230
and that shows how when they were 
carving the body,

239
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,470
they cut out huge blocks and then put 
them in position to make what's known as

240
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:58,450
the swings temple due east of the swing.

241
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,730
And the second image is the Sphinx 
Temple.

242
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,860
You look at this,
it says this,

243
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,861
things faces due east,
the rising sun and right in front of it 

244
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:11,220
is the Sphinx Temple.
So this is a humongous temple made out 

245
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,141
of these huge blocks of stone which were
carved out when they carve the body of 

246
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,950
the Sphinx.
And here you see in this image another,

247
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,190
a picture of the Sphinx Temple.
And so these erosion,

248
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,460
if you can see how big they are,
you can see how big they are.

249
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:28,960
They're enormous.
Okay.

250
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,680
These erosion features on the blocks,
don't worry about them for the moment.

251
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,710
Okay.
Let's go back to the Sphinx enclosure 

252
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,530
itself.
It's a sphinx enclosure where you see 

253
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,410
the rolling,
undulating,

254
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,710
profiled,
the Roche no features here.

255
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:47,500
You see it in that picture.
The vertical fissures,

256
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:52,501
and I know you're familiar with this 
personally because I've heard you talk 

257
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:52,501
about it,
finance they west,

258
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:55,220
that can only be caused by 
precipitation.

259
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,820
The rocks are like a layer cake,
so it takes out the software layers,

260
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,150
it receipts the software layer,
some of the harder layer stick out 

261
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,041
further,
but the water also finds its way down 

262
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,001
crevices and cracks,
natural features that are slightly 

263
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,650
softer and it forms these vertical 
fissures.

264
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,200
I want to make the point because a lot 
of people get confused.

265
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,320
They say,
couldn't it be rising Nile floods?

266
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,060
No.
Geologically,

267
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:25,890
that will give a very different 
signature on the rockets,

268
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,900
not floods coming up from the bottom.
It's actually precipitation and rainfall

269
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,240
runoff coming from above and rainfall 
for thousands of years.

270
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,370
Well,
there's two aspects here.

271
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,400
It could be thousands of years,
it could be much stronger rainfall,

272
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,200
you know,
huge flash floods,

273
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:50,201
that type of thing.
And part of the story that I hope we'll 

274
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:53,300
get to is that initially I'm jumping 
around here a little bit,

275
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,910
but initially I was thinking five to 
7,000

276
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:03,020
bc that was very conservative based on 
the geological data,

277
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,840
based on the seismic,
which we have to get to also.

278
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,490
But now I believe we're talking prior to
9,700

279
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:15,491
BC for the original construction of the 
Sphinx and we can talk about why the 

280
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:19,931
data and at 9,700
bc we have the end of the younger Dryas,

281
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,820
the end of the glacial epic,
the end of the last ice age.

282
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,150
I have now put together the story based 
on evidence and when I ever I say if I 

283
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,540
say I believe something or I think 
something is always based on evidence.

284
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I've been piecing together that what we 
had ending the younger dryas ending the 

285
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,880
last ice age was a huge eruption from 
the sun.

286
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,881
A huge solar outbursts,
huge climatic changes which put among 

287
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:53,831
other things a lot of precipitation,
allow moisture into the air which came 

288
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:58,691
down as precipitation with huge floods,
huge centrally,

289
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,080
thunderstorms,
etc.

290
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,200
And I think a lot of the initial 
errosion that we still see on the walls 

291
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:07,880
of the sinks enclosure go back to that 
period.

292
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,030
So you hAd the situation where you would
get thIs incredible weathering and 

293
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:19,541
erosion and then it continued for 
thousands of years after that and was 

294
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,381
reinforced until you had the sahara 
coming in in relatively recent times and

295
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,130
geologically in times desert that sahara
desert.

296
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,370
So before that it was some sort of a 
rain forest,

297
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,410
a.
It's a vanity rainforest.

298
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,440
It actually varied over time.
And before that it was very fertile.

299
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,360
Savannah,
lots of plants there.

300
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,870
People have seen it even in popular 
movies and whatnot,

301
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:48,350
how the sahara at one point had water 
and all kinds of animals.

302
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,150
That's before end of the last ice age 
before this.

303
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,840
These incredible changes that we have at
9,700

304
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,370
bc.
So that's where the sphinx,

305
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:04,371
I think the original sphinx goes back to
that time period and that's what the 

306
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:08,700
egyptians called zep tepi.
This was a first time for them or what I

307
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,310
call an earlier cycle of civilization.

308
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,580
The last cycle,
the one that we're still part of in my 

309
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,770
terminology is the last 5,000
years.

310
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:22,771
So civilization arising reemerging,
I should say about 3000 to 4,000

311
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:29,931
bc company into really what we have now 
is high technology,

312
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,100
etc.
But before that there had been an 

313
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,960
earlier cycle civilization that was 
essentially snuffed out or brought to 

314
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
its knees if you would,
by the end of the last ice age.

315
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,800
And just to map this out,
a period from about 9,700

316
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:51,801
bc,
this is what I'm reconstructing now to 

317
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:54,891
about 4,000
to 3000 bc where we have civilization 

318
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:58,140
reemerging between that period.
So thousands of years.

319
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:02,370
Ninety 700 bc to say 3,700
bc for round numbers,

320
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:03,330
6,000
years.

321
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,570
We have essentially a dark period.
And what I've been now calling siddha 

322
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,010
solar induced dark age,
sort of ironic.

323
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:16,011
the sun will induce a dark age because 
of brought civilization back to an 

324
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,120
earlier stage,
if you would.

325
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,010
I'm not sure I follow that.
Well,

326
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,640
how did the son do this?
Um,

327
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,810
solar outburst essentially coronal mass 
ejection,

328
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,960
huge eruption,
bigger than anything we've ever seen 

329
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,690
laws,
these massive thunder showers and we 

330
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,810
exactly in modern history,
modern history is even close to this,

331
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,110
but we do have isotope data,
etc.

332
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,410
That indicates this has happened in the 
past at the end of the last ice age and 

333
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,881
I'm sure it's happened many times over 
and you have a lot of markers that 

334
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,960
indicate this.
You have vitrification of rock.

335
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,210
I'm in fact a lot of the markers,
and I don't want to be debating the 

336
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,461
issue necessarily,
but a lot of the markers that people 

337
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:06,381
have used for a comment at the younger 
dryas or during the younger dryas 

338
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
through,
most of them are at the beginning of the

339
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,960
younger dryas.
That'S what they're claiming,

340
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,960
but loved that a lot of the dating is 
very,

341
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,800
very iffy.

342
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,470
Um,
I found it interesting.

343
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:21,471
For instance,
someone will use something as a marker 

344
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,110
for the younger dry ice.
And that will give a date of 12,000

345
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,060
plus or minus 4,000
years.

346
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:24,990
So,
you know,

347
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,200
this is just the way geology is,
but I remember,

348
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,620
I can't remember his name.
You had a guest on one of your shows.

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,250
he was when?
randall carlson,

350
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,340
not randall carlson.
I know randall very well.

351
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,010
Uh,
he was on with carlson and shermer and a

352
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,120
half,
but he came on by a skype.

353
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,610
You outcome malcolm.
I do not remember it.

354
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,190
But anyway,
he was one of the people that was quote,

355
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,550
comment proponent.
And he started pointed out a lot of the 

356
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,560
evidence,
a micro spirituals,

357
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,160
glassy spheres on nano diamonds.
I don't think he mentioned biomed,

358
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,210
say shocked quartz,
et cetera.

359
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,720
And everyone has been assuming this has 
to be from a physical impact in the 

360
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,900
sense of something coming down like a 
comet or asteroid,

361
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,650
that type of thing.

362
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,930
but the problem is you don't necessarily
find craters.

363
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:23,320
You don't necessarily find the pieces of
the comment.

364
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:26,560
You should find some physical remains.
And he mentioned,

365
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:31,561
and I found it very interesting,
he mentioned in passing what I've been 

366
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,730
working on now for a number of years 
that no,

367
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,150
and I was once on the comment band bike 
and I'll put it that way and I'm not 

368
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,301
trying knock good research,
but when you look at the evidence,

369
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,990
what is not being considered by a lot of
people,

370
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,480
and he mentioned this in passing and 
said,

371
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:49,930
well,
you know,

372
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:54,931
something else that could cause this 
lightning but you wouldn't have 

373
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:54,931
lightning.
You know,

374
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:58,180
that's very localized.
We think of this very localized.

375
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,330
Um,
but if you have a major solar outburst,

376
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:06,331
mainers are coronal mass ejections and 
astrophysicists who is now deceased.

377
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,110
He was at cornell,
thomas gold,

378
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,020
who did a lot of really good,
in fact,

379
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:16,021
prize winning work in astrophysics,
first pointed out in the 19 sixties that

380
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,380
if you have a major solar outburst,
major coronal mass ejection,

381
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,320
you would get essentially huge.

382
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,320
What would be like huge lightning 
strikes over incredible areas of the 

383
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,770
earth.
Simultaneously.

384
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,120
This would cost vitrification.
It would cause all these features.

385
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,510
And just as a,
within the last year,

386
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:42,511
there's been more work done showing that
full rights were lightning strikes in 

387
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:46,831
modern times.
Even small lightning strikes like that 

388
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:48,760
can cause,
can create things like shocked quartz.

389
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,720
Other quote impact features that people 
have always said,

390
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,540
well,
it must be a comet or asteroid,

391
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,050
but you're not finding the craters,
you not finding other things.

392
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,380
So what I'm finding are my own research,
um,

393
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:08,430
is I'm coming to conclude that it wasn't
a physical object that hit us.

394
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,730
It was a solar outburst.
That's a general term I use possible 

395
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,090
that it was both.
Um,

396
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,400
actually there's,
it's quite possible that it could have 

397
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,740
been both.
Yeah,

398
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:23,410
there could have been fragments of both.
I can address that.

399
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,280
Um,
and there's a couple of aspects to both.

400
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,310
When you say both,
there is indications that comments 

401
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,950
diving into the sun actually caused 
coronal mass ejections a correlated with

402
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,380
disturbing the sun.
So in some cases you'll have the occult,

403
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,390
the comic group talking about how we go 
through these comment streams 

404
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,760
periodically.
I agree 100 percent.

405
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:51,761
In fact,
I talk about this in some of my early 

406
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:51,770
books because I really was into comments
at the time,

407
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,320
four inches of the pyramid builders.
For instance,

408
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:58,430
I talk about how comments might have 
begun and ended the younger dryas,

409
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,820
but I wasn't thinking about solar 
activity at that time.

410
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,010
Seriously asked,
no one else was.

411
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
But we now find that commentS dive into 
the sun when we go through comment 

412
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,560
streams that can set off solar activity.
So in fact,

413
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:17,561
I think it could be both,
but it could be that the comments are 

414
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:19,520
affecting the sun,
which is then affecting the earth rather

415
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,850
than directly,
if that makes sense.

416
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Um,
and the other thing is that people have 

417
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,080
to understand there's a couple of things
going on.

418
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,510
The younger dryas,
10,900

419
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,020
bc when it first begins is a cooling 
period.

420
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,610
It's not as dramatic climate change as 
you have at 9,700

421
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:42,611
bc when all of a sudden we go from deep 
ice age climatic regime to modern are 

422
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:49,190
even a little bit warmer initially.
Modern changes.

423
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,690
And this is it.
Oh,

424
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,140
there.
Yeah,

425
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:56,141
there we have some isotope data.
And what we have at 9,700

426
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:01,361
bc,
and this is based on sediment cores in 

427
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:01,580
ice cores,
we also have lunar data that supports is

428
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,200
at 9,700
bc.

429
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,190
We have incredible climatic change going
from,

430
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,120
you know,
deep ice age to modern warming.

431
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,280
And this literally now based on what 
they call micro stratigraphy from 

432
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,330
greenland,
ice cores can be dated within.

433
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,300
Get this weeks,
two days.

434
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,690
Wow.
So thiS happened literally we're talking

435
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,590
virtually overnight.

436
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,230
When I was a graduate student,
we thought things had happened.

437
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:31,580
Suddenly we were talking thousands of 
years or decades.

438
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,030
Oh god,
don't take decadeS for something to 

439
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,030
happen geologically.
That'd be crazy.

440
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,360
Right now we're talking literally weeks 
today.

441
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,610
So that's incredible.
Yeah.

442
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,790
So I think this ties in to support that.
There was a massive solar event in 

443
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:47,480
[inaudible] 9,700
bc.

444
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,290
Uh,
what we had a,

445
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,310
just a slide a minute ago when I saw it 
out,

446
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,820
the side of my eye was a graph of based 
on isotope data is what they call 

447
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,860
proxies of solar activity.
Again,

448
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,500
based on primarily ice core sediment 
cores.

449
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,180
And the sun was incredibly active and 
9,700

450
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,270
bc and shortly after there,
and it had huge,

451
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,210
if you think of anthropomorphically mood
swings,

452
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:19,211
will be very active.
Then would go very skilled and very 

453
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:19,211
active again,
very still.

454
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:24,100
And this happened for some thousands of 
years and then it evened out.

455
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,920
The sun cert became quiescent.
It was during this quiescence period 

456
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,360
that tying back into human civilization,
civilization was able to reemerge,

457
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:40,661
redevelop again,
and we've had incredibly good conditions

458
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,950
should we say,
for the last 5,000

459
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,470
quite condition,
stable conditions on earth for 

460
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,090
civilization to reemerge.
Tying back into that theme,

461
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,660
but recently the son has become very 
active again and we have to be very 

462
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,000
careful.
I'm not a doomsayer scaremonger.

463
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,820
I'm not trying to sell people on being 
preppers,

464
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
but the reality is the sun is starting 
to become active again,

465
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,940
just as it was at the end of the last 
ice age.

466
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,200
And I think this makes perfect sense 
because the sun is a star.

467
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,800
It goes through cycles like other stars 
do,

468
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,040
and we're a little planet or retain it.
And we're like all the other plants 

469
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,560
affected by this fascinating.
Now that we have this incredible need to

470
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:30,561
keep things exactly the way they are,
to the point where we were in denial 

471
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:30,750
about any potential change.

472
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,150
If you're studying things that was like,
oh,

473
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,350
it'll be fine.
We're,

474
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:37,320
we're so inclined.
We are so inclined to do that.

475
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,410
It's very interested helion.
And in fact,

476
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:42,090
um,
I forget who it was.

477
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:46,050
One of the astrophysicist some decades 
ago said about the sun.

478
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,580
It was sort of the last vestige of eris 
julianism in modern science.

479
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,580
Everyone assumed the son is stable,
essentially.

480
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,360
Perfect.
Yes,

481
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:59,361
it goes through little sun cycles of 11 
and 22 years and maybe some bigger ones 

482
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:03,580
have a few centuries,
but no one wanted to think of it as what

483
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,590
it is.
Just a plain old star that goes through 

484
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,870
periods of the equilibrium.
We've been in relative solar equilibrium

485
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:17,241
for thousands of years now,
but it goes through disequilibrium and 

486
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:21,050
has,
we'll call hiccups in spurts and has to 

487
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,750
recalibrate itself if you would,
uh,

488
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,150
and we feel the effects on earth.
And so at the end of the last ice age,

489
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,230
we had this massive solar event,
solar outburst,

490
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:35,400
what they call 'em,
a solar proton events,

491
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:40,401
um,
it would have messed up the ionosphere 

492
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:40,401
caused all kinds of geomagnetic storms.

493
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,560
This tyson with earthquake activity that
we see at the end of the last ice age 

494
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,190
because we now have lots of evidence 
that solar activity upset,

495
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:53,370
said mac nita sphere and the magnate 
magnetic fields on the earth,

496
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,670
the electrical currents in the earth.
It's A will trigger earthquakes that are

497
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,360
about to happen anyway.
Not unlike.

498
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,380
I was talking to katy,
my wife on the right here.

499
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:12,381
And a good analogy is when you have an 
avalanche just about ready to go,

500
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:16,530
you can clap your hands in some cases 
and it sets off this huge avalanche.

501
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Yeah.
So solar activity is tied in with earth 

502
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,670
activity,
earthquake activity for instance,

503
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,290
of volcanic activity.
So we see volcanic activity,

504
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,690
increased volcanic activity.
There was a major,

505
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,310
I'm super volcano that went off just at 
the end of the last ice age.

506
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,910
Will why?
Probably it.

507
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,030
This is me speaking because of the solar
activity that set it off,

508
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,210
so when you start getting things like 
platinum iridium osmium spikes,

509
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,030
that's not necessarily extra 
terrestrial.

510
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:57,030
That could be from terreStrial volcanic 
activity was occurring at that period,

511
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,220
so yes,
there's extraterrestrial causes,

512
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,870
but I think that there's a very strong 
case to be made that this is solar,

513
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,900
that this is the sun influencing us,
which is really important to fast 

514
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,280
forward to today.
Here we are,

515
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:15,370
we're on skype.
We're using all these electronic media.

516
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,630
What could be more vulnerable to a solar
outburst?

517
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,270
That kind of stuff.
Oh,

518
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,350
our grid power grids.
Power grids will be friday.

519
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,610
There was a,
and I think we're seeing the beginning 

520
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,800
of this are we saw the beginning of this
because again,

521
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm a geologist,
so I think in broad terms,

522
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,250
few hundred years is nothing.
Eighteen,

523
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:42,820
59.
Are you aware of the carrington event?

524
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,880
No.
There was a major solar outburst from a 

525
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,160
human Perspective,
major solar outburst.

526
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:52,630
From an astrophysical perspective,
it was nothing but it was a coronal mass

527
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:53,110
ejection.

528
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,200
Actually two in a row that hit us in 18,
59.

529
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,920
It's known as the carrington event after
richard carrington,

530
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:00,550
who,
um,

531
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,880
first saw the solar flares,
a really bright solar flares that were 

532
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,991
associated with it.
It was picked up on the primitive 

533
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:11,080
magnetometers of the time that they had,
for instance,

534
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,210
in london,
etc.

535
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,030
Study by the physicists of the time and 
18,

536
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:18,730
59,
there were electronics around.

537
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,180
It was called the telegraph system to 
telegraph system.

538
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,450
Acted as huge antenna that picked up the
changing magnetic fields,

539
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:31,870
generated electricity along it,
burnt out the telegraph lines,

540
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,950
literally set telegraph,
um,

541
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,270
uh,
uh,

542
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,710
you know,
the places where the telegraph operators

543
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:44,650
worked on fire,
telegraph stations on fire,

544
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,430
that type of thing.
Um,

545
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,870
if we had a carrington level event now,
which is really quite minor from a 

546
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,240
astrophysical perspective,
orders of magnitude less than what 

547
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,110
happened at the end of the last ice age,
uh,

548
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:04,111
it would fry are grid lines that would 
knock out all the huge transformers it 

549
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:06,300
would be for it.

550
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Did that as it's coming in and probably 
knock out all the sound lights on the 

551
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,450
gps systems,
communications.

552
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:16,030
I mean,
it would really bring us to our knees.

553
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,540
Is this an article from 18,
59?

554
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

555
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,260
The rural display in boston's.
Now the display of auroral.

556
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,030
Yeah.
There you go.

557
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,170
Brilliant.
At 1:00,

558
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:29,230
ordinary print can be read by the light.
Exactly.

559
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:33,670
Because one thing you get is these 
bright auroras,

560
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,910
these bright,
what people think of as in northern and 

561
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:38,910
southern lights,
but in 18,

562
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,890
59,
they saw them around the world.

563
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,700
I'm back at the end of the last ice age 
because they were so powerful.

564
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,260
What?
They become more intense.

565
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:52,370
They take on very discrete structures in
the sky.

566
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,420
Here's some of what are known as a,
again,

567
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,650
northern lights,
right?

568
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Rural displays.
But see how it starts to take on a 

569
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,280
discreet structure on there right there.
and to describe it to the audience.

570
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Do you see how it sort of looks like a 
person with their hands up in the air?

571
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,430
They start to take on more and more 
discreet structures.

572
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:15,431
Some of them looked like people with 
their hands up in there and little legs 

573
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:19,571
and some birds phenomenon.
This is basically the high charge 

574
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:24,941
particles,
electrons and protons and whatnot 

575
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:25,260
interacting with the atmoSphere.
Um,

576
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,230
and they form these figures,
so it's electrical phenomenon,

577
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,680
uh,
and it will ultimately come down if you 

578
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,560
have a tense enough one as you did at 
the end of last ice age,

579
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,360
it will look like if you were there 
living,

580
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,310
you know,
12,000

581
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,900
years ago,
10,000,

582
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,740
11,000,
700 years ago at the end of the last ice

583
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:46,700
age.
And you saw this,

584
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,070
you would see these things in the sky.
Oh,

585
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,090
they look like god,
say,

586
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:52,880
look like stick figure humans in the 
sky.

587
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:58,330
Uh,
you would see huge lightning bolts 

588
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,731
hitting parts of the surface of 
fascinating because that image on that's

589
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,990
in hieroglyphics and exactly find this 
around the world.

590
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,890
and anthony parak who's along when we're
looking at,

591
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:13,891
but for the people that are.
Because a lot of people just listening 

592
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:13,940
what we're looking at a discharge 
formation.

593
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,100
Yeah,
this is plasma discharge formation.

594
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:20,900
Plasma is essentially think of is 
electrically charged particles,

595
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,610
electrons,
protons,

596
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:25,640
that type of thing.
As it comes off the sun.

597
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,730
And this case,
think of a coronal mass ejection,

598
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:32,480
a huge ball of charged gas is one way to
describe it,

599
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,780
hitting the atmosphere,
driving down into the atmosphere,

600
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,180
causing these northern lights on 
steroids.

601
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:46,181
If you wanT to put that image.
We're seeing very specific images that 

602
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:48,800
looked like stick figures.
So these are things you would see in the

603
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:53,801
sky,
except they're in many cases they're 

604
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,711
spinning electrically.
You wouldn't notice that they were 

605
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:57,650
spinning generally and they looked sort 
of like.

606
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,710
because we've tend to anthropomorphize,
we tend to look at like even clouds are 

607
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,620
rocks formations and we make them look 
like what we think they look like.

608
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,770
They look sort of like stick figure men.
Is any of this an actual photograph or 

609
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,250
these just graphic illustrators?
Graphic illustrations.

610
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:18,251
But what we know because we haven't been
experienced this fortunately and since 

611
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:23,471
photography,
but what we do have our petroglyphs 

612
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:27,130
dating back to the end of last ice age 
where people were seeing this in the sky

613
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,530
and they were drawing it on the walls of
caves,

614
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:34,130
on the walls of rocks.
And actually globally.

615
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,420
Anthony per rod,
who's a los alamos plasma physicist.

616
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:43,080
He is the world's expert on this type of
high energy plasma physics.

617
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,940
These are some of the.
It'll go back.

618
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,380
Go back,
jamie.

619
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll look at this from all over the 
world looking at it exactly.

620
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,920
Amazing all over the world.
Arizona,

621
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:53,190
Italy,
it's all the same thing.

622
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,870
It's all the same thing in notice to 
that.

623
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,900
Spain see how they look like stick 
figures,

624
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,390
but they have little weird dots on their
sides.

625
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,640
Donuts,
real humans don't have that,

626
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,930
but they're seeing this around the world
in this guy and recording it.

627
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,820
Also the motif of when these take on 
search formed,

628
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,460
they take on what looked like birds' 
heads,

629
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,580
so the bird headed man.
A moTif that you see around the world 

630
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,571
going back and I believe it all goes 
back to the end of the last ice age and 

631
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:25,860
what people were experiencing,
what they were seeing,

632
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,740
if you will called gods in the sky or 
whatever,

633
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,030
but they were seeing this and it was 
having a real effect on their life.

634
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,700
What is causing that very specific 
pattern,

635
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,440
that very specific shape that you're 
seeing?

636
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,510
The way,
the way I would say,

637
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,480
the best way to say it is you've got 
this,

638
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,680
this is simplistic,
but you've got these huge electrical 

639
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,421
charges coming down.
they sort of focus like a tornado 

640
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:51,600
focuses,
or if you think of,

641
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,640
um,
running water out of a spicket,

642
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,730
if you play with it,
you can sort of squeeze it and make it 

643
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:58,730
form different shapes.

644
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,760
That served my analogy to it.
Um,

645
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,730
and it's the magnetic and electric 
fields interacting with each other.

646
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:08,010
Sometimes they serve spin around each 
other,

647
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:13,011
like a rope.
In that illustration here you see a how 

648
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:16,691
to say his name,
perrott parent dr plots experiments 

649
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:18,480
where he essentially reproduce that,
that shape over and over and over again.

650
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,680
That's right.
Exactly.

651
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,070
Reproduce that.
And then it gets even more fascinating.

652
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:25,860
And this is something that ties in well 
actually with katie,

653
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,100
my wife catherine ulysse,
um,

654
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,950
and imparato team has confirmed it on 
easter island.

655
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:36,951
You have the rango rango script,
which also duplicates this and seems to 

656
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,420
Be a reCord.
You know,

657
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,780
the modern rango rango are only a few 
hundred yearS old,

658
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:45,270
but just like any manuscript or 
anything,

659
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:48,870
it was copied over and over and seems to
go back to it too.

660
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,230
And if you look at some of the rango 
rango and I know a lot of your audience 

661
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,250
can't see this,
but you look at some of them,

662
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,380
they're even more definitive.

663
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,700
Look,
you know,

664
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,940
uh,
showing what [inaudible] was able to 

665
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,210
reproduce experimentally.
Um,

666
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,220
and they're,
they have it recorded from ancient 

667
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,611
timeS.
So when you're talking about this event 

668
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:14,790
that happened at the end of the younger 
dryas,

669
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,070
you what?
Like put it in perspective,

670
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:21,090
like are we talking about like a 
hurricane times a thousand?

671
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,060
Like what would this be like a million?
Yeah,

672
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,220
like huge thunderstorm.
Yeah.

673
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,550
I mean literally possible to comprehend 
and possible to comprehend from our 

674
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:31,740
point of view,
my perspective,

675
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,470
our perspective.
And there's more to it than that.

676
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,920
You would have incredible radiation 
levels at the surface of the earth.

677
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,910
Paula violetta physicist I know and he's
published on this,

678
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,910
has talked about how during an event 
like this,

679
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,930
you would have levels of radiation that 
were so high that large mammals,

680
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,630
we are large mammals,
large mammals.

681
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,610
If they couldn't protect themselves,
they could die within,

682
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,960
you know,
three to six,

683
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,970
seven days a week or so.

684
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,790
How do you protect yourself?
You go underground,

685
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:08,791
you go Into caves,
you go into places because rock will 

686
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,350
protect you from the surface radiation 
under the circumstances.

687
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,690
Now you don't need to stay there 
forever.

688
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,560
You can,
you know,

689
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,900
because these solar events probably 
came.

690
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,190
Now this is hypothetical because we've 
not experienced a huge one like this,

691
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,460
but they probably came.
Um,

692
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:29,470
and then it went back off a little bit,
but then maybe another one would come 

693
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:29,470
again,
I'm a geologiSt,

694
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:34,471
so think of a huge earthquake and then 
aftershocks after shocks that can 

695
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,450
actually last centuries or millennia in 
some cases,

696
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:42,670
smaller ones.
So something that was happening and you 

697
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,070
see this around the world too,
is that we're people survived,

698
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,810
I believe in part because they had 
access to natural caves initially.

699
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:55,110
Then they built underground structures 
for when they came again and it also 

700
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,670
encouraged our,
uh,

701
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,650
developed this whole tradition,
shall we say,

702
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:04,360
of having a place to go,
even if it's not occurring to the moment

703
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,050
they knew that these things do occur,
um,

704
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:09,880
at least for some thousands of years.

705
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And we're aware of this.
So we're getting prepared and now gi 

706
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,961
would uses during the cold war here.
What did a lot of people build in their 

707
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:18,790
backyards?
Bonders bonkers.

708
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,420
So they were doing this also.
So you get areas here.

709
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,420
I see there's a slight of India up at 
the moment.

710
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,660
Kappa dosha region is very well known 
for those get underground.

711
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,180
How do they know to get into initially?
I think initially,

712
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,690
I mean you've got literally fire coming 
down from the sky.

713
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,900
Think of the lightening bolts fire.
I mean if you've got a cave there,

714
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:44,901
you go into it.
It's the only thing that is going to 

715
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:44,901
protect it.
Protect these houses are useless.

716
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:50,390
All that burns.
I mean you've got literally fire coming 

717
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,721
down.
Think of his fire lightning that is 

718
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,120
going to set things on fire and you're 
entirely incinerate that.

719
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,260
Just lightening everywhere.
Almost like rainfall.

720
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,280
Yes,
yes,

721
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:00,870
yes.
In certain areas,

722
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,110
and that's why you have huge sheets of 
glass in some cases.

723
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:05,230
Wow.
So that's.

724
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,700
Wow.
Yeah,

725
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,590
and so you're incinerating everything 
where it hits ice,

726
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,430
it's flash pricing.
It is hitting water.

727
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,150
It's vape to this massive flooding,
so it's causing massive flooding.

728
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,790
It's dumping all the ice ultimately into
the oceans,

729
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:26,791
which is causing rising sea levels,
but more importantly it's causing 

730
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:29,040
massive precipitation,
massive flash floods and loss.

731
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,080
Are we talking about?
Incredible.

732
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,140
I think incredible because for instance,
we had can document linguistically,

733
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:39,590
and this is other people's work,
but I think it ties right in.

734
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:43,190
They haven't been explained it cogently 
otherwise that there is.

735
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,040
For instance,
in Turkey,

736
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,070
middle east,
there is a constriction of the 

737
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,850
population to the anatolia region,
kappa dosha,

738
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:55,550
where you have these underground 
shelters,

739
00:41:55,551 --> 00:42:00,551
you have a geology that was easy to go 
into and escape and linguistically we 

740
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:07,631
can map back into european languages to 
a small pocket that survived there at 

741
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:10,010
the end of the last ice age.

742
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,840
Wow.
So you know,

743
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:14,390
I think there was a massive around the 
world,

744
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:19,391
you would've had populations being 
constricted and then they spread out 

745
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:20,480
again and when they were constricted,
there's.

746
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,790
I see the slight there for the 
linguistic data,

747
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,120
when you constrict down in one area,
of course you lose a lot of the 

748
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,771
technology.
You lose a lot of the high culture if 

749
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:35,240
you go back to a much more primitive 
stage,

750
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,370
and that's what we find.
So we find,

751
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,350
for instance,
in anatolia,

752
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,410
a western Turkey,
no near asia as it was called in ancient

753
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:49,871
times,
you find not only of course you go 

754
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:53,420
things like comE back lay tappy,
which goes back before this huge 

755
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,460
catastrophe with the monumental stone 
mega list,

756
00:42:56,461 --> 00:43:01,461
et cetera.
But what you find there are 2000 years 

757
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:03,560
later in the same general area,
you find friends since childhood,

758
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,760
which is a bunch of mud brick houses all
clustered together.

759
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,680
Uh,
it's gone down.

760
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:14,681
It's gone into what I call an acadian.
I call sit at this solar induced dark 

761
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:20,330
age where they lost a lot of it,
not unlike an analogy,

762
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,880
I think it's easy for people understand 
analogies,

763
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,210
the end of the roman empire and 
everything that was lost there and then 

764
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,310
go into a much more primitive state,
um,

765
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,920
with the dark ages to the european dark 
ages.

766
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,350
In this case,
uh,

767
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,900
you look at the,
um,

768
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:42,730
technology.
It was much higher during the roman 

769
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,350
empire until maybe 1000 or 1200 a d 
again,

770
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:48,170
in many realms.
Same thing here,

771
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,630
although this was such a mighty 
throwback,

772
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:55,631
it took thousands of years for people to
reemerge and at least start to get up to

773
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,810
the status now.
And they had been before,

774
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:04,010
presented this in front of other 
scholars.

775
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,810
Yes.
Yes.

776
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,200
It's getting at.
Well,

777
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,970
there's a lot of resistance.
Look,

778
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,680
I'm an academic.
I,

779
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,760
I don't want to sound the wrong way.
I'm not looking for sympathy,

780
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:19,030
but going out on limbs like this going 
just beginning with the reading of the 

781
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,860
sphinx and that's what we,
we didn't even finish with that yet,

782
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,610
but that's okay.
We'll get back to that.

783
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,590
Got plenty of time.
Yeah.

784
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Um,
there's a lot of resistance to anything 

785
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,440
that's new.
Any new concepts,

786
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,790
new ideas,

787
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,110
textbooks have been rich and people I've
stayed.

788
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,680
Stayed robin given out.

789
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,240
Yeah,
pay a.

790
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,590
They've staked their reputation on it 
and I understand that and I try not to 

791
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:46,220
be that myself,
you know,

792
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,020
the old.
This is my pet theory,

793
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:53,290
but I do try and look at the evidence.
I think that slowly we're building up 

794
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,240
more and more interest more and more,
um,

795
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,890
at least people looking at objectively 
and uh,

796
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,890
I do see changes occurring.
Uh,

797
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:08,891
one thing I'll mention right now is,
as of relatively recently,

798
00:45:09,681 --> 00:45:11,570
knots are still very,
very small,

799
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,520
but at boston university I've been 
allowed to found what is called the iso,

800
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:21,521
see the institute for the study of the 
origins of civiliZation,

801
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,920
which is really just me at the moment,
but I want to build it up and I'd like 

802
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,410
To get,
I'm not trying to sound the wrong way,

803
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:29,540
but I'd like to get people to donate to 
it,

804
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,500
etc.
ETc.

805
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,120
I'm also,
I've,

806
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,020
uh,
found it with some colleagues of mine,

807
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:41,350
uh,
including some academic colleagues or 

808
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:41,350
cool,
which stands for the organization,

809
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,941
for the research of ancient cultures.
So we're bringing into the mainstream 

810
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:50,120
both as a private,
not for profit foundation as a institute

811
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:54,290
through boston university to really be 
looking at these things in a,

812
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,830
when I say professional way,
what I mean by that is,

813
00:45:57,831 --> 00:46:00,530
you know,
evidenced based way,

814
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,760
um,
but also looking outside the standard 

815
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,220
dog must have standard boxes,
standard paradigms and the standard 

816
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,040
vested interest because so much science.
Now people say to me all the time,

817
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,660
they think science is supposed to be 
objective.

818
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,190
Well,
maybe it Is supposed to be objective,

819
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:21,191
but who are the scientists doing it?
They have all their subjective biases 

820
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:25,040
and notions and vested interest.
I'm not trying to knock anyone but,

821
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,090
but it's a fact.
It is in.

822
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,940
It's just a human fact.
Yeah.

823
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,150
Are,
we're all humans.

824
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,210
And one of the things that happened in 
that documentary from 1993 that I was 

825
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,381
kind of stunned by was the reaction by 
the conventional egyptologists when you 

826
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:42,270
brought up this evidence where he was 
very dismissive,

827
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:45,360
almost mockingly in this weird sort of a
way where he was like,

828
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,950
what,
what,

829
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,160
what culture?
Where's this?

830
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,680
Where's the evidence in this culture?
Absolutely.

831
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,720
And it's kind of gross.
It is.

832
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:56,721
It is.
Because that really should not have any 

833
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:58,830
place in his mind.
He was in pain and being called.

834
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,350
I've been called a pseudo scientists.
Um,

835
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,090
look,
I,

836
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,350
I,
again,

837
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:09,351
I don't want to sound the wrong way,
but I think I'm as well as well 

838
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:09,820
credentialed as anyone.
I mean,

839
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,630
among my academic colleagues,
uh,

840
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,870
you know,
well that's why I appreciate you that 

841
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,301
you have stuck your neck out for so long
doing this research and since that time 

842
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,320
have I been punished?
Yes.

843
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,610
Yeah,
I'm sure.

844
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah.
Let's.

845
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,520
No,
I'll be honest.

846
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:28,610
You know,
I haven't gotten necessarily the,

847
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:29,950
I've

848
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,290
had colleagues say to me in no uncertain
terms very well,

849
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:40,291
meaning that I could have had a 
wonderful career and had all of the 

850
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:44,491
promotions,
advancements going up through the 

851
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:44,491
academic,
you know,

852
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:48,730
ladder if you would,
with no problems if I just stuck to my,

853
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,160
you know,
some little specialty that no one really

854
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,320
cared about.
Hm.

855
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,260
You know,
I'm.

856
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,770
But you've had an impact,
a gigantic impact on people like me that

857
00:47:57,771 --> 00:47:59,210
have a really about,
about

858
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,980
continue to work on.
For instance,

859
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,130
one of my specialties as a graduate 
student was paleocene esc in malmo 

860
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,960
evolution.
Would I be talking to you about that

861
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,340
now?
Maybe if it's a,

862
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,520
if it was interesting,
but less likely,

863
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,690
less likely from seeing your skeletons 
and whatnot and skulls.

864
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,980
I might be.
He might be.

865
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,830
Now.
When you were doing that,

866
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,840
you were talking to that guy.
One of the things that he was saying in 

867
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:25,840
this dismissive ways,
where's the evidence of this culture?

868
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,060
Well now we have go beckley tell.
Absolutely because is the evidence 

869
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,400
because that

870
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,660
that was an american association for 
advancement of science debate on the 

871
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:41,771
sphinx,
which turned out I thought I was going 

872
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:45,031
in for a real debate.
I thought it was going to be a great 

873
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:48,421
debate.
We're really going to discuss the 

874
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:48,421
evidence back and forth.
I brought all my data,

875
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,200
the seismic data,
which is very,

876
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:52,690
very important,
which we haven't even touched on yet.

877
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,750
Other types of data we haven't touched 
on because I want to make the point is 

878
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,171
much more than a little bit of 
weathering on the sphinx and I've heard 

879
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,290
so many critics,
even to my face,

880
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:02,770
they say,
well,

881
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,640
you don't redate civilization based on a
weathering profile.

882
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,670
No,
I've goT lots more than weathering 

883
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:11,670
profile.
The weathering profile and erosion.

884
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,520
the easiest thing to explain and yes,
it's what I saw initially in that first 

885
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:21,841
30 to 120 seconds because that's before 
I brought in equipment and work with tom

886
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:27,901
to becky to do seismic work,
to do other types of more detailed 

887
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:27,901
analysis.

888
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:31,000
I would not be talking to you today if 
it was just a national profile.

889
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,340
I for my own self,
I wouldn't put enough stock in that yet,

890
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:39,250
but when it ties in with everything 
else,

891
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:41,360
we have a coach and picture.
Um,

892
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,990
but getting back to someone being 
dismissive like that,

893
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:49,110
that was 1992.
The beckley tap bay had technically been

894
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:53,920
discovered back in the 19 sixties,
but they misdated it completely.

895
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:58,921
They thought was maybe a thousand or 
2000 years old byzantine or roman greco 

896
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:02,920
roman period,
not end of the last ice age,

897
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:03,880
not,
you know,

898
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,500
12,000
years old.

899
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,700
And how did they make the distinction 
that it was 12,000

900
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:10,190
years old is based on the soil samples.
That

901
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,730
was,
that was klaus schmidt.

902
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,990
Klaus schmidt went back to it in about 
1994 95.

903
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:20,280
So a couple of years after that.
Dismissive comment from the egyptologist

904
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:25,281
mark laner,
who I think is the specific person 

905
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:28,431
you're referring to at the american 
association for the advancement of 

906
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:30,740
science debate,
which I just went to make the comment.

907
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,380
I went into that thinking that was going
to be a debate.

908
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,740
I came out of it realizing that they 
were just trying to set me up to put me 

909
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,670
down and shut me up forever,
which they were not successful in doing.

910
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Do you think that they're so reluctant 
to just listen to the evidence and look 

911
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,230
at the information and,
and,

912
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:53,231
and consider the possibility that maybe 
there had been an ancient civilization 

913
00:50:53,231 --> 00:50:56,810
because it upsets the standard timeline,
the standard standard story.

914
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,410
And it also upsets a lot of people's 
concept of progression.

915
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
And uh,
this is something John Anthony West like

916
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,470
to talk about the whole,
he called it the church of progress.

917
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,780
That we've gotten better and better and 
better.

918
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,960
And I talked to so many people that 
think that we are the end all and be all

919
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,370
were the best that there ever has been.
Well,

920
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:21,371
maybe we are in terms of certain types 
of technology and I'm not making any 

921
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:26,741
claim that people in the past could ever
do what we're doing now doing a podcast 

922
00:51:26,741 --> 00:51:28,610
with all the electronics,
but as I pointed out,

923
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,490
that also makes us really vulnerable to 
things.

924
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,790
But I would argue that there is a not so
remote possibility that they knew things

925
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:44,501
that we don't know,
that they may have understood things 

926
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,950
that we don't understand.
They may have had a worldview that would

927
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:49,550
benefit us to at least have a feel for 
it.

928
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,810
Um,
I mean,

929
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,390
I don't want golf on spiritual tangents.
I could,

930
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,850
if I want to,
our philosophical tangent,

931
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,240
but I also have a training as 
anthropologists.

932
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,720
Anthropologists,
I have an undergraduate degree in 

933
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,661
anthropology on top of everything else.
and I'm fascinated by human approaches 

934
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,630
to life and the environment and their 
situation.

935
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:16,990
And I'm convinced that we do have thingS
to learn from the ancients,

936
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:23,710
whether it's the really remote ancients 
or the more recent ancients for only 

937
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,280
5,000
years ago,

938
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,700
even dynastic Egypt.
Um,

939
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:32,770
and that it's not all simply a one way 
progress that there are fits and starts 

940
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:36,770
that there have been high points and low
points and high points again,

941
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,980
and I'm not frankly convinced that we're
at the highest point when it comes to 

942
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,761
certain aspects.
We might be a high point with certain 

943
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:49,121
types of technology,
but I'm not convinced that we're at a 

944
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:49,580
high point when it comes to,
um,

945
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:51,970
stone construction.

946
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,140
Whoa.
Certainly not with stone construction.

947
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,430
So there are types of technology.
We are not high point with much less gay

948
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:02,030
into this philosophical or spiritual or 
whatever you want to call it.

949
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,060
And we don't think of it as technology 
because we think of technology as being 

950
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,060
something that's electronic.
That's right.

951
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,681
That's right.
And there are other technologies and if 

952
00:53:11,681 --> 00:53:11,690
you asked me how did they build the 
pyramids,

953
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,840
I will tell you,
I don't know if you asked me how they 

954
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,841
constructed the sphinx temple.
They carved out those huge blocks of 

955
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:23,771
stone that can waive 50 or more tons and
move them in such tight spaces with such

956
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,400
tight tolerances.
I don't know.

957
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,190
I mean,
I'm not going to.

958
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,240
No one really knows,
no one really knows and some paints 

959
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,240
people say,
you know,

960
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,560
you bring in thousands of slaves or 
whatnot.

961
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,360
Well,
there's no evidence for that.

962
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,330
And where would you have them stand when
you're building the sphinx temple?

963
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,870
You know,
there's not enough room to gather.

964
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,900
Round stones are so big.
Even thousands of slaves struggled to 

965
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:46,900
move them.
It's not like something like that.

966
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,940
Yeah.
Just get a couple of buddies.

967
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:49,230
We're going to move this couch.
Yeah,

968
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,610
yeah.
We're not talking about that.

969
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,150
No,
no,

970
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:51,720
no.
And yeah,

971
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:55,230
you can try to hypothesize levers and 
that type of thing,

972
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,650
but it's.
This has been said before and I've seen 

973
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,180
it questioned there in person,
but I've seen off the record document,

974
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,710
you know,
footage of it when they've tried to just

975
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,820
construct a little pyramid with very 
small blocks and then they end up using 

976
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:15,420
modern machines and they still weren't 
very successful.

977
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,050
I mean,
so they knew they knew a lot.

978
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:24,230
So there's a real resistance,
I find among allow my academic 

979
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,281
colleagues to one to even suggest that 
people could have known things in the 

980
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:32,421
past that we don't know now,
or If they knew something in the past 

981
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:36,051
that we don't know now,
it was so trivial that it was worth 

982
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:36,051
forgetting.

983
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:38,460
Worth not worrying about all should.
There's this,

984
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,580
that concept.
I find it amazing and I hate to be 

985
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,480
stereotypical,
some broad brushing,

986
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:50,481
but many egyptologists when I read their
works or I listened to them at 

987
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:52,320
conferences,
etc.

988
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:57,770
And I get the impression that they might
love egyptology and studying the ancient

989
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:02,070
egyptians,
but they also have this view that,

990
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,100
oh,
these guys made wonderful temples and 

991
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,100
had some fantastic art,
but really,

992
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,871
you know,
they're sort of primitive and 

993
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,210
[inaudible] isn't that silly?
And you see what I mean.

994
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,410
It's like the very thing they station.
Yeah.

995
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,510
The very thing they study,
they put down in a sense to Build 

996
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:23,030
themselves up and to build up this idea 
of ultimate progress that we Can.

997
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,750
Exactly.
Exactly,

998
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:27,960
exactly.
Then you also have in Egypt tall g,

999
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,640
and I wouldn't give you another example 
of this,

1000
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:34,641
not just me bringing in scientific 
evidence and data and the egyptologists 

1001
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:39,171
rejecting it,
but just recently in the last couple of 

1002
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:43,220
years,
have you heard about the project on the 

1003
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:43,220
great pyramid,
the big void,

1004
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,780
they've been using mammography,
which is a highly sophisticated 

1005
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,420
technique using muon set come from outer
space or come from the atmosphere.

1006
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,420
They go through the pyramid.
You can set up detectors longterm and 

1007
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,050
pick these up.
They're sort of like x,

1008
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,650
think of x rays technology,
but using muons,

1009
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,200
uh,
which are sort of exotic particle that 

1010
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,220
most people are not aware of because 
they just pass right through us without 

1011
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,940
interacting.
But when you've got massive stone,

1012
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,300
massive stone will block some of them so
you can pick up essentially image over a

1013
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,410
long period of time.
So this is really high tech physics,

1014
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:27,470
very expensive.
A consortium of physicists did work on 

1015
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,170
the great pyramid.
I think it's still ongoing,

1016
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,130
but they put up,
you know,

1017
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,170
tens of millions if not more worth of a 
high,

1018
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,560
you know,
sophisticate physical physics equipment,

1019
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,890
gathered all this data.
I've seen the raw data.

1020
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,220
I have a degree in geophysics,
geology and geophysics.

1021
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:48,430
I have some aBility to evaluate this 
type of data,

1022
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,580
whereas I hate to say aloud the 
egyptologist don't.

1023
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,010
Um,
and I found that with my own data when I

1024
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:59,011
shared my own data that not to be nasty,
but they didn't know what they were 

1025
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:03,181
looking at,
which is somewhat understandable since 

1026
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:03,181
it's not their training.
Right.

1027
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:07,230
So you have with the great pyramid,
just recently in the last couple of 

1028
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:11,760
years,
published in nature of very prestigious 

1029
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,960
journal,
they found what they believe is evidence

1030
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:18,961
for a huge void above the grand gallery 
that has never been known before.

1031
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,090
Um,
and yeah,

1032
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:27,091
there we have a picture of it.
The egyptologist had been so resistant 

1033
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:29,950
to this saying,
this is nonsense.

1034
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,330
There can't be,
we don't.

1035
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,360
Basically we,
there can't be anything new that we 

1036
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360
don't know about are.
If it is,

1037
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,360
it's just trivial.
It's just some space between the rocks.

1038
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:43,030
it's nothing important,
but what I wanted to say,

1039
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,050
what's really important,
some egyptologists actually called for 

1040
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:52,291
the whole project to be closed down 
because they don't like the results and 

1041
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:56,380
they called it quote propaganda because 
down,

1042
00:57:56,381 --> 00:58:00,490
but you'll cut that closed down the 
whole scientific project.

1043
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:02,380
They don't.
Not only do they not want to look at the

1044
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:07,381
data,
they'll want more data collected that 

1045
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:07,381
might contradict their standard.

1046
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:11,980
That's fascinating that someone would 
actually call for them because this 

1047
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:11,980
isn't even their study of their field of
study.

1048
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,300
Right,
so you're dealing with physical evidence

1049
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,600
that they're saying is nonsense,
but this is not something they study in 

1050
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,051
the first place.
So there's this void that we're looking 

1051
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,841
at here in these images.
Can you explain to people that are just 

1052
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:25,841
listening what we're seeing?

1053
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:29,820
Oh,
what you're seeing is they call it a 

1054
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:29,820
hidden chamber there,
but you can see how it's parallel to the

1055
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,970
grand gallery.
The grand galleries is huge gallery that

1056
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:36,030
goes up to the king's chamber and the 
great pyramid

1057
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,060
and that's deep in the pyramid.
The pyramid in chambers above bobbitt

1058
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,930
parallel shit is maybe close to the same
size of it.

1059
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:47,660
It's hard to tell with until it gets 
prob,

1060
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,690
you know,
you'd have to dro into it and maybe put 

1061
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:52,700
a camera in.
But I've seen the raw data.

1062
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:57,701
My point is I've seen the raw data.
I certainly think it's important they're

1063
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,060
interpreting it correctly now.
The proof will be in the pudding as they

1064
00:59:02,061 --> 00:59:05,600
say if they ever entered or at least put
a probe into it,

1065
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,930
but my point right now is to just 
dismiss the data is nonsense to call for

1066
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:16,361
the whole project to be shut down is non
client project and some of the Egypt 

1067
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,890
Egypt in Egypt.
Tologist.

1068
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:22,070
I'm close close to the ministry and my 
point

1069
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,380
is they've done the same thing to me.
So for instance,

1070
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:29,381
when we did seismic work and we found 
the chamber under the left pog this 

1071
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:30,140
sphinx,
that's never been explored since,

1072
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,470
at least not to my knowledge.
And they just dismiss it and say,

1073
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:36,350
we know there's nothing there.
Um,

1074
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,440
and that was despite the fact that we 
also found the chamber at the rump of 

1075
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,810
the sphinx,
which I didn't know about the time,

1076
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:46,811
but they already knew about.
So it confirmed that our data was good 

1077
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:47,930
because we were finding something they 
knew about,

1078
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:53,260
but when we find something that they 
don't know about and they don't want to 

1079
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,970
be there,
they dismiss it and don't want to pursue

1080
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,971
it further.
Do you have explored one of those 

1081
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:00,971
chambers?
Correct.

1082
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:00,971
Instead they explore the one that's in 
the rump.

1083
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:01,790
The one in the rump?
Yes.

1084
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:04,220
The one in the rump by it turns out they
already knew about it.

1085
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,340
It's probably not super significant.
It probably is just maybe a greco roman 

1086
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:11,360
or late period,
you know,

1087
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,960
burial or,
or some kind of excavation.

1088
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,310
The one I believe is important is under 
the left palm,

1089
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,320
the sphinx,
which I believe is a archive actually 

1090
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,641
may go back to this very early period 
because we now have hieroglyphic 

1091
01:00:27,641 --> 01:00:31,570
evidence indicating that what,
what is the evidence indicates it's an 

1092
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:31,570
archive.
Okay.

1093
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,340
So recently,
and this gets back to,

1094
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:35,510
um,
the sphinx?

1095
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,480
yes.
Okay.

1096
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:41,360
So we started this portion of the 
discussion with the sphinx in my initial

1097
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:46,361
observations of the spanx and one of my 
observations was that there's something 

1098
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:50,450
going on with the weathering and erosion
on the sphinx.

1099
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:55,750
The second observation,
this is within the first two minutes at 

1100
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,591
most,
was that the head is too small for the 

1101
01:00:59,591 --> 01:01:02,231
body.
The head is not eroded the way the core 

1102
01:01:02,231 --> 01:01:02,231
body is.

1103
01:01:02,231 --> 01:01:06,920
It's not erode the way the walls at the 
sphinx enclosure or it's not the 

1104
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,400
original head.
I hate to say it this way,

1105
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,430
but I knew immediately that was not the 
original head,

1106
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,660
just from a geological point of view and
I believe that's now since been fully 

1107
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,750
confirmed,
that this is not the original head.

1108
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:25,460
It wAs a recurved head.
So for a long time the question has been

1109
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,690
in my mind,
and we talk about this event,

1110
01:01:27,691 --> 01:01:32,691
I'm mystery of the sphinx.
What was the original head of the 

1111
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:32,691
sphinx?
What was the sphinx?

1112
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:37,211
Originally?
We've speculated and other people 

1113
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:37,430
speculate.
My have been a lion,

1114
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,930
for instance,
leo,

1115
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:43,490
because it faces on the equinox,
the constellation,

1116
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:47,660
leo in the sky.
Not today,

1117
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,660
but 10,000
bc or so,

1118
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,660
more or less at the very end of the last
ice age.

1119
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,580
Now I've had a lot of colleagues of 
mine,

1120
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,550
academic colleagues say that's nonsense.
You know,

1121
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:03,551
it doesn't mean anything because they 
weren't even recognizing the 

1122
01:02:03,551 --> 01:02:03,990
constellations back then.
Um,

1123
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,360
we now have plenty of evidence,
at least some of the constellations that

1124
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:11,150
we recognize today.
A leo,

1125
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:15,800
I would put in that category.
A tourist is in that category.

1126
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:18,140
Uh,
ryan is in that core category.

1127
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,220
Some of them,
we don't have evidence

1128
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,750
for it,
but the ones I just mentioned,

1129
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,920
the,
the,

1130
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,060
um,
they,

1131
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,190
these are constellations that go back 
well into the end of the last ice age.

1132
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:34,191
We have documents of that.
We have mammoth bones where you have a 

1133
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,450
ryan carved on it.
We have tourists shown in cave walls.

1134
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,060
We have leo shown.
So it's to me,

1135
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:43,200
it's fascinating that some of these 
constellations that we recognize today,

1136
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,170
we're recognized tens of thousands of 
years ago.

1137
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:51,171
So to me it's not nonsense that they 
carved a structure 10,000

1138
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,590
bc approximately that was facing its own
image in the sky.

1139
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,110
So one suggestion was that maybe it's 
leo,

1140
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,370
but recently manu safe today,
dr.

1141
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,430
Mondo saves a day and another colleague 
of mine,

1142
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,630
he recognized initially that there is a 
title,

1143
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:14,631
what's known as a dual title in dynastic
Egypt that goes back to the fourth 

1144
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:21,861
dynasty and even back to the first 
dynasty with the earliest writing and it

1145
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,860
when properly translate,
it basically refers to the sphinx as the

1146
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:33,651
guardian up an archive and not the 
sphinx is we think of it as a lion with 

1147
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:36,930
a human head,
but as a lioness.

1148
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:42,530
And there was a name for this line,
this method she was the goddess met hit 

1149
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,330
who guarded archive.
Um,

1150
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,570
and we wrote a paper on that.
When I say we,

1151
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,600
my new safe day,
myself and robert duvall,

1152
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:54,570
who you may know us from a ryan 
correlation,

1153
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,210
some of his,
his work ties in with this,

1154
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,600
the rko astronomy.
But we've now found that there is this 

1155
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,490
sign,
which we named the jaw signed and honor.

1156
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,100
That's awesome.
Under John Anthony West.

1157
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,480
Uh,
there it is.

1158
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:12,210
There's the jaw sign and what you see 
here,

1159
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,890
it's a lioness met hit,
which was the sphinx originally based on

1160
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:21,891
our reconstruction and interpretation 
and can't go into all the details.

1161
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:24,600
Now you can actually.
People can read the paper.

1162
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,840
If I could put a plug in.
If people go to my website,

1163
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:32,870
www dot robert schoch and that's r o b e
r t r o b e r t s c h o c h.

1164
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,670
The main thing is my name is spelled s c
h o c h,

1165
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,500
so www dot robert [inaudible] dot com.
They can go.

1166
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:48,620
I did a popular summary of the paper and
they can also go and download the 

1167
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:53,541
original paper and the peer reviewed 
journal archeological discovery where we

1168
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:58,470
argue that what we have here is that 
line has met him.

1169
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,250
She has what looks like a bent rod 
coming out of her back.

1170
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,480
Then people look at the actual image and
then aBove it is a aCts.

1171
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,760
So yeah,
it's,

1172
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:13,740
it's a primitive acts.
Um,

1173
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:18,770
when I say primitive,
even for the ancient egyptians in 

1174
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:22,050
dynastic Egypt,
that would have been sort of a symbolIc 

1175
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,631
acts if you would,
which was a sign of someone who was in 

1176
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:29,290
charge of things you oversee or that 
type of thing that bent rod.

1177
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,660
What is that?
That's a primitive key.

1178
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,720
We would now call the primitive key,
but it represents a key and so it's 

1179
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,780
basically saying that this is the 
guardian of the archives have met,

1180
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:45,781
hit the locked chamber or vault of 
method and we also have images.

1181
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:50,080
I see it up on the board now.
If you look at,

1182
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:55,170
you've got the linus with the key and 
you also have a line not in that image 

1183
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:59,650
by different image that we had before.
If you look at that,

1184
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:04,651
can you see how there's a linus a 
diagrammatic shape over what looks like 

1185
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,140
a facade.
Okay.

1186
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:16,141
If you then go to the stella that sits 
between the paws of this finks,

1187
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,480
you have the same image,
much more artistically rendered of the 

1188
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,820
sphinx sitting over a facade over what 
looks like a building.

1189
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,030
It's not really a building.
It's the archive underneath.

1190
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:36,031
I believe,
which I know there's something 

1191
01:06:36,031 --> 01:06:38,410
underneath because long ago in the early
19 nineties,

1192
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:43,411
thomas to becky and I,
when we did seismic work around the 

1193
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:46,861
sphinx,
we found the chamber under the paws of 

1194
01:06:46,861 --> 01:06:49,690
the sphinx and it's I'm sure an 
artificial chamber.

1195
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,840
It's very regular and this I believe 
could well be.

1196
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:59,860
I'm hypothesizing and in science we make
hypothesis that are testable.

1197
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:03,460
This is perfectly testable.
All we have to do is enter that chamber.

1198
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:08,580
Even if it's just to put fiber optic 
down and we can see is it an artificial 

1199
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:14,041
chamber that's an archive.
Hopefully there's still things there or 

1200
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,790
maybe it was gutted and cleaned out at 
some point,

1201
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:21,060
but here we have the seismic work.
One of the seismic maps,

1202
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:26,251
I'll call it to a data and what's label 
is normally a under the left paw that is

1203
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:34,921
the chamber we found under the left paw 
that the egyptologists have to deny ever

1204
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:38,680
since and they don't want to explore it 
and we haven't gotten permission.

1205
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,950
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Well,

1206
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,890
I know,
but this is.

1207
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,910
If there's physical evidence,
this is politics in Egypt.

1208
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,110
God,
it's so squirrely.

1209
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1210
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,350
So now,
okay,

1211
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:54,520
this is 1991 or so early.
Nineteen nineties.

1212
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,850
As of last year,
2017.

1213
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
We have textual evidence,
ancient hieroglyphs talking about this 

1214
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,621
chamber,
talking about this finks talking about 

1215
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:08,740
the sphinx being alignness guardian,
a chamber,

1216
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,920
and I want to point out that the 
earliest hieroglyphs that we have that 

1217
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,311
refer to this are about 30 3030 100 bc,
which is hundreds of years before the 

1218
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:23,651
egyptologists claim.
The sphinx was even thought about being 

1219
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:24,550
carved,
which is somewhere around 2,500

1220
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:25,030
bc.
One,

1221
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,510
500 bc back sides with the construction.
The great pyramid of giza.

1222
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,950
Okay,
well that's another question.

1223
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:36,010
Oh,
so we'll come back to that because I 

1224
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:36,010
don't buy the.
It's more.

1225
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:36,540
Can we come back?
Yes,

1226
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:37,010
yes,
yes.

1227
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:41,690
So the age of tall just claimed that the
sphinx was first car of 2,500

1228
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:44,570
bc.
Yet there's no mention of the carving of

1229
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:47,260
the sphinx.
Then they cite the inventory,

1230
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,420
not inventory stella.

1231
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:52,220
That's another step.
They cite the top most of fourth dream.

1232
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:55,040
Stella,
which is a thousand plus years later,

1233
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:59,350
which had one point,
a partial cartoon of kafra,

1234
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,140
partial cartouche of coffer,
which has since flaked away,

1235
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:08,170
was there reputedly in the 19th century.
There were drawings of it,

1236
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,890
um,
which we to put in our plugin,

1237
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:15,140
just if people are interested in gaining
more information.

1238
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:20,410
Robert duvall and I wrote a book last 
year published last year called origins 

1239
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:24,371
of the sphinx,
where we discuss a lot of this but met 

1240
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:25,430
hit is a more recent discovery.
Um,

1241
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,070
so there was a partial cartouche of 
kafra,

1242
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,150
which egyptologists said,
aha,

1243
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,520
this proves that kafra carved the sphinx
because the sphinx,

1244
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:39,140
it's due east of crawford pyramid coffer
was the pharaoh and 2,500

1245
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:42,380
bc.
Therefore the Sphinx must be 2,500

1246
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,960
bc.
I contend,

1247
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,120
and robert duvall and other people who 
are in our line of thinking content that

1248
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:53,240
this stella that's over a thousand 
thousands,

1249
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,480
sorry,
over a thousand years later,

1250
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,000
does not say that it carved.

1251
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:04,390
He carved the sphinx,
but that he restored the sphinx just 

1252
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,640
like most moses,
the fourth who was putting up the stella

1253
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,420
was restoring the sphinx.
And when you look at the sphinx,

1254
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,600
it has been restored numerous times,
including blocks of limestone that were 

1255
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:22,601
put onto it to restore some of the very 
ancient weathering that when I asked sy 

1256
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,550
hawala,
while my biggest critics,

1257
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,900
how old those blocks are,
he said they were fourth dynasty.

1258
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Now,
why would you restored in the fourth 

1259
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:35,500
dynasty when it had just been built,
you know,

1260
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,941
literally a century or two ago.
You don't need to restore a meter worth 

1261
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:40,090
of weathering.
Um,

1262
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,390
his,
his answer,

1263
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:46,391
and I'm not trying to make fun of him,
is that it's rotten rock that wasn't 

1264
01:10:46,391 --> 01:10:48,260
very high quality rocks was how somehow 
it just crumbled away,

1265
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:49,590
you know,
meter or so,

1266
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,500
a couple of hundred years.

1267
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,640
Graham hancock.
Yeah.

1268
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:54,880
But that's another issue.
I don't want get into that.

1269
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:55,760
Okay.
BeCause,

1270
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,820
uh,
let me just say it this way,

1271
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,430
there,
there's,

1272
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,730
there was not just science going on 
there,

1273
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:04,010
there was politics going on.
So,

1274
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,110
you know,
there's a lot going on.

1275
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,360
There's a lot going on.
Exactly.

1276
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:13,361
Exactly.
I've seen it too and I've known all 

1277
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:13,361
these people for a very frustrating 
decades.

1278
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:17,711
Yeah.
So I'm trying to keep just to the 

1279
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:19,851
science right now,
but so he himself admits that some of 

1280
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:24,570
these repairs go BaCk well over 4,000
years,

1281
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,640
which makes no sense if it's always 
4,500

1282
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,050
years old.
Exactly,

1283
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:36,080
exactly.
And they've always contended there was 

1284
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,481
no inscriptions or anything really 
referring to the sphinx until new 

1285
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:41,850
kingdom times.
We point out in origins at the sphinx,

1286
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:46,851
robert paval night that no,
you have to know what they were calling 

1287
01:11:46,851 --> 01:11:47,430
the banks.
And now with matt hit,

1288
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:48,750
we have inscriptions.

1289
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,120
They find that.
And when did they find this lioness.

1290
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:54,030
And when do they,
when you're saying this is very recent.

1291
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,610
Yeah,
manu saves the day.

1292
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,570
My coauthor just discovered that,
um,

1293
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,860
I don't know exactly when he found the 
inscription,

1294
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:10,250
uh,
but he first pointed it out to robert 

1295
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,060
duvall myself about a year ago,
a year ago,

1296
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:16,050
and we all worked on it and confirmed it
and put together the pieces.

1297
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:17,940
I mean,
he really gets the most credit for it.

1298
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,720
Um,
he's,

1299
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:24,010
he,
he knows his heart gliffy really where 

1300
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:24,740
they find this higher glyphic of this.
The,

1301
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,070
um,
it's shoWn in several different,

1302
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,290
uh,
uh,

1303
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,670
ancient artifacts.
So for instance,

1304
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:36,470
there is a statue of vca,
uh,

1305
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,560
from the fourth dynasty who may have 
actually overseeing the construction of 

1306
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,720
the great pyramid,
or I would say the reconstruction of the

1307
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,120
great pyramid because I might get back 
to that.

1308
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:53,150
I think the peer at great pyramid,
just like the sphinx was being 

1309
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,660
reconstructed refurbished,
if you would,

1310
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,840
during the old kingdom,
not constructed de novo,

1311
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,850
but he was overseeing that he must have 
had something to do with the sphinx.

1312
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,440
Um,
he was apparently the,

1313
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:09,460
um,
given the title of being the overseer 

1314
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,890
for the sphinx,
that type of thing,

1315
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,210
but it turns out this title was 
something he had in cuckoo's time,

1316
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,930
which is the,
the,

1317
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,500
the pharaoh before supposedly when the 
sinks is built to begin with.

1318
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:25,380
So that messes up the Egypt logical 
thinking right there.

1319
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:30,790
Um,
but this title was something that had 

1320
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:33,051
been held by others before him back down
to about 31 or so hundred bc,

1321
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,150
you know,
5,000

1322
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:36,930
years ago,
again,

1323
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:40,950
500 or more years before the swings was 
supposedly built.

1324
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:47,270
Uh,
so now we hAve this hieroglyphic text 

1325
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,920
that goes back refutes what the 
egyptologist are saying,

1326
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,040
and not only that,
but when you look at the way they wrIte 

1327
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,940
it,
this is the earliest writing,

1328
01:13:55,941 --> 01:13:59,250
so it's not surprising.
We don't have anything earlier.

1329
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:02,570
Maybe eventually we'll find earlier,
you know,

1330
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:06,090
the precursors,
but they are also in the context,

1331
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:11,210
it seems abundantly evident they're 
referring to it as a very old structure.

1332
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,130
Wow.
Now how do egyptologists receive this?

1333
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,300
Uh,
it's just making its way into the Egypt 

1334
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,180
logical community if we will see how 
they received.

1335
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:24,880
So far there's been no reaction.
No,

1336
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,350
no,
I'll just put it that way.

1337
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,720
No,
not that I know officially.

1338
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,300
Well,
you've seen it all before.

1339
01:14:30,301 --> 01:14:35,301
So I've seen it all before and you know,
it's a classic thing to that in some 

1340
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:36,540
cases.
So I'll,

1341
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:41,610
I'll put it related to the sphinx and 
maybe hopefully somewhat analogous.

1342
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:50,250
I pointed out decades should go and John
Anthony West and I working on this,

1343
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:55,601
that this finks the head is not the 
original head and I'm not sure if I'm 

1344
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:58,540
the very first one to ever say that I'm 
not going to try to take credit,

1345
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:01,720
but it was quite obvious to me when I,
as I mentioned,

1346
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:06,900
without anyone saying that to me,
I had not heard that someone else 

1347
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,970
suggested that since then egyptologist 
with,

1348
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:14,971
of course out ever citing me or John 
Anthony West have also been suggesting 

1349
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:20,311
that in some cases,
and some have suggested that maybe it 

1350
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:23,611
was [inaudible] face on the sphinx 
rather than coffers face after we 

1351
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:28,501
brought in frank domingo who demonstrate
that's not coppers face a frank domingo,

1352
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,400
if you remember from mystery of the 
sphinx,

1353
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:35,401
was a New York city police officer,
forensic expert who literally would 

1354
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,310
reconstruct faces,
compare faces that was his business.

1355
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,710
And To present it in court,
uh,

1356
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:45,760
he analyzed the face of the Sphinx in 
the face of kafir,

1357
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:50,761
also known as schaeffer on the pharaoh.
The egyptologists before our time,

1358
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:55,210
before we got involved in this,
always said these were the same faces to

1359
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:57,140
face of the sphinx.
The face of copper,

1360
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:02,430
a frank domingo came out very 
definitively that they're not the same 

1361
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:06,691
face and they're both competent artists.
They're not frankly the same ethnicity 

1362
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:07,960
of face.
Uh,

1363
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,320
and for mark laner to publish in 
national geographic that I'll 

1364
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,671
paraphrase,
some of the sphinx came alive when he 

1365
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:19,930
reconstructed with the face of chef ron 
or face of conference just,

1366
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,880
that's not science,
that's,

1367
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,430
um,
you know,

1368
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:29,830
wish fulfillment or something.
He wanted it to be the face of a certain

1369
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:34,650
pharaoh.
He does computer construction with it,

1370
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,230
having the face of the pharaoh he wants 
it to be.

1371
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,860
And then past the ad off is somehow,
um,

1372
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:47,970
I guess science.
So there's no egyptologist not 

1373
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,610
necessarily science either.
And I'm not saying that a nasty way,

1374
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,940
but it's an important point because 
egyptology,

1375
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:56,941
a lot of egyptologists classically come 
more from a art history background,

1376
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:03,330
that type of thing.
So tying in with the question you asked 

1377
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:03,400
before,
I literally.

1378
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,530
It's funny how things work.
I literally,

1379
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:10,531
when I was in graduate school,
took a seminar in sciences

1380
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,770
and other disciplines,
you know,

1381
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:17,450
this was because I was being trained as 
a scientist and one of the papers we had

1382
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:22,451
to read at the time,
this was long before I ever thought 

1383
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:25,721
about going to Egypt was how 
egyptologists are resistant to 

1384
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:31,421
scientific information and scientific 
data and how to help try to overcome 

1385
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:37,961
that.
If you're working with egyptologist 

1386
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:39,870
basically what's the answer was it's 
very difficult and it's not to put them 

1387
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:43,110
down because I have lots of colleagues 
and other fields that are not sciences,

1388
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,440
but classically I would contend 
egyptology is not a science.

1389
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:52,520
It comes more from art history or from 
linguistic studies,

1390
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,310
you know,
translating hieroglyphs,

1391
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,320
um,
historical studies and those are all 

1392
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,901
very important academic studies.
But you do sometimes get people in a 

1393
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:05,600
certain field and they're resistant to 
outsiders from another field,

1394
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:10,630
especially when they think it's a field 
that's so far apart and so diverse from 

1395
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,850
what they understand,
what they know,

1396
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:15,140
their own mindset.

1397
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,560
Yeah.
And their mindset is not geared towards 

1398
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:20,560
scientific data.
And I'm not.

1399
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,740
Again,
I'm not trying to be nasty,

1400
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,480
it's just have to explain yourself.
Yeah,

1401
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:28,510
you're not coming across nasdaq.
So when you initially saw these erosion 

1402
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:34,421
features and and you the first 30 to 90 
seconds or whatever,

1403
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:38,420
you said it was 120 seconds when you 
first looked at it and new,

1404
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:44,260
did you have any idea that your life 
would take the turn that it's taken?

1405
01:18:44,591 --> 01:18:49,591
I mean,
did you have any indication thrown into 

1406
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,170
such a shit storm?
All these years later?

1407
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,780
We are in 2018.
You're still fighting the good fight.

1408
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:56,980
I know as John Anthony West one said 
introducing me.

1409
01:18:56,981 --> 01:18:58,400
Um,
he ruined.

1410
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:03,430
He ruined my life.
Twenty five years later after that 

1411
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,680
documentary,
you're still swinging.

1412
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:04,800
I dunno,
I dunno.

1413
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:07,140
I'm still getting attacked and I'm 
still.

1414
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,520
The answer is no.
I was naive.

1415
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:15,521
I was incredibly naive at the time.
I still was not that far out of graduate

1416
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:17,900
school.

1417
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,290
You thought you could just present?
Yeah.

1418
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:22,790
Stand on its own and just present the 
said man,

1419
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,760
what a great new discovery.
Exactly.

1420
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,130
That was it,
and I was so naive

1421
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:33,420
and so we first present the evidence at 
the geological society of America annual

1422
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:36,750
meeting in 1991,
I guess it was.

1423
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,190
Yeah,
1991,

1424
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:43,350
and I want to say bluntly,
the vast majority of geologists,

1425
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:44,790
hundreds,
literally thought,

1426
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:46,080
oh,
this is amazing.

1427
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,280
This is great.
it made,

1428
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:49,770
started making some headlines around the
world.

1429
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:54,771
Literally,
there were one or two geologists there 

1430
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:59,151
that turns out.
Turns out we're working for 

1431
01:19:59,151 --> 01:20:02,750
egyptologist.
They didn't think this was so great 

1432
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,481
because they saw the implications for 
the Egypt illogical colleagues and they 

1433
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:05,610
started,
you know,

1434
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:10,620
a little rumbling there.
Then the journalists come in back then 

1435
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,040
you'll know internet like we have it 
now,

1436
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:16,340
just phones and the journalists start 
calling egyptologists that we're not 

1437
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,820
there,
had not seen the data,

1438
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:22,860
etc.
Immediately they were telling the 

1439
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,191
journalists at this has to all be 
nonsense that hundreds of egyptologists 

1440
01:20:25,191 --> 01:20:26,790
have studied this for,
you know,

1441
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,880
two or three centuries,
which is total nonsense.

1442
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,880
It turns out I knew every egyptologists 
because they're so few that have 

1443
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,460
actually stayed the sphinx personally,
surely just to.

1444
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,190
So.
So yeah,

1445
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:44,310
they were just trying to dismiss it and 
then the egyptologists come back and say

1446
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:47,190
we know this is nonsense essentially.
I'm paraphrasing,

1447
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,340
we know that the pyramids were not built
by aliens so they start bringing aliens 

1448
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:55,380
and you have photos.
So essentIally just to dismiss,

1449
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:58,010
dismiss me and I wasn't talking about 
total straw.

1450
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:00,210
Yeah,
I wasn't talking about pyramids,

1451
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:02,610
number one,
we could talk about that if you want to.

1452
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,520
And I wasn't talking about aliens.
They hadn't been there,

1453
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:10,380
they hadn't seen the data.
It was so bizarre in hindsight.

1454
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:15,381
And I'm so frustrated trying to defend 
their positions and they were just,

1455
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:20,760
they were really just attacking.
And then in Egypt at one point they were

1456
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:23,580
um,
putting things in the arabic press.

1457
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:28,610
Little did they know,
I have friends that would read it to me 

1458
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:30,750
and they were saying that I wasn't even 
a faculty member at boston university,

1459
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:33,390
which is outright lie since I had just 
been tenured.

1460
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:36,600
So there Was no doubt I was a faculty 
member there.

1461
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:41,601
But this was other academic saying this,
but they never thought we'd get back to 

1462
01:21:41,601 --> 01:21:42,090
me.
I mean really,

1463
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:44,340
really mean.
And nasty,

1464
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:48,690
I'm so game back to the evidence.
So they set up in,

1465
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:51,660
this was I think unprecedented within 
months.

1466
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:56,661
They'd set up this debate at the triple 
a s american association for the 

1467
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,830
advancement of science.
And I thought again,

1468
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,540
I was so naive,
I thought,

1469
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,190
oh,
this is wonderful.

1470
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:07,191
Fine though.
We'll get rid of all this nonsense in 

1471
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:09,601
this name calling and you know,
the stuff in the popular press that no 

1472
01:22:09,601 --> 01:22:10,950
journalists,
you can't blame them.

1473
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:15,951
They don't know what's going on 
necessarily and will really get the 

1474
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:16,770
evidence out and we'll be able to 
discuss it.

1475
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:22,430
Um,
sanely and objectively turns out that 

1476
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,270
wasn't the case at all.
It was just from my perspective,

1477
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:28,800
they were just calling me more names and
trying to set up straw men.

1478
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:28,950
And

1479
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,540
is this the egyptologist who was in that
documentary who dismissed everything was

1480
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,120
still around.
Oh yeah.

1481
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:36,910
And has he amended his position at all?

1482
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:42,070
Not to my knowledge.
I haven't spoken with him for years and 

1483
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:46,840
years and years.
Did yoU ever speak with them off the 

1484
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:46,940
record personally alone?
What is this?

1485
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:47,460
Oh,
I,

1486
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:50,630
I'll tell you this,
but he didn't say was off the record.

1487
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:52,160
I was,
I guess was off the record.

1488
01:22:52,161 --> 01:22:53,780
I don't think I would have said this 
years ago,

1489
01:22:53,781 --> 01:22:57,560
but I'll say it now at that debate,
at that debate,

1490
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:00,050
aaa's debate.
He,

1491
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:05,200
I just suddenly found myself in the hall
with him and there was no one else 

1492
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:08,620
around so he could totally deny this.
But it's true.

1493
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,850
My perspective,
at least he,

1494
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:15,010
um,
said something to me like,

1495
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,900
you know,
you don't really believe this.

1496
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:20,830
I know you don't really believe this.
You just want to be on television and,

1497
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:24,670
you know,
be famous or something like that.

1498
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:25,240
He said,
I said,

1499
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:28,630
no,
I really do believe it.

1500
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:33,720
Or you know,
I really go by the evidence and I do 

1501
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:33,720
think the evidence says this.

1502
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,540
And he served.
He was telling me that,

1503
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,290
no,
you don't,

1504
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:36,040
you know,
he was like,

1505
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,330
I don't know.
I analyze what the sizing you.

1506
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:40,930
Yeah,
yeah,

1507
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:43,330
yeah.
And then he lead in and then,

1508
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:48,331
and then what he does is he starts 
asking me a question of some detailed 

1509
01:23:48,331 --> 01:23:50,170
question about the geology and well,
if that's the case,

1510
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:54,820
how can such and such and I think in 
hindsight might have been fed to them by

1511
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:59,821
some geo archeologists.
They called someone who does archeology 

1512
01:23:59,821 --> 01:24:02,020
but knows a little geology.
Uh,

1513
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:07,260
and I,
I realize in hindsight it was meant to 

1514
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:11,071
be one of those gotcha questions.
I guess they say nowadays where I 

1515
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:11,620
wouldn't be able to answer it,
but no,

1516
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:13,180
I had,
of course I'd thought about it.

1517
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,520
It was to me as a geologist,
very obvious.

1518
01:24:15,521 --> 01:24:20,521
So I start giving him this detailed 
explanation as to why that's not the 

1519
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:20,610
case and why,
you know,

1520
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,270
my evidence stands up,
blah,

1521
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:26,410
blah blah.
And we're standing there face to face.

1522
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:31,470
I'm explained this to him and I see his 
face turn and it goes blank and I'm in 

1523
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:34,480
midsentence.
He just turns around and walks away.

1524
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:35,770
He's the one

1525
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,330
he couldn't,
he couldn't refuse,

1526
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,860
can refute what I was saying and he 
wasn't really answered.

1527
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:47,430
My takeaway is that he wasn't interested
in discussing it rationally or aunts,

1528
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,140
you know,
he just went to,

1529
01:24:50,141 --> 01:24:52,880
um,
when the debate or whatever,

1530
01:24:52,881 --> 01:24:52,980
he.

1531
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,160
No,
when he knew that he

1532
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,550
wasn't going to with you,
he just got out of there.

1533
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:58,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1534
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,540
And again,
you know,

1535
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,300
it was a,
just a personal thing.

1536
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:03,820
There was no other witnesses to my 
knowledge of this,

1537
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,850
but if he had really wanted to discuss 
things,

1538
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,800
I was willing to discuss it with them

1539
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,840
and it's so disturbing that someone 
would put their own egos so far above 

1540
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:20,451
the information that needs to be 
distributed to scholars and people and 

1541
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:21,960
students and all these folks out there 
that have questions about the history of

1542
01:25:21,961 --> 01:25:26,961
the human race.
it's someone would put their own 

1543
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:28,620
reputation and eagle above all of that 
and not have the,

1544
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,610
the,
the,

1545
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,980
the mindset to realize,
well,

1546
01:25:31,981 --> 01:25:34,530
we have new evidence and what we thought
of before.

1547
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:38,370
We're going to have to apply to this new
evidence and create a new timeline.

1548
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,480
It doesn't dismiss all the things that 
they learned in the past.

1549
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:41,760
No,
no.

1550
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,800
That's something.
In fact,

1551
01:25:42,801 --> 01:25:47,801
I'm glad you brought that up because I 
long contended that people talk about 

1552
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:48,410
rewriting history,
etc.

1553
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,290
Well,
yes,

1554
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:53,550
I understand that argument and I think 
we do need to rewrite good chunks of our

1555
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:58,551
very early history,
but I've never denied dynastic Egypt in 

1556
01:25:58,891 --> 01:26:03,891
the basic chronology for dynastic agent.
Now what I say that we've got a whole 

1557
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:08,000
new chapter to add to it going back in 
time plus,

1558
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,680
and I won't mention the great pyramid 
here,

1559
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:15,130
plus things like the great pyramid,
the standard dating for the great 

1560
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:16,040
pyramid,
let's say 20 5:50

1561
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:20,110
bc or so,
the pharaoh khufu also known as cheops.

1562
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,120
Just in case people hear those terms.
I don't deny that he had something to do

1563
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:31,001
with the great pyramid,
but when I study it geologically and I 

1564
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:31,430
don't want to get into great detail 
here.

1565
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:36,431
When I study a geologically,
I think there was a older structure 

1566
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:36,431
there.

1567
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:38,600
I think there was something else there.
For instance,

1568
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:43,601
a subterranean chamber I suspect goes 
back much earlier than the time of 

1569
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,790
fourth dynasty khufu.
So for instance,

1570
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:51,791
to bring in robert [inaudible],
he has his awry in correlation of the 

1571
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,640
three pyramids to the belt.
Stars have a ryan,

1572
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,750
which correlate very well at about 
10,500

1573
01:26:56,751 --> 01:27:01,751
bc.
So he'll talk and we talk about this in 

1574
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:01,751
our joint book,
origins of the sphinx,

1575
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:04,190
how there was a master plan going back 
to that period.

1576
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,510
A lot of people have said that,
well,

1577
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:10,511
that's nonsense.
Why would they be following a master 

1578
01:27:10,511 --> 01:27:13,151
plan?
Thousands of years later when they 

1579
01:27:13,151 --> 01:27:13,151
finally got around to building these 
structures.

1580
01:27:13,151 --> 01:27:17,920
I don't think that's the case at all.
I think there were earlier markers are 

1581
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,590
structures at those spots.
The pyramids in this case,

1582
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:26,591
those three major pyramids were built 
over or enhanced or restored older 

1583
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:29,030
structures,
if that makes sense.

1584
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,120
So for instance,
under the great pyramid is what I call 

1585
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,091
the sacred mound.
It's actually literally a stone 

1586
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:40,370
outcropping mound and John Paul move 
wall.

1587
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:45,870
I'm robert [inaudible].
Older brother's actually architect 

1588
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,720
robert paval himself was trained as an 
engineer.

1589
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:52,220
They both make the point among are 
things that if you're building the great

1590
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:57,221
pyramid,
I mean this is a humongous structure 

1591
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:59,351
with incredible way.
It's much easier to flatten the plateau 

1592
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:00,400
at that point.
Again,

1593
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:05,410
nice level base rather than try to build
over and around a mound that's to this 

1594
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,200
day incorporate within the great 
pyramid.

1595
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:14,680
This takes a lot more energy and work 
and it's a much more difficult 

1596
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,340
engineering feat,
but it makes sense if you're.

1597
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:21,230
You want to preserve that.
If it was sacred to them or whatever.

1598
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:26,410
That older structure.
We have images of the soldiers 

1599
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:26,410
structure.
Oh,

1600
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:27,500
you can't see it at this point because 
it's totally covered,

1601
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:32,501
but we have something very analogous,
and I know you mentioned this when John 

1602
01:28:32,501 --> 01:28:37,210
Anthony West was on the red pyramid,
is also built over an older structure 

1603
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:42,860
and you can see that to this day in one 
of the chambers where you have this much

1604
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:44,060
older structure.

1605
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:47,330
I'm talking geologically now based on 
the evidence.

1606
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:52,331
Then we have some images there where you
have this older weathered structure,

1607
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,640
which I believe goes back.
I don't know how much older but 

1608
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,761
thousands of years old or let's just 
leave it that and then they built the 

1609
01:29:00,761 --> 01:29:04,091
pyramid over it and around it,
I think marketing it,

1610
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:09,860
you know,
refurbishing and much older structure 

1611
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:09,860
and you can tell by the weathering and 
the stuff,

1612
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:11,660
whether it's stone,
whether constructed.

1613
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,400
Exactly.
And you can see the sharp divide between

1614
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:17,700
the older structure and the newer 
structure,

1615
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:20,250
which is nice.
Finally cut stone.

1616
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:23,880
And that newer structure goes back 
earlier than the great pyramid.

1617
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,950
I mean,
this is snefru.

1618
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,570
This is even earlier by a generation.
Uh,

1619
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:34,670
so you have this where they're using and
dynastic Egypt older structures there,

1620
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,680
reappropriating them.
You have the case here.

1621
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:39,300
I believe you have that with the great 
pyramid.

1622
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,000
I believe you have to have that with the
second pyramid.

1623
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,550
You have that with the sphinx.
Most definitely.

1624
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:47,160
And the valley temple and the sphinx 
temple.

1625
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,520
The first piece of evidence that really 
convinced me that something was going on

1626
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:57,831
with the sphinx.
So the first evidence that I saw that 

1627
01:29:58,111 --> 01:30:01,140
made me suspicious that the egyptologist
did not have it right,

1628
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:06,380
was within that first 30 to 120 seconds.
I described the weathering and the 

1629
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:09,900
head's too small.
The first piece of really solid evidence

1630
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,140
was looking at the walls of the sphinx 
and valley temple that were constructed 

1631
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:18,360
from the stones that came out of the 
sphinx.

1632
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:21,870
Enclosure,
we talked about that they are weathered,

1633
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:24,030
but then they were cut back a little 
bit.

1634
01:30:24,031 --> 01:30:29,031
That weathering was cut back and they 
were resurfaced or re faced with granted

1635
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,740
in dynastic times.
It's believed.

1636
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:37,730
So what you have is a older structure 
and here's a diagram a for anyone that's

1637
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:42,831
looking at,
but what you have is older limestone 

1638
01:30:42,831 --> 01:30:42,831
temples,
which are massive,

1639
01:30:42,831 --> 01:30:46,230
which were then faced with granite,
but what they did,

1640
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,260
they did it the hard way.
They preserved as much of the older 

1641
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,870
limestone temple as possible before 
refacing it with granted.

1642
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:59,871
So they actually took the time,
in some cases to cut the backs of the 

1643
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,340
granite blocks to fit the weathered 
surface of the limestone.

1644
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,400
Wow.
Whether it would be much easier,

1645
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:08,550
you have plenty of rock there.
Just skim down the limestone.

1646
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,580
Totally make a nice flat surface and 
then replaster so speak regranted it.

1647
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:15,420
Hmm.

1648
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:19,770
What you all chipping away the old rock 
that shipped with the new role because I

1649
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:23,790
think it was important for them.
It's like if we have a national monument

1650
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:24,750
now that goes back to

1651
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:29,950
evolutionary war days.
He wants to preserve as much of the 

1652
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:32,561
original structure as possible,
even if it makes it more difficult to do

1653
01:31:32,601 --> 01:31:33,590
the restoration.

1654
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,470
Now you put the effort into it.
Just to clarify,

1655
01:31:36,471 --> 01:31:41,471
so you feel that this time period of 
the,

1656
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,520
the coronal mass ejections mass 
ejections was somewhere around 10,000

1657
01:31:47,601 --> 01:31:49,790
bc.
Well 9,700

1658
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:52,240
bc and I say that very specific

1659
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:57,130
because based on greenland ice core data
in particular,

1660
01:31:57,131 --> 01:32:02,131
you can literally count back year by 
year and the best estimate is about 

1661
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:04,900
9,700.

1662
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:05,820
See,
you know,

1663
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:10,900
give or take a decade or something.
So from that point to 2,500

1664
01:32:11,691 --> 01:32:16,691
bc,
which is where most conventional 

1665
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:19,040
egyptologists date,
the construction of the pyramid,

1666
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:24,340
you believe that the great pyramid was 
probably built on top of this great 

1667
01:32:24,711 --> 01:32:27,560
mound which represented an older 
structure,

1668
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:32,860
but these are the people that their 
civilization was destroyed and then 

1669
01:32:33,441 --> 01:32:38,441
thousands of years later we're able to 
somehow or another rebuild

1670
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:43,260
thousands of years later.
Why don't know if they were rebuilding a

1671
01:32:43,261 --> 01:32:48,261
nut pyramid as it was before or they 
were building new pyramid on top.

1672
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:53,620
The,
they obviously had retained some of the 

1673
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:53,620
incredible

1674
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:53,620
wisdom and knowledge.
Well,

1675
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,880
think of it to this day,
I'm a,

1676
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:59,200
I'll think of judeo christian islam.
Uh,

1677
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,200
I mean we still have a,
like the temple mound.

1678
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:05,650
We have places where we know that there 
were older structures,

1679
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:07,480
solomon's temple,
et cetera,

1680
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:12,481
and maYbe only a fragment of it is left,
but we still held in high esteem 

1681
01:33:13,361 --> 01:33:18,361
veneration.
Modern structures are built around or 

1682
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:21,541
over these relics.
I think that's a somewhat of an analogy 

1683
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:24,020
of what the parthenon.
Yeah,

1684
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,030
yeah,
yeah.

1685
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:28,910
So you have veneration of older.
If I could use that,

1686
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:32,050
and I'm not used necessarily using it in
religious terms,

1687
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:33,460
I mean,
could just be respect.

1688
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:34,470
Yes.
Uh,

1689
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:39,720
so I think that for all three of the 
major pyramids on the giza plateau,

1690
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:44,050
we have evidence that there was 
something there,

1691
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,960
whether they were pyramids as we see 
them now,

1692
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:51,850
which is quite a possibility and they 
were just refurbished or something else.

1693
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:57,150
Uh,
we have evidence that goes back to that 

1694
01:33:57,150 --> 01:34:01,420
much earlier period before the demise of
high civilization,

1695
01:34:01,421 --> 01:34:03,910
if I could put it that way at the end of
the last ice age.

1696
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:08,260
And then it was reappropriate re-used,
rebuilt,

1697
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:13,710
restored,
whatever term you wanna use in dynastic 

1698
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:16,000
egyptian times.
Uh,

1699
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:20,650
when give you another example.
Have you been to Egypt?

1700
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:21,490
No,
I have not.

1701
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,520
I didn't think you had.
You need to come to show thIs to you in 

1702
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,280
person.
I wanted to go with you.

1703
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,470
Your chicken chicken.
Scared to go to Egypt.

1704
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,500
Hurt is dangerous.
Not with me.

1705
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,810
Not with me because I take care of her.
No,

1706
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,190
no.
I buy have enough context.

1707
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:41,191
I have enough context that I'll go with 
you immediately get we have to make 

1708
01:34:41,191 --> 01:34:41,191
something happen.
Yeah,

1709
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,310
definitely,
definitely.

1710
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:47,660
Points of the mountain and digital to 
give people a perspective of time that t

1711
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,860
2000,
500 years ago,

1712
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:53,820
the conventional dating of the 
construction,

1713
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,840
the grandparents,
cleopatra is closer to the construction 

1714
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,230
of the iphone than she is to the 
construction of the great pyramids.

1715
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:07,300
That's just how long a history you're 
dealing with when it comes to ancient 

1716
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:12,430
Egypt.
So we're talking about thousands and 

1717
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:14,720
thousands of years for sure.
And this is for sure for sure.

1718
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:19,780
Like where we absolutely know,
forget about all the speculation just 

1719
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:22,520
from cleopatra to the 2000 fIve hundred 
bc,

1720
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:26,510
which is what almost all the 
egyptologists except you're dealing with

1721
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,990
just a giant leap harris,
right.

1722
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:30,710
Here's the.
we could see it here.

1723
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,990
That's right.
And,

1724
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:37,010
and so,
and we are closer to the dynastic 

1725
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:39,970
egyptians.
Even the old kingdom dynastic egyptians,

1726
01:35:39,971 --> 01:35:44,971
we are closer to them in time than they 
were to the end of the last ice age and 

1727
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:51,330
the demise of that earlier civilization.
So a dynastic egyptian dynastic Egypt 

1728
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:51,400
arose.
Rough terms,

1729
01:35:51,401 --> 01:35:52,990
5,000
years ago,

1730
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:58,410
that was about 3000 bc.
That was,

1731
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:03,510
they arose over 6,000
years after close to 7,000

1732
01:36:03,911 --> 01:36:08,470
years after the end of the last ice age,
so that's crazy.

1733
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,590
Yeah,
that's hard.

1734
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:13,130
Hartford were talking real spans of time
here and you're looking at.

1735
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:15,500
We're looking at a chart right here.
Is there any way,

1736
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:20,530
is there a place or were other people 
can go and see this because it's 

1737
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:20,530
ongoing.

1738
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:24,710
A chart like this is on my website,
in the article,

1739
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:27,960
if you go to my website,
robert shocked again,

1740
01:36:27,961 --> 01:36:32,640
www dot robert schoch,
s c h o c h.com,

1741
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,700
and go to the website.
You'll see charts like this,

1742
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:40,701
but what you should do is go to the main
page of the website and then I believe 

1743
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,040
it is a research highlights,
go to whatsapp,

1744
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:50,090
hauled research highlights actually I 
think for those on the podcast are 

1745
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,940
seeing here and then go to what's called
the cita article as did a,

1746
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:56,070
and this is what we're looking at a 
standard on the website now which stands

1747
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:59,100
for solar induced dark age today and 
again,

1748
01:36:59,101 --> 01:37:01,020
it's ironic.
I think that the sun,

1749
01:37:01,021 --> 01:37:03,750
which of course is pride,
couldn't induce a dark age,

1750
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,240
but when you have a major eruption like 
this,

1751
01:37:06,241 --> 01:37:11,241
a major outburst from the sun hitting 
the earth and all the ramifications we 

1752
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:15,891
were talking about,
it's going to bring any civilization 

1753
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:15,891
down

1754
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:20,220
to its knees.
Thousands and thousands of years of 

1755
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:23,701
rebuilding civilization and rising 
backup to some still unbelievably 

1756
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:29,941
incredible technological level.
So even if they did rebuild the pyramid 

1757
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,210
at 2,500
bc,

1758
01:37:31,211 --> 01:37:33,090
it's still this incredible feat.
Oh,

1759
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,570
it's incredible.
For years,

1760
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:35,550
why 500

1761
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:40,550
bc?
Before if I could just finish a thought 

1762
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,431
that I started to have,
I was saying we have to go Egypt 

1763
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:43,930
together and I could show you something 
that we could do a podcast there.

1764
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:47,340
Snap.
Yeah.

1765
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:52,670
I could take you.
Among other things around the second 

1766
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:52,880
pyramid,
the second pyramid.

1767
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:57,510
You can see evidence.
I would point to you that I interpret as

1768
01:37:57,511 --> 01:38:00,300
going back to an earlier structure.
Furthermore,

1769
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:05,301
the second period pyramid few people 
seem to pay attention to this has a 

1770
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:08,250
ring,
a ring of granite around the base.

1771
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:13,430
That's significant because they were 
using granted in many cases and 

1772
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,240
conventional egyptologists who have 
confirmed to this,

1773
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:20,510
confirm this verbally with me.
They would use granted when they were 

1774
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:25,670
indicating they were restoring an older 
structure and there's no question that 

1775
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:31,011
granite goes back to the fourth dynasty,
just like there's no question that the 

1776
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:36,471
granite on the valley and sphinx temple 
goes back to at least the fourth 

1777
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:37,350
dynasty,
if not earlier,

1778
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,120
but they're using it to restore.

1779
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:44,120
So we have all of this indication that 
dynastic Egypt acknowledged that they 

1780
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:47,700
were restoring older structures.
Um,

1781
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:51,530
so getting back to where we were just on
the great pyramid.

1782
01:38:51,531 --> 01:38:54,900
So no matter how you look at it to try 
to do,

1783
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:59,010
build a great pyramid today,
whether you're talking 2,500

1784
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:01,860
bc or earlier,
I mean,

1785
01:39:01,861 --> 01:39:03,900
how were they doing it?
how were they doing?

1786
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:08,901
I don't know.
I told you I am not going to try to get 

1787
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:08,901
into how they did.
I'm,

1788
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:09,990
that's,
they did it.

1789
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:12,030
It's there.
Uh,

1790
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,050
you know,
it's,

1791
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:14,250
it's.
I have,

1792
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,320
I thought about a lot.
Yes.

1793
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,550
Whether I'm there in Egypt on site or 
elsewhere.

1794
01:39:20,551 --> 01:39:21,720
I mean,
it's incredible.

1795
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:27,110
I don't have any answer for you.
Is it possible that the people in that 

1796
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:30,181
part of the world somehow another 
survived the coronal mass ejection in 

1797
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:35,470
and they came out better than the people
in other parts of the world that were 

1798
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,610
really knocked into the stone age?
No,

1799
01:39:36,611 --> 01:39:38,430
I don't think there's any evidence for 
that because,

1800
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,520
because we seem to have a huge gap 
around the world,

1801
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:45,560
around the gap,
but they still historically

1802
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:51,470
now what they were doing in Egypt is 
incomparable.

1803
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:57,620
One could argue,
so it may well be that they found all 

1804
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:00,240
the right materials,
all the right environments,

1805
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:05,241
a nile valley in its height,
which is nonsense height.

1806
01:40:06,241 --> 01:40:07,540
Now,
um,

1807
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,540
you know,
at the end of sydney,

1808
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:13,020
let's say for a reemergence may have 
just been,

1809
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:18,021
I hate to say the goldie locks words,
but just right for everything to come 

1810
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:21,090
together for this to,
you know,

1811
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,790
come together.
It's a very fertile area.

1812
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:26,100
It's very easily,
uh,

1813
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:30,030
uh,
defended that type of thing.

1814
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:35,270
Um,
and also I do want to tie in with what 

1815
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,730
you were saying it is,
and I've certainly thought about this.

1816
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:39,760
It is possible that a,
we are electrical and um,

1817
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,780
the fluctuating and electric fields,
magnetic fields.

1818
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:46,660
Did they have some influence if I'm 
brain development or you know,

1819
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:51,710
that's real speculation,
but I wouldn't say it's impossible 

1820
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:51,710
either.
So,

1821
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:51,710
so

1822
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:54,310
these people,
is it possible they retained some

1823
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:59,310
of the knowledge from thousands of.
I think they definitely retaining 

1824
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:02,630
knowledge,
just like we have monasteries in europe 

1825
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:02,830
during the dark ages retaining 
knowledge.

1826
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:07,980
And what's interesting is in some cases 
you would retain chunks of knowledge 

1827
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:12,720
that don't even make sense out of 
context except that they know they're 

1828
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:12,940
important.
They're no,

1829
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:15,120
they're valuable.
What kind of examples?

1830
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:20,220
Well,
I think in europe where you would have 

1831
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:20,220
um,
uh,

1832
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:22,090
pieces of technology that would be 
retained,

1833
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:26,650
but you don't have the whole complex or 
thinking literary terms.

1834
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:31,651
That's probably the easiest where you 
have parts of like a history of 

1835
01:41:31,651 --> 01:41:35,050
alexander where the whole thing did not 
survive,

1836
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:40,051
but you know,
six out of nine chapters or whatever 

1837
01:41:40,051 --> 01:41:43,411
survived.
And even Though they knew it was an 

1838
01:41:43,411 --> 01:41:45,420
incomplete manuscript,
they would make numerous copies of the 

1839
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,230
incomplete manuscript.
Knowing that it was important,

1840
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,850
sort of like the goals.

1841
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:51,010
Oh yeah,
there's another example,

1842
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,760
although the dead sea scrolls 
potentially were absolutely complete,

1843
01:41:54,761 --> 01:41:59,220
or at least most of them are complete 
when they were buried and you know,

1844
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:02,440
put away for storage.
A lot of them,

1845
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:07,500
the incomplete lists there may be 
because they degrade it because they 

1846
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,390
were discovered by,
you know,

1847
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:11,680
locals who have been tore them apart.
And so pieces here or there,

1848
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:15,940
I'm referring more to a situation where 
you have ancient knowledge,

1849
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:20,941
our ancient manuscripts and even though 
say the monks and a monastery knew that 

1850
01:42:20,941 --> 01:42:25,561
this was not a complete manuscript,
they knew that even in its 

1851
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:30,330
incompleteness,
it was important to maintain as much of 

1852
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:34,500
it as possible.
It's just stunning that civilization 

1853
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,260
that was knocked down like every other 
civilization,

1854
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,500
somehow or another 2,500
bc rose to this incredible level of 

1855
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:44,440
construction that is just unparalleled 
anywhere else on the planet.

1856
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,450
And it did it very,
very quickly,

1857
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:48,340
very quickly.

1858
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:50,380
Uh,
which I think does,

1859
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:56,420
is it indicative potentially that they 
were reusing knowledge that had been 

1860
01:42:57,341 --> 01:43:00,220
passed down and somehow maybe things 
just clicked together.

1861
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:03,850
Maybe it took one genius to start 
putting things together.

1862
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:06,460
And that set off a renaissance if you 
would.

1863
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:11,820
I mean we've seen that historically and 
much more recent times that maybe 

1864
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:15,720
perhaps the understanding of how it was 
built and designed is more prevalent 

1865
01:43:15,881 --> 01:43:19,810
amongst the civilization amongst the 
community than maybe it would be today.

1866
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:25,020
Yeah.
So I mean there's still a lot of 

1867
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:25,300
unanswered questions here,
obviously.

1868
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,540
Yeah.
Obviously it's incredible incredible 

1869
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:33,301
stuff,
but I think we're starting to get more 

1870
01:43:33,301 --> 01:43:36,990
toward an answer or at least getting the
broader outlines of what is going on.

1871
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:44,610
Wow.
This is so fascinating to think that 

1872
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:44,920
this could potentially happen to us.
Well,

1873
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:48,190
that it's not the only fast dane.
I hate to use the term.

1874
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:52,340
It's scary and I think we're incredibly 
vulnerable and people are not

1875
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,120
addressing.
This is not the type of thing to address

1876
01:43:56,121 --> 01:44:01,121
for some reason because a major solar 
outburst and coronal mass ejection and 

1877
01:44:01,761 --> 01:44:05,390
all the related phenomena.
We've mentioned this earlier would bring

1878
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:09,650
down modern technology as we know it 
would fry the grid system.

1879
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:14,240
YoU'd have high radiation levels.
You'd probably have all the flooding.

1880
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:19,270
I mean,
look what happens now when you have 

1881
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,270
lIttle floods,
and I say that as a geologist,

1882
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:22,490
not to downplay the horrible disasters 
we've had,

1883
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:25,340
but other factors.
For instance,

1884
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:29,120
we have nuclear power plants all around 
the world.

1885
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:33,320
We've seen that with a few isolated 
instances.

1886
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:37,490
Chernobyl,
three mile island fukushima recently.

1887
01:44:37,491 --> 01:44:39,230
What happens when you have problems with
those?

1888
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:42,590
If you cut off power to a nuclear power 
plant,

1889
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,780
it's ironic.
Lot of people don't realize it.

1890
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,280
Yes,
they generate power,

1891
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:48,350
but they need a power supply going into 
them.

1892
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:53,351
IF you fry the grid system,
you're essentially going to have 

1893
01:44:53,351 --> 01:44:53,810
meltdowns and radiation.

1894
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:56,930
You're going to have problems.
And on top of everything else,

1895
01:44:56,940 --> 01:45:01,040
we're going to bring on this artificial 
radiation around the world.

1896
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,470
Uh,
I mean,

1897
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:02,930
it's,
it's,

1898
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:04,730
and again,
I'm not saying this,

1899
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,250
I don't have anything to sell.
You know,

1900
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:09,960
sometimes I hear people talk about this 
because there was.

1901
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:11,900
So they're prepping kid and now they're 
going to,

1902
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:13,460
oh,
for so much money,

1903
01:45:13,461 --> 01:45:14,720
I'll sell,
you know,

1904
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,100
jim baker style.
Yeah,

1905
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:16,720
yeah,
yeah.

1906
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:17,510
But no,
and I,

1907
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:22,511
I hate to even talk about it except I 
think it's important and I think that 

1908
01:45:22,511 --> 01:45:24,170
one of the things this gets back to 
that,

1909
01:45:24,171 --> 01:45:29,060
it's not just sort of academic to study 
ancient civilization,

1910
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:34,061
it's not just fun and interesting,
but I think there are things to learn 

1911
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:38,681
from this and one of the things to learn
is that they survived incredible.

1912
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,940
Well,
I don't know if they survive,

1913
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:43,340
but they were knocked to their knees,
but we,

1914
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:48,930
they went through natural catastrophes,
which are not unrealistic that we could 

1915
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:54,640
go through them again and be potentially
much more vulnerable than they are than 

1916
01:45:55,881 --> 01:45:58,110
they were at that time.
Uh,

1917
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,400
because we're so reliant on silver.
Yeah.

1918
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:07,130
Are there any hieroglyphs that are 
convincing or at least point to some of 

1919
01:46:08,071 --> 01:46:12,480
the construction methods of,
of the pyramid or of any of the other?

1920
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:14,150
Well,
you said convincing,

1921
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:16,640
I would say no.
Now I would say no.

1922
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:21,080
Uh,
and this gets into the problem to that.

1923
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:26,081
Why would you expect that I'm serious 
because what we have surviving are 

1924
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:31,850
generally religious,
somewhat literary,

1925
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,460
um,
things in tombs.

1926
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:38,710
Now I don't buy for a second that the 
great pyramid was a tumor initially too.

1927
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:43,760
That's like saying a huge cathedrals 
just to tune because you find a couple 

1928
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,331
of bodies there and you've never 
actually found bodies in the great 

1929
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:49,350
pyramid oriented,
the major pyramids and as you know,

1930
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:54,351
I know you know this,
the pure construction goes down hill as 

1931
01:46:54,351 --> 01:46:58,551
you go into later dynastic Egypt.
So they seem to have either gotten 

1932
01:46:58,551 --> 01:47:02,481
sloppier or just lost some of the 
technological finesse they had.

1933
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:07,790
So you find in some of the tombs these 
what almost seemed silly pictures of 

1934
01:47:09,151 --> 01:47:14,151
them dragging huge statues on sledges 
where they're supposedly pouring oil or 

1935
01:47:16,051 --> 01:47:18,630
water in front of it to lubricated.

1936
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:22,470
And you know,
the egyptologist say,

1937
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:24,300
aha,
this is how they built it all.

1938
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:27,960
We'll try doing that in real life.
It doesn't really work.

1939
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:32,940
So I think some of that may just be sort
of artistic license or metaphor,

1940
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,190
that type of thing.
Do you have any images of that?

1941
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:37,110
Uh,
but not.

1942
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:42,111
Not that I brought with me,
but my point is that you wouldn't even 

1943
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:47,121
expect them to be leaving detailed 
construction plans are that we wouldn't 

1944
01:47:48,411 --> 01:47:51,620
necessarily find them.
Maybe we'll get lucky find someday,

1945
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:55,020
but put it this way,
if they find a bunch of iphones 12,000

1946
01:47:55,021 --> 01:48:00,021
years from now or 5,000
years from now with whichever period we 

1947
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:03,601
want to find,
talk about will they know what they are 

1948
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:04,470
and even if they know what they are,
will we,

1949
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,500
will they find the plans of how to build
one and the factory specifications of 

1950
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,280
all the engineering that goes into it?

1951
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:15,720
No.
So why would you expect it for the great

1952
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:16,410
pyramids?
Right.

1953
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:17,310
But well,
you know,

1954
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:19,820
it'd be a lucky,
it'd be a lucky find different bid,

1955
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,110
but how much would that odds are against
it?

1956
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,320
And,
and not to throw out too much academia 

1957
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,351
type stuff,
but one of the things I study is a 

1958
01:48:30,351 --> 01:48:32,811
graduate school,
so I took a series of courses in 

1959
01:48:32,811 --> 01:48:35,290
taxonomy which is basically how did 
things get preserved focusing on 

1960
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:35,720
fossils.
Um,

1961
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,880
but the principles apply to other things
as well.

1962
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:43,970
And as you go back in time,
what you expect to survive 

1963
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:46,110
logarithmically drops off,
you know,

1964
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:49,710
so you go back to these earlier periods,
it's amazing.

1965
01:48:49,711 --> 01:48:53,310
We have much of anything and what'S 
going to survive big,

1966
01:48:53,311 --> 01:48:58,311
massive stone structures,
not the plans on papaya iris or sheep 

1967
01:49:00,331 --> 01:49:04,290
skin or whatever of the details of how 
to build it.

1968
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:06,710
That's why what I found particularly 
offensive about that,

1969
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:09,000
um,
egyptologist saying,

1970
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,940
where's the evidence of this culture 
from 10,500

1971
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:12,420
years ago?

1972
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,020
Like,
what?

1973
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:14,550
What do you expect to find?
Yeah,

1974
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:16,530
exactly.
This is what we're talking about.

1975
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:19,710
You know,
what we find from that earlier period,

1976
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:24,020
if you think about our massive stone 
monumental structures,

1977
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,120
everything else would be grounded.
It was incinerated,

1978
01:49:27,121 --> 01:49:30,750
it was,
it was ground into dust or it was reused

1979
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:32,790
in some cases.
Sometimes people say,

1980
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,570
well,
they,

1981
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,210
how could they do that without metal 
tools will,

1982
01:49:36,211 --> 01:49:41,211
maybe metallurgy does go back further.
Maybe it was lost and then reinvented 

1983
01:49:41,211 --> 01:49:41,880
again.
So again,

1984
01:49:41,881 --> 01:49:45,450
I don't deny the standard timeframe,
but there could be a lot of things going

1985
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:48,310
back before that.
And you have metal.

1986
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:53,490
And I'm not trying to focus on metal now
and I'm not making any big claims about 

1987
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:56,710
metallurgy a earlier time,
but let's just say for instance,

1988
01:49:56,711 --> 01:50:01,711
as a thought experiment,
if you had metallurgy much earlier than 

1989
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:07,380
conventional timeframe says,
and you had a natural catastrophe like 

1990
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,840
that,
are they just going to leave their metal

1991
01:50:10,841 --> 01:50:12,400
tools all over the place?

1992
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:18,050
No,
they collect all the scraps of metal 

1993
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:18,820
possible and recycle and reuse and 
reuse.

1994
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:21,640
we do that to this day.
I mean people got,

1995
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:27,500
in Massachusetts at least if you have a 
warehouse and you're not paying 

1996
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:29,860
attention to it all the time,
it's an old warehouse.

1997
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,960
There have been cases where people have 
found.

1998
01:50:31,961 --> 01:50:35,050
Someone broke in not to steal the things
in the warehouse,

1999
01:50:35,051 --> 01:50:37,060
but to steal the copper piping.
Right?

2000
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,620
yeah.
That's very common.

2001
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:43,980
Now there's some of the more interesting
pieces of evidence that came out of the 

2002
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:49,300
great pyramid and a lot of the other 
structures of Egypt had been the pottery

2003
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:52,330
that's incredibly difficult to reproduce
those stone.

2004
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,120
Well,
you just made a mistake.

2005
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:56,980
I'm not criticizing you.
I said pottery.

2006
01:50:57,010 --> 01:50:59,480
You said padre,
because it's Important distinctions,

2007
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:04,530
not monitoring,
it is fired in a kiln and fired dearly,

2008
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:09,540
carved out really hard stone,
which will crack easily if you don't do 

2009
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:15,361
it just right,
so it looks like pottery and that's you 

2010
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:16,210
used a term colloquially put it that 
way.

2011
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:19,930
Looks like pottery because that's how 
people imagine,

2012
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:22,090
you know,
it looks like a beautifully shaped pot,

2013
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:27,120
but some of these they go and they go 
back to the earliest dynastic Egypt and 

2014
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:32,131
probably much earlier they are carved 
out really hard granites and schists and

2015
01:51:32,741 --> 01:51:33,490
nice,
you know,

2016
01:51:33,491 --> 01:51:38,491
these really hard stones and two 
Incredible tolerances and incredibly 

2017
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:44,671
thin,
incredibly beautifully carved and most 

2018
01:51:44,671 --> 01:51:47,390
importantly to very small opening.
Very small openings is.

2019
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:50,560
Exactly.
And how do you do this?

2020
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:55,561
I mean it's just incredible when you 
have to come to Egypt with us and when 

2021
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:58,840
we do,
we'll look at some of these onsite.

2022
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:04,500
There's a bunch in the museum.
There's some at a museum at sakara where

2023
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:08,260
they had been nice one.
Yeah,

2024
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:10,000
that's amazing.
It looks like a mace.

2025
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:12,520
Headers are destined jar,
but that's not what we're talking about.

2026
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:13,780
That's not.
There's much,

2027
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:14,560
much nicer.

2028
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:20,050
I'm a much nicer in the sense of the 
finesse of how both arterial,

2029
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:24,580
theY were carved out of marble.
Different marbles.

2030
01:52:24,581 --> 01:52:27,120
Two easier ones to do.
They would grab them out.

2031
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,440
diorite granted.
Nice.

2032
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:33,890
Which is a metamorphic stone schist.
These are really hard stones.

2033
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,000
He's called direct.
I'm d,

2034
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:39,250
I o r I t e,
I believe.

2035
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:41,850
Try that because that's what I'm pretty 
sure I saw one of them.

2036
01:52:41,851 --> 01:52:46,851
It was carved out of that.
And so what we're saying is that these 

2037
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:50,900
are really hard to carve,
that use very narrow openings,

2038
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:55,930
like you said,
sometimes they put handles on them so 

2039
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:58,901
they're not just spinning them.
Allow lave because how will you get the 

2040
01:52:58,901 --> 01:52:59,000
handles on it because that's not put on 
separately.

2041
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:01,250
It's all car from one.
Look at that.

2042
01:53:01,251 --> 01:53:02,780
Look at that.
There's a nice one,

2043
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:08,310
a then on vessels and these thousands of
these have been found going back to the 

2044
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:13,110
earliest dynastic times.
But what suggested the.

2045
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,090
Yeah.
There's um,

2046
01:53:14,091 --> 01:53:17,740
how they were carved according to the 
standard egyptologist.

2047
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:21,290
I try to do that without cracking it,
without making a mistake,

2048
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,370
et cetera.

2049
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,590
Oh,
we'll explain what we're looking at.

2050
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:25,900
we're looking at some sort of a,
um,

2051
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:30,970
it looks like a little like amazed that 
they use scratch out the inside.

2052
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,540
YeaH.
To,

2053
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:37,600
um,
and maybe they did it and just took a 

2054
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:37,600
log until.
what's the speculation?

2055
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,830
Other than that,
we'll get the one right above it.

2056
01:53:38,831 --> 01:53:39,830
Jamie,
that red one,

2057
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:42,440
the red one right above your cursor.
That one's incredible.

2058
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,900
Yeah,
they're,

2059
01:53:42,901 --> 01:53:46,440
they're absolutely incredible.
And we can see these on site.

2060
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,880
So what,
what's the circulation?

2061
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:51,850
The uh,
the,

2062
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,030
the speculation is that they weRe doing 
it the same way.

2063
01:53:55,031 --> 01:53:59,650
They were doing a new kingdom times.
So when you look at them and new kingdon

2064
01:53:59,651 --> 01:54:04,651
times as a general rule,
you get things similar to this new 

2065
01:54:04,651 --> 01:54:06,820
kingdoms that say 1500 bC just for round
numbers.

2066
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,790
You get similar types of vases and 
whatnot,

2067
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:13,870
but they're actually to my eye,
much cruder.

2068
01:54:13,871 --> 01:54:18,871
Generally they're made out softer stone,
more your calcites sites in limestones 

2069
01:54:19,451 --> 01:54:21,340
and marbles,
that type of thing.

2070
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:26,580
They geneRally are just not.
They'll have the same artistic finesse 

2071
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:30,340
to them,
the same perfection to them and the new 

2072
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:33,091
kingdom.
Egyptians did show diagrams as we just 

2073
01:54:33,091 --> 01:54:35,530
saw how they did it or supposedly did it
and that may well be how they were doing

2074
01:54:35,531 --> 01:54:40,531
it,
but I questioned as a geologist whether 

2075
01:54:40,531 --> 01:54:43,000
that would really work for these 
beautiful harder stone,

2076
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:46,030
muCh more perfect in my assessment.

2077
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:51,840
Older ones that you find going back to 
the earliest dynasties and you find in 

2078
01:54:52,061 --> 01:54:54,850
some cases thousands of them.
So at sakara,

2079
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:58,030
at the step pyramId,
generally considered the oldest pyramid,

2080
01:54:58,060 --> 01:55:01,930
although I would question that,
but it's definitely an old pyramid.

2081
01:55:01,931 --> 01:55:06,931
Even by Egypt biological standards,
you found thousands of these really well

2082
01:55:07,601 --> 01:55:12,130
carved ones from the harder stone,
the more artistic ones,

2083
01:55:12,131 --> 01:55:15,880
if we could call it that sort of a huge 
horde of them.

2084
01:55:16,630 --> 01:55:19,240
I don't even think they were necessarily
carved at that time.

2085
01:55:19,241 --> 01:55:24,241
I think this may have been a horde that 
they had preserved from thousands of 

2086
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:26,590
years earlier.
Service stock poweR museum,

2087
01:55:26,591 --> 01:55:27,880
if you would.
In fact,

2088
01:55:27,881 --> 01:55:31,180
what we're finding for as many of these 
quote tombs and temples,

2089
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:33,340
not temples,
tombs and pyramids,

2090
01:55:33,341 --> 01:55:34,990
that type of thing,
is that maybe the.

2091
01:55:34,991 --> 01:55:37,510
Essentially they were stockpiles.
They were um,

2092
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:38,930
the equivalent of,
you know,

2093
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:39,690
fall out shelter.

2094
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:44,690
So if you were you stuck away supplies 
type of thing that may have been part of

2095
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:50,151
the original structure.
Some of these are very long next to a 

2096
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:52,360
very long neck bottoms.
Exactly.

2097
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:54,080
Sanely difficUlt,
like the ones that you've told them,

2098
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:58,680
there's ones that are difficult and they
have all kinds of curves.

2099
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:04,310
And what you have to be careful as I was
saying is that you have the really well 

2100
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:08,181
finished very ancient ones and then you 
have ancient ones that are from the new 

2101
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:10,920
cayman only 3000,
3000,

2102
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:12,930
500 years ago.
Yeah.

2103
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:14,100
Yeah.
Uh,

2104
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,530
and then what you have,
and I Could show you one,

2105
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:18,810
and if it's still on display in the 
egyptian museum,

2106
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:23,811
I say still on display because they 
changed the displace and they're 

2107
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:25,140
building a new grant Egypt museum as 
they call it.

2108
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:30,141
So it's hard to say in Egypt,
in Egypt when we go to Egypt now going 

2109
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:35,930
say,
I can show you one where I'm convinced 

2110
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:38,661
that it's a very old bowl that was then 
reused in later times.

2111
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:44,870
So you see this crude or hieroglyphic 
inscription on it and you just look at 

2112
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:50,571
it and you say someone that incredible 
bowl would not have done such a crude 

2113
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:53,010
inscription on it this year.
I mean,

2114
01:56:53,011 --> 01:56:58,011
so,
and then when we go through each with a 

2115
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:01,161
megalithic statutes and whatnot,
you can find over and over where they 

2116
01:57:01,161 --> 01:57:06,021
would carve on them later.
So reappropriate them in later dynastic 

2117
01:57:06,781 --> 01:57:09,510
times,
which is still thousands of years ago.

2118
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,180
So very ancient from our personal 
perspective,

2119
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:16,830
but they were reusing older structures 
and older,

2120
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,390
older artifacts.
This,

2121
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,860
the whole subject is so fascinating to 
me.

2122
01:57:22,861 --> 01:57:27,861
But this bowl thing is very weird 
because it's almost like one of the 

2123
01:57:27,861 --> 01:57:28,980
crazier pieces of evidence,
but it's dismissed.

2124
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:31,080
It's like right under your nose.
Oh,

2125
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:34,410
it's absolutely dismissed and it's not 
unlike.

2126
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,810
And I only think of this because I know 
you saw it.

2127
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:41,811
If you remember when,
because I watched the recently to 

2128
01:57:41,811 --> 01:57:45,261
refresh my memory,
the podcast where you interviewed John 

2129
01:57:45,261 --> 01:57:46,620
Anthony West and he showed a picture 
which happened to be my hand.

2130
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:52,080
Um,
but in mY hand was a little bead that 

2131
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,070
was founded come back.
And the thing is,

2132
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:56,220
remember that little beat had this,
it was a very hard,

2133
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:01,280
I'm probably volcanic stone and little 
teeny hole drilled all the way through 

2134
01:58:02,491 --> 01:58:03,420
it,
the long way.

2135
01:58:03,421 --> 01:58:05,850
So you had a drilling that's,
you know,

2136
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:10,910
a centimeter or more long going through.
It's not just a little hole punch 

2137
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:11,970
through,
but a little tunnel going through.

2138
01:58:11,971 --> 01:58:13,440
There it is.
UM,

2139
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,250
and you know,
how do you do that with quote primitive 

2140
01:58:19,441 --> 01:58:23,490
technology that to me is as amazing as 
the erection of the pillars,

2141
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:29,760
you know,
so you have to look at both small scale 

2142
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,821
and large scale and like you say,
the bowls may be something you hold in 

2143
01:58:31,821 --> 01:58:31,821
your hand,
but they're just justice.

2144
01:58:31,821 --> 01:58:36,711
Incredible technology.
Just like if people were to judge us 

2145
01:58:36,711 --> 01:58:37,230
today,
10,000

2146
01:58:37,231 --> 01:58:42,231
years from now,
they'd say that iphone is incredible 

2147
01:58:42,231 --> 01:58:42,231
technology even

2148
01:58:42,231 --> 01:58:43,870
though it's small scale,
just like,

2149
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:46,960
I guess they would maybe say if anything
survives of them,

2150
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:51,961
uh,
some high rise was a incredible in this 

2151
01:58:51,961 --> 01:58:53,070
is good beckley [inaudible] that would 
just pulled up jamie.

2152
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,840
These images.
And what are these images of?

2153
01:58:55,841 --> 01:59:00,841
Looks like a nail or something called 
earplugs or Bugs.

2154
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:04,540
Some people claim that no one really 
knows exactly what they are.

2155
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,720
Airports.
Yeah.

2156
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:06,720
Well,
you know,

2157
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:10,040
not ear plugs and plug your ears are 
like,

2158
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:12,450
oh,
your earrings.

2159
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:16,460
I don't know exactly what needs to be.
Yeah,

2160
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:19,810
they call them buttons there sometimes.
What is the speculation,

2161
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:21,940
the construction methods of those 
complicated bowls.

2162
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,860
What?
What do people believe they did,

2163
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:29,190
but the bolsa Egypt.
Is there any speculations or any 

2164
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:35,610
installation is that they may have been 
using some kind of lave for it at least 

2165
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:39,640
in part,
but the problem is you can't turn it and

2166
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:43,460
still have the handle sticking if you do
standard workout,

2167
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:45,970
you know,
spinning late type of thing.

2168
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:49,090
so there's something else that has to be
going on there.

2169
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:54,360
I was going to say part of the problem 
with any of this knowledge being passed 

2170
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,470
down right up into at least the 16 
hundreds,

2171
01:59:56,471 --> 01:59:57,790
early 17,
hundreds,

2172
01:59:57,791 --> 02:00:00,340
you know,
there were guilt systems where you would

2173
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:05,341
retain knowledge of how you do search 
and technological things and I think 

2174
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:10,921
that may go back to very,
very ancient times that you don't want 

2175
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:11,360
to just give out.
Right.

2176
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:13,480
You know,
the knowledge to anyone,

2177
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:15,670
but you know,
again,

2178
02:00:15,671 --> 02:00:20,671
I've,
I've heard no good compelling and my 

2179
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:22,330
mind explanation as to how these things 
were made.

2180
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:27,390
Now one of the things that they found in
the king's chamber was what they 

2181
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:28,450
referred to as.
They call it a sarcophagus,

2182
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:30,160
like what they called the chicago 
fergus.

2183
02:00:30,161 --> 02:00:33,760
I preferred the term coffer and it's 
made out of granite.

2184
02:00:33,761 --> 02:00:34,750
Aswan,
granite.

2185
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:39,780
The coffer meaning like almost like a 
treasure chest treasure chest or a big 

2186
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:40,480
chest or brock's that type of thing.

2187
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:45,480
It's missing its lid and the sarcophagus
represents something that you've put a 

2188
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:45,700
body in.
You don't think that's correct?

2189
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:46,420
No.
Correct.

2190
02:00:46,421 --> 02:00:50,590
That's why I don't like calling it 
fergus coffer is more generic,

2191
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:51,720
should we say.
Right.

2192
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:56,970
And doesn't,
the king's chamber has some of the more 

2193
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:56,970
complicated stones,
right?

2194
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:56,970
Larger.
Oh,

2195
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:58,750
it has.
It's lined with granite.

2196
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:03,960
So the primary construction material of.
There you go.

2197
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:11,910
The primary construction material for 
the great pyramid is limestone,

2198
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:17,690
right?
Some of the limestone was quarried 

2199
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:18,250
pretty much onsite and you can still see
the quarries there,

2200
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:22,000
other high quality limestone known as 
tour limestone,

2201
02:01:22,001 --> 02:01:27,001
which brought from across denial and you
can still see the turro limestone 

2202
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:32,251
quarries and then granite which used for
parts of the construction,

2203
02:01:33,130 --> 02:01:36,490
particularly to line the king's chamber.
And this grant,

2204
02:01:36,491 --> 02:01:39,110
it was brought from southern Egypt,
brought up,

2205
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:41,300
brought down the nile,
I should say,

2206
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:46,510
from the south to the north,
now flows from the south to the north 

2207
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:49,730
and it's asked one grant and you're 
talking about huge blocks of stone up to

2208
02:01:49,731 --> 02:01:54,731
90 tons or so have been the estimates 
for those particular stones in the 

2209
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:55,640
king's chamber.

2210
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:00,640
So when you go into the king's chAmber,
it's totally lined with this beautiful 

2211
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,490
red as juan.
Granted,

2212
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:05,090
you've got this big coffer there that,
you know,

2213
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,950
they give you permission,
you can lie in.

2214
02:02:06,951 --> 02:02:08,000
And,
uh,

2215
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:09,850
it's a neat feeling,
uh,

2216
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:11,960
to lie in and a lot of people have,
you know,

2217
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:14,310
all kinds of experiences,
et cetera.

2218
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:17,660
It's really incredible.
But it is these,

2219
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:23,590
this lining is so perfect and so well 
fit together and you have this,

2220
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,120
uh,
you know,

2221
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,280
all the sides,
a roof,

2222
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:30,470
the ceiling,
the roof,

2223
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:32,720
the ceiling of it,
um,

2224
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:34,700
the walls of it,
the floor of it,

2225
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:37,490
the coffer there,
and then you have,

2226
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,880
um,
what they call star chefs are air shafts

2227
02:02:40,881 --> 02:02:45,881
that go out to a north and south.
That's what robert has worked on in 

2228
02:02:45,881 --> 02:02:47,210
part.
And then above the king's chamber,

2229
02:02:47,211 --> 02:02:50,420
you have the so called relief chambers 
or relieving chambers,

2230
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,220
which you can't get into normally.

2231
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:54,410
I've been in there a few times,
uh,

2232
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:59,411
but you have to get special permission.
they have to put a ladder up from the 

2233
02:02:59,411 --> 02:03:00,770
grand gallery and you go through this 
little snake hole,

2234
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:02,160
so to speak,
um,

2235
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:07,240
to get up there.
But there's these chambers above it 

2236
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:10,270
which seemed to serve no function.
That's why they're called relief 

2237
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:13,640
chambers or relieving chambers because 
there was early speculation that somehow

2238
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:16,670
they help distribute the weight of the 
great pyramid,

2239
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:19,340
but engineering from an engineering 
point of view,

2240
02:03:19,341 --> 02:03:22,400
they don't seem to work or it doesn't 
seem to make any difference.

2241
02:03:22,401 --> 02:03:27,401
I mean the rest of the pyramid solid and
other pyramids are solid and don't 

2242
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:31,631
collapse without.
Why do they copy these chamber and It's 

2243
02:03:31,631 --> 02:03:35,081
called the king's chamber.
Basically the arabs called it that 

2244
02:03:35,081 --> 02:03:36,350
because their concept was,
if I remember correctly,

2245
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:41,180
that men will have a chamber with a flat
ceiling on it.

2246
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:43,870
The queens chamber,
which is lower down in the,

2247
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:48,950
um,
a pyramid has a inverted v shape change 

2248
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,540
a ceiling to it and they thought that 
was for the queen.

2249
02:03:53,541 --> 02:03:58,541
That would be female.
The king's chamber would be for the 

2250
02:03:58,541 --> 02:04:01,481
male.
It's also the more impressive chamber 

2251
02:04:01,481 --> 02:04:01,790
speculation.
Purely speculation.

2252
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:02,720
Yeah.
It's purely spec.

2253
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:04,110
Now,
the coffer,

2254
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:09,140
this giant stone box.
One of the things that I read was that 

2255
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:12,770
the way it was built,
they believed that it was possible that 

2256
02:04:12,931 --> 02:04:14,610
cores were drilled out.

2257
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:15,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2258
02:04:15,181 --> 02:04:18,900
Probably the corn.
And we have good evidence for that going

2259
02:04:18,901 --> 02:04:22,950
back to earliest dynastic times of not 
earlier that they,

2260
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:28,240
um,
I forget what you call it in modern 

2261
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:28,240
times,
but uh,

2262
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:31,971
you have a drill bit that is circular in
shape and it drills out a core.

2263
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:35,400
So you know,
they were drilling granite.

2264
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36,690
You,
again,

2265
02:04:36,691 --> 02:04:41,691
if it's on display,
I could show you in the egyptian museum 

2266
02:04:41,691 --> 02:04:42,420
in cairo,
sarcophagi guy,

2267
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:48,200
which probably really worse or carf a 
guy or at these big granite boxes where 

2268
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,980
they were signed the granite.
In fact,

2269
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:52,800
not only were they saw you,
it looks like they were using high speed

2270
02:04:52,801 --> 02:04:57,801
saws because in some cases they would 
make a little mistake and then have to 

2271
02:04:57,801 --> 02:05:01,080
back off and then go at it again.
You don't do that if you're,

2272
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:03,810
in my opinion,
if you're doing it by hand,

2273
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:06,480
you know,
back and forth with a,

2274
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,480
there's some sort of machinery involved.

2275
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:11,970
There's some kind of machining they were
using.

2276
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,280
And very ancient times.
There's,

2277
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:16,920
once you open your eyes to it,
you see it.

2278
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:21,600
Where you see it seems to be high speed 
machinery.

2279
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:23,670
There's no regulation as to how,
oh,

2280
02:05:23,671 --> 02:05:25,260
there's lots of speculation.
I mean,

2281
02:05:25,261 --> 02:05:30,261
some people say they had electric motors
and electricity and all that type of 

2282
02:05:30,261 --> 02:05:30,810
thing.
Some people.

2283
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:35,960
Yeah.
Some people I don't go there because I 

2284
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,151
want real evidence,
so I see real evidence that they were 

2285
02:05:38,151 --> 02:05:41,751
doing things that seem really 
unbelievable from a standard status quo 

2286
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:49,020
conventional point of view.
Say that standard Egypt logical point of

2287
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:51,180
view of how cool,
how primitive they were.

2288
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:56,690
Right.
But I'm not into speculating in 

2289
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:59,901
ordinarily as to,
well what kind of technology they might 

2290
02:05:59,901 --> 02:06:00,390
have had.
I just don't know at this point.

2291
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:03,450
Yeah.
So there are images of the inside of the

2292
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:08,451
sarcophagus,
like we could get a look at what that 

2293
02:06:08,451 --> 02:06:08,451
looks like.

2294
02:06:08,451 --> 02:06:08,451
Oh,
it's not very impressive.

2295
02:06:08,451 --> 02:06:12,651
I'm sure he can probably,
I don't know if you can see the drill 

2296
02:06:12,651 --> 02:06:12,651
marks they have essentially.
No.

2297
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:15,150
Um,
but you know,

2298
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:17,880
they're there.
You can see other places.

2299
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:23,060
So for instance,
when we go into the valley temple next 

2300
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:28,011
to it,
there's one of the doors that was on 

2301
02:06:28,011 --> 02:06:31,311
huge hinges and I don't think you're 
going to find pictures of this on the 

2302
02:06:31,311 --> 02:06:33,070
internet because it's very hard to 
photograph a,

2303
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,350
but when you look at that in person,
you can see how they drilled out,

2304
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:40,020
you know,
the hinge several,

2305
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:44,970
several inches in diameter and did a 
core drill because you can still see,

2306
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:50,180
if I remember there,
you can still see the sort of the stub 

2307
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:50,180
where it broke off.
Oh wow.

2308
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:54,770
Yeah.
You can see how they were using 

2309
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:56,540
sophisticated techniques to do this,
but no idea whatsoever.

2310
02:06:56,541 --> 02:06:58,470
But I don't know what cad.

2311
02:06:58,740 --> 02:06:59,820
Well,
put it this way,

2312
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,560
if we,
and this is.

2313
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,750
I'm not speculating that they had such 
things,

2314
02:07:03,751 --> 02:07:08,670
but you can tell in modern times that 
someone used a power,

2315
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:11,820
saw a power drill or this type of tour,
that type of tool.

2316
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:17,330
Thousands of years from now.
You might be able to still see that in 

2317
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:17,330
this table.
Yeah.

2318
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:22,191
I'm like beyond interpreted,
but you don't have a single example of 

2319
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:22,740
the tool that was actually used for.
Right,

2320
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:24,960
right.
We know these guys.

2321
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:28,200
I sometimes almost find it silly when 
people say,

2322
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,730
well,
here we go.

2323
02:07:29,731 --> 02:07:31,620
No,
this how could out there.

2324
02:07:31,621 --> 02:07:33,870
That's a nice example of it.
Okay.

2325
02:07:33,871 --> 02:07:35,680
There we go.
That's a good example.

2326
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:40,681
Yeah,
that's actually probably the one I was 

2327
02:07:40,681 --> 02:07:42,241
just talking about us as a bore hole and
you can see the,

2328
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:48,390
how it was spinning.
You can see how they were cutting down 

2329
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:48,390
quite a bit in each turn.

2330
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,240
So,
so,

2331
02:07:49,241 --> 02:07:51,820
so I almost find it.
I don't almost find.

2332
02:07:51,821 --> 02:07:56,260
I do find it silly sometimes when people
say to me the critics or skeptics,

2333
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:56,830
oh,
you know,

2334
02:07:56,831 --> 02:07:58,180
if they were doing all of this stuff 
will,

2335
02:07:58,181 --> 02:08:01,950
where's examples of their tools?
Let me.

2336
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,690
How many guys just leave,
you know,

2337
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:07,360
they walk away from a site and they 
leave their buck toolbox.

2338
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:10,150
There are even our.
Forget.

2339
02:08:10,151 --> 02:08:11,140
I mean,
all the,

2340
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:14,770
all the mechanics I've ever known and 
people like that,

2341
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:20,250
they're very careful to pick up every 
tool and put it back and make sure 

2342
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:24,181
they've got all their equipment will go 
to the building and try to find a 

2343
02:08:24,181 --> 02:08:24,181
hammer.
Right?

2344
02:08:24,181 --> 02:08:24,460
Yeah,
exactly.

2345
02:08:24,461 --> 02:08:25,840
Yeah.
No,

2346
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:27,970
that completely makes sense.
But man,

2347
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:34,480
I would just like to know,
like what were they doing and how did 

2348
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:34,480
they make that whole.
That's,

2349
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:38,790
that's a massive,
massive mr right in front of everyone's 

2350
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:38,790
face.
Yeah,

2351
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:39,250
yeah,
exactly.

2352
02:08:39,251 --> 02:08:43,570
What's the standard eds egyptologists 
explanation.

2353
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:51,340
They just really,
they just shrug their shoulders all we 

2354
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:51,340
see that all the time.
Well,

2355
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:52,030
great.
You see it all the time,

2356
02:08:52,031 --> 02:08:54,540
but it reminds me of,
um,

2357
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:57,430
this is maybe silly,
but I'm going to say it any way.

2358
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:59,010
Uh,
no,

2359
02:08:59,011 --> 02:08:59,650
I don't know.
Well,

2360
02:08:59,651 --> 02:09:03,550
I'll say it anyway.
A supposedly a analogy.

2361
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:07,370
You know,
if you,

2362
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:09,400
if you're used to something,
I'll put it this way.

2363
02:09:09,401 --> 02:09:11,980
If you're used to seeing something on a 
regular basis,

2364
02:09:11,981 --> 02:09:13,930
you start,
you stop questioning.

2365
02:09:13,931 --> 02:09:15,950
It just becomes,
um,

2366
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:21,380
common to you,
but you don't really question it.

2367
02:09:21,381 --> 02:09:26,381
It's like technology today.
How many people could explain how even 

2368
02:09:26,381 --> 02:09:29,200
the most rudimentary sense,
how some of the technology works that we

2369
02:09:29,201 --> 02:09:31,750
have today.
The egyptologist seemed to.

2370
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:37,320
They just get immune to it.
They see all this fabulous stuff and 

2371
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:40,741
they just forget that will this was made
somehow we don't really know how it was 

2372
02:09:40,741 --> 02:09:40,741
made.

2373
02:09:40,741 --> 02:09:45,570
Then they again go back to the 
simplistic explanations of,

2374
02:09:46,031 --> 02:09:46,490
oh,
you know,

2375
02:09:46,491 --> 02:09:50,710
on some new kingdom or late period we 
have this illustration.

2376
02:09:50,711 --> 02:09:55,711
This must be how they did it and I'm not
convinced that that's always how they 

2377
02:09:55,711 --> 02:09:58,210
did it.
Almost just to look a little cartoon.

2378
02:09:58,260 --> 02:09:59,460
Right.
Did they have any illustrators?

2379
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:05,560
They would have a drill and some stones 
around it as a wage to keep it spinning.

2380
02:10:07,511 --> 02:10:08,530
No,
I haven't seen that.

2381
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:11,020
Yeah.
You might have had.

2382
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:11,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2383
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:17,100
I mean there's.
So you think that's just purely 

2384
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:17,100
speculation?
Yeah.

2385
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,921
Or it could be sort of the equivalent 
modern cartoons of a,

2386
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:25,790
you know,
simple explanation of how something 

2387
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:27,010
works and a lot of that is really more 
to say,

2388
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:29,080
okay,
if you're a watchmaker,

2389
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:31,450
I say 200 years ago,
you're a watchmaker,

2390
02:10:31,451 --> 02:10:34,820
you might have some sign that indicates 
you're a watchmaker,

2391
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:40,210
but don't try to take that sign is a 
blueprint of how you actually made 

2392
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:40,210
watches.

2393
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:40,640
Right,
right.

2394
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:41,660
That makes sense.
No,

2395
02:10:41,661 --> 02:10:42,650
it does.
It does.

2396
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:46,250
Um,
so the,

2397
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:51,200
when they constructed that coffer,
they somehow or another board,

2398
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:56,290
yeah,
they probably board down maybe board in 

2399
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:56,290
the quarters board down,
broke out pieces,

2400
02:10:56,290 --> 02:11:01,001
this a speculation now and broke it out.
And then once you've got it roughed out,

2401
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:04,610
then polished the surfaces,
that type of thing.

2402
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:07,220
Um,
so you know,

2403
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:11,150
if you leave any traces of how it was 
actually constructed,

2404
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,970
that's not as good as if there are no 
trace.

2405
02:11:14,971 --> 02:11:15,830
It's more or less,
you know,

2406
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:19,370
it's not as good a job.
You look at something like the statue of

2407
02:11:19,371 --> 02:11:24,371
kafra or chef ron.
This is credible statue and the egyptian

2408
02:11:25,611 --> 02:11:26,600
museum,
again,

2409
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:31,780
it's the one that has the face of the 
pharaoh that supposedly was the face of 

2410
02:11:31,881 --> 02:11:36,881
the sphinx,
which they don't match up at all as the 

2411
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:36,881
hawk control has a haka shoulders.

2412
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:40,700
Uh,
that statue is absolutely incredible.

2413
02:11:40,701 --> 02:11:43,160
You know,
it's so smoothly polished,

2414
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:48,170
etc.
You have to look very hard to find a 

2415
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:50,340
tool marks or evidence of how it was car
because you know,

2416
02:11:50,341 --> 02:11:55,341
a really good work and ship,
you remove all that ultimately.

2417
02:11:56,870 --> 02:12:01,870
So that's part of the problem with some 
of this really high quality egyptian 

2418
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:05,270
work is that they would remove the 
traces.

2419
02:12:05,271 --> 02:12:05,600
Yeah.
There,

2420
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,370
there it is.
Um,

2421
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:12,620
the,
they would remove the traces of how it 

2422
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:15,770
was made in that image.
The thing on the side of it,

2423
02:12:15,771 --> 02:12:18,020
you see that sort of plasma formation.
Yes,

2424
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:20,420
absolutely.
Because this ties in.

2425
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:25,421
This is why I brought image of this 
because it ties in with that whole 

2426
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:29,000
scenario.
Well,

2427
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,530
it has the circle said,
well,

2428
02:12:30,531 --> 02:12:32,090
exactly.
Very observant.

2429
02:12:32,091 --> 02:12:37,091
And think about the bird headed man,
the hoc and this incredible statue.

2430
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:43,190
If you feel it face on,
you don't see the bird from the side.

2431
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:45,610
You see the bird.
God,

2432
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:48,220
it's incredible.
All of this stuff is so fascinating,

2433
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:53,240
so I think it really all goes back to 
this very early formative period.

2434
02:12:54,471 --> 02:12:59,471
If you would this really important 
period for humanity and what was 

2435
02:12:59,471 --> 02:13:03,671
happening.
There's a head on view and there you 

2436
02:13:03,671 --> 02:13:04,160
don't see the bird at all.
Of course.

2437
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:09,610
Incredible.
And tammy carve something like that 

2438
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:10,490
today.
I don't know what it would cost,

2439
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:12,740
who you could pay.
I've heard,

2440
02:13:13,790 --> 02:13:15,020
you know,
this is anecdotal,

2441
02:13:15,021 --> 02:13:18,950
but I've talked to his stone cutters and
that type of thing and you know,

2442
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:23,750
to try to duplicate some of what they 
see in Egypt.

2443
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:29,320
I mean it just would take them so long 
and so much work and it would be so 

2444
02:13:30,501 --> 02:13:32,220
expensive with modern power

2445
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,190
tools that they basically say,
you know,

2446
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,000
who could do it?

2447
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:37,920
Do you have any fear that this is going 
to?

2448
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:42,930
Disinformation is going to be lost.
I mean that you're so far down this 

2449
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:47,741
track of sort of explaining these things
and these revolutionary theories about 

2450
02:13:48,981 --> 02:13:51,530
what happened and I don't.
This is a,

2451
02:13:51,531 --> 02:13:56,531
I been,
I've been studying this for a long time 

2452
02:13:56,531 --> 02:13:56,531
and this is the first time I'm hearing 
it,

2453
02:13:56,531 --> 02:14:01,170
so that's why I need to be on your show.
I'm so glad you're here to get this out 

2454
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:01,870
into the public.
Yeah.

2455
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:06,940
You're so far down this road.
Is there anyone else is doing the same 

2456
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:08,060
kind of work?
Does anybody else's with you on this?

2457
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:13,940
Well,
I think I'm the one that's doing this 

2458
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:16,311
right now,
but I think there are a lot of other 

2459
02:14:16,311 --> 02:14:16,980
pieces that tie in.
So per dr parata work,

2460
02:14:16,981 --> 02:14:18,540
but he served,
been,

2461
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:23,660
you know,
he had some health issues and other 

2462
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:23,660
things.
She's older.

2463
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:27,440
I'm the electric universe.
There's what's known as the electric 

2464
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:31,221
universe community,
which ties in with this that a 

2465
02:14:31,221 --> 02:14:33,360
electrical phenomenon,
plasma discharges are more important.

2466
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:36,170
There is a whole group now,
um,

2467
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:41,270
that I think are starting to think about
what if we had another carrington event 

2468
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:45,060
in the new future,
how would that affect our grid systems?

2469
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:48,810
So what I'm saying is I think there are 
a lot of little pieces that are starting

2470
02:14:48,811 --> 02:14:53,220
to come together and you know,
starting to come together,

2471
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:56,610
weaving this together,
but what I'm trying to do right now,

2472
02:14:56,611 --> 02:15:01,611
it's to paint the broad picture,
the broad strokes and I think it goes 

2473
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:06,150
back to the end of the last ice age and 
what was happening then,

2474
02:15:06,450 --> 02:15:10,320
right up until now and what the 
implications are

2475
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:15,950
and how is this being received.
Are people picking up on that for 

2476
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:16,490
picking

2477
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:19,020
up on it and sometimes the,
you know,

2478
02:15:19,021 --> 02:15:20,730
people are picking up on it.
When,

2479
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,840
how did they say it,
the sincereness,

2480
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:28,620
was it copying someone or is this 
sincerest form of flattery,

2481
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:36,050
imitation that should imitation.
And I do find and I'm kind of sometimes 

2482
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:38,580
get a little annoyed.
Yeah.

2483
02:15:38,581 --> 02:15:40,950
People are starting to talk about a lot 
of these things,

2484
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:46,070
especially the plasma and the sun and 
solar events and all of a sudden by 

2485
02:15:46,070 --> 02:15:49,020
chance they're talking about it.
Not necessarily mentioning me,

2486
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:51,000
but I think,
you know,

2487
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:54,450
I know they tend to lecture or they 
maybe read my book.

2488
02:15:54,451 --> 02:15:59,451
But yeah,
these things take time and I'm not 

2489
02:15:59,451 --> 02:15:59,451
asking for a lot of,
you know,

2490
02:15:59,451 --> 02:16:01,850
everyone has to acknowledge me,
uh,

2491
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:07,280
but I think it's important to get the 
information out and I think as we have 

2492
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:12,290
things like your podcast and people read
the books and I'm able to talk at 

2493
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:13,800
conferences,
we slowly get this out.

2494
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:14,760
Well,
you know,

2495
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:16,050
it takes time.
It all takes time.

2496
02:16:16,070 --> 02:16:18,540
Made me put it this way.
Copernicus,

2497
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:20,700
and I'm not comparing myself to 
copernicus,

2498
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:26,030
but copernicus and the um,
heliocentric view,

2499
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:32,290
now he publishes that on his death bed.
That was a view that actually went back 

2500
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,130
to,
um,

2501
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:35,380
there were predecessors in ancient 
times,

2502
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:40,381
of course,
but he published his on his death bed 

2503
02:16:40,381 --> 02:16:40,560
and um,
you know,

2504
02:16:40,570 --> 02:16:45,570
a couple generations later they're still
persecuting galileo for supporting it.

2505
02:16:45,791 --> 02:16:47,530
So these things,
yeah,

2506
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,990
things go quicker now.
Yeah.

2507
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:53,920
But it still takes some time.
I see a big difference now,

2508
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:59,150
uh,
than I do in the 19 nineties for even 

2509
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:00,100
the reading of the sphinx,
you see,

2510
02:17:00,101 --> 02:17:02,660
is because of the internet.
Uh,

2511
02:17:02,661 --> 02:17:05,470
I think it's not just,
yes,

2512
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:08,410
the internet helps.
I have mixed feelings about the internet

2513
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:12,160
because the problem with the internet is
you can disseminate information,

2514
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:17,730
you get information out,
but it doesn't mean it's good 

2515
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,480
information.
So you get the naysayers,

2516
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:21,430
the critics,
the skeptics,

2517
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,860
they have access to it,
to fake news,

2518
02:17:23,890 --> 02:17:25,750
fake news,
and genuine

2519
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
news versus real fake news.
It seems that so many times they're 

2520
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,850
flipped.
They're very much.

2521
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:36,320
So it's very confusing.
So one of the problems I see

2522
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:41,380
with all this information and 
misinformation and all these factoids 

2523
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:45,461
out there is,
it's very confusing for many people if 

2524
02:17:45,461 --> 02:17:46,040
they're not involved in something.
And again,

2525
02:17:46,041 --> 02:17:51,041
I'm not trying to claim you have to go 
to experts and authorities because 

2526
02:17:51,041 --> 02:17:52,910
that's part of the problem too,
when you have the pseudo authorities who

2527
02:17:52,911 --> 02:17:57,911
just are pushing their own agendas and 
frankly don't know what they're talking 

2528
02:17:57,911 --> 02:18:01,751
about.
And I see too many of that among we'll 

2529
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:03,260
say certain academics and skeptics,
that type of thing.

2530
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:08,730
Uh,
but it's also confusing when you only 

2531
02:18:08,730 --> 02:18:12,310
take information and you don't know how 
put altogether.

2532
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:13,690
So I teach,
you know,

2533
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,480
I teach in university,
I teach college at boston university and

2534
02:18:17,481 --> 02:18:21,140
what I find with students,
and I'm not picking on them,

2535
02:18:21,141 --> 02:18:26,141
I'm saying this with all due respect,
they have so much access to facts and 

2536
02:18:26,141 --> 02:18:27,470
factoids,
we'll use that term,

2537
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:30,230
but they have to understand the bigger 
picture.

2538
02:18:30,231 --> 02:18:34,550
They have to be able to understand 
critically and think critically about it

2539
02:18:34,551 --> 02:18:36,590
to put things together.
Um,

2540
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:41,690
and how does it all fit together and 
that that's so important.

2541
02:18:41,691 --> 02:18:46,691
And that's not something I think you get
just from surfing the internet,

2542
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:48,140
right?
Of course.

2543
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:49,800
Quickly,
no.

2544
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:54,540
Watching a couple of youtube videos by 
someone that's not necessarily reliable,

2545
02:18:54,541 --> 02:18:55,560
that's a problem,
right?

2546
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:59,390
How much misinformation that's been 
spread through youtube more.

2547
02:18:59,430 --> 02:19:02,030
More than good information probably.
I mean,

2548
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:07,070
we could put on some fake lab coats 
right now and just make some nonsense 

2549
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:09,180
video views by not exactly.
And see,

2550
02:19:09,181 --> 02:19:12,720
I've had the problem too in my business,
you know,

2551
02:19:12,721 --> 02:19:17,721
what I'm talking about is that they say 
you can't please everyone all the time.

2552
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:21,720
But it seems like in some cases in my 
career,

2553
02:19:21,721 --> 02:19:26,721
in this field,
I've been able to displease every one 

2554
02:19:26,721 --> 02:19:29,510
because I'll come out with position.
Sorry I'm losing my headset.

2555
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:34,720
I'll come out with position sometimes 
where I'm not pleasing my academic 

2556
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:36,890
colleagues,
but I'm not extreme enough for the.

2557
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:41,920
Should we say other sites either also 
like caught in the middle because I'm 

2558
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:44,740
going by the evidence I actually have 
it.

2559
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:47,120
It's not jiving with.
So to speak.

2560
02:19:47,121 --> 02:19:48,950
The foil hat brigade.
Yeah.

2561
02:19:48,970 --> 02:19:53,970
So what,
how is that received by the people that 

2562
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:55,910
mean there are those ancient aliens type
folks that really want everything.

2563
02:19:55,911 --> 02:19:57,920
They want everything to be ancient 
aliens.

2564
02:19:57,921 --> 02:20:01,520
And I've been accused of how could I not
accept this or that,

2565
02:20:01,521 --> 02:20:06,521
you know,
because they get really mad at me and 

2566
02:20:06,521 --> 02:20:08,390
they say nasty son.
They'll even tell me,

2567
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:13,400
well,
this supports what everything you've 

2568
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:15,071
been saying.
I don't care if it supports everything 

2569
02:20:15,071 --> 02:20:15,071
I've been saved.
It's not real.

2570
02:20:15,071 --> 02:20:15,920
It's not real evidence isn't there?
It's not.

2571
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:21,670
It is fascinating.
They do dig up these ancient structures 

2572
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:22,850
and the machu picchu and all these 
different places were like,

2573
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:27,851
wow,
these construction methods are really 

2574
02:20:27,851 --> 02:20:27,851
pretty impressive.
Incredible.

2575
02:20:27,851 --> 02:20:31,170
It was going on back then,
but they always want to tie it to 

2576
02:20:31,170 --> 02:20:31,170
aliens.
They always want to tie it to aliens,

2577
02:20:31,170 --> 02:20:31,880
which I think is a.

2578
02:20:32,630 --> 02:20:34,730
I hate to use this term,
but sure of a cop out.

2579
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:37,310
Yeah,
it's a business.

2580
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:40,430
That's where it gets down to a lot of 
this is business.

2581
02:20:40,431 --> 02:20:43,570
People want to sell their books.
They want to sell in their conference.

2582
02:20:43,571 --> 02:20:48,571
Just they were settled their dvds.
They want to sell their youtube videos 

2583
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,770
and in some cases they want to sell for 
money.

2584
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:54,980
In some cases they want to sell for 
promotion,

2585
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:57,410
self promotion,
and they want to be famous.

2586
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:02,530
I told you I was accused of that back in
the early nineties.

2587
02:21:02,770 --> 02:21:04,080
Oh,
I just doing this place.

2588
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:05,470
I want to be famous.
No,

2589
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:09,170
I'm not that type of person,
and people love those shows.

2590
02:21:09,171 --> 02:21:13,820
Those ufo in ancient alien type shows 
and they love those conferences.

2591
02:21:13,821 --> 02:21:17,420
They go to those conferences and they 
all just mentally masturbate together.

2592
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:20,930
Very bizarre.
It's like they're all like,

2593
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:22,790
yeah,
there's not,

2594
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:27,170
but I think it was exCiting,
but I think it does fill a void for some

2595
02:21:27,171 --> 02:21:31,700
people and one thing I'm trying to do is
to fill that void with something real,

2596
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:33,350
something important.

2597
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:38,350
Something thAt has evidence to back it 
up because there are a lot of the 

2598
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:43,331
questions.
There are a lot of mysteries and I will 

2599
02:21:43,331 --> 02:21:43,430
admit I've been on the ancient aliens 
show,

2600
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:47,510
but I've never proposed ancient aliens 
have never supported that.

2601
02:21:47,511 --> 02:21:50,120
I've always been clear.
People actually listened to me,

2602
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,210
but they asked me to be on in a number 
of other academics have to.

2603
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:56,120
Do they kick you out of context a little
bit?

2604
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:56,990
Well,
yeah,

2605
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,140
the context is not slippery,
slippery,

2606
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:05,350
but the point is that there are real 
mystery to this day.

2607
02:22:05,691 --> 02:22:10,691
Things that we don't really understand 
that you and I have been discussing 

2608
02:22:10,691 --> 02:22:11,120
about and there's so many more we could 
discuss,

2609
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:16,540
but those are real and so many people 
that I know that watched shows like 

2610
02:22:16,941 --> 02:22:21,941
that.
When I talked to them and I'm talking 

2611
02:22:21,941 --> 02:22:21,941
academics who would never admit that 
they watch it,

2612
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:24,020
they watch it because they find it 
entertaining,

2613
02:22:24,021 --> 02:22:26,070
number one,
they don't quite say it this way,

2614
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:31,070
but I think it fills a void and it does 
raise issues that if they're perceptive,

2615
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:35,700
then they might become aware of and 
realize that these are real issues.

2616
02:22:35,701 --> 02:22:40,701
No ancient aliens or some other easy 
answer is not the way to go,

2617
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:46,200
but they are real things that need to be
looked into.

2618
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:48,840
So even when I speak at a conference 
like that,

2619
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:53,310
there are so many very intelligent 
people that are there besides the other,

2620
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:55,650
but you know they're different types of 
people.

2621
02:22:55,651 --> 02:22:57,540
Sure.
But I know many people,

2622
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:02,600
they'll have phds and stuff and they'll 
go to it for a serve between 

2623
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:05,991
entertainment but also to get exposed to
things they're not going to be exposed 

2624
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:11,541
to by the standard academic community.
You're not going to get exposed to a lot

2625
02:23:13,011 --> 02:23:15,360
of this.
These types of questions.

2626
02:23:15,361 --> 02:23:19,890
If you just go to the standard closed 
academic conferences,

2627
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:21,330
they're going to be washed over.

2628
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:22,350
So,
you know,

2629
02:23:22,351 --> 02:23:26,430
I'm part what on trying to do with 
oracle,

2630
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:29,160
the organization for the research of 
ancient cultures,

2631
02:23:29,161 --> 02:23:31,260
which is not just me.
I want to be clear on that.

2632
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:32,190
In fact,
we,

2633
02:23:32,191 --> 02:23:35,700
our president is a,
uh,

2634
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:36,900
he,
he's actually,

2635
02:23:36,901 --> 02:23:40,770
I guess heavy metal guitar player.
He's really berkeley trained.

2636
02:23:40,771 --> 02:23:42,000
He's excellent.
Yeah,

2637
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:42,990
no,
I mean seriously,

2638
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:48,200
but he's,
he's a really bright guy and he's 

2639
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,481
fascinated by these things.
We have people like jocelyn godwin from 

2640
02:23:50,481 --> 02:23:54,640
colgate university who's a world 
renowned scholar on the visory board.

2641
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:59,940
Uh,
but what we're trying to do with things 

2642
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:02,610
like oracle and I will encourage people 
to actually look at it because we've got

2643
02:24:02,611 --> 02:24:04,980
a website up that you can go through my 
website,

2644
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:09,560
www.robertschoch.com
to get there or um,

2645
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:14,670
go directly to us@www.oracle.
Oh,

2646
02:24:14,671 --> 02:24:15,720
there it is.
there we go.

2647
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:20,670
Or coal online o r a,
c u l online.

2648
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:21,690
Oh,
you know,

2649
02:24:21,691 --> 02:24:26,691
all one word.org.
And what we're trying to do with this 

2650
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:32,700
and also through the institute for the 
study of the origins of civilization,

2651
02:24:32,701 --> 02:24:33,660
iso,
soc,

2652
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,520
which I'm trying to do at boston 
university,

2653
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:40,320
is to have a forum where we can look at 
these real topics,

2654
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:44,250
these topics,
these topic seriously using evidence,

2655
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:49,400
but not all but also not be dismissive 
just because we have to uphold the 

2656
02:24:49,621 --> 02:24:54,621
standard dogma.
So I don't want to go with just a 

2657
02:24:54,621 --> 02:24:54,621
nonsense,
you know,

2658
02:24:54,621 --> 02:24:59,040
flippant or easy out to sell someone's 
book that,

2659
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:01,250
you know,
this crazy book or yeah,

2660
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:03,270
I'm not being nasty about anyone,
um,

2661
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:08,370
or you know,
just stick to the standard pair of time,

2662
02:25:08,371 --> 02:25:11,460
but thinking out of the box,
but as they say,

2663
02:25:11,461 --> 02:25:15,540
but thinking out of the box,
using real evidence and using real logic

2664
02:25:15,541 --> 02:25:20,380
and using real rationality to look at a 
number of these issues,

2665
02:25:20,390 --> 02:25:24,130
they're more resistance towards a 
redating

2666
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:29,160
Egypt and Egypt technology,
particularly ancient Egypt versus other 

2667
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:30,520
cultures like go,
go back,

2668
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:35,500
like tap a and some other ancient 
structures that they're finding a tap a.

2669
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,980
The Beauty of rebecca tap bay is that 
there's no cd attached to it.

2670
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:44,100
That's right.
The dating of rebecca tap is the dating 

2671
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:48,040
that is based on hard strategic rfi 
radiocarbon dates,

2672
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:50,920
german archeological institute,
correct me if I'm wrong,

2673
02:25:50,921 --> 02:25:55,921
it's because it was pr.
It was purposely purposefully covered 

2674
02:25:55,921 --> 02:25:57,520
10,000
plus years ago.

2675
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,000
And in that case,
this ties back to our bigger picture.

2676
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:06,180
You have evidence,
we have evidence of catastrophe at 

2677
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:10,770
rebecca beckley tap bay.
We have evidence that the pillars were 

2678
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:12,700
knocked down and hastily re-erected.
Um,

2679
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:16,630
and you can see that in the pillars they
built these.

2680
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:18,010
There.
We have a picture up there.

2681
02:26:18,011 --> 02:26:21,220
If you can see the pillar on the far on 
the right side,

2682
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:23,980
that is not an archeological 
reconstruction.

2683
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:27,400
That pillar was knocked down.
It was put back into position,

2684
02:26:27,401 --> 02:26:30,220
but you can see how it was put back into
position crudely,

2685
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:35,490
using fragments of another pillar.
Then they built these crude walls to 

2686
02:26:35,951 --> 02:26:37,540
serve.
Hold the pillars up.

2687
02:26:37,541 --> 02:26:39,280
They butted against it.
Well,

2688
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:44,520
to me,
this is happening and the dating 

2689
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,951
confirms it in the aftermath of the 
initial solar outburst at the end of the

2690
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,660
last ice age when you had all this 
tumultuous,

2691
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:52,000
um,
you know,

2692
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:53,450
things happening,
uh,

2693
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:57,790
earthquakes.
And this the precipitation,

2694
02:26:57,791 --> 02:27:00,580
the rain,
the fire coming down the thunder.

2695
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:05,850
So you have this incredible situation 
where we have captured at beckley tap 

2696
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:11,360
bay the catastrophe that was going on 
and how they were trying to reconstruct 

2697
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:12,580
it and I think,
I don't want to say that gave up,

2698
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:14,950
but for whatever reason that was 
probably just so much.

2699
02:27:14,951 --> 02:27:17,830
They ended up covering the whole thing 
artificially.

2700
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,870
Maybe to preserve it.

2701
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:23,620
Maybe they intended to go back to it 
maybe for posterity.

2702
02:27:23,621 --> 02:27:27,790
I don't know what their thinking was.
We could speculate about that,

2703
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:31,270
but tying in with what you were just 
asking,

2704
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:36,690
beckley tap bay is not tied to some 
other later civilization as is dynastic 

2705
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:41,940
Egypt.
So there's a lot of dogma involved.

2706
02:27:41,950 --> 02:27:44,530
correct.
It's a dogma there is involved.

2707
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:49,531
How sophisticated is is good.
BeckleY tap a and you know those that 

2708
02:27:49,531 --> 02:27:51,610
want to uphold the standard story 
saying,

2709
02:27:51,611 --> 02:27:52,960
well yeah,
it's pretty,

2710
02:27:52,961 --> 02:27:57,961
but it's not that sophisticated,
dismissive data as hunter gatherers.

2711
02:27:58,510 --> 02:28:03,510
Yeah.
They called hunter gatherers and they 

2712
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:03,510
say,
oh,

2713
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:05,020
hunter gatherers are thereby primitive,
and therefore they,

2714
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:08,470
you know,
they just try to wave their arms and say

2715
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:12,900
it served like saying it's a normally 
but not much of a nominally,

2716
02:28:12,910 --> 02:28:17,910
so we don't need to really worry about,
but they've only correct me if I'm 

2717
02:28:17,910 --> 02:28:21,241
wrong,
they've only uncovered as very small 

2718
02:28:21,241 --> 02:28:21,241
fragment of it.

2719
02:28:21,241 --> 02:28:21,241
Yeah,
very,

2720
02:28:21,241 --> 02:28:25,531
very small.
This is an enormous structure structure 

2721
02:28:25,531 --> 02:28:28,811
and in that picture that's up.
We'll describe it for those that don't 

2722
02:28:28,811 --> 02:28:32,261
see the picture,
but there's pictures like this in my 

2723
02:28:32,261 --> 02:28:32,360
book,
forgotten civilization.

2724
02:28:32,361 --> 02:28:34,090
In fact,
I think that's right out of my book,

2725
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:39,100
probably are very similar to what you 
can see the pillar in the back on the 

2726
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:41,120
left.
Do you see how that was knocked down and

2727
02:28:41,121 --> 02:28:45,950
it's propped up and it is been put back 
into position.

2728
02:28:45,951 --> 02:28:50,951
Then they built these crude walls 
against it before they buried the whole 

2729
02:28:50,951 --> 02:28:54,281
thing.
So this whole site underwent dramatic 

2730
02:28:54,281 --> 02:28:57,230
catastrophe was being put together 
quickly again.

2731
02:28:57,231 --> 02:29:00,920
And then the animals as well.
There's,

2732
02:29:01,230 --> 02:29:02,870
yeah,
there's one right there.

2733
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:05,030
It's beautiful.
The serve,

2734
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:06,740
I call it a fee line,
sir.

2735
02:29:06,741 --> 02:29:10,730
Feline going down and theY had a carved 
the stone around that,

2736
02:29:12,850 --> 02:29:15,000
so much more complicated,
much more complicated.

2737
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,650
And when they were,
when they were carving these originally,

2738
02:29:18,651 --> 02:29:22,040
taking them out of the quarry to get,
say a 15 ton pillar,

2739
02:29:22,041 --> 02:29:23,390
I think we're looking.
Oh,

2740
02:29:23,391 --> 02:29:26,150
there we are there.
It's so beautiful.

2741
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:27,410
I love that.
Now,

2742
02:29:27,411 --> 02:29:30,710
if you saw that in a museum of modern 
art,

2743
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,230
it could fit right in.
Uh,

2744
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:38,760
uh,
two points I just wanted to make before 

2745
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:38,760
I forget them.
One,

2746
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:41,981
when you're carving these pillars to get
10 or 15 ton pillar like that finalized,

2747
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:48,160
you have to cover a much bigger chunk of
rock initially because of course you 

2748
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,140
have to leave the rock where you're 
going to have the animal.

2749
02:29:51,141 --> 02:29:55,280
You have to leave the rock because 
they're not in sizing these in.

2750
02:29:55,281 --> 02:29:58,630
They're carving them and relief.
So that's a lot more complicated kind of

2751
02:29:58,631 --> 02:29:59,600
way.
All the rock,

2752
02:29:59,601 --> 02:30:04,601
etc.
so this is an incredible technological 

2753
02:30:04,601 --> 02:30:04,850
feat.
Also off the record.

2754
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:06,920
And this one,
if you look at that one,

2755
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:10,640
do you see how it's got weather,
pig pigs and whatnot,

2756
02:30:10,641 --> 02:30:15,641
but you also see the weathered surface.
I'm going to teach you a little geology 

2757
02:30:15,641 --> 02:30:20,180
that is a older pillar that was being 
reused at the end of the last ice age,

2758
02:30:20,181 --> 02:30:25,181
I believe,
so some of these structures actually go 

2759
02:30:25,181 --> 02:30:26,990
back earlier and before klaus schmidt 
passed away unexpectedly.

2760
02:30:26,991 --> 02:30:31,991
He was talking about this too,
that even there they were maybe you 

2761
02:30:31,991 --> 02:30:35,531
reusing some structures that were a 
little bit earlier or maybe several 

2762
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:39,020
thousand years earlIer,
so this goes back.

2763
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:44,170
The origins of get back late.
Teppei may go back thousands of years 

2764
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:49,450
earlier when all said and done,
once we get the evidence in a well into 

2765
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:53,090
the end of the last ice age,
I'm stuffed out about 9,700

2766
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:58,120
bc.
I was going to say before I forget it a 

2767
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:59,540
lot going on here,
off the record,

2768
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:01,700
of course they would never admit to 
this,

2769
02:31:01,701 --> 02:31:06,701
but off the record,
I've spoken to archaeologists when 

2770
02:31:06,701 --> 02:31:10,650
they're in a giddy mood and and,
and asked them,

2771
02:31:12,081 --> 02:31:13,160
well,
if you just found,

2772
02:31:13,370 --> 02:31:18,370
say that animal on the glabella tip a 
pillar in isolation or you just found 

2773
02:31:18,801 --> 02:31:21,510
one of these pillars are part of one in 
isolation.

2774
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:24,540
You were just looking at how do you 
think it would be,

2775
02:31:24,541 --> 02:31:29,541
and I've heard the answer 600 bc,
a thousand bc based on the technology,

2776
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:33,460
you know,
the technological finesse,

2777
02:31:33,461 --> 02:31:37,320
the beauty of the carving,
not eight,

2778
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:38,850
9,000
years earlier,

2779
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:39,810
right?
Yeah.

2780
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:41,940
But they would never say that on the 
record.

2781
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:43,140
Right,
right,

2782
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:44,220
right.
Yeah.

2783
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:46,530
Because it's so complicated to monkey.
Yeah.

2784
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:47,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

2785
02:31:47,161 --> 02:31:48,660
And then.
But I've had them say that,

2786
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:49,860
well if I,
they just found,

2787
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:55,040
say that little feline type thing on the
side of the pillar just broken off and 

2788
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,120
just an isolation,
they'd probably say one told me,

2789
02:31:57,121 --> 02:31:59,490
yeah.
Oh maybe it's a thousand bc at most,

2790
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:02,850
right.
Most but not 9,000,

2791
02:32:02,851 --> 02:32:05,940
700 bc or whatever.
That's crazy.

2792
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:08,460
Now are,
have they Identified the quarries?

2793
02:32:08,461 --> 02:32:10,240
Were these stones?
Yeah,

2794
02:32:10,241 --> 02:32:15,241
some of them happen and they're not 
super far away as a kilometer or a bit 

2795
02:32:15,241 --> 02:32:15,270
more.

2796
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:17,220
I mean it's,
there's limestone around there,

2797
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:20,400
so it's not a situation as you have in 
Peru for instance,

2798
02:32:20,401 --> 02:32:22,950
where they're dragging this stuff,
you know,

2799
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:27,230
tens of kilometers away.
but I don't think that detracts from.

2800
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:28,180
No,
no,

2801
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:29,790
no.
What they were doing it sort of,

2802
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:31,680
yeah,
it's still crazy and um,

2803
02:32:32,430 --> 02:32:36,120
you know,
it's easy for me to say this,

2804
02:32:36,121 --> 02:32:39,210
but once you've quarried a block,
if you're moving a kilometer,

2805
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:42,480
it's not that much harder to move it 10 
kilometers,

2806
02:32:42,481 --> 02:32:44,880
it just takes more effort.
But the same technology,

2807
02:32:44,881 --> 02:32:49,881
it's really korean.
Be able to move it to begin with and 

2808
02:32:49,881 --> 02:32:52,170
then be able to carve it into these 
beautiful structures.

2809
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:57,410
And something I want to point out too is
that a lot of times when I talk about 

2810
02:32:57,410 --> 02:33:01,620
Rebecca Lee bay,
I'll make the comment about stone henge 

2811
02:33:01,620 --> 02:33:02,550
because people are familiar with 
stonehenge.

2812
02:33:03,430 --> 02:33:05,490
Stonehenge,
when you look at the blocks,

2813
02:33:05,491 --> 02:33:09,030
they're,
they're so much cruder than what we have

2814
02:33:09,031 --> 02:33:13,770
at beckley tap bay and the tap pay stone
pillars.

2815
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:18,980
The central ones particularly,
they are so beautifully carved,

2816
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:21,930
but if you look at them,
they're also very,

2817
02:33:21,931 --> 02:33:26,931
very thin and their smallest dimension 
there you can see it how thin it is and 

2818
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:31,410
that one's anthropomorphic with the belt
and the hands.

2819
02:33:31,411 --> 02:33:36,411
And that sure looks like a,
some people would say a metal buckle on 

2820
02:33:36,411 --> 02:33:39,981
it.
So that's very similar to like those 

2821
02:33:39,981 --> 02:33:39,981
easter island Is very similar to easter 
island there.

2822
02:33:39,981 --> 02:33:41,790
I think there are definite connections 
there,

2823
02:33:41,791 --> 02:33:46,791
but why shouldn't there be.
We were just talking about rango rango 

2824
02:33:46,791 --> 02:33:50,021
in ours to ago and how they were seen 
similar things in the sky,

2825
02:33:51,210 --> 02:33:56,210
but I wanted to point out that when you 
carve a pillar like that that's so thin 

2826
02:33:56,221 --> 02:34:01,221
and narrow,
that's much more difficult to keep it 

2827
02:34:01,221 --> 02:34:02,340
from snapping to keep it from breaking.
Also,

2828
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:05,970
if you see in that pillar how it's said 
into the bedrock,

2829
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:10,410
it's said in just literally very,
very shallow.

2830
02:34:11,150 --> 02:34:16,150
I'm the set into the bedrock.
Klaus schmidt commented to me that,

2831
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:22,140
and he published this too,
that they seem to be using some kind of 

2832
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:25,060
concrete or cement to help set them into
the bedrock,

2833
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:30,390
which is untold up at such an early 
period when he fIrst was excavating them

2834
02:34:31,181 --> 02:34:34,630
before he got down to the bottom.
I think he said this to me verbally.

2835
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:39,840
He estimated that about a third,
at least a third of the pillars should 

2836
02:34:40,331 --> 02:34:42,760
be set into the bedrock.
Just to hold it up,

2837
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:47,940
prop it up,
not just on the order of centimeters as 

2838
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:50,590
you find.
Is this a sturdy construction like a,

2839
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:52,140
was it?
No,

2840
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:53,350
no.
You can't touch it now.

2841
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:55,960
They won't touch it and it probably 
would fall over.

2842
02:34:55,961 --> 02:34:57,850
They have to do all kinds of supports on
it.

2843
02:34:57,851 --> 02:35:02,851
Now.
My suspicion is that initially it was 

2844
02:35:02,851 --> 02:35:04,990
not roofed over there,
that they were free standing pillars and

2845
02:35:04,991 --> 02:35:09,991
they were very,
very carefully set and balanced and 

2846
02:35:09,991 --> 02:35:12,040
everythIng was in perfect order.

2847
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:17,610
This is total speculation,
but like many of the habilis and 

2848
02:35:17,610 --> 02:35:21,091
whatnot,
they may have even had a vibration to 

2849
02:35:21,091 --> 02:35:24,961
them.
They may have purposefully vibrator 

2850
02:35:24,961 --> 02:35:24,961
picked up some kind of frequency.
You can see the.

2851
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:26,770
Yeah,
how shallow it is,

2852
02:35:26,950 --> 02:35:29,830
but they were finely tuned,
whatever you want call that,

2853
02:35:29,831 --> 02:35:34,831
and I'm not trying to claim it.
Some kind of weird machine or some 

2854
02:35:34,831 --> 02:35:37,861
people have called speculated,
but I think there was something there 

2855
02:35:37,861 --> 02:35:42,460
and resonance.
An audio cues.

2856
02:35:42,461 --> 02:35:47,461
Audio frequencies are historically very 
important in both modern structures.

2857
02:35:49,690 --> 02:35:52,660
Usually you think of as religious,
but you know,

2858
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:58,420
it affects your mental thinking and 
abilities and that type of thing.

2859
02:35:58,421 --> 02:36:00,700
So something may have been going on 
there with that.

2860
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:05,320
This may also be why they broke so 
easily during the catastrophe.

2861
02:36:05,321 --> 02:36:07,570
I shouldn't say easily.
It was a huge catastrophe.

2862
02:36:07,910 --> 02:36:10,690
Um,
but they were trying to redirect them.

2863
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:15,970
What is the timeline in terms of like 
the total uncovering that site?

2864
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,710
Oh,
in modern times.

2865
02:36:17,770 --> 02:36:18,100
I mean,
no,

2866
02:36:18,101 --> 02:36:23,101
what are they trying to do?
Like how much time do you think it's 

2867
02:36:23,101 --> 02:36:23,101
going to take for them to completely 
uncover?

2868
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,820
Oh,
if they do it carefully,

2869
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:26,350
century century.
Oh,

2870
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:27,790
could be.
It's a huge site.

2871
02:36:27,791 --> 02:36:32,791
And,
and klaus schmidt when katie and I were 

2872
02:36:32,791 --> 02:36:32,791
there,
um,

2873
02:36:32,791 --> 02:36:36,900
I think he waved his arms and he talked 
about how there's all these other hills 

2874
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:38,080
out there that probably have more under 
them.

2875
02:36:38,081 --> 02:36:43,081
I mean,
you're talking a huge complex and we 

2876
02:36:43,081 --> 02:36:45,361
know that in some cases because you see 
little fragments sticking up and that 

2877
02:36:45,361 --> 02:36:49,051
type of thing.
And also remember when you're doing 

2878
02:36:49,051 --> 02:36:52,801
archeology and I have training in 
archaeology despite what some of my 

2879
02:36:53,201 --> 02:36:56,680
critics would say.
When you're doing archeology,

2880
02:36:56,681 --> 02:37:01,030
it's inherently destructive because you 
can't put it back together.

2881
02:37:01,031 --> 02:37:04,150
So if you don't do it carefully,
you don't do it right.

2882
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:07,900
You're destroying evidence.
You are inherently destroying evidence.

2883
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:11,320
So a lot of people nowadays,
professionals,

2884
02:37:11,321 --> 02:37:15,100
they don't want to excavate the entire 
site at one time.

2885
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:16,130
They want leave

2886
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:21,130
parts on,
excavate it so that other people have a 

2887
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:21,830
go at it.
As you develop new technology,

2888
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:27,050
you can apply that to a different part 
of the site,

2889
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:30,800
plus practical things.
This is in Turkey,

2890
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:35,000
it's close to the syrian border.
Um,

2891
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:40,460
and we know how the political situation 
there is with this l'amec state,

2892
02:37:40,461 --> 02:37:42,680
etc.
They would love to destroy this site.

2893
02:37:42,681 --> 02:37:43,730
I'm sure.
Really,

2894
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:45,500
it's very close to earth,
uh,

2895
02:37:45,530 --> 02:37:50,530
which is the city of abraham.
It's a very sacred holy site,

2896
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,900
um,
for judaism,

2897
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:55,100
christianity.
But more than anything else,

2898
02:37:55,130 --> 02:38:00,130
islam get beckley.
Teppei is just outside psychic power 

2899
02:38:00,621 --> 02:38:04,420
drive by taxi.
I'm from earth in earth.

2900
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:05,420
Uh,
you have the,

2901
02:38:05,421 --> 02:38:07,760
um,
sacred cave of abraham.

2902
02:38:07,761 --> 02:38:10,910
You have the pools of abraham,
you have big mosque there.

2903
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:16,330
And I bring this all up because this is 
a very ancient city when they excavate 

2904
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:19,150
in earth,
uh,

2905
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:23,860
not archeological excavations,
but say they build a new road or they do

2906
02:38:24,110 --> 02:38:28,700
build a new underground garage,
they often hit 12,000

2907
02:38:28,701 --> 02:38:31,370
year old or there abouts remains.

2908
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:34,040
So there's this beautiful statue called 
earth,

2909
02:38:34,041 --> 02:38:36,810
a man,
which is now in the museum and five,

2910
02:38:36,940 --> 02:38:40,340
which also has just lots of artifacts 
from beckley tap bay.

2911
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:43,830
And it was found right near the,
um,

2912
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:47,510
modern pools of abraham when they were 
doing some construction project,

2913
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:52,750
but it represents an image of the people
supposedly are at least it's an image of

2914
02:38:57,471 --> 02:39:01,760
a man or person that gates back to go 
back 10 times.

2915
02:39:01,761 --> 02:39:04,310
It's about full sites.
It's about the same size as me,

2916
02:39:04,430 --> 02:39:09,430
but lucky legs very similar actually has
a lot of comparisons to the moai on 

2917
02:39:10,461 --> 02:39:12,170
easter island.
Got a picture of this.

2918
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:14,420
I think we do.
I think we do.

2919
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:16,320
Is that beautiful?
Wow.

2920
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:21,580
Look,
he's staring at you with obsidian eyes 

2921
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:23,430
and he is from beckley tech time,
but he was found in earth.

2922
02:39:23,431 --> 02:39:26,000
Uh,
and you're not going to do it.

2923
02:39:26,001 --> 02:39:31,001
We're not going to do it,
but if you could just wipe out the 

2924
02:39:31,001 --> 02:39:33,281
modern city and excavate there,
who knows what you would find 

2925
02:39:34,130 --> 02:39:35,190
potentially erf.

2926
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:36,160
Uh,
uh,

2927
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:40,100
this is me speaking as one of the oldest
inhabited cities on earth.

2928
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:45,380
I'm going back to the late ice age.
Well,

2929
02:39:45,381 --> 02:39:47,690
this is something that goes on in Mexico
city as well,

2930
02:39:47,691 --> 02:39:48,310
right?
Yeah,

2931
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:50,370
sure.
Building apartment building,

2932
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:55,300
all kinds of things on an aztec temple 
and,

2933
02:39:55,301 --> 02:39:58,310
and,
and in cairo and other parts of Egypt.

2934
02:39:58,311 --> 02:40:03,311
There were families that lived for 
centuries because their little huts or 

2935
02:40:03,311 --> 02:40:07,310
the community was on the top of ancient 
ruins and they would dig in their 

2936
02:40:07,551 --> 02:40:10,760
basement and pull out a gold statuette 
or whatever,

2937
02:40:10,761 --> 02:40:13,880
sell it and you know,
eat for the six months.

2938
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:14,100
So

2939
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:19,100
is this earth a place?
Is there any consideration to like 

2940
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:21,250
picking isolated spots and starting to 
dig in?

2941
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:26,650
I think there's some consideration on 
the part of archeologist and turkish 

2942
02:40:27,781 --> 02:40:29,100
government,
that type of thing,

2943
02:40:29,101 --> 02:40:34,101
but you've also got a very strong 
religious elements you mentioned placed 

2944
02:40:34,101 --> 02:40:34,380
into all of this.
Of course.

2945
02:40:34,890 --> 02:40:38,960
And also,
you don't necessarily want to destroy a,

2946
02:40:39,490 --> 02:40:41,300
uh,
ancient islamic temple,

2947
02:40:41,301 --> 02:40:46,050
say islamic mosque,
a mosque that goes back to,

2948
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,460
I don't know,
I'm just making this up.

2949
02:40:47,461 --> 02:40:52,461
Eight hundred 80 or something to 
excavate something that's a few thousand

2950
02:40:52,951 --> 02:40:55,170
years old,
a thousand years older or 10,000

2951
02:40:55,171 --> 02:40:56,940
years old or more,
I mean,

2952
02:40:56,941 --> 02:40:57,570
yeah.
Again,

2953
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:00,720
on the one hand,
which am I more interested,

2954
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:05,750
it might be one versus the other,
but other people are interested in the 

2955
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:08,571
other car.
I mean there's all these factors that 

2956
02:41:08,571 --> 02:41:08,760
play into it.
So it gets very complicated,

2957
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:09,720
very messy.

2958
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:15,020
And then of course You have this 
situation and this ties in where,

2959
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:19,170
you know,
I know christians are more interested in

2960
02:41:19,171 --> 02:41:24,171
the birth of jesus and where the mangers
and we can see in Egypt of one's 

2961
02:41:24,171 --> 02:41:28,590
interested to suppose that place where 
the holy family stayed when jesus went 

2962
02:41:28,801 --> 02:41:29,850
to Egypt,
you know,

2963
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:32,010
whatever.
Um,

2964
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:34,300
and you can see things like that in 
earth,

2965
02:41:34,301 --> 02:41:36,450
uh,
for abraham and whatnot.

2966
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:41,480
And how do you respect that with.
But also why excavate underneath.

2967
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:47,810
And then some people would say 
excavating underneath is sacrilegious 

2968
02:41:47,810 --> 02:41:47,880
to,
you know,

2969
02:41:47,881 --> 02:41:50,130
what their main interest is,
you know,

2970
02:41:50,131 --> 02:41:51,630
so it gets very,
very complicated.

2971
02:41:51,631 --> 02:41:55,160
I've met phds in Egypt,
uh,

2972
02:41:55,170 --> 02:41:57,810
one in particular.
Just to tell you a quick anecdote,

2973
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:02,580
I'm sitting there having breakfast.
This was in the 19 nineties and um,

2974
02:42:02,730 --> 02:42:06,860
it was in a hotel where it's overlooking
the pyramid and sphinx.

2975
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:08,400
I'm looking at them,
nice.

2976
02:42:08,401 --> 02:42:10,860
Having a nice breakfast.
That guy comes down and sits with me,

2977
02:42:10,861 --> 02:42:13,080
joins with may,
start making conversation.

2978
02:42:13,081 --> 02:42:16,170
Turns out he said,
I'm cairo university,

2979
02:42:16,470 --> 02:42:18,210
you know,
economics.

2980
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:21,300
I think he's a professor of economics or
whatnot.

2981
02:42:21,630 --> 02:42:25,550
And he starts telling me because it's 
obvious I'm not a chip shit,

2982
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:28,890
why am I there?
I'm staying the pyramids.

2983
02:42:28,891 --> 02:42:33,180
And then he starts telling me his 
opinion of all this was opinion,

2984
02:42:33,181 --> 02:42:37,200
was that the pyramid should be 
dismantled.

2985
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:41,670
Get rid of this finks don't need any of 
that.

2986
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:47,240
Used those raw materials on site to 
build a cupboard over air condition 

2987
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:53,190
shopping mall bigger than the one in 
dubai.

2988
02:42:54,210 --> 02:42:59,210
And that would really benefit Egypt 
economically and otherwise.

2989
02:42:59,310 --> 02:43:04,310
Who said this?
He was a professor at our university.

2990
02:43:05,070 --> 02:43:08,580
I might not know his name,
but I have no question.

2991
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:12,040
He was genuine and real and I didn't or 
anything

2992
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:16,690
because it was serious,
but where's he coming from?

2993
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:19,150
Impart Egypt.
Didn't mean anything to him.

2994
02:43:19,151 --> 02:43:22,690
Dynastic egyptians.
Lot of egyptians do.

2995
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:26,410
It means something to them,
but there's a lot of egyptians in Egypt.

2996
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:29,050
They're muslim.
If it's pre muslim,

2997
02:43:29,051 --> 02:43:31,660
it's not a big deal.
If it's pre arab,

2998
02:43:31,661 --> 02:43:34,780
it's not a big deal because they're 
arabs.

2999
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:39,040
They might've been in Egypt for over a 
thousand years,

3000
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:43,350
but the native egyptians is not their 
culture.

3001
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,530
Culture.
Wow.

3002
02:43:44,890 --> 02:43:46,200
Well,
but it's not.

3003
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:51,780
Think about America,
how many native native american mounds 

3004
02:43:52,421 --> 02:43:56,290
and raves and whatnot get bulldozed over
with that.

3005
02:43:56,291 --> 02:44:01,291
Maybe the most preliminary archeological
salvage to build a shopping mall or a 

3006
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:05,740
neW development.
It's the same thing.

3007
02:44:05,741 --> 02:44:10,741
It's the same thing.
We think it's really crazy when someone 

3008
02:44:10,741 --> 02:44:11,560
like that would say that about the 
pyramids and sphinx,

3009
02:44:11,561 --> 02:44:13,330
you know,
because everyone knows about them,

3010
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:16,690
but from his perspective,
if I quizzed him,

3011
02:44:16,691 --> 02:44:18,100
he could have turned around and said,
well,

3012
02:44:18,101 --> 02:44:19,660
look what you do in your country.

3013
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:24,900
Well,
it's almost human nature across the 

3014
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:25,480
planet when they're inconsiderate to do 
something along those lines.

3015
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:28,260
So my point is not really to criticise 
him.

3016
02:44:28,270 --> 02:44:31,490
He had very different perspective.
Um,

3017
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:34,270
it's,
I don't agree with that perspective,

3018
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:37,600
but I could understand where he was 
coming from.

3019
02:44:37,601 --> 02:44:40,570
He wasn't coming,
he wasn't some crate,

3020
02:44:40,580 --> 02:44:44,260
he didn't strike me as some crazy 
fundamentalists or anything like that.

3021
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:49,000
He was just thinking in different terms 
and for him,

3022
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:52,510
and he's not the only one I've spoken to
in Egypt.

3023
02:44:52,511 --> 02:44:55,870
Egyptians a who'd take that perspective 
now.

3024
02:44:55,871 --> 02:44:58,420
Others will say we have to save all 
these,

3025
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:03,720
but not necessarily because they could 
care less about pyramids and sphinxes 

3026
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:06,730
and tombs,
but because they're good for the economy

3027
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:12,300
because it brings in tourism.
But then there's the counter argument 

3028
02:45:12,300 --> 02:45:15,580
which I've heard many times that Egypt 
has to separate itself from tourism.

3029
02:45:15,850 --> 02:45:18,610
So you need to cut off the nipple.

3030
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:23,700
Yes,
because I've had egyptian say to me in 

3031
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:28,021
no uncertain terms,
and I'm not joking or anything but 

3032
02:45:28,151 --> 02:45:30,460
pointed out that depending on how you 
count it,

3033
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:35,520
you know,
25 percent to 60 percent or more of the 

3034
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:36,880
egyptian economy could be based on 
tourism because it's not just the direct

3035
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:41,881
tourism,
but it's those that supply the people 

3036
02:45:41,881 --> 02:45:41,881
who deal with the tourists,
et cetera,

3037
02:45:41,881 --> 02:45:46,671
et cetera,
and when you have a situation that you 

3038
02:45:46,671 --> 02:45:48,490
have something happen in the middle east
could be far from Egypt,

3039
02:45:50,110 --> 02:45:51,520
but people get excited,
you know,

3040
02:45:51,521 --> 02:45:53,190
americans all of a sudden tell me,
oh,

3041
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:58,200
I can't go to Egypt.
That's my interest to go to Egypt 

3042
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:01,591
because something happened in Syria.
That's what I heard and it has nothing 

3043
02:46:01,591 --> 02:46:01,591
to do.
No,

3044
02:46:01,591 --> 02:46:05,820
but I think if our country and our 
economy was dependent upon tourism 

3045
02:46:06,161 --> 02:46:08,670
solely,
not solely,

3046
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:10,040
but portion of

3047
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:15,040
it was tourism and then something 
happens in Brazil and all of a sudden 

3048
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,290
because something happened in Brazil,
no tourists are coming to America and it

3049
02:46:18,291 --> 02:46:20,480
cripples our economy.
I mean,

3050
02:46:20,481 --> 02:46:25,481
I can Understand that perspective dog 
and completely understand their 

3051
02:46:25,481 --> 02:46:28,211
perspective.
What is the perspective in Turkey when 

3052
02:46:28,211 --> 02:46:28,211
they're dealing with go beckley?
Tempe and the.

3053
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:30,140
Well,
I think it's a mixed too.

3054
02:46:30,141 --> 02:46:32,450
I mean,
I think they're in Turkey,

3055
02:46:32,451 --> 02:46:37,451
unfortunately from my perspective,
you've got more and more rise of should 

3056
02:46:37,461 --> 02:46:42,461
we say radical islamic fundamentalism 
that doesn't really worry about such 

3057
02:46:42,461 --> 02:46:47,351
things,
but you also have people who seek of 

3058
02:46:47,351 --> 02:46:50,750
beckley tap a as potentially someday 
vine with the sphinx and pyramids for 

3059
02:46:52,011 --> 02:46:54,950
tourist dollars and for a destination.
I mean turkeys.

3060
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:56,180
Wonderful.
My opinion,

3061
02:46:56,181 --> 02:46:59,990
I love both Turkey and Egypt.
Just to visit them,

3062
02:46:59,991 --> 02:47:02,090
to travel through them,
that type of thing.

3063
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:05,990
Within the country you have to know what
you're doing by people travel with me,

3064
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:07,100
I know what I'm doing.

3065
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:10,970
I don't mean that nasty way.
I know and I will not take risks.

3066
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:14,690
I'll take risks for myself and I've,
as I say,

3067
02:47:14,691 --> 02:47:17,350
been on the wrong end of a garden 
center.

3068
02:47:17,390 --> 02:47:18,770
Yeah.
But happened.

3069
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:20,450
Oh,
the worst was Pakistan,

3070
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:23,960
but that's what we do in Pakistan.
I was collecting fossils.

3071
02:47:23,961 --> 02:47:26,690
This is when I was a graduate student 
and at one point,

3072
02:47:26,810 --> 02:47:29,480
um,
I was accused of carrying plastic,

3073
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:33,800
plastic explosives and all of a sudden 
had for um,

3074
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:39,000
ak 47 point myself.
Not point.

3075
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:40,320
I felt that.
Yeah,

3076
02:47:40,430 --> 02:47:43,520
they were touching it and I know enough 
about small arms.

3077
02:47:43,521 --> 02:47:48,521
These were loaded in the cocktail.
I mean their fingers were on the 

3078
02:47:48,861 --> 02:47:50,360
triggers,
not on the trigger guards.

3079
02:47:50,980 --> 02:47:51,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

3080
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:55,250
It turns out I didn't have plastic 
explosives and you know,

3081
02:47:55,251 --> 02:47:58,840
I'm a mild mannered guy and I said,
you go whatever you want to.

3082
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:04,180
I didn't do anything wrong and I 
explained and I was carrying back then a

3083
02:48:06,380 --> 02:48:11,380
little bricks,
little things of a oil based clay that I

3084
02:48:11,911 --> 02:48:16,040
guess have the texture and feel of some 
of the explosives they would use.

3085
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:21,220
We would use these when we collected 
fossils and you find a bunch of 

3086
02:48:21,220 --> 02:48:24,230
fragments to prop it up and put it into 
position as you glued them together.

3087
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:28,130
But explaining that.
Yeah,

3088
02:48:28,131 --> 02:48:29,540
yeah.
I had to explain all of that.

3089
02:48:29,541 --> 02:48:34,541
And um,
someone came from the Pakistan 

3090
02:48:34,541 --> 02:48:34,541
geological survey.
Explain that.

3091
02:48:34,541 --> 02:48:35,720
Yeah.
I really was who I was,

3092
02:48:36,470 --> 02:48:41,470
but you know,
it's a situation where people get 

3093
02:48:41,470 --> 02:48:42,650
excited and that was back in the battle 
days of,

3094
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:45,080
you know,
well I don't know if it seemed better in

3095
02:48:45,081 --> 02:48:47,350
Pakistan now,
but you know,

3096
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:54,250
they're tough situations,
but if you know how to behave and you 

3097
02:48:54,250 --> 02:48:54,250
know,
how deal with it,

3098
02:48:54,250 --> 02:48:56,450
you know how to avoid it,
you'll be okay.

3099
02:48:56,451 --> 02:48:59,960
And uh,
right now I would say Egypt is very,

3100
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:02,120
very safe.
It really is.

3101
02:49:02,121 --> 02:49:04,880
People have all kinds of misconceptions 
about Egypt.

3102
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:08,070
Turkey,
we were starting to talk about Turkey.

3103
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,650
Turkey may be going the other route a 
little bit.

3104
02:49:10,650 --> 02:49:12,690
I'm being very honest.
Uh,

3105
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:17,720
but I have no problem going with Turkey 
and I have no problem taking people to 

3106
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:21,771
Turkey,
but at this point there are certain 

3107
02:49:21,771 --> 02:49:23,220
areas I might avoid just to be on the 
safest,

3108
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:25,260
safest,
a little more slippery.

3109
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:29,040
Yeah.
But I would never endanger anyone else.

3110
02:49:29,041 --> 02:49:34,041
In fact,
I always err on the side of safety when 

3111
02:49:34,041 --> 02:49:35,600
it comes to anyone.
One else.

3112
02:49:36,110 --> 02:49:39,000
I'm not that I want to take great risks 
with myself either.

3113
02:49:39,001 --> 02:49:41,670
But you know,
sometimes as a geologist and I read that

3114
02:49:41,830 --> 02:49:43,220
I have,
I feel I have to do what I

3115
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:48,380
do.
Do you have any plans on releasing this 

3116
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:50,570
theory of coronal mass ejections and all
the things that we've talked about today

3117
02:49:50,571 --> 02:49:52,430
into something like a documentary?

3118
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:54,530
something that I might be a little bit 
more.

3119
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:58,220
I would love to do a documentary.
Something that john,

3120
02:49:58,221 --> 02:50:01,190
Anthony West and I,
we're often talking about documentary.

3121
02:50:01,191 --> 02:50:06,191
We also would like to do a film,
a full length feature film if we could 

3122
02:50:06,191 --> 02:50:09,430
get back in and whatnot.
serve a,

3123
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:14,740
how should I say it?
Semi popularized a semi fictionalized,

3124
02:50:14,741 --> 02:50:17,390
but always based on real science,
real data,

3125
02:50:17,391 --> 02:50:19,020
real evidence.
So yeah,

3126
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:23,360
I've seen so many films where they're 
about geological catastrophes,

3127
02:50:23,361 --> 02:50:26,520
whether it's huge asteroid city know or 
you know,

3128
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:29,180
san andreas fault and they're so faked.
Yeah.

3129
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:32,330
But because it's not real,
what really happened,

3130
02:50:32,331 --> 02:50:37,331
it's not really what happened and what 
I'm saying is what has happened in the 

3131
02:50:37,331 --> 02:50:41,180
past and what really will happen in the 
future if we get hit again,

3132
02:50:41,181 --> 02:50:45,770
which I hate to say this,
but from a geological perspective,

3133
02:50:45,771 --> 02:50:49,160
there is no doubt these things are 
unavoidable.

3134
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:54,460
It would be like saying we'll never have
another volcanic eruption or earthquake 

3135
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:55,790
again.
Of course we will.

3136
02:50:55,850 --> 02:51:00,850
Of course we will.
So it's better to be aware of it and 

3137
02:51:00,850 --> 02:51:00,850
prepare for it.
So yeah,

3138
02:51:00,850 --> 02:51:05,621
I'd love to do.
I'm a good film and this film would be 

3139
02:51:05,621 --> 02:51:06,350
something that would really catch on.
Well,

3140
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:08,030
if you could help us.
Well,

3141
02:51:08,031 --> 02:51:10,280
I'll connect you to people.
Maybe that would be excellent.

3142
02:51:10,281 --> 02:51:11,310
I'm serious.
I'm serious.

3143
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:13,850
This is something that katie and I,
katie,

3144
02:51:13,880 --> 02:51:17,930
for those that just tuned in,
katie's my wife and uh,

3145
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:21,080
I think you heard when we were talking 
to me for,

3146
02:51:21,081 --> 02:51:24,000
she has some background in um,
you know,

3147
02:51:24,230 --> 02:51:26,570
she was a dancer and entertainment and 
broadway,

3148
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:29,750
but film connections.
We really need to connect with them,

3149
02:51:29,840 --> 02:51:32,900
put it out there for contact information
if someone is in that.

3150
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:33,640
If someone like

3151
02:51:33,670 --> 02:51:35,750
to take hold of you,
absolutely.

3152
02:51:35,751 --> 02:51:39,620
The best way to get ahold of me would be
through my website,

3153
02:51:39,650 --> 02:51:44,650
www dot robert schoch,
s c h o c h is how the last name is 

3154
02:51:44,861 --> 02:51:47,960
spelled.com.
Or if they want to email me directly,

3155
02:51:47,961 --> 02:51:50,600
and this is on the website whole with 
this thing you're given.

3156
02:51:50,601 --> 02:51:55,601
I know.
Why should I give out the email to the 

3157
02:51:55,601 --> 02:51:58,190
contact page that my wife is to my left 
there.

3158
02:51:58,191 --> 02:52:00,130
And she said the contact page.
Nailed it.

3159
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:02,510
Um,
she said the contact page.

3160
02:52:02,540 --> 02:52:04,050
Did I say too much?
No,

3161
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:04,460
no,
no,

3162
02:52:04,461 --> 02:52:05,320
you're good.
Okay.

3163
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:10,560
Um,
so if people go to www.robertschoch.com

3164
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:16,110
and then go to the contact page,
they'll get my contact information 

3165
02:52:16,110 --> 02:52:19,651
there.
I think we have a fairly direct way to 

3166
02:52:19,651 --> 02:52:19,651
contact me.
I fall,

3167
02:52:19,651 --> 02:52:23,740
so I believe got my business address,
their boston university address office 

3168
02:52:25,150 --> 02:52:27,040
because I really am at boston 
university,

3169
02:52:27,041 --> 02:52:30,310
full time tenured faculty member.
And,

3170
02:52:30,311 --> 02:52:32,920
uh,
I'm interested if people want to contact

3171
02:52:32,921 --> 02:52:35,620
me about film,
if they want go to each with me.

3172
02:52:35,621 --> 02:52:40,621
I do tours periodically.
I'll arrange something if people have 

3173
02:52:40,621 --> 02:52:40,690
enough,
you know,

3174
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:45,710
if they want a private,
if they have enough people that would 

3175
02:52:45,710 --> 02:52:47,910
want come to make it viable or yeah,
these things cost money.

3176
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:53,400
If I were independently wealthy,
maybe I just take people for fun at my 

3177
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:53,530
expense,
but I just,

3178
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:54,460
I don't have that.

3179
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:56,610
Well,
I built a to you.

3180
02:52:56,611 --> 02:52:58,800
You Have stimulated a lot of people's 
imagination.

3181
02:52:58,801 --> 02:52:59,810
And I mentioned one more please

3182
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:05,490
chamber that chamber under the pod,
the sphinx for a quarter century.

3183
02:53:07,961 --> 02:53:12,961
Now.
I want to continue the serious research 

3184
02:53:12,961 --> 02:53:13,630
on that.
I have Contacts in Egypt.

3185
02:53:13,631 --> 02:53:16,390
I've talked to the ministry of 
antiquities,

3186
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:17,950
the um,
uh,

3187
02:53:18,070 --> 02:53:23,070
actually director,
I guess he is of The grand egyptian 

3188
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:23,070
museum,
the new museum.

3189
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:27,390
I think we could make inroads there to 
actually explore that if someone has 

3190
02:53:27,390 --> 02:53:30,010
money or interest in that.
The problem is,

3191
02:53:30,011 --> 02:53:32,380
and I want to say is bluntly,
a lot of people say,

3192
02:53:32,381 --> 02:53:37,381
oh,
well why don't you just raise money by 

3193
02:53:37,381 --> 02:53:39,010
crowdfundinG doesn't work for Egypt.
You have to have the money upfront,

3194
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,750
they don't want,
you know,

3195
02:53:40,751 --> 02:53:43,540
crowd funding type money.
So that's another thing.

3196
02:53:43,690 --> 02:53:47,770
So my point is that there's film project
love to pursue,

3197
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:50,020
there's research,
love to pursue.

3198
02:53:50,021 --> 02:53:54,070
That's why we've set up the oracle,
the not for profit to do this.

3199
02:53:54,071 --> 02:53:59,071
Alright.
And legitimately that's why I'm saying 

3200
02:53:59,071 --> 02:54:02,000
the institute at bu institute for the 
study of the origins of civilization.

3201
02:54:02,021 --> 02:54:05,660
So lots of possibilities and I'm hoping 
we can make some of this happened.

3202
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:08,470
I'm hoping we tend to uh,
really appreciate you being here man.

3203
02:54:08,471 --> 02:54:10,970
It was really awesome to talk to you and
you blew my mind this,

3204
02:54:10,971 --> 02:54:13,990
this whole theories.
It scares the shit out of me,

3205
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:16,030
but it also,
it's very exciting.

3206
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:17,410
Well thank you.
Thank you.

3207
02:54:17,411 --> 02:54:19,270
And again,
I'm not trying to scare anyone

3208
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:24,500
but I think we have to be real and we 
have to be realistic and there's no 

3209
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:26,410
point in hiding and you know,
closing your eyes to.

3210
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:28,390
And it's just an awesome theory.
I mean it's just,

3211
02:54:28,410 --> 02:54:29,750
it's very cool.
Thank you.

3212
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:31,040
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

3213
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:32,240
Gentlemen.
