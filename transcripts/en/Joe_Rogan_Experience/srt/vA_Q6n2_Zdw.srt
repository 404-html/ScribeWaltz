1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,770
The joe rogan experience.
Why was it all being covered up?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,970
It's fucking insane.
When you find out why he has a for dead

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,180
bodies in general,
the key people,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,540
why he loved fucking dead people.
What'd you hear this then surgery,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,630
the ninth circle on these of congruent
to watch that Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,000
It's insane.
It's insane.

7
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,090
When you find out when you watch that
shit dude,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,640
it is crazy that you like you're saying
this and it sounds like like they can

9
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,910
never be possible.
It sounds like it never,

10
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:42,570
it could be possible that some giant
television star that worked with

11
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,450
children and it was always helping out.
Children could have actually been

12
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:48,360
fucking them the whole time and a bunch
of them,

13
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:53,361
hundreds of raping them and then people
must have known there's no way he was

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,390
killing them too.
He was killing him.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,600
He was killing it,
dude.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,110
They got,
they found all these bodies.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,690
It's a box.
It's a big scandal in the UK.

18
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:04,080
Hold up right now,
dude.

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,440
Jesus Christ.
There's an island called Jersey island

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,830
that's owned by the Queen and look into
that shit.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,290
I don't even want to get that.
I don't even want to get that deep into

22
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:17,490
it because that I don't have a rape
children as young as nine while working

23
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:21,300
at BBC leaked report on veils.
And this is in the independent.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,733
Yeah.
How come,

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,790
how come there's not the same kind of
effort for this kind of stuff like there

26
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,460
is with the um,
um,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,600
the gun shooting,
the Florida school shooting.

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,780
Why isn't there that?
Cause that's not a big event where it's

29
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,630
one thing we're,
all the deaths happen in one deaths or

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,800
deaths.
I understand.

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,180
I'm with you.
I understand.

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,140
But I mean this is also why people don't
freak out about 500,000 people dying

33
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,190
every year because of obesity.

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,270
Like what would you,
what's worse?

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,600
What's worse?
Having your kid get shot at a school

36
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:53,601
shooting or having that motherfucker
rape your daughter and multiple times

37
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,770
and then kill.
I don't think what's worse,

38
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,000
they're both hard.
Yeah,

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,050
exactly.
It's horrible.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,160
It's just what's scary is that that is
being protected.

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,160
Yes.
There's someone that either knew about

42
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,900
it and now it's trying to cover their
ass because they knew about it.

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,300
That was the thing about Sandusky.
Y'All saying Guskey did the same thing.

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,800
He was raping all these kids and the
whole time he was running these programs

45
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,950
for underprivileged children and helping
all these orphaned kids,

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,480
you've got to watch your kids,
man.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,230
You got to watch it till he got away
with abusing 500 children and sex with

48
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,390
dead bodies.
Whoa.

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,150
You know what a death ride is?
Death ride,

50
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,440
death ride.
No.

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,730
Jimmy savile.
What's,

52
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,250
uh,
supply 10,

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,740
15 boys to a certain politician.
Um,

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,550
he'd have a boat.
He'd take him out on the boat.

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,190
He could,
he couldn't afford to have any

56
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,070
witnesses.
So those were always the last rides.

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,260
Those kids would take their called death
rides,

58
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,890
cheese.
It couldn't have.

59
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,870
This is from that same documentary.
Ninth Circle C but how do they know that

60
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,880
for a fact?
You just got to watch it and,

61
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,100
and uh,
and make the,

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,520
uh,

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
conclusion.
Yeah.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,700
Dot.
That's magnified when you have children

65
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,730
because they have no say,
well that's the other buildings.

66
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,300
They put their kids out there and I'm
like,

67
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,134
well,
okay.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,150
I don't know.
I'm not saying it's the worst thing to

69
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,280
do,
but it's not the child's choice.

70
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,370
And they're very young and you're making
your look like whoever did what they did

71
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,120
to Michael Jackson,
right?

72
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,310
Yeah.
One of the things that they did is they

73
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,430
made him famous way before he had any
idea what the fuck that meant.

74
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,140
And they profited off of it.
Yeah.

75
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,510
They kind of pimped them out.
Right?

76
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,150
Yeah.
And that's kind of what's happening and

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,930
the story to them.

78
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,820
Yeah.
Ultimately the whole thing destroyed

79
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,420
him.
Right.

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,970
And um,
I just,

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,310
I don't want to be a part of that.
I just,

82
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,830
there's no think that's smart.
I don't think it's intelligent.

83
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,700
And I also don't,
this is my real honest feelings.

84
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,970
I do not think that fame is a,
I don't think that people should aspire

85
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,200
to it.
I think it should be something that

86
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,470
happens if people like your work and
then it's cool,

87
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,190
it's fine,
but I think there's way too much

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,760
emphasis put on just trying to get
attention and it's being rewarded and

89
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,180
supported in this weird way.
There's nothing wrong with getting

90
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:14,030
attention,
but it should make sense.

91
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,820
It should make sense.
There should be some reason and if it's

92
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,430
out of balance,
yeah.

93
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,830
You know you should,
you should probably look at like why,

94
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,270
why is it that

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,060
balance like,
yeah and lots of things that attract

96
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:31,061
attention or not things that we need.
Why we want more of,

97
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,900
you know,
like conflict.

98
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,100
Yes,
conflict.

99
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:34,930
That's a big one.

100
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,190
But it's also the,
I like just fame itself.

101
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,730
One of the weirdest parts about it is
that you have to constantly be checking

102
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,800
yourself.
Like all these people are nice to you.

103
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,850
All these people are saying nice things
to you or being mean to you.

104
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,700
You know,
one of the,

105
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,130
like they've all people that you don't
even know,

106
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,600
so you can't rely on them for your self
esteem and you certainly can't rely on

107
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,420
them for criticism.
You can't rely on them and people you

108
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,770
don't even know that don't care about
you,

109
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,750
you know,
so you,

110
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,740
you,
you're in this weird position.

111
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,150
You have to be very careful with who you
communicate with because one of the

112
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:14,170
weirdest things you'll see from famous
people is all the sudden they get this

113
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:18,760
very strange thing where they feel like
people were supposed to do things for

114
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,440
them and you know,
they don't,

115
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,100
they're not supposed to pay for things
and everything's supposed to be easy and

116
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,740
they're supposed to get that.
That's a,

117
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,150
that's a weird one.
Like they,

118
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,010
they don't respond to criticism.
Well,

119
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,950
they don't understand that there's still
a human being in the middle of growth.

120
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,000
No.
There a fucking star.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm a fucking star and I want this and I
want it now.

122
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah.
And they just like,

123
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:41,130
what kind of fucking bullshit is this?
Do you know who I am?

124
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,921
Yeah,
exactly.

125
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,700
What we've seen.
We've all seen like a version of that.

126
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,350
Right.
And Rob about it.

127
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,780
The problem though is that

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,413
they

129
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,670
no,
that their shit stinks.

130
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes.
They know that they're human.

131
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,290
They know.
So they're so then they develop this

132
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,124
sort of,
um,

133
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,160
fraud,

134
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,530
a phobia that people are going to find
out what they really are.

135
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,030
Yeah.
That's weird.

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,890
It hurts us.
It's also weird,

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,430
like the UFC could just,
did they just decide who's fighting?

138
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,090
I mean it's the whole thing.
The business is so interesting because

139
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,270
it's like they decide who's fighting.
They decide who's champion.

140
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,140
They decide,
Tony,

141
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,550
you're not champion anymore.
I'm going to strip yet.

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,430
It's like put it all fell.
I was,

143
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't want this to,
he's up at Fox studios.

144
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,750
I twist my knee,
but he was working for the UFC when he

145
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:32,540
fell.
I mean he's doing his,

146
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,180
his obligations,
his press obligation.

147
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:37,340
It's very strange to strip him of a belt
when he never lost it.

148
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:41,060
And here's the longest winning streak
and then and mean,

149
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,900
but also happiness.
No belt,

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,420
no belt can be.
It was going to take the belt.

151
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:47,480
They going to make up a bell.

152
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,660
And then connor has the belt at 55.
So what do you do with that belt?

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,940
Well what they're planning on doing,
I believe,

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,490
and now they've kind of let the cat out
of the bag because he said it's going to

155
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,790
be for the world lightweight title.
They were going to strip connor the

156
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,360
moment something happened,
like the moment the fight started.

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,620
That's when they were going to strip
connor.

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,930
Yeah,
because if they'd stripped him

159
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:09,860
beforehand,
then what happens if Tony doesn't make

160
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:13,250
weight or something totally makes
[inaudible] doesn't make weight.

161
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,810
Then what the fuck do you check?
Concern,

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,730
then you have nothing.
You already stripped him.

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,690
We're going to give it back to him.
I'm going to give it back to them.

164
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,420
No.
If he wants to fight again now,

165
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,240
he's not the champion anymore.
The fuck kind of Shit is strange.

166
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,330
So they waited and the idea was to wait,
but now they're going to desperado

167
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,164
situation.

168
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,820
Desperado so belt on the line had
fucking April fool's.

169
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,650
April fool's day,
it happens.

170
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,110
I didn't believe a God damn word of it.
Jimmy Smith's starts texting me.

171
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,070
I'm like,
fuck that dude.

172
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm not falling for it.
Jamie texted me.

173
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:40,100
I'm like,
I'm not falling for it.

174
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,840
You texted me,
you go pro,

175
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,930
it's April 4th I'm like,
no,

176
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,370
but Dana,
I dated,

177
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,360
released a video and he's listed,
I'm sure he likes a good April fool's

178
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,940
joke,
but what are you like s'mores money and

179
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,900
pay per view buys?
You can't honey dick.

180
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,540
The fans are like psych.
It's back on,

181
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
right.
People are going to be pissed and the

182
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,180
bust.
That's a good point.

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,970
Who knows?
I don't think we know enough

184
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,880
future science.
Yeah,

185
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,430
that's what you're into.
I'm way in the future science.

186
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:09,430
I wish we lived in the future,
so that's where ghost fit in.

187
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,320
I just go,
I mean future science.

188
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:12,820
I think.
I just think time.

189
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,830
I think time is an illusion.
I think that I'm more,

190
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,230
do you ever see interstellar?
Yes.

191
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm more in that zone.
That's that smacked of good science to

192
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,490
me.
I was like,

193
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,623
yes.

194
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,370
So when you say time's an illusion,
you mean like the watch is real?

195
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,620
Like if it says four 30 that's when the
movie starts,

196
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,850
right?
That's all real.

197
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,020
No,
that's just coordination.

198
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,170
That's it's,
it's within our species.

199
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,230
We're coordinating together.
We're working as an ant colony.

200
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,170
We're sending signals,
which happened to be time signals were

201
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,240
using math to coordinate.

202
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,920
But if you go underwater and hold your
breath for five minutes,

203
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,120
that's real five minutes.

204
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,970
No,
that's just when you run out of oxygen.

205
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,260
So that five minutes,
that is the counting of that time

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
doesn't mean anything.
Doesn't mean anything.

207
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
No,
it doesn't mean anything.

208
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,570
But if someone's five minutes late,
you're like,

209
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,404
bitch,
you're fine.

210
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,760
No,
it doesn't mean anything.

211
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,730
Well,
I'm never mad about that because I'm

212
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,564
always late.

213
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,873
Oh,
okay.

214
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,410
Hmm.
That's interesting.

215
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,040
Um,
well the only time supposedly is now and

216
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,580
everything else is just are pathetic
attempts at measuring it and trying to,

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,220
that's just coordination on like,
you know,

218
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,560
people,
like that's all we're doing.

219
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,080
Like how old are you?
Um,

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,030
you know,
and then that just means how crispy you

221
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,540
are from going around the sun.
That's not like really anything.

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,070
Sorry.
Yeah,

223
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,480
you're like,
sorry.

224
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,840
Right,
right.

225
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,390
Skin.
Cracklin you know,

226
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,090
like,
it's just kind of that and to me like

227
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,620
time is just,
it's just space.

228
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,320
It's like how far are you away from this
gravitational pull?

229
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:53,700
I think gravity is way more interesting.
I think time is just us coordinating

230
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,630
with math while we definitely are,
but it's also like when the sun's coming

231
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,980
up,
like check your watch,

232
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,650
six 15 sun's coming up.
That's a real thing.

233
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,130
We're just clocking a spin of an earth.
Yeah.

234
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,900
It's the same thing with the lungs under
water.

235
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,400
The earth spins.

236
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,470
I agree with you and disagree with you
at the same time.

237
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,640
Yeah,
that's fine.

238
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,450
I think you're right.
But I also think the fucking movie

239
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,300
starts at four 30.

240
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,840
That's another human putting on a movie.
It's true.

241
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,100
You're just coordinating with,
give me an example of time that is a

242
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:28,030
manifest thing outside of human
coordination.

243
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,310
Um,
well you could,

244
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,380
the oldest don't mean like

245
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,410
things happening,
right?

246
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,420
I mean time,
just time itself.

247
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Like is that helpful in any way?
Other than for us?

248
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,910
I don't think it exists in the universe
really.

249
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:51,740
Okay.
