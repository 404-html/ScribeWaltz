1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,630
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:05,430
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,264
one.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,410
Gary Vee.
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,663
Dude,
I have gotten so many fucking tweets 

6
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,124
about you ever since I say we're going 
to do this podcast or I don't know if I 

7
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,060
announced it online or tweeted or 
something.

8
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:17,801
Man,
that you are.

9
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,310
You're doing something out there.
Dude.

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,980
You got a lot of people behind you.
Lot are people excited about you.

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,120
Well,
listen,

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,440
I'm super thrilled to be here.
I,

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,660
I really appreciate it.
I appreciate you being here.

14
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm thrilled to talk to you.
Thanks.

15
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,810
You're a motivational motherfucker,
man.

16
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,160
You got a lot of people up and Adam,

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm super grateful.
You know.

18
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,400
Do you know it's funny.
I,

19
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,234
uh,
I spent the three years for the last 

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,901
year.
I've been okay with it,

21
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:40,734
but the three years prior to that,
I specifically didn't want to be a 

22
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,544
motivational speaker.
How come I was selfish in deciding like 

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,260
that?
I just didn't want to be that,

24
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,094
that I was more proud in my own mind of 
being an entrepreneur or business 

25
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:59,010
builder who happened to have 
entrepreneurial tendencies.

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,370
And I feel like the motivational speaker
thing,

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,760
you know,
by percentages can get a little ugly,

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,060
gets a little kind of hollow,
a little spammy.

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,460
And for my own mind,
the way I had it,

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,960
my brand was I suppressed and stop 
putting out the content like that.

31
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,750
I would tell my boys and my internal 
employees,

32
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,520
but for the last year I embraced it a 
little more.

33
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,900
And so,
you know,

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,430
it's got a place,
you know,

35
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,720
I mean,
you can't,

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
I know you feel this because as soon as 
you announced it too,

37
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,920
I've gotten so many emails and tweets 
and the ems of the same thing,

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,233
if you're lucky enough that some way,
the way you communicate brings value to 

39
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,724
others.

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,820
You need to be smart about that.
And so I'm trying to figure it out.

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,310
Yeah.
Um,

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,350
yeah.
I mean I definitely think you need to be

43
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,610
smart about it.
You definitely don't.

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,110
You don't want to get greedy with it or 
stupid with it or there's a fine line.

45
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:57,000
But the population and you know,
and doing the right thing for sure.

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,640
And for me,
when I go onstage,

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,280
that is my zone.
Like I,

48
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,440
that's like,
that's my arena,

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,363
that's my court.
I just don't think anybody does it 

50
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,214
better.
Like when you give a motivational 

51
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,770
speech,
usually business talks,

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,790
but um,
so like Rah,

53
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,460
Rah,
that takes,

54
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,293
you know,
I feel like I'm a defensive coordinator 

55
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,310
that's giving you the place,
but I'm going to give it to you,

56
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,530
like we can do this,
let's rip their next,

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,820
you know,
like out of their body.

58
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,654
And so when I'm up there that and the 
youtube videos and things of that 

59
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,634
nature,
that's the majority of what people see 

60
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
of me.

61
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,370
And that's the only one version of it.
And uh,

62
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,271
yeah,
I,

63
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,104
I,
I'm very conscious of the motivational 

64
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,854
thing.
I think a lot of people use motivation 

65
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,390
for their own selfishness.
And I'm trying.

66
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,580
I know it all plays out in 30 or 40 
years,

67
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,360
but along the way for my own appetite,
I want to balance it the right way.

68
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,403
Well,
there's a lot of people that are doing 

69
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,690
it that haven't,
they don't really,

70
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,083
they don't really do anything else.
Like I know a guy who does motivational 

71
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,154
speaking,
used to be a shitty comedian and now 

72
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,610
he's just doing these weird motivational
speeches and they're like,

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,080
there's sort of hobbled and cobbled 
together from other people's Shit.

74
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,750
And it's like it's fake.
You know what?

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,900
Listen,
I don't judge anybody very honest.

76
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't give a fuck really.
I really don't really.

77
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,720
I don't.
But about what other people are doing.

78
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,170
Entertainment,
escapism.

79
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:21,761
Just,
you know,

80
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,030
people can say reality stars of this.
People say watching football,

81
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,980
like my beloved jets for three hours of 
stupid.

82
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,470
Like people can judge escapism in any 
way they want.

83
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,690
Here's my big thing.
I'm a businessman,

84
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:35,000
so I talk about business content.
It's not just finding your inner peace,

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,993
right?
Scares the shit out of me is everybody 

86
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,794
who fucking says that they're a business
coach and they've never made a fucking 

87
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,480
dollar outside of selling other people 
how to make a dollar.

88
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,410
The scheme is basically sell other 
people on how to make a dollar.

89
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,903
So I just don't want to go down that 
path and I think I can look the part 

90
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,220
very quickly and that's why suppressed 
it for a little while,

91
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,960
but then in the last three or four years
I've built a very large agency,

92
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,943
a media agency,
and so I think I felt good that I went 

93
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,794
and executed again,
just like I did when I built the wine 

94
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,840
business.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,020
So I filled that bucket of building 
another big business,

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,033
which makes me feel more comfortable to 
go out and do the content and being out 

97
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,314
there.
Well there's definitely value in giving 

98
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,970
people motivation is definitely value 
that other people get from it.

99
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,180
It's a real positive thing and there's 
ripples that come off of that.

100
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,210
And I feel like I gained a lot from a 
lot of people that are motivational.

101
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,860
I get a lot out of it.
I love it when they're real.

102
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,730
When the real.
Yeah.

103
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,170
It's just,
it's hard to find,

104
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,363
you know,
you've got to separate find out who's a 

105
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:38,930
boat,
you know,

106
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,930
who's a real health expert and who's a 
bullshit artist that is sort of compiled

107
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,934
and remembered a bunch of things that 
other health experts have actually 

108
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,371
studied and done headline research on 
versus practitioners should imagine what

109
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,270
you guys are dealing with.

110
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,910
Being at the top of the sphere of this 
important medium,

111
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,150
you must get bombarded and it takes 
work.

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,313
Like I've been able to navigate who I 
want to fuck with and have drinks with 

113
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,570
and who I stay away from.
It takes a lot of time.

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,593
Yeah,
does because it can look the part and 

115
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,220
you got to like dig and then you gotta 
like take and you know,

116
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,770
you know this,
there's people that you actually respect

117
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,200
who haven't done the work and are lazy 
about putting somebody else on and our,

118
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,170
yeah,
that's a good guy,

119
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,150
but they're not.
And they're like,

120
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,930
fuck.
I'm like,

121
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,880
you know,
the whole thing is really interesting.

122
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,330
And then there's hosers mess.
There's a lot of hoses out there.

123
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,310
There's just no,
there's no getting away from that though

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,770
and kind of all walks of life and I 
think you're right though,

125
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:33,604
did not concentrate on the negative ones
because it's really just a waste of 

126
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,030
resources.

127
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,863
It's a waste of energy.
But this is an amazing time though to 

128
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,880
get a message out there and to motivate 
people and to show people that,

129
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:46,710
you know,
there's,

130
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,360
there's something positive not just in 
being inspired buttons.

131
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,430
Inspiring others.
Yeah.

132
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,264
I mean,
listen,

133
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,493
you know,
the communication infrastructure of 

134
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,720
society is incredibly interesting right 
now,

135
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,530
but you and I are doing,
do you know,

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,070
I mean like if you map what you're doing
right now,

137
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,260
like it's insane.
You,

138
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,094
you basically had to give up all the 
economics to the biggest radio station 

139
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,121
in the world.
Like,

140
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,954
like everybody can reach so many people 
and of course everybody's gonna head's 

141
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,300
going to go to what's going on in 
politics and what's going on.

142
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,134
And it's true,
the reason that dictator when they're 

143
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,194
creating a coup d'etat wants to take 
control of the media is because people 

144
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,840
go with what the media is telling them.

145
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,123
And so yeah,
I mean I think it's imperatively 

146
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,800
important to try to navigate and 
distinguish yourselves.

147
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,350
To me,
I'm saying this quite a bit lately,

148
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,410
which is if you're feeling good right 
now,

149
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,371
it's like,
for example,

150
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,890
I am,
I feel enormously optimistic.

151
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,413
You have a massive sense of 
responsibility to communicate that 

152
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,640
because the wave of negativity is 
extreme.

153
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,683
Yeah,
I agree.

154
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,240
I agree.
And I think it's super beneficial.

155
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,610
And um,
you know,

156
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,740
what you were saying about the media 
being powerful.

157
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,360
I mean the most powerful thing about it 
is everyone has access to it now.

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,233
It was nothing keeping anyone from 
starting an instagram page and just 

159
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:09,590
putting up little videos everyday of how
they feel and how they think.

160
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,250
And it might only affect one person.
It might affect a thousand people,

161
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,350
it might get to a million people.
And it builds.

162
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,370
And what happens,
Joe,

163
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,040
is I think people look at this in a 
cynical way.

164
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,650
They're like,
social media is bad.

165
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,380
That person has no talent.
Why are they successful?

166
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,420
This political thing is going on.
That's bad,

167
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,254
this is bad.
And what they don't realize is these 

168
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,470
social networks haven't changed us.
They've exposed us.

169
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,190
You know what people like twitter didn't
change your opinions.

170
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,780
Twitter allowed you to express them.
Back in the day when something was on tv

171
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,690
or the radio.
We were yelling when I used to listen to

172
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,524
sports radio,
Mike and the mad dog in the nineties in 

173
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,940
Jersey,
I was yelling back at mad dog,

174
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,840
like,
you idiot,

175
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,400
no,
the jets should do this.

176
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,950
But now that voice is in play,
right?

177
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,803
Right.
One famous person away from retweeting 

178
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,690
it to getting the foundation.
That's the,

179
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
you know,
that's the match.

180
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:06,290
That can start your infrastructure.
Not only is it in play,

181
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,124
but if you have opinions on sports,
you could start your own podcast and it 

182
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,420
just builds.

183
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,343
And it could be massive in bigger than 
anything on the radio because it's such 

184
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,394
a superior medium.
People forget that blogging was a 

185
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,400
precursor to this.
I mean,

186
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,780
where do you think Bill Simmons came 
from?

187
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,990
People were confused,
like people forget real quick.

188
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:24,980
I mean,
that was my story.

189
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,040
I owned a wine store in Jersey.
Youtube came out.

190
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,143
It was five months old and I'm like,
this thing is going to be big and it's 

191
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:32,274
sad to sit in front of a table,
drink four bottles of wine for 20 

192
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,354
minutes,
and it was good enough that a lot of 

193
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,360
people want to watch what you started 
out.

194
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,860
That's what you started doing.
My Mike.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,780
So My,
if you want to take it all the way back.

196
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,910
I was born in Belarus in the former 
Soviet Union,

197
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,330
so I have a very immigrant story.
Came to the states in [inaudible] 78.

198
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,283
Lived in a studio apartment half the 
size of this studio with eight family 

199
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:52,460
members.

200
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,840
Real immigrants.
Shit.

201
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,063
My Dad got a as a stock boy in a liquor 
store for two bucks an hour in New 

202
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,303
Jersey.
Wow.

203
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,620
Became the manager of that store 
eventually.

204
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,454
You know,
that immigrant thing just work every 

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,040
hour.
Right?

206
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,850
Dad Did.
I didn't even know my dad until I was 14

207
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,950
even though he slept in my home every 
night.

208
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,320
And uh,
and we moved to Jersey.

209
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,550
I was straight entrepreneurial DNA,
like lemonade stands,

210
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,713
like shoveling snow.
I used to rip people's flowers out of 

211
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,250
their yard and ring the doorbell and 
sell it back to them.

212
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:25,251
It was real raw entrepreneurship and 
then I'm 41 baseball cards were like the

213
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,300
thing in 87,
88,

214
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,390
89 90.
That was culture and I became a baseball

215
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:34,320
card dealer and I was making two,
$300 a weekend selling baseball cards in

216
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,440
the malls of New Jersey that my dad 
owned a small liquor store.

217
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,930
Eventually in Springfield,
New Jersey dragged my ass in.

218
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,213
I hated it,
but around 16 I realized people 

219
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,660
collected wine that was connected to 
what I liked,

220
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:50,400
which was collecting baseball cards and 
football cards and I at 16 years old,

221
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,240
spent every minute of my life trying to 
become the foremost expert in wine.

222
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,243
I would go into like science class 
junior year and not give a fuck about 

223
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,704
Saturn and we'll just sit there and read
the wine spectator and decided I was 

224
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,540
going to be the greatest wine retailer 
of all time.

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,913
Heard the Internet in [inaudible] 94 in 
a dorm room playing madden [inaudible] 

226
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,750
94.
My friend came and he's like,

227
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,310
you got to see this,
went to a room,

228
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,463
heard cooch,
that whole thing and 15 minutes in was 

229
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,284
on a Bolton board and a PSA,
seeing that people are selling wine and 

230
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:23,024
decided that I would launch a wine 
website and in 1996 I launched one of 

231
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,430
the first ecommerce wine businesses in 
America.

232
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,413
Wow.
And so then in 98 I came home full time 

233
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,714
and from 90 to 2003 in that five year 
window I built my dad's business from a 

234
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:39,380
three to a $60,000,000
business on the back of email marketing,

235
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,753
google ad words and just having a 
website and that became my first foray 

236
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:48,260
into using technology to grow very 
quickly.

237
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,680
Sell wine through that website.
Eat.

238
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,683
So buy and sell.
I don't know Jack Shit about one I go 

239
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:55,510
to.
I just asked the guy,

240
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,130
what's good dude?
Do you like it?

241
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,520
Love it.
That's all you need to know.

242
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,870
The number one reason I broke out in 
wine.

243
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,640
Everyone who's listening right now,
real quick,

244
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:06,580
take a step back.
Do you know anybody that's into wine?

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,500
Everybody probably knows one or two 
people,

246
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,843
they know what I know.
Every one of those people are street 

247
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,513
douchebag.
Anybody that's really into wine thinks 

248
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,324
like it's some magical information that 
they impose on others and they become a 

249
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,384
straight dick.

250
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,420
Since I knew so much about wine,
I was like,

251
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,254
you know what,
I'm going to take this away from all 

252
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:24,814
those assholes.
So I started the youtube show and I 

253
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,300
started comparing the wines to like 
Hillbilly Jim's like,

254
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,220
you know,
like boot and like,

255
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,183
you know,
like racquetballs and like the gum out 

256
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:34,834
of a tops pack,
all the stuff that actually tastes like 

257
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,773
and democratized wine.
And it was a good thing because wine 

258
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,970
should not be on a pedestal if you like 
it.

259
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:43,450
Good.
Nobody.

260
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,760
There's no cheeseburger expert running 
around going,

261
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,710
Joe,
you're using the wrong cheese.

262
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:48,750
It's from the wrong.
Right.

263
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,890
It's so douchey that nobody wants to get
into it.

264
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:51,581
So I was like,
fuck that.

265
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm going to help wine.
And it did.

266
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,010
It got a lot of young people

267
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,820
into it.
Yeah.

268
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,760
There's a weird pretentiousness to wine 
that doesn't sort of.

269
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,980
It doesn't really exist with a lot of 
other liquors,

270
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,550
like it doesn't exist with Tequila.
Well,

271
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,400
you're seeing it right?
Like craft beer,

272
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,463
you're seeing it with Breadski,
a craft beers more down home and it's 

273
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,683
Kinda cool.
But you know what Brooklyn heads that 

274
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,710
are trying to be Douchey as to.
Well Brooklyn's a rough spot.

275
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,093
It's a weird spot.
So confused and thinks it's like North 

276
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,230
Carolina thinks it's Asheville,
North Carolina,

277
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,480
like planted in the middle of New York 
City.

278
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,660
It's for what a weird place Brooklyn is 
right now.

279
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
And it wasn't like that when I was 
living in New York at all.

280
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Now when I lived in New York,
Brooklyn was kind of like rough.

281
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,890
It was like Guido's and you know,
and uh,

282
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,340
urban.
It was a,

283
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,640
it was a different spot and now it's 
just all these weird hipsters,

284
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,970
skinny jeans and fucking vests on and 
half.

285
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,570
It's probably you listening,
love your genes.

286
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
See what I'm saying?
Monday while they're doing it,

287
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:45,934
they can even run on those things that 
you have to get away with something 

288
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,770
chasing you guys are getting away from 
it and not getting away.

289
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,750
They just accept their fate and not 
stealing their role,

290
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,040
their pants up,
keep it tight.

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,730
You know,
they're,

292
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,563
they're paying six x the price of 
whatever in North Carolina for the same 

293
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,590
item.
Why?

294
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,900
Yeah.
I don't get that.

295
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,923
I don't,
don't even get that living together 

296
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,830
thing.
Everyone's smushed into that one spot.

297
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,620
It just seems like that's a retro that I
love.

298
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,240
I live in Manhattan.
I liked it.

299
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,880
I can't live anywhere else.
I definitely could.

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,200
I call it way,
but I really prefer not.

301
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,940
Why do you like to be smashed?
Him like that.

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,270
I need speed.
I need the action to get to other places

303
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,800
like La,
like here we are.

304
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,813
Right.
And like there's nothing going on here 

305
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,310
at 11:00
PM tonight.

306
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,960
Trailer is you just got to go to the 
city.

307
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,180
That's fine.
But right out here in Woodland Hills?

308
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,120
No,
but like yes,

309
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,180
fish.
Yes.

310
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,040
Fish but not Manhattan Ish.
No,

311
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,993
and not that that's bad by the way.
It's probably mainly good for 99 

312
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,850
percent.
I just know what I'm about.

313
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,110
Like I like it.
I like,

314
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,003
I like the action.
You like there being a restaurant open 

315
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,160
at 1:00
AM,

316
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,450
you can get a nice meal at and it's not 
even that cool.

317
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,980
I'm not cool enough for that.
Here's what I like.

318
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,350
What do you like noise.
So for example,

319
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,490
what I fucking hate,
right?

320
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,230
So I love it.
So let me give you a good example.

321
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,153
I have to sleep with a sound machine 
because I need the chaos when I walk in 

322
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,960
my office floor and everybody's got 
headphones on and there's no sound.

323
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,230
I freaked my shit.
And like poke somebody in say like blast

324
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:12,730
your spotify or it like I need sound.
Really man.

325
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm the total opposite.
I want to be on a mountain.

326
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,693
I want to hear birds Chirp and nothing 
makes me happier than hearing like 

327
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,550
sirens and people yelling.
It really puts me to sleep.

328
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,410
Like Lizzie,
Lizzie,

329
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,820
my sister right now.
I know she's listening.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,280
She knows there used to be a train 
outside our house in Edison,

331
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,660
New Jersey.
I couldn't sleep.

332
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,500
The train would come by and it'd be like
one of those hips out sound.

333
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,990
That's so weird.
That's why I love social.

334
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,390
That makes sense.
You know what I mean?

335
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,493
Post that it did a reply like I am an 
action junkie and luckily I haven't 

336
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:47,290
deployed that against drugs or,
or a little gambling early on,

337
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,124
but I've gotten away from Medicare when 
enough to get me excited and I can lose 

338
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,004
and get pissed.
So like finally won that game where 

339
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,640
you're gambling like Vegas,
gambling our sports vegas.

340
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,603
Yeah.

341
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,280
And like dumb shit,
like roulette.

342
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,143
Like I would just decide like no,
like $500 on the number five because 

343
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,330
like fuck,
if I hit this know just like dumb shit.

344
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:13,331
Like I'm gonna when I go so much for the
UFC gamble at all.

345
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,240
I've never gambled in Vegas.
I've gambled on fights and that's it.

346
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,140
I should really bet baseball.
I've been a hardcore,

347
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,660
like 25 year fantasy baseball player and
so you know,

348
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,494
a lot.
The only time I've ever really made 

349
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,504
money gambling was when I new up and 
coming pitchers were coming up and 

350
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,200
that's how they really run it and that's
where I've made my biggest arbitrage.

351
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,220
It's hard to make money on fighting too.
They used to be able to,

352
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,163
when I used to gamble,
when I first started working for the 

353
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,284
UFC,
I'd still bet on fights and then I 

354
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,450
thought about it for a while and it's 
like,

355
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,250
I'm probably not supposed to do this.

356
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,050
He's like,
it doesn't make any sense.

357
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,033
I couldn't.
I can't affect anything and no one ever 

358
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,290
told me I can't do it.
It's not like I'm a manager.

359
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,700
And that your commentary with slate?
Yeah.

360
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,060
That.
Anyway,

361
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,780
they said,
they said that it has been me.

362
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,930
They said I was biased for people I bet 
against,

363
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:06,080
which is hilarious.
I've had that happen,

364
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,680
but I stopped doing that like more than 
10 years ago.

365
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,553
It was probably like 2002 or three,
like right after I first started doing 

366
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,980
commentary.
I quit doing that,

367
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,823
but used to be able to make a lot of 
money because there were some killers 

368
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,220
and there were and people were 
undereducated and that's,

369
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,510
well there were some killers that would 
come in from other countries and I would

370
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,120
go,
you know,

371
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,090
like they didn't know about this guy and
I'd be like,

372
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,050
oh,
this like Atlanta.

373
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm a golf guy,
was coming in from,

374
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,560
I forget where he's from,
but I was like,

375
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,700
Jesus Christ,
what is the,

376
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,590
what's the line?
Fucking bet the house,

377
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,020
you know,
there was some guys from parts unknown.

378
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,950
There's a few guys from parts did that 
so.

379
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:39,784
Well.
I was fascinated when they were like 

380
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,760
from parts unknown shit.
Where's he from?

381
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,743
Well that's no good for global 
enterprise at the UFC because you want 

382
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,760
to engage those people in the other 
countries.

383
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,230
Like,
like there's this guy,

384
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:52,280
Habib normal.
Go ahead off.

385
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,380
Who's the number one contender in the 
lightweight division?

386
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,260
He says fucking murderer.
He's such a bad ass.

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,730
And he's undefeated and like the big 
thing about this guy's a,

388
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,390
he's from Russia.
He's from Dagestan.

389
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,261
Yup.
And there's a,

390
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:06,380
it's a really weird place because it's 
not a large place,

391
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,640
but there's a bunch of killers that come
out as one spot and this guy is like the

392
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:11,450
main killer.

393
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,283
And so they're,
they're planning on doing a big UFC in 

394
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,800
Russia.
This guy's fighting in Russia.

395
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,110
It's going to be fucking bonkers,
you know?

396
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:18,944
So like,
that's a big deal at conor mcgregor in 

397
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,130
Ireland and you know,
there's this,

398
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,800
it's a big deal to fight in your 
country.

399
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,900
One hundred percent digital thing has 
always worked,

400
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,760
you know,
World Cup Olympics.

401
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,810
These are historic things like we're 
look,

402
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,320
nationalism is on the rise.
Yeah,

403
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,520
no,
it definitely is.

404
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,421
And,
and even,

405
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,530
you know,
statewide,

406
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,364
you know,
like a cowboy serone fought this past 

407
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,330
weekend in Denver,
you know,

408
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,280
and he's just from Denver.
And so when he goes to Denver,

409
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,520
they go fucking crazy hometown stuff.
There's,

410
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,150
there's always that,
you know,

411
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:47,830
it's just,
it's,

412
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,663
it's a fascinating thing.
And that your signature on your fucking 

413
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,930
phone case.
That's a little weird there buddy.

414
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,270
I'm a weird dude.
This is,

415
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,203
you know,
you got like a watermark signature 

416
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,010
that's a signature by the way that 
anybody could rip off.

417
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,600
You'll be super careful.
Your checkbook.

418
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,960
Luckily I don't have any checks.
Sometimes I don't even know what a check

419
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:04,980
is.
I got a buddy of mine,

420
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,710
his name is Guido Orlando.
He's a good guy and he,

421
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,090
uh,
his signature is this,

422
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,280
it's like,
that's it.

423
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,173
Which was great until he got divorced 
and then his ex wife just fucking went 

424
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,960
off with the to trench.
Just drain the poor guy.

425
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,440
Or do I still fucking stuck to his guns 
though?

426
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,890
After she drained them,
kept that fucking seconds.

427
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,280
He's like,
you can take the money,

428
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,750
but you hadn't taken this signature 
taken.

429
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,770
My big old bitch gets.
Nobody could tell you how you write your

430
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:33,931
name,
you know,

431
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,640
you could write your name a any way you 
want.

432
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,380
So he just decided that's how I write 
it.

433
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,010
That's it right now.
That's a good question.

434
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,540
He's a pool cue maker.

435
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
He makes custom made pool cues.
Yeah.

436
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,140
And last time I heard he was somewhere 
in the midwest where pool is still got a

437
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,343
pool,
is always connected to gambling and 

438
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,843
it's,
it does better in places where there's 

439
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,900
not as much to do.
Right.

440
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,734
Not as many options for gambling.
Although Manhattan is like a good spot 

441
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,454
for pool.
It is,

442
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,380
oddly enough.
It's like a date thing,

443
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,290
like you know what I mean?
Pool pool pool.

444
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,170
Like real pool gamblers,
high level players.

445
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,004
Yeah.
I could play,

446
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,560
I could play decent.
What about darts?

447
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,150
No,
a dartboard over there.

448
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,690
Somebody gave it to me.
I never even opened it up over there.

449
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,200
Are you good at darts?
Yeah.

450
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,670
Better than I am.
People love darts.

451
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,160
Just have good hand eye coordination.
It's a fun.

452
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,670
It's fun to play.
Yeah,

453
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,800
but it seems like you're looking at the 
same thing over and over again.

454
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,050
That's my problem with bowling and 
darts.

455
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,580
You're looking at the same goddamn 
thing.

456
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,900
To me.
Pattern recognition.

457
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,470
It's kind of how I think about like,
yeah,

458
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,630
content and business and those things.
I like pattern recognition.

459
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,520
Why do you like pattern recognition?
He comes to me but you like chaos.

460
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,960
I do.
I do.

461
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,950
I do.
But I.

462
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,783
But I,
you know,

463
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,630
I definitely am a big,
big fan of,

464
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,570
of pattern recognition.
Like to me,

465
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,240
everything just happens over and over 
and over again.

466
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,870
You just have to understand the 
historics.

467
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,753
So for example,
my great thesis right now where I think 

468
00:19:58,801 --> 00:19:59,634
all the money's going to be made,
this is the television and that is the 

469
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,320
radio.
So you're pointing to your phone.

470
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,610
It was the television,
the TV,

471
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,830
the radio,
and it's 19,

472
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,820
48 to 1957,
meaning we are going from a primary as a

473
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,200
society in the US.

474
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,333
The primary device in our lives is 
switching from the television to the 

475
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:20,130
phone.
The same thing that happened in the late

476
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,963
forties,
early fifties from the radio to 

477
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,373
television.
If you go back and understand the 

478
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,770
brands,
the media companies,

479
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,710
the personalities,
what happened in that decade,

480
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,440
then you can start making bets on 
understanding,

481
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,030
Oh wait a minute.
If the phones,

482
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,800
the television than facebook and twitter
and instagram are ABC,

483
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:38,634
NBC and CBS.
Shouldn't I become bob hope and seal 

484
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,550
ball?
Because if you go back and read a lot of

485
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:49,540
the radio stars didn't go to television 
because they disrespected the medium.

486
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,240
Huh?
So I would tell you,

487
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,283
I asked you this before we went on.
I was fascinating because I know you've 

488
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,280
been really a pioneer in this in early 
dude.

489
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,510
Like you went to podcasting and I'm sure
now everybody's like,

490
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,130
oh my God and can I be on your show?

491
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,460
But when you first started,
it didn't have the,

492
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,860
you know,
the brand as a platform.

493
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:12,670
It has now short plenty people were 
snickering at it or what does it mean?

494
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,743
That's what it is.
They were doing it reasonably like 

495
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,523
people are still doing it.
Howard stern was making fun of podcast 

496
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,760
just a couple of years ago,
not even a year ago.

497
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:25,420
He was mocking people doing it.
Now we get $95,

498
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,254
million downloads a month.
Of course he's mocking it because 

499
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,700
everybody mocks the competitive thing 
that's rise.

500
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,840
There's that,
there's that.

501
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,540
But it's also.
Yeah,

502
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,150
it is that for sure.
Let's just save ourselves in that way.

503
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:38,590
Well,
in my opinion,

504
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,060
radios fucked because it's it.
You have to tune in at a certain time.

505
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,820
You have to listen to their commercials.
You have to.

506
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:46,654
I mean the.
The medium of podcasting is so superior 

507
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,450
that it's instantaneous.
You pause it when you want.

508
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,520
You get back into your car,
Bluetooth to your car.

509
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,700
It plays anywhere.
You can go from your car to headphones.

510
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,950
It can play in your car or complain your
headphones.

511
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,230
You could pick it up,
you could put it on your laptop,

512
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:03,064
you could have it stream in your house,
you do whatever the fuck you want with 

513
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,980
it.
You delete them,

514
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:07,930
you download their.
They're instantaneous.

515
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,150
You can get them whenever you want.
You can go to the archives.

516
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
I agree.
I mean,

517
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,960
and it's also a hundred percent 
uncensored,

518
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,440
100 percent unproduced.
There's no one in like with this,

519
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,483
it's me and Jamie and that's it.
I mean there's no one else involved in 

520
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:21,940
this.
That's it.

521
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,740
And look at Jamie,
he's just chilling,

522
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,680
but I mean it's really amazing in that 
respect.

523
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,563
There's no corporate end.
Like when you get to these kinds of 

524
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,264
numbers,
usually you'd be in some giant building 

525
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,610
somewhere and there'd be a gang of 
people involved.

526
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,320
They'd have meetings and after the show 
meetings and a tutorial post and we had.

527
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,070
We never had a fucking meeting ever.
You guys smoke a little weed.

528
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,410
Even talked to each other.
Yeah.

529
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:44,260
Look,
tell him we're friends,

530
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,860
but a little weed will knock some pool 
balls around.

531
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:48,990
Jamie has a good idea.
We're going,

532
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:49,541
yeah,
let's do that.

533
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,374
And we fucking wind up doing it,
but it's so informal and it's like 

534
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:57,880
there's nothing going on like corporate.
What's amazing is that allows the talent

535
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:59,460
to rise to the top.
Well,

536
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,170
it,
it also allows people to be themselves,

537
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,610
which is what allows the talent to rise 
to the top or allows the.

538
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,173
Let me say the word talent,
but allows content to find its way in a 

539
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,184
pure manner where it's not like if you 
have a bunch of people influencing what 

540
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,160
you do,
as soon as you start compromising and as

541
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:20,530
soon as you start compromising,
you just can't.

542
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,270
It's never going to get through the 
right way.

543
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,104
Like one of the beautiful things about 
standup and one of the beautiful things 

544
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,064
about podcasting is that like if you go 
to see a guy like bill burr has netflix 

545
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,600
specials out right now,
he's in gentleman just came out,

546
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,160
he was on earlier today.
Like you see his thoughts.

547
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,860
There's no one telling him what to say.
There's no one needed to know.

548
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:41,650
When you watch a stand up on stage,
that's their thoughts.

549
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:44,230
They figured out a way to hone it to 
their personality.

550
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,860
And then boom,
put it out there like that.

551
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,053
And that's the same thing with 
podcasting and that's never existed 

552
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,900
before.
They've never had the opportunity.

553
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,650
The Internet is the.
We take it for granted.

554
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:58,340
It's really fundamentally only 20 to 21 
years old.

555
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,353
Windows 95 really kind of put normal 
people on it is the great shift in our 

556
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:09,290
society and I think we haven't fully 
quantified it's impact across the board.

557
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,250
Well if you think about 20 years and 
how,

558
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,133
what a short period of time that is in 
human history and if we go a hundred 

559
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,763
years from now and look back,
they will look at this like this great 

560
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,490
explosion of content and creativity and 
expansion and integration.

561
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,324
This integration of thoughts and ideas 
and the instantaneous ability to 

562
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,064
communicate that's just never existed 
before and they're going to think it's 

563
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,060
slow.
Oh yeah.

564
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,350
I mean this is going to say everybody's 
like,

565
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,730
it's so fast.
And the kids,

566
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,564
the kids,
I mean I love these kids are not going 

567
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,400
to be capable to live in society because
they're on a phone.

568
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,660
I was told that I would not be a 
functioning human being because I played

569
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:48,230
Zelda and Mike Tyson's punch out too 
much while they were right.

570
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,060
They knew it in that way.
I mean,

571
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,800
but I tell my friends all the time,
like,

572
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,170
what world do you think our kids are 
going to be living in?

573
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,650
You think it would be outside throwing a
racquet ball against the fucking wall.

574
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,670
Like the world shifted.
Yeah,

575
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,970
there'll be taking selfies of her ass 
and that's exactly right.

576
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,833
So they're doing,
they're going to be putting lenses and 

577
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,790
let me get a vr world 24 slash seven.
That's what they're really going to be,

578
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,810
is really what they're going to be 
doing.

579
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,970
Yeah.
What do you think is next?

580
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,833
Like if you look at the cell phone and 
you look at technology and the 

581
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,520
integration in our lives,
what do you think is the next step?

582
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,030
Voice voice is going to be really 
interesting because it's on us now.

583
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,850
So voice.
So here let's take a step back.

584
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,810
It's all about time arbitrage.
The thing that we're all addicted to his

585
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,400
time.
So Uber,

586
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,570
Uber doesn't sell transportation.
Uber sells time this whole convenience.

587
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,040
That's exactly right.
And it's.

588
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,993
And it's packaged in time.
So voice when Alexa can order your 

589
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
package for you instead of like 
whatever's faster,

590
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,530
like the head of the I pads that we 
talked about,

591
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,620
like the yearbook.
Thank you there.

592
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,620
Whatever's faster,
whatever's faster is what we're going to

593
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,200
gravitate towards.
So I think voice activation,

594
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,400
ai,
ar,

595
00:25:58,401 --> 00:25:59,234
those kinds of things are really gonna 
start to populate up over the next half 

596
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,411
decade.
Those,

597
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,510
um,
those earbuds that you're wearing,

598
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,920
do you work out in those things?
No.

599
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,690
No,
they don't hang in there.

600
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,370
They'll fall out.
I haven't tried it.

601
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,210
I don't.

602
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,043
I'm not quite sure they look.
That's the only thing I would worry 

603
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:15,980
about.
They look pretty bad ass.

604
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,613
I'm upset.
It's the best product that was put out 

605
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,130
since the phone itself.
You really believe that.

606
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:22,700
I really believe that.
Now.

607
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,593
Do they work the way the other way?
Is there a button you can press on them 

608
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:26,960
to answer the phone?
Like how does that work?

609
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,120
I don't know.
The truth is I'm not even sure,

610
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,300
like by the way probably,
but I'm so weirded out like I don't do.

611
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,213
I'm so bad at that.
Like I never get the full value out of 

612
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,650
products because I don't even have the 
time to read.

613
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,070
That's actually probably good because 
that means that a product has to be

614
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,903
really,
really good to impress you because it 

615
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,590
becomes so easy to use.
Have very good insight.

616
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,490
Yeah.
No,

617
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,151
seriously.
Yeah.

618
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,984
Because there's some shit like on one of
those fitbit's like good luck with all 

619
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,074
that.
I'm not getting in there and pulling up 

620
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,200
apple product.
Right.

621
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,800
You know what they're gonna do.
They're gonna make all that ship.

622
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,380
Not work stuff.
They're not.

623
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,660
They're not here to be friendly.
They want your fucking money.

624
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,523
Somebody gave me one of these gps 
watches that you have to charge every 

625
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:11,250
other day or some fucking stupid shit.
And the other thing that thing charges,

626
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,830
like I thought it was like that three 
days like,

627
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,660
you know,
like instantaneous.

628
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,760
It's been really good.
It lasts for three days.

629
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,940
Mine have been lasting for as long as 
three days here.

630
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,731
Yeah,
I ordered it,

631
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:22,680
but they're not going to deliver it 
until March.

632
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,130
I think they're back ordered for quite a
while because too many people like you.

633
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,580
Maybe you can predict it up.
You fucked it up,

634
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:29,520
dude.
Sorry everyone.

635
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,950
I like it.
I like it.

636
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,903
So you think voice meaning like voice 
control voice and I'm one of the things 

637
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,654
that I use all the time as a comic is 
the notes feature on the iphone yet has 

638
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:41,994
that little voice thing and it's 
amazingly accurate and accurate enough 

639
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:46,704
that I could realize what I'm saying.
Like even if it fucks up a word or 

640
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,850
something like that,
I can go back and look at it.

641
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,590
But if you've ever used it.
Yeah,

642
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,730
I do.
It's fucking granted.

643
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,500
But I think,
I think it's the two point.

644
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:55,921
Oh,
of that,

645
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,570
right?
Where like things are actually happening

646
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,404
because of your voice.
So we could talk right now and this 

647
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,094
fucking thing is going to be able to 
pick up a good 99 percent of everything 

648
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:07,260
we're saying and I'm not even touching 
it.

649
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,140
You see it crushed it.
I just Uhm,

650
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,680
killed it.
Perfect.

651
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,920
Yup.
Got It.

652
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,813
One hundred percent.
So to me where it gets really exciting 

653
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,550
is when everything around you is being 
at.

654
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,443
So when everything becomes smart,
then it starts getting really 

655
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:22,500
interesting.
So our phones are smart,

656
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,343
right?
But what happens when your belt is 

657
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,334
smart?
Oh,

658
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,413
and now all of a sudden you go to order 
a big Mac and you try to pay with your 

659
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:33,960
phone,
but your belts talking to your phone and

660
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,020
when you go to pay it declines and it 
looks at you and says,

661
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,910
order a salad.
Fat Ass,

662
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,280
Woo.
Your belt is telling you it's tightened,

663
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
correct.
Tights pushing against your body.

664
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,980
And what about when your refrigerator 
reorders?

665
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,293
Another case of Budweiser because it 
understands how often you drink it and 

666
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:52,944
so you're down to two.
It knows that you're going to drink to 

667
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:55,554
tonight because that's your average and 
as soon as you get home that night and 

668
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:01,080
open and grabbed the first one,
it's already reordering it for you.

669
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,900
So your refrigerator becomes an enabler.
Everything's going to be.

670
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,530
Then they started doing the 
refrigerator,

671
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:06,430
right?
Your traffic,

672
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,090
your toothpaste is going to have one 
drop left.

673
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,983
If he orders it for you,
so we're going to get into that place 

674
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,194
where everything is smart and that's 
when it starts getting a little bit 

675
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,344
interesting and then.
And then virtual reality porn is going 

676
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:21,090
to be interesting.
Well it's already interesting.

677
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:23,850
Have you ever done the htc vive?
You ever fuck with?

678
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,520
Yeah.
Duncan has the porn and the htc vive and

679
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,363
he tried to get me to look at it briefly
and they looked at it briefly like six 

680
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:31,824
hours.
No,

681
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,090
a few days.
It's not,

682
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,970
you're just getting too much.
You know,

683
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,730
you could just stare at someone's tits.
They're just too big.

684
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,010
The whole thing is too weird.
It's just too.

685
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,160
It's not going to be bizarre.
You know,

686
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,500
it was bizarre 10 years ago.

687
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Dating somebody that you met online like
bizarre gets redefined real quick.

688
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,890
Oh for sure.
And guys are real simple.

689
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,163
You know,
all you need is one of your buddies and 

690
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,640
five years saying,
Bro,

691
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:58,474
no,
seriously.

692
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,160
That's it.
Just that tone.

693
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,150
And that was it.
Right?

694
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,320
And You wonder,
you felt where Jamie was like,

695
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,813
no bro.
Seriously.

696
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,743
Well,
how many people are getting laid now 

697
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,420
because of online.
It's got to be giant.

698
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,500
Like with tinder and swiping all these 
different things.

699
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,580
We missed it.
We missed it.

700
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,140
That's to say.
Yeah,

701
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:14,974
I mean it seems like probably a bit less
people are in committed relationships 

702
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,980
now because it's just a fuck rampage out
there in the streets.

703
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,620
Yeah.
We never recover just a rampage.

704
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,890
But a buddy of mine,
my friend Greg Fitzsimmons,

705
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,530
one of his good friends got divorced and
uh,

706
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,700
you know,
fucking,

707
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,930
you know,
the whole deal.

708
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,630
Torturous marriage hung in there too 
long.

709
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:38,380
The whole deal.
No sex for the last year and a half plus

710
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,430
raw,
got out and now he's just on a pussy.

711
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,013
Catastrophic rampage.
I mean there's Dude's just crushing any 

712
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,580
sad.
Right?

713
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,050
He's happy,
he's happy.

714
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,160
He's got a giant smile on his face and 
his phone's vibrating.

715
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,560
It's amazing.
Yep.

716
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,660
Yeah,
I mean sleepiness and it does.

717
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,560
You don't even have to be a good looking
guy.

718
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,394
He's all right.
But I mean it's not even that carries 

719
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:04,750
water finds its own level so you could 
find your level.

720
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:05,770
You find what it.
Well,

721
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:07,480
that's exactly who is willing to fuck 
you.

722
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,640
They're out there.
They're out there always someone.

723
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:12,070
Someone's willing to fuck you 100 
percent.

724
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:12,904
True.
You just gotta find that person might 

725
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,500
not be everybody.
No,

726
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,960
but what's real fun is when you actually
break out of your level.

727
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,853
Yes.
Once in a blue moon every now and then 

728
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,020
every now and then below your level or 
above your level.

729
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,990
Every now and then the moment you 
actually talk about the three point line

730
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:30,280
and it's nothing but net.
You're like,

731
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:31,900
what?
How did that happen?

732
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,893
Yeah.
Well,

733
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,250
you know,
it's just,

734
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,223
it's fascinating to me because I'm 
really concerned about the integration 

735
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,430
of human beings and technology.
Not Concerned.

736
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:49,150
I shouldn't say concern,
but puzzled as to the end point.

737
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,580
The end point is the robots kill us all.
You think so?

738
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,510
Yeah.
Really?

739
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,130
Yep.
Why do you think that?

740
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:54,964
I think we integrate with them.
I think we can come see me until we 

741
00:31:57,401 --> 00:32:00,070
become bothering forced to them.
Yeah,

742
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,270
and we don't stop.
Well,

743
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,104
I think it's those pussies that are 
scared to integrate that we're going to 

744
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,490
have to kill off.
I think it's folks like you and me,

745
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,324
they're going to get the chips so you 
think we'll be able to survive on team 

746
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,800
robot.
I really killed those humans.

747
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,673
I think there's gonna be some,
some folks that want to make their own 

748
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:17,820
homemade bows and arrows and shit and 
chop the.

749
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,490
Yeah,
with a stone ax like those assholes.

750
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,503
I don't use matches.
I'm fucking robe starts to grow those 

751
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,170
people,
they're going to be a problem.

752
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,480
I think people can be scared of it.
Like as we continue.

753
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,480
I mean people are scared of technology 
for regeneration of it.

754
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm real curious how far it gets before 
we get to 80,

755
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:36,730
90,
a hundred.

756
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,710
Like what are we going to really see at 
the tail end?

757
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,883
Right.
I mean you think of somebody who's 90 

758
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,410
years old now,
the shit they saw.

759
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,700
Like I mean if you go the whole gamut,
like,

760
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,050
like in their forties and fifties,
they're like a television,

761
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,571
you know,
like.

762
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:50,030
I mean,
so you know.

763
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,070
Do you remember?
How old are you?

764
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,240
Forty nine.
Perfect.

765
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,590
Your little.
I don't know.

766
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,260
I don't know how this plays out for you.
You might have been a slightly.

767
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,550
I'm 41,
so it's slightly.

768
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,900
It'll be interesting to see what you 
say.

769
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,020
The jumped from fucking Atari to 
Nintendo.

770
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,033
Oh yeah.
Santa giant insanity or the iphone from 

771
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,670
the fucking razor or whatever.
So when you have those moments,

772
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,193
that's when it gets interesting when you
have that quantum product that leaps 

773
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:16,334
everything,
the ipod from whatever the MP3 fucking 

774
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:23,360
horseshit things we had said it's going 
to be artificial parts too.

775
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,980
I think that's going to be a big part of
it.

776
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:25,814
Like people who are blind getting them 
artificial eyes that worked better than 

777
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:29,504
realize and then people,
you mean initially it's gonna be not as 

778
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,430
good and then it's going to be as good 
as you were.

779
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,280
80,
60 slash 50.

780
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,710
Now you're 19.
Well not even plastic surgery.

781
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,544
It's going to be genetic manipulation.
I'm saying that the back to pattern 

782
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:46,010
recognition when when plastic surgery 
came out,

783
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,980
you are 50 40,
you know that range now,

784
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,993
18 year old girl,
16 year old girls are attacking it 

785
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,310
earlier.

786
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,143
So when first it's going to be for the 
blind and then some dudes going to be 

787
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,044
like,
wait a minute,

788
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,973
fuck this,
why is my friend who was blind can see 

789
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,000
shit better than me,
I'm going to just do that.

790
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:02,834
And it could go from defense to offense.
Somebody showed me a breakdown of Kylie 

791
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,710
Jenner's plastic surgery over the years 
and she's only like 20 years old.

792
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,633
That's right.
And this girl has had her face just 

793
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,560
chopped apart.
She's had her chin widdled down,

794
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,570
she's had her hips widen,
her breast enhance.

795
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,240
She's a little kid.
I get it.

796
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,440
And she's just there.
There's sculpting her with scalpels.

797
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,550
Yep.
It's very,

798
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:29,384
very,
very strange because she doesn't look 

799
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,020
remotely like she used to look just a 
couple of years ago.

800
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,820
That's right.
And I'm thinking heralded for it amongst

801
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:38,654
their peers.
And so what do you think's going to 

802
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,650
happen?
People are going to follow that pattern.

803
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,590
Oh,
for sure.

804
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,483
Yeah.
I mean they're jumping in head first 

805
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,310
starts with celebrity than it supposed 
to.

806
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,480
The affluent.
Well,

807
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,240
the amount of money that it cost to do 
something like that.

808
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,074
It's got to be in the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars because she's had 

809
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,790
some really extensive stuff done.
I mean,

810
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,740
you just didn't see that when we were 
kids.

811
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:58,574
No,
you didn't see a 20 year old girl that 

812
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,300
hadn't been.
Maybe a girl got a boob job.

813
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,650
Maybe,
but not even.

814
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,360
I mean it was so rare for later.
You know,

815
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,210
maybe in our twenties we heard about 
such stuff.

816
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,550
Wait a minute.
One didn't to do that,

817
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,810
you know,
I get it,

818
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,780
but now it's bizarre.
Like they're doing stuff to their hips,

819
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,063
like girls are getting their hips wide 
and because asses the offense now I 

820
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,860
don't.
But it's just so strange to see.

821
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:22,694
Like when you look at a person and you 
know their asses mostly like some weird 

822
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,180
extra substance that they're sticking in
their lap it up.

823
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,083
But you know what the guys respond.
Like my good friend moves set a long 

824
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,550
time ago.
He said good friend named Moose.

825
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,560
Yeah.
Robin use.

826
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,670
We call them loose.
He said about fake boobs.

827
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:42,810
He's like,
if they're fake,

828
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:45,060
why can I put them in my mouth?
Yeah.

829
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,950
If I can touch them,
they're real.

830
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,380
It was in 1999 albums.
Yeah.

831
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,050
I think that it's um,
it's,

832
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,540
it's a fascinating thing because we 
don't care,

833
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,300
but we do care when it gets to lips,
you know,

834
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,780
there's something about lips were like,
hey,

835
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,251
hey,
hey,

836
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:02,760
slow the fuck up.
Like you can get those preposterous tits

837
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,340
and nobody blinks.
But as soon as you get to lips,

838
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:06,174
gods go Jesus.
Like there's something about when they 

839
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,060
have this crazy.
Yep.

840
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,470
The lip implant thing.
That's a strange one,

841
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,304
man.
That is a,

842
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,173
there's something sad about that one 
where it elicits a response that you 

843
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:19,710
don't get out of the boobs.

844
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,813
I get it.
Yeah.

845
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,650
I could.
Dude's nothing.

846
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,140
Not a,
not a Dick Implant and site.

847
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,860
Not a goddamn thing you can do to start 
happening soon or thing it's going to be

848
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,480
genetic.
Yeah.

849
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,760
And when it happens,
I used to have a bit about that.

850
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,623
It's going to take about 30 minutes for 
the first guy to dive and overdose 

851
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,270
because they go out with a pill that 
makes your dick bigger.

852
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:40,104
We're not taking one.
We're taking them all just going to go 

853
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,010
give me a stroke.
Give me one less than that.

854
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,240
Let's fucking do this.
Simple that way.

855
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,313
Yeah.
Well we're going to morph because 

856
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,173
vaginas are going to have to change to 
deal with the size of the Dick because 

857
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:56,850
dudes are going to have carpet roll Cox.
It's just going to be this giant.

858
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,883
No,
we're not going to stop like people 

859
00:36:59,281 --> 00:36:59,790
don't understand.

860
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,340
Like once we have that ability to get 
bigger dicks than once,

861
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,533
it's going to be like those crazy ladies
who bought crushed beer cans with her 

862
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:07,030
tits.
You ever see them?

863
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:11,940
They get like a triple Z on instagram.
It's going to get to that point.

864
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,320
It's the spot.
Yeah.

865
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,370
It's soft porn though.
I like how they don't go full twitter.

866
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,510
Well that's why I'm glad it's soft porn.
But twitter,

867
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:22,600
let's use twitter.
You can fuck me.

868
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,750
You can do whatever you want on twitter.
I kinda liked that.

869
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,510
Don't be confused.
Instagram can go there too.

870
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,390
If what you have to be private is to be 
a private page.

871
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,630
I mean nothing and then they get pulled.
Tumbler was really there.

872
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,680
Really?
Oh yeah,

873
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,713
nodding furiously.
It investor and Tumbler and the growth 

874
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,160
was enormous.
At one point I'm like,

875
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,660
where's all this growth coming from?

876
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,111
I'm like,
Oh,

877
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:43,944
poor.
Oh well what tumbler at one point in 

878
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:48,780
time became like really tormented social
justice warriors,

879
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:52,080
making bizarre blogs that are very 
difficult for you to understand.

880
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,170
On that note though,
it was a very creative space.

881
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,910
It was,
you say was like,

882
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:57,840
it's gone,
it's gone.

883
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,510
What happened?
Everybody left is it?

884
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,850
But it's still active,
but no,

885
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,130
I like my space.
Like a club,

886
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,173
like sometimes the clubs,
the hottest club in your city still in 

887
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:10,104
business six years later,
but like it's bridges and tunnels and 

888
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,180
shit like that.
Right,

889
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,023
right,
right.

890
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,953
Yeah.
Weird bridges and tunnels that people 

891
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:18,924
don't know.
What that means is they give you a 

892
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:22,470
little doing some recall for powerful 
Jersey.

893
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:23,963
Yeah.
It's um,

894
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,490
it's,
it's interesting the trends,

895
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,353
you know,
like why did my space go away like that 

896
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,900
because the operators weren't good 
enough.

897
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,793
So I'll tell you what's interesting 
about the trends in social and business 

898
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,220
digital that people don't understand.
Everybody

899
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,400
was waiting for facebook to go away.
It sucks as a beast.

900
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,283
He's an extremely talented all time CEO 
and so he was good enough if my space 

901
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,340
was run,
first of all,

902
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,174
it's sold to newscorp and so once it was
owned by the big company you talked 

903
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,950
about earlier today?
No,

904
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,903
they wanted to milk it.
You know what they did with the first 

905
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,100
second?
They got it.

906
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,113
They pump the shit out of their x men 
movie that they owned into the platform 

907
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,733
because the economics and the movie were
greater than the investment they 

908
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:06,310
thought.
So they were milking it.

909
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,213
Right?
It's like somebody buying this and just 

910
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:13,060
pumping ungodly amounts of whatever 
products they thought.

911
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,010
Your audience read into the point where 
they just saturated it.

912
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,630
Isn't it weird how something gets a 
stink on it and then that's kind of it.

913
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,050
Like no one wants to come along and try 
to revamp my space.

914
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,191
That's.
So.

915
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,280
That's another interesting insight.
One of the things that I'm dying to know

916
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,340
in a 15 year window is will there ever 
be a recall?

917
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,180
Will something die?
Will anybody,

918
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,470
because I want to buy it to the B,
two b space.

919
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,140
I want to buy a historic brand,
like I want to buy friendster.

920
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,190
First of all,
I just want.

921
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,080
I just want,
I just want the Ip,

922
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,290
so I think nostalgia plays so the same 
way.

923
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,220
We talk about like saved by the bell and
that fucking the sparks and I think that

924
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:53,221
I can buy tumbler in nine years for $40,
Aka $11,000,000

925
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,680
and just make enough on tee shirts to 
the kids when they're 40.

926
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,903
They're now 25 that were 15 year olds 
doing all those weird sites because 

927
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:03,971
they're like,
yeah,

928
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,980
tell him that it was the best.
You a good point.

929
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:09,010
Because Jamie and I were looking the 
other day at all the Netflix shows,

930
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:10,180
like what's most popular?

931
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,960
Fuller House is the most popular show.
Bringing everything back to him for just

932
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,200
coming back,
like at 24 is going to be on Netflix now

933
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,690
it's going to be a Fox Fox,
but it's a different 24,

934
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,760
right?
Yeah.

935
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,603
But I mean like,
you know,

936
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,790
yes they're.
But they're bringing the style.

937
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,770
Joe,
Joe,

938
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,240
my big theory is nostalgia is one of the
most under priced assets in the world.

939
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,130
So,
so my entire thesis in business,

940
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,110
so I want to buy the New York jets.
Let's take a step back.

941
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,820
Yes.
Really?

942
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,650
Yes.
And I'm going to.

943
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,450
Oh my God.
And I'm so.

944
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,210
It's a very good.
I'm going to make it happen.

945
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,493
So the way I think I'm going to buy the 
jets and the reason I built my company 

946
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,360
gonna sell friendster.
No,

947
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,613
but I'm going to go and buy Mug croupier
or animal crackers or cracker jacks or 

948
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,330
or rainbow pops.
I'm going to buy a brand and then market

949
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,164
it like it's 20,
20 instead of the Horse Shit TV 

950
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:01,984
commercials and fucking billboards and 
print and all the bullshit that these 

951
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,630
companies do.
Right?

952
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,530
And then I'm going to buy it for $130 
million,

953
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,580
do my thing and then resell it for two 
point 3 billion by the jets,

954
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:15,010
win super bowls and then I can die.
Damn Dude,

955
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,390
that's the ultimate goal.
That's the plan.

956
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,500
Brother.
Own the jets.

957
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,353
Yes.

958
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,123
But you don't.
You think that you're the kind of guy 

959
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:23,620
that you'll own the jets and go,
you know what I'm saying?

960
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,200
It's not enough what I need to win super
bowls.

961
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,910
Right?
So I'm going to be like crazy.

962
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:30,250
Like I'm going to make all these crazy 
owners seem calm.

963
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:31,084
I'm going to be like,
I'm going to do shit like I'm going to 

964
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,430
play.
I'm really a 71

965
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,140
year old wide receiver.
Oh,

966
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,210
don't do that.
Maybe you couldn't do that once.

967
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,044
Genetic engineering kits to the point 
where they could just to come out with 

968
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:41,354
my fucking let's.
I'm going to come out with my fucking 

969
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,140
bionic eyes and let's look and run a 
four,

970
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,700
3:40
with my new fucking feet.

971
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,430
Yeah.
Brian made from like duck fucking ass or

972
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,264
whatever.
You know?

973
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,280
Yeah.
Like when they integrate a.

974
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,123
What was that article about?
Their integrating spider silk into a 

975
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,803
human tissue.
They're grading artificial skin for 

976
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:04,640
human beings.
Were they going to integrate spider silk

977
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,610
into human tissue to make it 
bulletproof?

978
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,300
That's fucking Rad.
Yeah.

979
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah.
That's a real thing.

980
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,970
I heard the Peter Teal and I want to 
make sure I'm saying this,

981
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,033
but I think till they leave.
This is bulletproof skin made from 

982
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,400
spider silk proteins and human skin 
cells.

983
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,711
By the way,
guys,

984
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:22,544
this is all coming.

985
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,280
Awesome.
Peter Teal,

986
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:28,070
but it might be some other.
A mogul and silicon valley is,

987
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,340
is putting young blood in himself.
It is him.

988
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:31,970
Yeah,
yeah,

989
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,530
yeah.
Yeah.

990
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,000
So is that going to work?
Well,

991
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:36,920
it's kind of like ask him do it.
It's bullets based.

992
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,460
This is the theory that it's based on.
Forget about getting like a log dick.

993
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,330
Tell me something that won't let me die 
and that I will definitely do.

994
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,490
Well,
not only will not let you die,

995
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,860
which is entirely possible.
It's going to extend your life,

996
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:49,694
but more importantly,
it'll give you more energy while you're 

997
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:51,764
alive now,
which makes it fascinating because 

998
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,440
you're going to be able to do the thing.
Yeah,

999
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
fuck you.
I'm thinking about doing it tomorrow.

1000
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,010
I might fly up.
What about the spider doing that too?

1001
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,180
Go ahead ma'am.
Shoot,

1002
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,180
bitch.
At the thing is that bullet will destroy

1003
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:05,960
your bones.

1004
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,850
That's so they're going to have to do 
something with the bone.

1005
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,690
They're going to have to give you some 
read Adam and tanium bones underneath,

1006
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,583
because like the spider silk,
nothing gets so jacked in like four 

1007
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,750
minutes.
What does he do that 100 percent?

1008
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,840
One thousand percent.
One million percent good.

1009
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,710
And he also does intermittent fasting,
so he drops a lot of body fat.

1010
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,161
Got It.
You know,

1011
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:28,310
you get into a state of Ketosis,
you don't eat for 14 hours.

1012
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,200
He pounds like low fat,
low carbohydrate,

1013
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,860
high fat,
high contact.

1014
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,410
So this,
his body's burning fat.

1015
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,420
He's doing tons of steroids.
I'm sure.

1016
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,130
Allegedly.
I don't know you.

1017
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,260
You seem like a nice guy.
I'm not shitting on you buddy.

1018
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,240
I like them.
I'm a big fan.

1019
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:45,140
I like Hugh Jackman.
Yeah,

1020
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,600
it was fun,
but I think he's on steroids.

1021
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,330
Just sure.
Yeah.

1022
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:52,580
I'm just telling you I'm an expert in 
that shit.

1023
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,223
I can tell.
I mean it's very difficult to look the 

1024
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,730
way he looks without doing them.
Very,

1025
00:43:58,731 --> 00:43:59,860
very,
very difficult.

1026
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,400
Excuse me the other day and I'm like,
man,

1027
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,490
he fucking beefs up fast.
Yeah,

1028
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,521
yeah.
Well,

1029
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,500
he does the right shit though,
you know what I mean?

1030
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,420
But that's the thing about like saying 
someone does steroids,

1031
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:11,200
it's not enough like you.
It's not like he takes a pill,

1032
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,260
a conversation that might train.
So I started working out three years ago

1033
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,490
finally taking this serious.
I've had two,

1034
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,500
two trainers full time.
They travel with me.

1035
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:20,660
I've really gotten into it.
I've got my life damaged.

1036
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,880
How many trainers I've had,
I've had,

1037
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,490
I only have one trainer at a time and 
they travel with you,

1038
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,640
but they travel with me.
So I was really out of shape,

1039
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,863
like come never worked out,
didn't have a muscle my fucking body 

1040
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,713
three years ago.

1041
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,950
And I'm like,
I'm gonna die.

1042
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,040
This is stupid and I can afford it.
I'm going to hire.

1043
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,263
I'm not held accountable to myself,
but I'm very good at being accountable 

1044
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:43,320
to others.
That's why I run good businesses.

1045
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:45,660
I don't want to let the team down.
So I figured it out.

1046
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,740
I fucking found the binary switch.
So I hired somebody and they travel with

1047
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:50,930
me.
Well that's so days.

1048
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,410
That's an awesome idea because it will 
force you to work out.

1049
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,380
Both of them are.
No,

1050
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,760
not with them.
The first guy,

1051
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:58,830
Mike is like,
like it was interesting.

1052
00:44:58,831 --> 00:44:59,664
He wasn't saying do steroids,
but it was interesting to hear a 

1053
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,240
perspective of like,
peep.

1054
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,750
I've been fascinated by the steroid 
conversation in general.

1055
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,580
Like I think certain things become taboo
and then they don't like marijuana.

1056
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,763
Right?
Is Steroids that I'm asking you because 

1057
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,930
I feel like you're closer to that genre 
than I am.

1058
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,530
Well,
they most certainly work 100 percent.

1059
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,960
So let's go.
Let's go over that first.

1060
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:24,630
Let's take it from step by step.
Here's what's important.

1061
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,493
It's very important that young people 
don't do them and this is why because 

1062
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,184
you ruined your endocrine system.
It's very important that young people 

1063
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:35,580
realize that if you do get an 18 now 
even into your twenties,

1064
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,953
when you do steroids and you're a young 
person and you have a healthy endocrine 

1065
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,154
system,
what happens is you inject exogenous 

1066
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:46,170
steroids or exotic testosterone into 
your system.

1067
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:47,004
It shuts down your natural production of
testosterone and then you're fucked 

1068
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,830
because then when you get off the 
steroids,

1069
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,903
your body doesn't work right.
Your testicles aren't functioning 

1070
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,750
correctly and it takes you roughly 
depending on the person and depending on

1071
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:01,820
how you treat it,
like what,

1072
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,100
what treatments you use to kickstart 
your endocrine system.

1073
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:05,934
Again,
half the time you want to steroids to 

1074
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:07,980
recover.

1075
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,500
So if you did a two month cycle for one 
month,

1076
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,300
you're going to be miserable and your 
Dick's not going to work.

1077
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,670
Got It.
So it's very important for young people.

1078
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,740
However,
once you get older,

1079
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,180
like I'm 49 and it becomes sort of that.
That's why people do it,

1080
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,930
put him in.
Well because it's a self esteem enabler,

1081
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,310
right?
For a guy.

1082
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:27,144
And if I'm a guy right now and I feel 
like I need the muscles for the 

1083
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,960
summertime,
he's like,

1084
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,490
I'm going to go on a cycle for two 
months.

1085
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,730
I'll have a shitty fucking ma may or 
April and that will be ready to roll.

1086
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,460
Yes.
No,

1087
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,383
you know,
you should get your blood work 

1088
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,523
monitored.
Like if you're really considering doing 

1089
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:45,654
something.
I think the most important thing is to 

1090
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:51,180
do very little to do just a small amount
and give yourself a little boost.

1091
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,283
You don't want to go fucking hog wild 
and take some Androgel 50 and turn into 

1092
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:56,304
a fucking gorilla.
You don't want to do that because it's 

1093
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,240
too much of a shock to your system.
However,

1094
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:01,800
when you're in your forties like you 
are,

1095
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,903
then testosterone replacement therapy 
becomes a very viable alternative 

1096
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:09,240
because your body is just simply not 
producing testosterone correctly.

1097
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,074
However,
can we use gorilla because I just got 

1098
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:11,800
excited.
You could.

1099
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,610
You could kind of.
You could still take some time,

1100
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,320
but here's the thing,
like the Hugh Jackman thing,

1101
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:19,740
because when I get back to that,
that motherfucker works hard.

1102
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,800
There is no way you look like that 
unless you work hard,

1103
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,170
so you have to do like really,
really,

1104
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,440
really hard.
You got to do fucking heavy dead lifts,

1105
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,120
heavy squats.
You've got to shock your system.

1106
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,760
You're got to get your body to think,
Holy Shit.

1107
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,980
This crazy asshole wants to carry around
gigantic amounts of weight.

1108
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,814
We're fighting against gravity.
We have to incorporate all of our 

1109
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,410
resources.
Your body does not want to use resources

1110
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,580
to get bigger.
It just doesn't.

1111
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:46,414
It resists it because it's not.
It's not healthy and it's not a smart 

1112
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:52,270
survival tactic like for your body to 
put on all this meat.

1113
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,283
Then all that meet needs fuel,
like your body's not totally convinced 

1114
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,990
you're going to have this fuel because 
for thousands and thousands of years,

1115
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:00,940
food was very,
very difficult to come by.

1116
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,620
So for your body to be convinced that 
you're doing this all the time,

1117
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,360
we need this extra mass like you have to
have massive amounts of food and massive

1118
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:13,180
amounts of work that's hugely important.
And then steroids,

1119
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,313
those things too,
but more important than steroids is 

1120
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:20,710
balancing your diet out,
making sure your nutrient levels are all

1121
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,430
consistent.

1122
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,263
They're all healthy,
that you have the proper amount of 

1123
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:26,230
vitamin B,
Vitamin D,

1124
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,920
All these different essential nutrients,
essential fatty acids,

1125
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:30,903
all the proper amino acids,
like a steroid is just a bandaid on an 

1126
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,890
account a least five days a week,
at least five days a week.

1127
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,780
Zero.
Jamie runs a lot.

1128
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,160
He's a fucking stud.
But um,

1129
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,830
you know,
I do a lot of different shit.

1130
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,840
I love Jamie's.
He's a fucking runner.

1131
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:52,390
You how many miles you run a lot of 
miles right now.

1132
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,201
I told you,
I'm like,

1133
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:55,210
I'm doing weight lifting and I just get 
back into basketball,

1134
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:57,850
shooting hoops this weekend.
When you were at your peak of running,

1135
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,070
you running some pretty impressive 
numbers of miles a week.

1136
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:00,660
Easily.
Yeah,

1137
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,493
that's back to basketball.
I just put up a post so I didn't let my 

1138
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,194
brother Aja score on me and he's 11 
years younger than me until he was like 

1139
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,560
15 score score.
You wouldn't let them know.

1140
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,110
I'm a.
So I'm my four year old guy.

1141
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,640
He's got,
he's got a Zander,

1142
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:21,070
my little guy,
he's got a weird condition when he picks

1143
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:21,904
up the basketball he starts kind of 
weirdly crying cause he knows dad's 

1144
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,760
going to come out of somewhere and block
the fucking shit out of him.

1145
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,193
And so I posted this thing about it 
today on instagram and it was funny to 

1146
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:32,614
watch everybody.
I mean everybody's in these fucking 

1147
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:34,743
eighth place trophies.
I'm going to kill people like all this 

1148
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:37,834
fucking infrastructure of fake fucking 
self esteem and then these kids go into 

1149
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,510
the market and they get punched in the 
mouth and they don't know what to do.

1150
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,760
So you don't let your kids score and you
either know.

1151
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,600
That's hilarious.
I will not let I'm,

1152
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,150
I'm,
I'm fucking gonna.

1153
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,780
Beat the like until he could win,
then he's good.

1154
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,320
Like age.

1155
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,790
My brother has a better basketball 
player than me because I didn't let him.

1156
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,330
Like,
what?

1157
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,160
What are you going to let people score 
for?

1158
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,310
That's a very interesting perspective.
Let me give you mine,

1159
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,570
please.
I don't.

1160
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,583
Um,
I don't think you should ever be very 

1161
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,790
competitive with people who are not 
competitive with you.

1162
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,310
So here's a perfect example.
An interesting thing.

1163
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:15,310
When I do Jujitsu,
I'm a black belt in Jujitsu,

1164
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,220
Jujitsu with a white belt.
I treat them very kindly.

1165
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,980
I,
I might tap them out a little bit,

1166
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:21,814
but I,
there's no way I roll with them the way 

1167
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:24,580
I roll with another black belt.
Well,

1168
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:27,290
that's fighting in that there's a 
difference.

1169
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,630
It's not a statement.
It's a game.

1170
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,660
The game respect.
So what like when,

1171
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,150
like if I'm rolling with someone and 
they're making mistakes,

1172
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:37,760
I'll correct their mistakes if I want it
to.

1173
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,440
If I'm wrong with someone who's a white 
belt,

1174
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,920
I could just cut right through them,
just keep cutting right through them.

1175
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:43,754
But you know what you do with them,
you discourage people from doing it and 

1176
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,300
it's not really fair because you're not 
getting anything out of it either.

1177
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,163
All you're getting out of you're 
practicing like a grappling dummy and 

1178
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:55,820
like occasionally maybe that's a good 
thing to do.

1179
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,360
I feel like once you get into the blue 
belt and purple belt range,

1180
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,810
then I'm going to go with you 100 
percent because when you're dealing with

1181
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:05,120
someone who's not really competitive 
with you,

1182
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,523
it doesn't make sense.
You're not getting anything out of it 

1183
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:09,770
really.
You know?

1184
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,210
I think.
I think it's an interesting perspective.

1185
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:16,390
So what you really lovely like kids kick
the shit out of me.

1186
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,370
I have an eight.
Anyone martial arts?

1187
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,880
I have an eight year old and she's.

1188
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,450
She's allowed to punch me and kick me 
full blast.

1189
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,550
She doesn't kick the shit out of me.
Yeah.

1190
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,710
Of course,
but she's 50 pounds,

1191
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:31,130
but she leg kicks me full blast.
I mean I don't ever hit her back.

1192
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,910
She,
she sets up leg kicks,

1193
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:33,744
she throws a left hook to the body and 
then she comes around with that right 

1194
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:36,500
leg kick.
WHAP whap.

1195
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,080
And as long you mean she's allowed to 
hit me full blast.

1196
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,880
So like she'll,
she'll go,

1197
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:41,714
can I hit you on?
All right,

1198
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,750
go ahead and she'll just tee off on me.
So it gets her used to doing it now if I

1199
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:48,710
like.
Every time she went to do that,

1200
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:52,190
I checked it and it hurt her shin or 
punched her in the face.

1201
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,203
Well then she's going to have this 
mental block in her head that she's not 

1202
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:58,340
gonna be able to overcome one day she's 
going to get to be,

1203
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,950
get to a point where I can light spar 
with her.

1204
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,881
She's not there.
Yeah,

1205
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:05,120
I do think maybe she'll get there some 
certain games play out differently.

1206
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,410
Right?
I mean fun.

1207
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,860
Like I'm not letting my seven year old 
daughter score basket either.

1208
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,600
Right.
But I probably wouldn't punch her in the

1209
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:12,434
face.
Right,

1210
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,230
right,
right,

1211
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,760
right.
I'm not letting her beat me in.

1212
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,910
No,
you're not even letting her know.

1213
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,863
That's fun.
I won't like snap her neck or rip your 

1214
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,750
throat out like yes.
Well what I do is like say like,

1215
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,040
here's another example,
like if I'm rolling with a girl,

1216
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,623
you know,
if you're a man is doing Jujitsu with a 

1217
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:28,770
girl.
Yeah.

1218
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,603
If you're going full blast,
you're not getting anything out of it 

1219
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:32,894
either.
So what I do is if I'm sparring with a 

1220
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:35,444
girl,
I pretend that I'm only as strong as 

1221
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:39,470
them,
so if they're pushing against me instead

1222
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:42,770
of going the fuck out of here and just 
locking down and you know,

1223
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:46,670
and giving them the full chimpanzee 
strength I give,

1224
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,780
I give with things.

1225
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,613
So I don't,
I don't want to allow my body to use 

1226
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:51,960
full blast.
I understand.

1227
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,813
So as they push I just give in and try 
to use technique and find a better way 

1228
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:56,970
in,
you know,

1229
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,640
I just try it out,
we'll try to go with it,

1230
00:52:59,090 --> 00:52:59,923
you know?
Yeah.

1231
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,660
So yeah,
I let them score on me in that sense.

1232
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:04,250
Like I'll let them get side control on 
me.

1233
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,140
And then I'll hit escape and try to get 
back in,

1234
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,830
but everything I do,
I do with almost no strength.

1235
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,510
I just move my own body away.
I would tap them out in four seconds.

1236
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,440
I just don't know any.
I understand.

1237
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,343
Probably wouldn't by the way,
just because 99 percent of you don't 

1238
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:22,850
know me.
I wouldn't have done it at all.

1239
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:26,100
I would've never even got in there.
I don't know that thing.

1240
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
But if you did know that thing,
I think maybe you'd probably have a 

1241
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:29,220
different opinion on it.

1242
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:33,600
Correct.
What I mean by that thing is if I like,

1243
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,523
I'm either going to go in there and not 
let the guy score or what would have 

1244
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,390
mostly likely happened is I wouldn't go 
in the ring.

1245
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,960
Whatever that ring is at all in the 
first place.

1246
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,610
I'm not trying to discourage.
No,

1247
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,830
I know what you're playing.
Like.

1248
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,003
Yeah.
I just think that when you're playing 

1249
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,830
basketball and you're playing basketball
with a small person,

1250
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:50,664
that doesn't move as good as you.
You're trying to blow them out of just 

1251
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:58,110
knocking them by slamming,
slamming shit.

1252
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,363
Put it if I can.
But if I can win 11 nothing and remind 

1253
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:05,400
them for the rest of their lives,
I'm interested in that.

1254
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:06,240
So fine.

1255
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,520
I don't know what else to say.
I understand what you're saying.

1256
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,630
Dick.
Did the competition.

1257
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,770
It's fun.
I enjoy it.

1258
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,753
I'm not trying to hurt me.
Like I think there's two ways to build 

1259
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:18,000
the biggest building.
One,

1260
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:21,720
just build the biggest building or to 
tear everybody else's.

1261
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:22,554
Building down.
No interest in hearing other people's 

1262
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,213
buildings.
But if I fucking build the biggest 

1263
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:28,074
building I'm letting you know.
And the same way that you should let me 

1264
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:34,110
know I'm not gonna cry about that,
but I love the game.

1265
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,063
That's why I love business.
It's the one place you can do that 

1266
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:37,560
forever.
I agree with you,

1267
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,394
but I just feel like physical things 
that becomes a very to a different 

1268
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,720
place.
I'm not in rings and that gets into it.

1269
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,970
Again,
in basketball,

1270
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:45,804
like you run faster,
you'll feel very comfortable shutting 

1271
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,910
out my seven year old daughter and 
basketball,

1272
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,980
but I'm completely not comfortable 
punching so you know.

1273
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,750
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

1274
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:56,940
Let's let her score,
man.

1275
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,530
Let her let her sneak through a little 
bit.

1276
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,040
Do you think the paper view of Mcgregor 
Mayweather?

1277
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,690
It's going to be because it's not just 
not a debate anymore.

1278
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,063
Hundred percent going to happen.
I don't know about that 100 percent 

1279
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,104
gonna happen.
No.

1280
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,020
Putting it on tape right now might not 
be right.

1281
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,470
Well,
listen.

1282
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,310
Well,
you know what?

1283
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,173
Either build the biggest building or not
when I will have a nice little exchange 

1284
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:16,260
in 40 years.
You will.

1285
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,180
You'll make fun of me.
You'll know you're close as clip.

1286
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,100
It's happening.
Well,

1287
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,943
I would say doing everything they can.
If you looked at it as in terms of a 

1288
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,350
zero percent chance to 100 percent 
number,

1289
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,860
I think we're in the seventies in the 
seventies or eighties,

1290
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,780
clarify because I think that's where 
Brad as well.

1291
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,980
I think there's a significant legal 
hurdle to overcome with the UFC and they

1292
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:35,520
might not.

1293
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,280
Might not overcome that depending on how
they play that card.

1294
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,470
This is my opinion on it.
Now.

1295
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,680
Mcgregor has publicly stated that he 
believes because of the Ali Act,

1296
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,790
he can compete in boxing and not do it 
with the UFC,

1297
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:52,050
but he wants everything to be smooth so 
he would rather have the UFC involved,

1298
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,250
but he also wants the UFC to recognize 
what he says is their place,

1299
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:59,750
so there's mayweather productions,
the UFC and mcgregor productions,

1300
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:00,584
so this is what he's promotions rather,
so this is what he is stating now he's 

1301
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:05,304
going to be a partner in the promotion 
and so there's going to be some sort of 

1302
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:09,904
a negotiation for how things are split 
up in three ways and then the question 

1303
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:16,710
becomes can can they work that out?
Okay.

1304
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,544
If they can work that out,
then it becomes a question of should 

1305
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:21,294
they do it and will it be competitive 
and is it good for their brand and 

1306
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,040
that's where they might have a debate on
this.

1307
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,913
I think what's gonna end up happening is
the economics are going to be so big 

1308
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,320
that it's going to override the brand 
play.

1309
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:34,240
The the math is just going to be too 
big.

1310
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,250
It's possible,
but mcgregor so big.

1311
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,710
The economics of him fighting and MMA 
like see,

1312
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,140
look at it this way.
So if he fights mayweather,

1313
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,990
maybe there'll be 4 million pay per view
buys.

1314
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:45,480
Right.
But it was packed.

1315
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,250
What was Pacquiao mayweather before?
What was it,

1316
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,600
Jamie?
Four and a half or something.

1317
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:51,310
We looked at it the other day.
Just Google it.

1318
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,050
Google it real quick.
I think it was like four and a half.

1319
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,200
I think it was the biggest of all.
Four point six,

1320
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:56,860
right?
Was it a four point six?

1321
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,480
I think was the biggest of all.
Well,

1322
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,670
we'll find out.
I think it was the biggest of all time.

1323
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,070
And uh,
I think that,

1324
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,380
that those numbers though,
here's the deal.

1325
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,980
Mcgregor can do those numbers over the 
course of three fights.

1326
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,120
So is that a 44 point six?
So four point 6 million papers using now

1327
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,410
mcgregor has done one point five for the
Nate Diaz rematch.

1328
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,940
One point three for Eddie Alvarez.
Some.

1329
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,270
Somewhere around those range.
So that right there,

1330
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,104
just those two together.
A roughly $3 million pay per views for 

1331
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,900
to fight.
He making notes.

1332
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,920
Fights.
Fuck load.

1333
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:29,803
No,
no,

1334
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,753
he's not going to make the kind of,
I mean not as not the same money he 

1335
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:33,980
would make as a co promoter,
but,

1336
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,013
and,
and if he loses in a bat in a boxing 

1337
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:40,090
match,
it's so simple for him to say,

1338
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,820
that's not what I do and go back.
That's true.

1339
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,853
I don't know.
MMA,

1340
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,750
the not even remotely close to you and 
not enough to be dangerous here,

1341
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,160
but what,
from what I understand,

1342
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:49,210
I've done a little homework.

1343
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,310
He doesn't have a lot of great natural 
fights.

1344
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:53,650
He's a third fight with Diaz.
Great natural fights.

1345
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,810
These next three fights,
he's got a bunch.

1346
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,240
So help me understand what like,
you know,

1347
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,870
that's why I'm setting it up for you.
So from a financial standpoint,

1348
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:03,130
from what the fans want,
right?

1349
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:06,190
The champions underneath of it seems 
like he's fought several of them.

1350
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,290
He's one those pretty glaringly.
Cool.

1351
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,470
What's the boy when the Nate Diaz fight 
glaring?

1352
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,870
The first one on the second one was a 
very close decision.

1353
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,580
I mean the other new ideas is the big 
one is the big one.

1354
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:21,520
So that one brings in close to 2 million
pay per view buys.

1355
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,350
I really do.
I grieve ds three,

1356
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,170
one point three and one point two,
one point five,

1357
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,030
one point five and one point three,
three for Eddie Alvarez where he won his

1358
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:31,150
second world title,
right?

1359
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,253
The other one is tyron woodley or 
whoever wins the tyron woodley versus 

1360
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,620
Stephen Wonderboy Thompson rematch for 
170 pound title.

1361
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,460
That's an interesting fight too,
because if it goes up and and challenges

1362
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:45,580
at one 70 and winds that Jesus fucking 
Christ,

1363
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:49,060
now he's through the roof.
Now he's the biggest star in sports.

1364
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:54,061
I mean he becomes this gigantic,
huge global worldwide phenomenon that's,

1365
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,300
that's entirely inside the realm of 
possibility.

1366
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,283
Now he's not favored in a fight.
He gets 170 pound champion because the 

1367
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:04,020
guys are bigger,
they're faster or they're,

1368
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,230
they're,
they're stronger rather.

1369
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,870
But he's fast as fuck.
He's really clever.

1370
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:10,330
He's very interesting.
The way he approached his fights,

1371
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:11,164
he's,
he's very intelligent and it's not 

1372
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,104
outside the realm of possibility that he
could beat someone at 170 pounds that's 

1373
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:19,270
holding the world title,
whoever that is.

1374
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,770
So that's a big fight too,
and that could also with him attached to

1375
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,290
bring in one point five,
maybe 2 million pay per view buys.

1376
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,243
So what you're talking about is in a 
couple of fights he could make what he 

1377
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:34,160
could make in that one.
Floyd mayweather fight.

1378
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:37,280
He wants to be a global icon.
There's no way.

1379
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:41,210
Anything he does in just MMA trumps that
fight.

1380
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:41,751
No,
no,

1381
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:42,510
you're right.
You're right.

1382
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,670
Because it's a short sentence.
It transcends the sport also.

1383
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,563
It's a really good match for him because
mayweather doesn't really knock people 

1384
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:53,030
out.
I mean he knocked out Victor Ortiz,

1385
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,250
Ortiz had his hands down.
Exactly.

1386
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,260
He fucked up.
He headbutted him and then he was trying

1387
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,090
to apologize and then may whether the 
chaotic.

1388
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,160
But that was a different sort of 
scenario.

1389
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,510
Before that.
The last guy,

1390
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:05,480
I believe he stopped as Ricky Hatton and
he stumped.

1391
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,070
Yeah,
11 or 12.

1392
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,080
I mean he's in.
But by the way,

1393
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,780
Ricky Hatton is like half the size of 
conor mcgregor.

1394
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,550
Conor mcgregor is a big guy.

1395
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,020
He's tall.
He's five,

1396
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:17,600
nine.
He's broad shouldered and he fights.

1397
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,850
He can fight easily at one 70,
you know,

1398
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:24,770
he cuts weight down to 1:55.
I'm in a fairly healthy manner.

1399
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,110
Very unhealthy for him to get down to 
1:45,

1400
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:28,760
but he has done it.
If they fight,

1401
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:31,820
I assume they're going to fight 
somewhere in 155 pound range.

1402
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,120
Connor will be significantly bigger than
anybody floyd's ever fought before.

1403
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,230
What was your favorite sport growing up?
Martial arts growing up?

1404
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

1405
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,480
Yeah.
I was just like,

1406
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,333
why?
It shouldn't definitely that Chuck 

1407
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:50,300
Norris Movies got me into it times for 
sure.

1408
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,470
Yeah,
there was that,

1409
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:56,710
but there was also the finality of it 
and also finish him.

1410
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,920
Yeah.
Well it was just,

1411
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:01,110
it was so real.
Like it didn't matter to me anymore.

1412
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,630
Have a ball.
I love that.

1413
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,533
The hat,
obviously a mortal Kombat the guy right 

1414
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,760
next to the guy had the hat,
like sliced you with the hat.

1415
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:10,623
Random.
Someone's slice to mortal Kombat three 

1416
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,610
years.
Uh,

1417
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,140
it just,
to me it was so much more dangerous.

1418
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,010
It was so much more.
There's so much more on the line.

1419
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,980
Or you'll fight fan like a boxing fan 
too.

1420
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,913
I've always described martial arts as 
high level problem solving with dire 

1421
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:31,520
physical consequences.
That's what I looked at it.

1422
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:32,270
Yeah.
It's just,

1423
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,103
it's also your problem solving.
Someone who's improvising in the moment 

1424
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,473
with like.
And there's such a psychological factor 

1425
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:42,640
in why you like stand up to.
Yeah.

1426
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,800
It's how I think about keynotes.
So what.

1427
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:45,973
One of the reasons I think my speaking 
career has gone so well is I'm reverse 

1428
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,020
engineering the crowd in realtime.
How so?

1429
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,470
I'm literally give them the talk,
right?

1430
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,463
Feeding off the reactions and navigating
in an Improv manner on my business 

1431
01:01:58,731 --> 01:01:59,980
content.
Huh?

1432
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,063
So you don't have a clear outline.
I have a clear outline for the first 

1433
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:06,770
seven minutes,
which is I already gave you that spiel.

1434
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,280
I like to frame up my life.
I'm an immigrant,

1435
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,590
made that little Schpeel I already gave 
you.

1436
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,753
That's all I've got.
And then I basically go into the state 

1437
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,360
of the union.
Okay.

1438
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:20,040
So now if you're going to give a speech.
So if you're going to give

1439
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,170
one of these keynotes,
what's your objective?

1440
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,004
Like what are you trying to accomplish?
What are you doing that leg brand 

1441
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,000
legacy,
legacy.

1442
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,913
I,
so I talk about stuff that most people 

1443
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:30,324
think is coming and I think it's 
actually here and they don't think it's 

1444
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:34,344
real anything.
I'm a futurist or a or a destructor and 

1445
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,184
so I'll go and talk about instagram and 
why I think people can go from zero to 

1446
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:47,670
$100 million in their business in seven 
years or from zero to $100,000.

1447
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,720
So the amount of people listening right 
now that are making $81,000

1448
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:55,680
a year doing something they hate that 
could make $80,000

1449
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:56,514
a year on instagram either selling 
something or slowly but surely building 

1450
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:04,980
their brand and then doing content deals
is staggeringly practical.

1451
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,800
How do people make money on instagram?
I don't make any money.

1452
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,040
I have one point 8 million instagram 
followers have made zero sense.

1453
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,903
The way people make money,
the way people make money is always the 

1454
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,374
same.
So I would argue you do make money 

1455
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:18,683
because you're using a chest move 
instead of transacting just on that 

1456
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,094
platform.
That is a platform where you create 

1457
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:25,794
reach and awareness that drives towards 
things of this nature and then you 

1458
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:29,724
either sell advertising or get into 
business development where you have 

1459
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:33,983
pieces of equity in businesses that you 
build through the attention people sell 

1460
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:37,944
against the tension.
So either you're doing commercials or 

1461
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:42,540
you're doing step two,
which is you're building brand,

1462
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,793
right?
So one thing I've never done is I've 

1463
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:47,970
never been paid ever for a piece of 
content I put out on social,

1464
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:49,740
which is the majority of how people get 
paid,

1465
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:50,963
but I get paid $100,000
to give a speech and I've done that 

1466
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:56,094
because of the attention and awareness 
that I've been able to build on those 

1467
01:03:58,591 --> 01:03:58,970
platforms.

1468
01:03:58,970 --> 01:03:59,730
Every book,
Mr.

1469
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,620
Speeches,
speeches,

1470
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,693
fuck this.
Fuck all this posts and pictures of my 

1471
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,820
food.
So do I think.

1472
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,760
I think.
I think there's,

1473
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:09,743
you know,
you could sell stuff right now I'm 

1474
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,930
obsessed with people buying and selling 
shit.

1475
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,990
I don't know if you know this,
but it is scary.

1476
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,453
Scary how much money can be made if you 
go to thrift stores and Marshall's and 

1477
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,350
dollar stores and garage sales.
And Flip Shit on craigslist.

1478
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,330
Ebay let go.
Really?

1479
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,250
And I mean real economics.
So people go to thrift stores,

1480
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,020
they buy a bunch of vintage clothes and 
then they go on craigslist.

1481
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,893
It's even scarier than that.
Now that you have a phone and you get 

1482
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:42,720
the Ebay App and you just scan shit.
It's not even vintage clothes.

1483
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:45,480
Which is like the thing that most people
listening think makes sense.

1484
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,090
It's fucking every single thing on 
earth.

1485
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,420
Every single person right now that's 
listening,

1486
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,410
that's needs $5,000.
It's in your fucking house.

1487
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,770
It's in your closet,
it's in your basement,

1488
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,510
it's in your attic.
Your shit that you're not using is worth

1489
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:05,490
money and you just don't want to put in 
the work.

1490
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:06,840
The flip it,
Huh?

1491
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:07,993
Uh Huh.
So I started something called the 2017 

1492
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:11,250
flip challenge,
right?

1493
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,280
And I made this video and the amount of.
I'm getting hundreds of emails a week of

1494
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,590
people like,
Holy Shit.

1495
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,200
I was on fucking welfare.
I have college loans.

1496
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,030
I wanted to take my family on a 
vacation.

1497
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,150
And it was the fucking fourth pair of 
shoes in my closet that I didn't have.

1498
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:25,984
Or people that are not as fortunate 
maybe really don't have a lot of stuff 

1499
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,390
in their home.
They were just going to dollar stores or

1500
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,224
thrift store scanning with the Ebay APP.
One guy found some guy just bought like 

1501
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,483
80,000
fucking American apparel tee shirts for 

1502
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:39,850
$80,
forty nine cents.

1503
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:42,070
And it's like selling them for like 16 
bucks on Ebay.

1504
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,380
Like it's the flip man.
I'm telling you,

1505
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:45,214
the reason I'm saying this right now is 
I want somebody to leave with something 

1506
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,670
tangible from us.
They're paying for themselves.

1507
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,820
The flip,
like all this fucking shit here.

1508
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,460
Like I'm looking.
Yeah,

1509
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,700
I'm looking at him like that.
Big things.

1510
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,790
Probably 11 and this fucking Buddha.
So for 11 bucks,

1511
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,590
you think that's worth way more than 
that respect,

1512
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,280
you know.
But like,

1513
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,720
you know what the plan is to sell that 
guy,

1514
01:06:02,721 --> 01:06:05,930
makes those.
He actually sculpt them and then makes a

1515
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:08,960
mold of the sculpture and then sends 
them out.

1516
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,420
They're dope.
And the sunglasses actually come off.

1517
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:13,850
A biggie.
His eyes,

1518
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,490
his details in his eyes,
smoking dope,

1519
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:18,650
and then we've got a condom.
Mcgregor one here and the Tupac.

1520
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:21,350
One couple of bliss.
Plastisol guy's a bad motherfucker.

1521
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,070
So Joe on this thing.
Seriously,

1522
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,700
it's.
I'm fascinated by this.

1523
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,060
By what?
This weapon flipping shit.

1524
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,273
Yeah.
I'm fat because you understand because 

1525
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,044
of the content I put out,
I get asked a thousand times a week 

1526
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,730
through social email live streams.
How do I start?

1527
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,564
I need money.
How do I raise money from venture 

1528
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:44,640
capitalists?
I'm like,

1529
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:45,474
you don't.
You're not raising money from venture 

1530
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:51,480
capitalist lets you know you're not 
fucking like at 98 point nine percent of

1531
01:06:51,481 --> 01:06:53,670
the people are not raising money from 
venture capitalists.

1532
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,020
Invest.
You're not inventing the next instagram.

1533
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,163
Let's get a lot more fucking practical 
and like start like learning how to 

1534
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:01,284
actually make money and then take that 
money and if you want to go build an 

1535
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:06,510
APP,
would that money Mazal Tov.

1536
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,520
But learn how to actually make the 
money.

1537
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,413
And the flip thing has been,
I'd be putting out business content for 

1538
01:07:11,851 --> 01:07:12,684
a long time.
It's been the one thing that I'm 

1539
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,730
watching people actually pull off.

1540
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:15,783
Hm.
That's a really interesting perspective 

1541
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,690
because you're talking about something 
that's very practical,

1542
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,470
like somebody can actually get going on 
that books.

1543
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,070
You know,
like when someone comes to you and says,

1544
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:25,480
I want to start the new facebook,
you're like,

1545
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,120
well good luck.
Yeah,

1546
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,380
that's been,
you know this.

1547
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,463
They just think immediately they're 
going to be able to start to see match 

1548
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,343
come up and you're like,
Hey,

1549
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,223
I'm starting this business.
It's going to be like it's gonna be for 

1550
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:37,270
UFC fighters if they want.
If you.

1551
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:38,104
Yeah,
you get pitched $25 and invest in 

1552
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:42,970
businesses.
I fucking believe in let alone ones that

1553
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:43,804
you don't exactly like.
I've had people come up to me that have 

1554
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:48,140
like super solid businesses that are 
really.

1555
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:48,974
I think what they're doing is awesome.
Have you ever passed anything that's 

1556
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,160
gone on to be like monster?
What?

1557
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,260
Oh,
I'm not interested.

1558
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:57,910
I don't.
I'm not.

1559
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,430
I'm just not interested.
To me.

1560
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,323
I mean obviously I have a very different
life than you do in terms of like that 

1561
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:04,900
is what you do.
You're about.

1562
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:07,420
Because I'm not,
that's not what I do,

1563
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,520
so for me,
anything that takes away from my time is

1564
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,670
that thinking.
Yeah.

1565
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,030
Normally,
like people say,

1566
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,410
well you don't want to,
you want to have to do anything.

1567
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:15,630
You just invest it like,
no,

1568
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:16,610
you don't.
No,

1569
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,473
you don't understand because then I'm 
gonna think about it and that's very 

1570
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:20,564
valuable.
My thoughts and having that resource 

1571
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,210
occupied by anything that in is you are 
doing something,

1572
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:29,810
they're leveraging your name and now 
you're associated with it and you've got

1573
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,190
and you care about your name.
Yeah.

1574
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,300
And like there's definitely that.
I mean that's what you mean.

1575
01:08:33,301 --> 01:08:35,270
Even if my name wasn't associated with 
it,

1576
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:36,760
if it was just they were just using my 
money,

1577
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:37,594
I just,
I don't want to think like I have a 

1578
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,820
limit.
Yeah.

1579
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,580
Well I have too much shit I'm already 
thinking about.

1580
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,280
It's not less thinking.
My thinking is over.

1581
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,110
Yeah,
exactly.

1582
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:52,690
I avoid anything new just simply because
I get obsessed with things.

1583
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,150
I don't have the time I get it.
Yeah.

1584
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,720
What's the last thing you got obsessed 
with?

1585
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,380
Archery.
Archery.

1586
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,390
Bowhunting?
Yeah.

1587
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,680
Oh yeah.
Have you been doing.

1588
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:07,970
Trust me,
five years,

1589
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,580
45 years,
and continue to get worse with less than

1590
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,290
five years.
Four and a half years hunting,

1591
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,020
three years.
Bowhunting.

1592
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,280
What are you obsessed with you pussy.
Basketball.

1593
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,660
He loved me.
Like honestly,

1594
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:23,690
I've been for the last little bit last 
year.

1595
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:26,450
It's honestly what you like,
what you talk about,

1596
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:27,284
but not.
I haven't been following you for the 

1597
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,383
last year.
I've been following you since you run 

1598
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,220
diggnation a long time.
Oh yeah.

1599
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,113
By the way,
Jamie's the first person to tell me 

1600
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:33,644
about.
You initially talked to you about about 

1601
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:36,284
him too.
Like twice and then I got an email from 

1602
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:41,420
your guy like serendipitous asleep,
but a content and different things.

1603
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,373
Pattern recognition to.
I'm just trying to figure out all this 

1604
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,730
stuff almost because I was five,
10 years ago.

1605
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:49,040
I wanted to be Zuckerberg,
instagram,

1606
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,350
all of that stuff and I know now it's 
not there.

1607
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,570
I'm doing a different job and you know 
what's interesting about that?

1608
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,673
The thing that has really come to the 
top and my content that's really also 

1609
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:00,170
helping people.
Self awareness.

1610
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,240
One thing I'm enjoying listening to you,
I'm like,

1611
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,660
I'm like,
this guy really like you can just like a

1612
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,830
martial art.
It's been really interesting.

1613
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,120
I'm sitting here kind of thinking.
I'm like,

1614
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:08,983
wow,
there's some real self awareness going 

1615
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:10,964
on here and even just thinking about you
now saying that I wish I could figure 

1616
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,233
out,
forget about drug to make your Dick 

1617
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,113
Bigger.
If I could give somebody a pill that 

1618
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:20,750
would allow them to deploy self 
awareness,

1619
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,763
the amount of happiness that would be 
going on in this world would be 

1620
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,120
tremendous.
I I understand that.

1621
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:26,954
I can give them a solution struggle and 
overcoming obstacles and very difficult 

1622
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:32,414
problems to solve problem solving,
whether it's through martial arts or 

1623
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:39,410
even through complicated things that 
don't seem complicated like yoga,

1624
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:43,070
very difficult tasks teach you about 
yourself.

1625
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,680
Those things teach you about personal 
awareness.

1626
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:50,710
Let's let's take a step back amount of 
people that when they do that and fail,

1627
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,543
right,
decide to spend all their fucking time 

1628
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:58,550
on pondering and blaming is unbelievably
high.

1629
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,470
Well,
that's just a problem with the way their

1630
01:11:00,471 --> 01:11:03,770
mind is structured.
Let's just consciousness structuring.

1631
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,633
Hence why I'm interested in that self 
awareness pill and slash or populating 

1632
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:12,860
this conversation to the top because 
when you start caring about what you are

1633
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,840
versus what you're not good shit 
happens.

1634
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,400
Right?
Well,

1635
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:18,510
yeah,
exactly.

1636
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:19,344
Or you know,
I assume when I think about Larry 

1637
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,493
Holmes,
like I had a conversation once about 

1638
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,830
like how the Jab that he was deceased in
assassin.

1639
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,603
Man,
it's really interesting when you start 

1640
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:31,524
tripling down in your strengths,
obviously you have to round yourself 

1641
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:34,470
out.
You don't want to get exposed,

1642
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,513
especially in mma.
Obviously it's so multidimensional that 

1643
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:38,390
way,
um,

1644
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,600
that it becomes a vulnerability.

1645
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,463
But fuck man,
I'm big on tripling down on people's 

1646
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:43,640
strengths.
Yeah,

1647
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,221
it's huge.
Well,

1648
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,054
the,
one of the interesting things about mma 

1649
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:46,734
is people that you call specialists,
like there's a few people that are 

1650
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:54,120
really good at one aspect of MMA and 
they dominate people because of that.

1651
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,283
Like Anderson Silva is the greatest 
martial artist of all time was just a 

1652
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,160
sensational striker.
And when you,

1653
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,700
every fight starts off standing.
You had to deal with his striking before

1654
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:07,380
you could get to him before you could 
take him down,

1655
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:08,940
before he could try to submit him 
through that.

1656
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,970
He had to get through that and that was 
a.

1657
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,873
he's a specialist.
Damien Maia is a specialist in a 

1658
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:15,660
completely different ways.
One of the top welterweight contenders,

1659
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,530
probably number one now next to a 
wonderboy was going to be fighting for a

1660
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:20,400
rematch,
the title,

1661
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,430
but Damien Maia is a pure Jujitsu 
specialists.

1662
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,563
His striking is only to get close enough
to you to grab you dragged to the 

1663
01:12:27,361 --> 01:12:28,230
ground,
strangle you,

1664
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,650
and in that way he's a lot of a lot of 
what he is as a throwback,

1665
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,753
but his jujitsu skill is so elite that 
everyone else who goes to the ground 

1666
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,394
with him.
Even guys like Carlos Condit who was a 

1667
01:12:39,661 --> 01:12:42,570
former world champion to really high 
level guy,

1668
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:43,404
just get smushed like a bug and 
strangled because he's such a 

1669
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,270
specialist.
I get it.

1670
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,700
Yeah,
it's martial arts is very interesting in

1671
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,560
that way because that works with some 
people,

1672
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,930
but it doesn't work with other people 
and other people have beaten.

1673
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:55,764
Damien Maia,
because of the fact that in many ways 

1674
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,880
one dimensional,
but that one dimension is a motherfucker

1675
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,040
of a dementia.
I'm.

1676
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,003
I'm a big boxing fan.
I grew up a big Aaron Pryor family to a 

1677
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,040
big pernell whitaker fan.

1678
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,600
Like what was in that bottle?
Man?

1679
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,730
Louis,
what the fuck did he slip them?

1680
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,830
What did he slip them?
I'm dying to know.

1681
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,040
I would like to know Panama Lewis is 
still alive.

1682
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:16,874
I'm able to.
I'm able to quantify that because I 

1683
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,940
think about a lot of the boxers who had 
their one or two things.

1684
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:22,440
Then it was just fascinating.
Sure.

1685
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,000
Like had to figure it out.
Sure.

1686
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,750
Jones Rojo.
You know,

1687
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,603
it's funny you're talking about Condo,
like when Roy Jones found his moment to 

1688
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,900
go up to heavyweight.
Interesting.

1689
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:31,321
Okay.
Well,

1690
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:33,480
here's a perfect example.
We were talking about steroids.

1691
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:34,314
Yes.
When Roy Jones went up to fight John 

1692
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:36,511
Ruiz,
I don't know.

1693
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,980
Roy Dot well.
I've met him.

1694
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,570
He's a great guy.
I'm a huge fan.

1695
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,850
He's probably one of my favorite boxers,
if not my favorite of all.

1696
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:42,684
Time was great,
but I'm pretty sure he did some Mexican 

1697
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:46,800
supplements to fight John Ruiz to get up
to that way.

1698
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,500
He was 200 pounds.
He was jacked.

1699
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:50,334
He was shredded.
It's not necessarily that natural for 

1700
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:57,200
you to put on that kind of weight in 
that short period of one slash 68 to one

1701
01:13:57,201 --> 01:13:59,250
slash 75 to 200.
That's a big.

1702
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,180
That's a lot of CIG jumping and looked 
amazing and you know,

1703
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:04,890
kept a speed.
Then here's the thing,

1704
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,570
dropped back down to one 75 again to 
fight tarver and looked like shit.

1705
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,413
Yeah.
Had a really hard time making the way 

1706
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:15,160
and I think also you look at his body 
who was smooth,

1707
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:16,203
his muscle tone was different.
It didn't look the same and I think a 

1708
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:22,390
lot of that is endocrine system 
potentially suffering from the steroids,

1709
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,030
like taking steroids and then the crash,
I don't know,

1710
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:28,510
this is pure speculation,
but all my years of seeing people do the

1711
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,344
same thing,
seeing people take steroids or take 

1712
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,313
anything that any anabolic enhancements 
and then dropping down and getting off 

1713
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:36,400
of them.

1714
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,121
Again,
you just,

1715
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:39,870
you've seen flat pattern recognition.
Well,

1716
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,830
I know a lot of pattern recognition 
about fighting.

1717
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:42,664
I,
that's one of the things about fighting 

1718
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,830
is pattern chunking.
You know,

1719
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,830
you see things that you've seen before,
you know,

1720
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:48,664
and you,
you see it coming before maybe even the 

1721
01:14:50,171 --> 01:14:51,004
other guy sees it coming and that's what
I do with consumer behavior and that's 

1722
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:55,180
how I bet on business.
That makes sense.

1723
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:58,240
I was an early investor in facebook and 
Tumblr and twitter.

1724
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,810
It was because I just knew that that 
looked to me like email.

1725
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:05,740
That looked to me like I saw that I 
invested in twitter because I thought it

1726
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:08,110
was the next email.
What do you think of snapchat?

1727
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,900
So I invest at a first full,
full disclosure.

1728
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,930
I wrote a $5,000,000
check into snapchat,

1729
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,340
snapchat,
snapchat.

1730
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,620
That you're responsible for those puppy 
dog filters.

1731
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,760
That shit's got to stop.

1732
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:20,650
But ladies,
listen to me.

1733
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:23,860
Stop taking pictures with the puppy dog 
nose stop.

1734
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,190
I like it.
I think more the don't.

1735
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,950
Don't listen to me.
I'm just fucking around.

1736
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,353
Do whatever you want to do.
The flowers on the head though aren't 

1737
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:32,360
making it look any better yet is it 
gives you a coachella.

1738
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,753
It's fake.
They're fake flowers or think you're 

1739
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:35,644
crazy person.
They do that or should they put the 

1740
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,560
check?
No,

1741
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:39,723
they should definitely take flowers to 
figure out the next move because 

1742
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:43,294
instagram's features have in the short 
term affected it and where snapchat was 

1743
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:48,754
on the verge of becoming a monster was 
we started seeing 40 and 50 year olds 

1744
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:56,020
download it.
The features came to instagram.

1745
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:57,603
It gave those 45 year olds a reason not 
to download another APP and that's why 

1746
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,680
snapchat's lost a little momentum.
It's not that a 20 year old.

1747
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:06,933
Yes.
Some are using stories more than 

1748
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,750
instagram now.
It wasn't like a mass exodus of that.

1749
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,670
It was the growth that they were 
feeling.

1750
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,504
Forty and 50 year olds that were just 
starting just like facebook back in 

1751
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:16,931
2000,
10,

1752
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:20,110
11.
They just started getting your aunt that

1753
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:20,944
wanted to act like she was in it 
starting to download and then the 

1754
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,600
network effect because her aunt has a 
friend and that's what happens.

1755
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:30,220
It stopped that and that is the concern 
that snapchat has,

1756
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:31,054
which is in wants to be at full scale 
because that's how you justify a 

1757
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:36,520
$20,000,000,000
valuation,

1758
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:40,300
which is what it wants to go IPO at.
I think snapchat's big things.

1759
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:44,200
The filters like the Zombie filter in 
the rainbow throw up all that stuff.

1760
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:47,410
Like that's what makes it cool and the 
fact that I could take your face and put

1761
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:49,690
her on my face,
like that's kind of dope.

1762
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:53,410
I mean a lot of people do that and it's 
really pretty amazing.

1763
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:56,650
If your face is similar,
like similar sized,

1764
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:58,840
what you can pull off.
It's amazing.

1765
01:16:59,050 --> 01:16:59,741
I agree.
I mean,

1766
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,420
listen,
they've done a lot of smart stuff,

1767
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,870
especially with ar and all that kind of 
stuff.

1768
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,980
It's gonna be very fascinating.
If the glasses take off at full

1769
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,640
scale or what else are they up to?
They call themselves snap now.

1770
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,520
I've never seen a snapchat anymore as a 
company.

1771
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,410
Their snapchat,
but as a holding company,

1772
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,480
corporate bullshit.
Nobody cares about.

1773
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,140
The reason I care is when they came out 
with the glasses speckles I,

1774
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,310
I've never seen a social network act 
like a fashion brand.

1775
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,590
There's something different about 
snapchat that way.

1776
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:34,130
How's it act like a fashion brand?
Because the glass is like if you said if

1777
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:37,520
I woke up tomorrow and found out that 
snapchat was coming out with sneakers,

1778
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,680
I'd be like [inaudible],
where's.

1779
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:42,800
That would make no sense for twitter or 
instagram or facebook.

1780
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,723
Huh?
So that's where I'm curious if they're 

1781
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:48,860
opening up that avenue.
Snap is very la out.

1782
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,100
It is not hardcore silicon valley 
product.

1783
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:55,010
It's got a little that La Flavor.
Evan's got that.

1784
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:59,090
What's the difference?
The difference is Silicon Valley is very

1785
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,080
tech nerded out.

1786
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,913
It's a little different now because 
everybody's gone there to make their 

1787
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:03,854
millions,
but it is still very grounded in 

1788
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,254
technology.
Engineers are the rock stars and it's a 

1789
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:13,310
San Francisco vibe.
Snapchat is an La company and it started

1790
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:14,144
by a very young entrepreneur who is way 
cooler than the majority of 

1791
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:20,900
entrepreneurs that we've seen before.
Build these products just in life.

1792
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,790
He was a cooler kid and the vibe of the 
product that the exclusiveness of it,

1793
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,950
the awkwardness abusing it and they like
that.

1794
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:29,300
It's like,
if you don't understand us,

1795
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,253
fuck you.
It had that vibe and so I'm curious to 

1796
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:35,270
see how that plays out.
Yeah.

1797
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:37,910
I don't use it.
I have it on my phone.

1798
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,760
I use instagram and twitter and facebook
and facebook.

1799
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:41,594
Honestly,
I kind of use facebook only because 

1800
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:45,120
instagram links up to it.
I don't,

1801
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,580
but it's interesting like distribution.
Yeah.

1802
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,473
Yeah.
I'd use it and I don't interact with 

1803
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:52,550
people that much on facebook and people 
get mad,

1804
01:18:52,551 --> 01:18:55,930
but this don't have that much time.
That is native to interact there.

1805
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:58,070
Right.
It's a lot easier to interact in an on a

1806
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:59,920
twitter.
Twitter's easiest.

1807
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:00,763
Fuck.
Instagram's a little weirder because 

1808
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:05,150
like when you get a comment,
if you reply to that comment,

1809
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,340
then you have to go find the original 
comment.

1810
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,980
It's not a native.
It's clunkier.

1811
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,940
Twitter is the watercooler of our 
society.

1812
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:12,503
It's got a lot of shortcomings for 
content and how much people are paying 

1813
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:16,154
attention to the newsfeed,
but definitely from a conversation 

1814
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:20,600
standpoint there's nothing close.
So for example,

1815
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,793
when this airs,
like that's where I'll go and engage 

1816
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:25,850
with people because a lot of people have
never heard of me before that,

1817
01:19:25,851 --> 01:19:26,684
listen to this and I'll respond to those
feedbacks much more data than anyone 

1818
01:19:29,921 --> 01:19:30,380
else.

1819
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,280
Yeah,
I will too.

1820
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:32,114
And that's where I have the most 
followers too and I will interact with 

1821
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:36,590
people more,
but I also feel like I said,

1822
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:37,424
I just think that Jamie was just telling
me the other day that a instagram makes 

1823
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:42,440
it so you can like people's comments 
now.

1824
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,820
Yes.
That's a new little feature.

1825
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:44,663
They've,
they've been,

1826
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:45,551
as you know,
Jim,

1827
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:47,420
it sounds like you're really getting 
deeper and deeper in this game.

1828
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:51,530
Like they've been innovating very fast.
Tons,

1829
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,363
tons.
Snapchat today put out a way for you to 

1830
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,340
link out to websites.
So there's just movement.

1831
01:19:55,341 --> 01:19:56,174
There's always moving.
Facebook is definitely gonna launch 

1832
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:00,560
stories in facebook.
Yeah,

1833
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:02,240
because yeah,
they just launched it in Ireland,

1834
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,840
so I've already seen the preview of it.
It's out like it,

1835
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,703
so that's coming,
so that will be interesting to see what 

1836
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:10,500
that does.
So plenty more to come.

1837
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,363
I think facebook should become a 
television company like I think they 

1838
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:13,824
should actually come out with a 
television and then I think when you're 

1839
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:17,490
in an actual towe have an actual 
physical television.

1840
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,050
This is just what I think they should 
do.

1841
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,600
And when you're in your feed you see 
something,

1842
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,240
you just flick it and it goes on your 
television,

1843
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:26,370
you watch it.
So like apple TV does.

1844
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,250
Hmm.
Don't do that.

1845
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,750
Facebook,
facebook,

1846
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,643
listen to me.
If you want to talk about fighting 

1847
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,430
somebody.
Facebook,

1848
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:40,431
if you want to fight for job,
no one's going to buy your fucking TV.

1849
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:42,623
You're got to make a lot of TVS.
They're going to be sitting in a 

1850
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:45,730
warehouse somewhere.
Can we?

1851
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,370
The mistake I made that mistake,
the TV I'm going to say,

1852
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,760
and in this keynote,
look at this great clip from 2017 when I

1853
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,590
fully predicted the facebook TV.

1854
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,613
I just.
Why would they get involved in selling 

1855
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:58,944
tvs?
What would it be different than their 

1856
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,230
TV?
And you own the hardware,

1857
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,183
you own the action.
Why would anybody buy that when you 

1858
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:05,454
could do like a little google chrome 
thing that sticks right into a Usb port 

1859
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:09,414
and just shoot it right from your 
android phone and TV and make the best 

1860
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:13,524
product.
Everybody has permission to play in 

1861
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:17,070
anybody space.
So if you make the best tv,

1862
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,503
Sony had no permission to go in the 
video game space until they made the 

1863
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,430
fucking playstation.
Everybody's like,

1864
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,220
what the fuck?
Right?

1865
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,250
Like Netflix wasn't supposed to produce 
the best original content,

1866
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,320
but that's a difference,
right?

1867
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,183
Like there's a platform,
if you're selling a console that makes 

1868
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:34,464
video games,
then you have to hire a bunch of people 

1869
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:36,954
to make games for that.
Or you're the razor and the razor blade 

1870
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:40,680
thing,
right?

1871
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,110
Like facebook and just first of all,
razor and razor blade.

1872
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,490
Would it be.
And you just become the platform.

1873
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:47,250
Other people can make it like Sony,
Sony to make those games.

1874
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,660
Right.
But they hired people to.

1875
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,840
They made some of their own game and 
mainly bought from other professors,

1876
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:52,674
but more importantly they created a 
platform that people built for that 

1877
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,553
facebook has facebook can go out and buy
the number for TB manufacturer steel to 

1878
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:02,190
people from Samsung and they're in the 
fucking game.

1879
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,053
Right.
But everybody already has a TV like 

1880
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:07,240
getting them to buy a facebook tv one 
more time and you know this Joe,

1881
01:22:07,241 --> 01:22:09,630
like we used to have Sony Tvs.
Now we have Samsung.

1882
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:10,464
People like Jamie,
you with me on this now he's with me 

1883
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,320
with both of you.
I mean,

1884
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:16,660
I see what you're both saying.
Both of you.

1885
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,850
You know,
I'm leaving Jamie,

1886
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,520
Jamie,
Jamie.

1887
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,353
This is historic.
He also knows that I'm not connected 

1888
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,813
directly.
Correct.

1889
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,110
Yeah,
that's a great point because I.

1890
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,890
I mean you brought up that snapchat 
sneaker thing a few weeks ago.

1891
01:22:28,891 --> 01:22:29,724
At least.
That's what I saw with a few weeks ago 

1892
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,970
and I think that's a great point.
It's not gonna work for everyone.

1893
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:34,520
Good idea if you want to go broke,
but it's a,

1894
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:39,590
it's a brand thing like put all your 
money and you know what's interesting is

1895
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,080
actually where I was about to go.
You just walked into it.

1896
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,890
I'm fascinated by the following,
the fact that you even said easy's three

1897
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:48,150
years ago,
right?

1898
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,133
Everybody,
you would have never said anything to 

1899
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:51,743
understand us.
The reason why I say because he buys 

1900
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,710
easiest and mock him on a daily basis,
but what are the shittiest fucking goofy

1901
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:01,440
look at sneakers I've ever seen in my 
life and and they sell it crazy.

1902
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,010
God,
there's a lot of retards out there.

1903
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,830
Hey Joe,
how about this?

1904
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,223
What I'm of the age then when,
when you have ceased started when mixed 

1905
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:11,530
martial arts started hitting the scene,
right?

1906
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:12,700
Royce Gracie,
like way back.

1907
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,590
It feels like.
So I apologize.

1908
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,680
So you know,
what did everybody say about that?

1909
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,960
No chance.
Fucking stupid.

1910
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,130
Well,
that's different.

1911
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,150
No,
it's not sure.

1912
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:22,984
It is at the.
Everybody understood that fighting at 

1913
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:28,000
the fashion is primal.
It's the way we express.

1914
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:31,510
These are definitely not private.
Brother yeezys are primal.

1915
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,460
That's stupid.
Stripe and color.

1916
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:36,460
Stripe on the side of Christ makes them 
harder to duplicate.

1917
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,320
They look like shit wrong.
Trust me.

1918
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,510
Five years from now,
you're gonna making fun of those things.

1919
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,260
Hang in there buddy.
On my feet right now.

1920
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:50,470
Those are pretty dope.
Been retroed like four or five times and

1921
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,770
that's where those sell for $700 and 
they're like $160.

1922
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:55,900
Shoes and those look better.
Those are Jordan's.

1923
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:56,853
They look cool.
I've never wore a pair of Jordans my 

1924
01:23:58,001 --> 01:23:58,750
life.
Really?

1925
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,360
Michael Jordan with my entire heart.
Whoa.

1926
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,370
Whoa.
I'm a 41 year old knicks fan.

1927
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,790
Just a one year old knicks fan out there
right now.

1928
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,540
Fuck you.
If you bought Jordan's,

1929
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,260
can't believe what you're saying.
Yep.

1930
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,380
Stop the next championships.
That's right.

1931
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,223
So,
so you're just a loyal because he's a 

1932
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,810
really good basketball player.
You're loyal to the team that he crushed

1933
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,673
you.
Loyal to his characteristics that you 

1934
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:29,560
admire and you do on your own daughter.
Yes.

1935
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,023
I respect.
I,

1936
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:31,893
I fully respect that.
I respect and understand he's the 

1937
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:36,280
greatest basketball player of all time.

1938
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,600
Right?
Is he still,

1939
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,510
is that still a jam?
That is probably right.

1940
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:41,681
I mean,
listen,

1941
01:24:41,681 --> 01:24:42,514
you want to get into the Wilton,
there's some different ways to the bait 

1942
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:45,730
that.
Here's what I will say.

1943
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,850
You can say I hate when people argue 
with me on this.

1944
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:54,040
You can separate respecting somebody's 
skillset and thinking they're a piece of

1945
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:54,874
fucking shit,
but you only thing he's a piece of shit 

1946
01:24:56,261 --> 01:24:57,670
because he beat your team.
Yes,

1947
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,400
that's it.
Isn't that more than a fuck enough?

1948
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,893
I guess.
See Tom Brady choke would be 

1949
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:06,670
phenomenally happy with that.
If he died.

1950
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:09,390
Listen,
I don't want to go there because I could

1951
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,820
never put it again right after Sunday.
I'd be real happy.

1952
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:15,520
Real fucking happy.
You just don't like that.

1953
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:17,230
He's really good and he wins.
Correct.

1954
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:18,620
That's so weird.
Expensive.

1955
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,860
My team see that,
but that whole my team,

1956
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:21,080
I.

1957
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,410
I understand if you own that team,
but you don't own it yet.

1958
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,310
No,
it's my escape,

1959
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,260
Joe.
It's the one place I get to escape.

1960
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:27,094
It's my three hours fucking 16 times a 
year where I can recalibrate my whole 

1961
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,450
fucking insane life.
Well,

1962
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:32,284
I'm coming in from a perspective of 
weird perspective as a person who is a 

1963
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:36,034
sports fan because my sports that I only
watch her martial arts and as a fan of 

1964
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:43,180
them,
I'm a fan of performance more than I'm a

1965
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:45,800
fan of a person,
so I'm not a fan.

1966
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:49,120
Like when I watch people fight,
I'm a fan of whoever wins the fight.

1967
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,970
I'm a fan of how they win it.
I'm a fan of what goes down.

1968
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,050
Not a bandwagon.
I'm kidding.

1969
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:53,650
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1970
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,720
I'm a fan of technique.
You love the craft.

1971
01:25:55,750 --> 01:26:00,040
I love the craft and I also love.
I love moments.

1972
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:04,040
I love someone dominating a moment.
That is exactly right.

1973
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,190
And I love when I don't have a horse in 
the race,

1974
01:26:07,191 --> 01:26:08,024
so you always have a horse race when it 
comes to the ball and football and I 

1975
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:11,534
used to in hockey and baseball,
but my teams won championships and then 

1976
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,294
I get out.
All right,

1977
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,610
so you can if so,
no baseball.

1978
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,820
So if you could appreciate someone who's
a bad motherfucker,

1979
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,380
breaks the home run record.
That stuff I get excited about.

1980
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:22,850
That's why I love that.
That's what I liked.

1981
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:26,060
I liked boxing so much for that.
I tend not to have a horse in the race.

1982
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,520
I usually root for the underdog.
That's a good move.

1983
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,880
Yeah.
It feels better when they win.

1984
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,220
That's usually my default.
Yeah.

1985
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,073
When you.
When someone is the favorite and they 

1986
01:26:34,701 --> 01:26:35,750
beat the shit out of,
so I'm going to go.

1987
01:26:35,751 --> 01:26:36,584
Well,
I saw that coming when Tyson was in his 

1988
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:39,704
prime.
Those were weird fights because they 

1989
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:46,040
were an execution fibrous cells and 
those were real event.

1990
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,560
Bruce Allen was post was posted by the 
way.

1991
01:26:48,561 --> 01:26:50,810
Bruce Selden had,
uh,

1992
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:51,800
uh,
uh,

1993
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,330
no,
that's smoke smoking.

1994
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:54,164
Burke Cooper,
who I think of when I think about bruce 

1995
01:26:56,261 --> 01:26:57,980
selling because they had a similar body 
shape,

1996
01:26:57,981 --> 01:26:59,720
jacked smoking.
Burke Cooper,

1997
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,840
knockdown holyfield in Atlanta.
Yeah.

1998
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,670
And I thought he had that excited.
That's great.

1999
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:06,380
Fine.
Holyfield.

2000
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,760
Yeah.
I mean there's a lot of great boxers,

2001
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,430
but Tyson had something going on where 
pop culture.

2002
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,210
Yeah,
it was an executioner.

2003
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,643
Yeah.
It's popcorn when they transcend into 

2004
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:20,643
popcorn.
The problem with that a lot of times is 

2005
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,920
I feel bad for those,
Rhonda.

2006
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,130
Right.
Like the drop off is so extreme when you

2007
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:30,890
get to become a cultural icon.
Yeah,

2008
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:31,724
but she's a real weird case because 
she's essentially done so you gotta 

2009
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:42,220
wonder like her mindset when she was 
winning was this mindset of a destroyer.

2010
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:47,060
She would go in there and smash these 
girls and she was all in,

2011
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,373
but then she got wooed by Hollywood and 
all the distractions and movies and TV 

2012
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:53,054
shows and all that nonsense and then 
bought into a bad strategy against one 

2013
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:00,494
of the best strikers in the sport and 
fought the absolute worst way she could 

2014
01:28:04,201 --> 01:28:05,034
have fought against that elite striker 
and got fucked up and once she got 

2015
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:11,420
fucked up,
man the wheels came off.

2016
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,673
She takes a whole year off and then 
comes back again and just gets 

2017
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:20,960
annihilated and now dilated and now 
she's essentially done.

2018
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:24,540
Here's my biggest crazy mma in the 
modern world [inaudible],

2019
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:29,590
you lose the entire fight in within the 
time of an instagram post.

2020
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,080
You're in deep shit.
You are,

2021
01:28:32,081 --> 01:28:33,110
but you're not.
See,

2022
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:33,944
because she beat cats in Ghana in 14 
seconds and cat Zingano is still in the 

2023
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:39,590
mix and mma,
math is all fucked up,

2024
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:42,200
but it doesn't really work this way,
but this is a fact.

2025
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,200
Cat Zingano stopped.
Amanda Nunez,

2026
01:28:45,201 --> 01:28:46,034
she beat her in the third round,
but Ronda Rousey after that fight arm 

2027
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:53,530
barred cat Zingano in 14 seconds,
so I get those banana.

2028
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,370
What's really cool about Emma,
I have said this,

2029
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,233
you may have caught the shame.
It's the closest thing to 

2030
01:28:57,681 --> 01:29:01,360
entrepreneurship because everybody loses
an entrepreneurship boxing's.

2031
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,110
Funny.
That loss really dangles.

2032
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,390
It's devastating that loss.

2033
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,030
I've been more fascinated from afar and 
I'm not as deep into sport,

2034
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:12,900
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but there is an absolute different level

2035
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,470
because the way the sport is structured,
there's an acceptance by the fan base of

2036
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:21,900
the loss in this sport that I think is 
very different than boxing.

2037
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:23,970
It's like it's a scarlet letter of 
boxing.

2038
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,550
When you're coming up,
you need to keep it clean,

2039
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,230
right?
You want to be undefeated and want to be

2040
01:29:28,231 --> 01:29:29,064
an undefeated contender.
It has a is a big factor and an MMA 

2041
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,903
almost.
No one is undefeated except number man 

2042
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:34,953
off.
He's one of the very few guys that's a 

2043
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:36,714
top contender right now.
That's undefeated and he's just a 

2044
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,340
destroyer,
but you know he's rare.

2045
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,480
He's.
He's very rare.

2046
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:43,314
Most people at the top have lost a 
couple of times what connor showed when 

2047
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:49,260
he lost,
he showed the ability to regroup,

2048
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:51,240
take it on the chin like a fucking man.

2049
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,030
Make no excuses whatsoever and jump 
right back in and when,

2050
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,640
and that's super,
super rare.

2051
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:02,040
He's a phenomenal individual in his 
ability to visualize things.

2052
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,053
His belief in himself is just 
unflappable and his incredible 

2053
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,730
confidence and ability to operate under 
pressure.

2054
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,790
That's the big thing,
is being dwarfed by the moment,

2055
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:18,000
by the moment happened so many times,
so much.

2056
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:21,180
People let allow those negative thoughts
to creep into their mind.

2057
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,660
All those eyeballs.
It's all fucking eyeballs,

2058
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:26,760
baby.
A lot of eyeballs and a lot of doubt.

2059
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,623
What was the.
What was the biggest audience you 

2060
01:30:28,961 --> 01:30:29,794
performed?
What was the first time you took a 

2061
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:32,700
quantum jump?
Like what was the number?

2062
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:35,160
Did he go from like consistently doing 
like clubs?

2063
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,170
Then what was the first time like?
What was that?

2064
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,180
Because I had a very weird thing 
happened to me with speaking.

2065
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,433
It was always like 500,
349 and then I got this weird Gig for 

2066
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:48,780
remax natural national convention at the
Mgm Grand,

2067
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,690
like 15,000
Jesus Christ.

2068
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,500
And I was like,
it was such a like.

2069
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,560
I mean,
I would do it everyday if I could.

2070
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:56,970
It seems really bizarre,
right?

2071
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:57,823
Like that's a yes,
but I focused on the people that were 

2072
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,510
closest to me.
Okay.

2073
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:04,770
It worked for me.
Yeah.

2074
01:31:04,771 --> 01:31:06,210
That's a good move.
That's the way to do it.

2075
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:09,240
And while taking into account all the 
people that aren't right there.

2076
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,800
Yeah.
What about for you?

2077
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,900
What was the uh,
well,

2078
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:15,930
I mostly started out with clubs for a 
long time,

2079
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,973
mostly did clubs.
And then as I started getting more and 

2080
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:20,844
more popular,
I moved into larger places and the 

2081
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:26,880
biggest place that I've ever sold out 
was in Denver,

2082
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,000
which was like 5,700
people.

2083
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,640
So that's a different experience,
man.

2084
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:34,650
It's just weird.
It's weird.

2085
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:39,680
Someone's addicted to their phones.
Do you have another meeting tonight?

2086
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:42,270
What are you doing tonight?
Doing a Biz Dev meeting.

2087
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:46,410
Really Your Business Development meeting
tonight at after 10:00

2088
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,760
PM.
That's hilarious.

2089
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:49,530
I,
I normally.

2090
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,690
And you live in New York.
So this is 1:00

2091
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:53,610
AM for you.
And I left at 4:00

2092
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:55,060
AM this morning cause that's Chicago 
meeting soon.

2093
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:56,070
And speed.
What are you doing?

2094
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,890
My brother still has a weird.
No,

2095
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:01,090
I'm like seriously?
What was super cool?

2096
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:01,924
I have,
I've never even tried smoking a 

2097
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:04,930
cigarette.
Whoa.

2098
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,400
Yeah.
Well that's good.

2099
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,250
Smoking cigarettes pot.
No.

2100
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:09,970
Nothing.
No,

2101
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,220
no,
no much district rent of every one of my

2102
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:13,054
friends.
And maybe make you a little bit more 

2103
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:16,260
creative.
Uh,

2104
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:17,493
I just think I have natural something 
because my brother literally thinks I'm 

2105
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:21,004
a robot.
Like literally as asked weird questions 

2106
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,040
and passionate.
If you're passionate,

2107
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,110
you're engaged.
If you're engaged,

2108
01:32:26,111 --> 01:32:26,944
you're excited.
You know what I am energy grateful as 

2109
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:29,950
fuck.
Well that's good.

2110
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:33,940
Like if you really asked me what the 
slight variation of that is,

2111
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,020
I think it's gratitude.

2112
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,770
Gratitude is huge.
I think gratitude is a real drug,

2113
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,960
but I think it is too,
so I'm just grateful,

2114
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:44,350
but certainly fuel its energy and its 
uh,

2115
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:47,680
its warmth and feeling also that's very 
attractive.

2116
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,753
Like other people recognize true 
gratitude and they get excited by it 

2117
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:51,670
too.
Yeah.

2118
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,860
And perspective.
I think perspectives that other one.

2119
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:54,880
Oh,
I agree.

2120
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,200
Yeah.
Perspective is good,

2121
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,403
you know,
being honest and humble and recognizing 

2122
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,090
that yeah,
you work hard.

2123
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:01,960
Yeah.
You bust your ass.

2124
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:02,794
But yeah,
you're also like super lucky just to be 

2125
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:07,390
living in America for super lucky to be 
held into one.

2126
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,243
Yeah.
Your Dad might've decided to jerk off 

2127
01:33:12,281 --> 01:33:14,280
one more time the day before.
Right.

2128
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:15,790
And we wouldn't be here.
Damn.

2129
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:19,690
400 Janie.
Your mom might've wanted to take a quick

2130
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,650
glass of wine,
like 400 trillion to one.

2131
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,260
The odds of being a human being.
No,

2132
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:27,094
seriously.

2133
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:29,620
This is a little weird thing,
but like we're going down this path,

2134
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:32,020
like I'm fascinated by that.
Yeah.

2135
01:33:32,021 --> 01:33:32,854
No,
it's real.

2136
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,510
It's a real statistic.
If you think about,

2137
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:37,170
come really start dividing and 
conquering.

2138
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:39,120
Understand that you can end up on your 
dad's.

2139
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,980
Come instead or Napkin instead of 
becoming a human trait.

2140
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:44,040
It's humbling.
Yeah,

2141
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,750
it is a lot of ways.
Yeah.

2142
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:48,340
But once that happens,
once you become a human,

2143
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,333
once you become a human,
then even then the odds of being 

2144
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,050
fortunate to have good health,
fortunate to not have been,

2145
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,750
have the fuck beat out of your body,
your parents,

2146
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,943
or being in foster care with abusive 
people or a million different factors 

2147
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:03,894
going down.
You're going down the path that I think 

2148
01:34:05,411 --> 01:34:09,970
about on a daily basis.
I also had the misfortune of three of my

2149
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:10,804
four grandparents dying before I knew 
them because everybody died in Russia 

2150
01:34:13,281 --> 01:34:16,030
and in their fifties because everybody's
fucking miserable from communism.

2151
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,800
And then,
uh,

2152
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:20,170
so I haven't had a whole lot of death in
my family.

2153
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,550
Like I had A.
I mean,

2154
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,470
it's real good.
So I'm grateful.

2155
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:26,440
Gratitude is giant man.
It's really good.

2156
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:28,630
And you know what?
And you can extend that gratitude.

2157
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,280
Like there's a lot of people that woe is
me,

2158
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:32,800
but God damn it.
You just need to look at,

2159
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,083
look at it in a balanced perspective.
There are people in parts of the world 

2160
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:41,521
that would fucking literally kill to be 
in any position that anyone listening to

2161
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:45,490
this who is woe is me right now.
You know the problem with what was me?

2162
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,550
Nobody's fucking listening.
My friends.

2163
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,413
Let me tell you who's listening to you 
complain either the two or three people 

2164
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:53,554
that kind of have to because they're 
your parents or your other fucking 

2165
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,040
losing

2166
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,380
friends.
Nobody gives a fuck.

2167
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:01,214
That's the problem when people don't 
understand about complaining isn't as 

2168
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,000
zero Roi and also excuses.
Excuses are terrible.

2169
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,193
They're the worst thing you could ever 
do is give yourself a reason why you're 

2170
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:14,270
not successful or not happy or not this 
or not.

2171
01:35:14,271 --> 01:35:16,400
That was easy for you to say,
Gary.

2172
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,100
Yeah,
because yeah,

2173
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,620
your dad,
your dad's wine store,

2174
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,560
Bro.
Fucking and here so happy.

2175
01:35:22,561 --> 01:35:27,470
He started fucking youtube channel.
Who will mud flaps to hit me with a belt

2176
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,230
if anybody's made it.
That looks like you.

2177
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,620
That's it.
That's it.

2178
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:35,060
So it must have happened.
There's a blueprint,

2179
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:36,590
so I get it,
man.

2180
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,810
Let's.
What is even making it right?

2181
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,883
Well,
that's your.

2182
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:41,420
Is Anybody happy?
That's it.

2183
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:42,283
Are you,
is anybody that's in similar 

2184
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:44,504
circumstances,
did they navigate their way better than 

2185
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:48,380
you learn from them?
Learn from them?

2186
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:51,500
I think for me the journey is the FEC 
and addiction,

2187
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,190
so he just loved the whole hustle of it 
all the game,

2188
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:55,790
you know?

2189
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:56,623
It's funny.
I was listening to you about like 

2190
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:00,050
fighting and the performance.
That's how I feel about business.

2191
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:03,260
Actually.
Buying the jets is going to be the worst

2192
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:06,290
day of my life because then you're gonna
need a new mountain to climb.

2193
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,440
Yeah.
Started started crunching.

2194
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,510
I don't want that shit.
You know what I want?

2195
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:13,700
I want to.
I want to build a honey empire.

2196
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:14,900
Honey.
Honey.

2197
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,580
Honey,
I want to be able to bs.

2198
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:17,503
I want to build one of the most 
successful business things ever and I 

2199
01:36:20,301 --> 01:36:21,134
want to do it in a way that I treated my
employees and my business partners in a 

2200
01:36:24,831 --> 01:36:26,180
honey manner.
Oh,

2201
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:27,530
okay.
Not actual honey.

2202
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,393
No.
Honey like honey and vinegar or honey 

2203
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:31,634
than vinegar.
Right?

2204
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,361
Correct.
Right.

2205
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:33,194
You get more.
I was super pissed when Steve jobs was 

2206
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:35,804
the icon in Silicon Valley and all my 
young friends started becoming dicks to 

2207
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:39,374
their employees because they thought 
they were getting more out of their 

2208
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:45,200
employees that way about him to 
narrative.

2209
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:46,303
I fucking hate that,
but I wish I knew what the actual truth 

2210
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:51,710
was.
I wish I got to see him communicate with

2211
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:54,980
his employees and see what it was that 
freaked them out.

2212
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:57,690
Like was he really a dick or did he work
with a bunch of ne'er?

2213
01:36:57,691 --> 01:37:01,450
Do Wells are lazy people were fools or 
you know what it is?

2214
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,040
Is it number one?
Why he wanted to be number one?

2215
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:06,680
For sure he was a dick.
He was definitely Dick.

2216
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,293
Listen,
truth is back to the way you talk about 

2217
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:10,430
steroid Houston,
hugh,

2218
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:11,730
and I don't know.
Right?

2219
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:15,160
I don't know her hard when a whole lot 
of human beings are saying it.

2220
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,370
Who worked for him?
Yeah,

2221
01:37:16,371 --> 01:37:21,050
I think he was absolutely completely 
obsessed and I think for a lot of people

2222
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:24,110
that really wasn't what they wanted.
They wanted a job,

2223
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,460
you know,
they want us to do good at their jobs,

2224
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,400
but I deploy empathy.

2225
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,293
I know that other people have other 
goals and wants and needs and that 

2226
01:37:32,271 --> 01:37:34,700
shouldn't come.
Mine mine,

2227
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,520
even though it's my company,
it shouldn't come at their expense.

2228
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:38,503
It's my job as a leader to figure out 
how to provide for them and figure out 

2229
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:44,540
what's left for me to do what I do.
That's leverage,

2230
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:45,643
right?
But what he wanted to do was create 

2231
01:37:46,911 --> 01:37:51,290
something unbelievably powerful and you 
had this supervision of it and he wanted

2232
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:52,124
everybody else to share that vision but 
not really necessarily share in the 

2233
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:57,540
rewards of it,
which is a big problem,

2234
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:58,050
right?
Less.

2235
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:58,801
Listen,
I am known.

2236
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:01,500
I don't know shit about him to critique 
it.

2237
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:03,540
Here's what I know.
I don't like turtlenecks ready for this.

2238
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,003
Ready for this bottom line is he 
impacted an entire generation of young 

2239
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:15,330
25 year old silicon valley ceos who 
weren't smart enough and decided just to

2240
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:18,570
be assholes across the board for like 
two years there and it really suck.

2241
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,060
So you would know that.
I don't know anything about that.

2242
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,900
So explain to me what that was like 
because I'm just your,

2243
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:26,130
your miters we'll be talking to someone 
from another country,

2244
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,880
that whole era of like web two point.
Oh that second wave,

2245
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:32,140
that 2004 that Kevin Rose,
right.

2246
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:35,410
You know,
who invented dig then you know,

2247
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:40,050
and xbox and Ed Williams and the 
investors Soka and all these characters.

2248
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:43,120
It was just a crazy thing.
You knew he were sitting in again,

2249
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,700
it was kind of like hip hop,
85.

2250
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,400
Like I would go to these meetings,
I would be in San Francisco,

2251
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:48,503
I would hang out with them and I just 
fucking knew I even have videos in 2009 

2252
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:52,920
like saying this ship and just knew I 
was like,

2253
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:53,754
these are going to be the fucking 
fucking characters that are going to be 

2254
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:56,154
the next icons of the world because 
they're building the products that 

2255
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:00,150
everybody's going to pay attention to.

2256
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,010
And there were just a lot of things 
going on.

2257
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:02,844
At first it was pure shit.
Like these kids really just wanted to 

2258
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:07,290
save the world,
right?

2259
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:08,124
Like let's make the world better with 
technology than they started having 

2260
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:10,794
assholes.
Like me come in who had commerce 

2261
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:13,950
ambition and I'm like,
yes,

2262
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:17,160
you save the world,
but let me own 10 percent of the company

2263
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:19,870
while you save the moral.
Right.

2264
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:21,063
And then you had the worst wave,
which was the people who blindly just 

2265
01:39:24,361 --> 01:39:25,194
thought because they were 22 and wore a 
hoodie that they were going to invent 

2266
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,820
the next facebook.
Yeah.

2267
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:31,050
There's a lot of posers,
right?

2268
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,760
You understand that there's a very big 
difference between being an entrepreneur

2269
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,020
and being a successful entrepreneur,
right?

2270
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,590
Yeah.
But the market right now,

2271
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:41,191
everyone's like,
oh,

2272
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:42,810
you're a CEO and entrepreneur.
Like,

2273
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,850
like as if you won.
That's like me saying,

2274
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:47,850
I'm a basketball player.
I play basketball,

2275
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,640
mom,
I'm not making any fucking money.

2276
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:51,990
Right?
And so yeah,

2277
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:54,420
we have a real issue in fake 
entrepreneurship right now.

2278
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,910
Everybody thinks,
you know,

2279
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,510
it's cool.
It became cool.

2280
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:59,173
It's crazy to me how cool 
entrepreneurship became when I was a 

2281
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:02,354
kid.
Being an entrepreneur meant you were a 

2282
01:40:03,171 --> 01:40:06,200
loser and had an idea.
You know,

2283
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:09,200
you're laughing because a lot of 
youngsters will listen.

2284
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:10,340
You don't know.
Back in our day,

2285
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:12,890
like entrepreneur was a word that you 
rarely heard.

2286
01:40:12,891 --> 01:40:15,020
I used to think I was a businessman.
That's what I said,

2287
01:40:15,021 --> 01:40:15,854
not an entrepreneur.
You must hear a lot of really shitty 

2288
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:18,524
ideas for living for a living because I 
get some email sometime and I'll get 

2289
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:27,410
like one paragraph and I'll get the fuck
outta here.

2290
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:29,960
What is this nonsense?
And I just deleted.

2291
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:33,260
But you must get that like all day long,
all day long.

2292
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,020
It's hard to separate,
right?

2293
01:40:36,021 --> 01:40:37,910
Like how do you find those little 
diamonds?

2294
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:39,470
Sometimes you do and sometimes you 
don't.

2295
01:40:39,471 --> 01:40:40,304
You have to take your ls.
I have an email that I always look at 

2296
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:42,973
from a good guy named Joe and he worked 
at a company called air bed and 

2297
01:40:46,551 --> 01:40:49,790
breakfast.
Joe At air bed and breakfast.

2298
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:52,190
Gary Vee were huge fans here at our 
company.

2299
01:40:52,191 --> 01:40:57,191
We'd love for you to never even replied.
Now airbnb is worth a lot of money.

2300
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,830
Fucking money.
Email for my boy.

2301
01:40:59,831 --> 01:41:01,630
Ben Layer,
founder of thrillist.

2302
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:02,770
Send me an email like,
hey,

2303
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:04,780
I really like these guys.
You should look at it.

2304
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:09,430
Didn't jump on it or be Parker big glass
company,

2305
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,540
you know,
like it happens.

2306
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,590
That's a weird one.
Right?

2307
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:14,800
Who saw that?
A glasses company was going to be giant,

2308
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,940
but other times you know Venmo.
Zappos knew it right away.

2309
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:19,391
Like,
you know,

2310
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:20,710
it happens.
I mean it goes both ways.

2311
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:22,330
I saw Amazon.com.
I was like,

2312
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,343
bitch,
how much money you gonna make selling 

2313
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,800
books?
Yeah.

2314
01:41:24,801 --> 01:41:26,470
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2315
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:28,023
I use it every day.
I'm from the generation where people 

2316
01:41:29,741 --> 01:41:30,574
made fun of my dad for because I didn't 
open a second wine store and I went on 

2317
01:41:35,081 --> 01:41:38,490
the Internet.
The Internet's youngsters.

2318
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,620
Listen real quick.
People debated the Internet itself.

2319
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:42,454
Forget about.
Is snapchat going to be here in five 

2320
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:45,760
years?
Back in 1994.

2321
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:46,391
Five,
six,

2322
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:47,050
seven,
eight.

2323
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,060
People like the Internet not going to be
here in five years.

2324
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:50,253
Go earlier than that.
When ibm first came out with their home 

2325
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:54,160
computer thing,
that's ridiculous.

2326
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:55,870
Of course,
that's a joke.

2327
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,530
Telephone is not a viable product.
One said.

2328
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,433
Yeah.
By the people that didn't want the 

2329
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:03,730
telephone to win,
nobody saw a lot of things coming.

2330
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,100
So what should we do,
Gary Vee?

2331
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,750
What's wrap this up?
What should we do?

2332
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,960
What should people do?
People should fucking stop complaining,

2333
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:11,943
right?
People should figure out how the fuck 

2334
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,624
they are.
Good people should not listen to 

2335
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:15,964
America.
Propaganda of fixing the shit they suck 

2336
01:42:18,401 --> 01:42:19,234
at.
They should be tripling down on what 

2337
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:20,914
they're good at.
They should be competent in certain 

2338
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:24,124
areas,
but you're not gonna become beyonce or 

2339
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,893
your bone structure is a certain way 
like you're not going to solve 

2340
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:34,150
everything.
Your Iq can get a little bit better,

2341
01:42:34,151 --> 01:42:34,984
but don't worry about the incremental.
Figure out what you fucking puts you on 

2342
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:38,734
fire and you're halfway decent at.
If you're lucky enough right now to be 

2343
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:42,124
listening and you're good at what you 
like become tunnel fucking vision 

2344
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,740
because there's way too many voices 
telling you what and how.

2345
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,660
And here's the other thing,
and this is the big one job,

2346
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,160
because you have a humongous audience.

2347
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,173
The biggest thing that I've seen 
dividends from have the conversation 

2348
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:02,440
with the person that's holding you back.
The reason most people who are listening

2349
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:03,274
right now are not doing that thing is 
they're worried about the opinion of 

2350
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:08,140
somebody,
usually their mother,

2351
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,633
usually their father,
and the reality is is that your spouse 

2352
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:16,780
may be the person holding you back and 
you have to have that conversation.

2353
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:17,643
Turn them off.
We have to get to a place where you're 

2354
01:43:19,601 --> 01:43:20,434
doing you because the number one thing 
that scares the fuck out of me is 

2355
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:24,880
regret,
and you're gonna.

2356
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:28,000
Sit there at 72 and I'm going to say,
I wish I wish,

2357
01:43:28,001 --> 01:43:28,834
I wish,
and whether that's money or spend more 

2358
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:32,200
time with your family.
There's a million ways to do this.

2359
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:36,340
Not everybody wants to buy the jets.
Not everybody wants to smoke weed on the

2360
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:38,860
beach and Bahamas,
like everybody's got a different fucking

2361
01:43:38,861 --> 01:43:39,694
thing.
Figured out what your fucking thing is 

2362
01:43:40,811 --> 01:43:44,110
and stop making fucking bullshit excuses
who the president is.

2363
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,080
Your mom did this like,
like,

2364
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,640
I missed it.
You had that idea for Uber.

2365
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:50,380
Then why didn't you fucking do it,
Dick?

2366
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,130
That's

2367
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:52,963
what I think.
Joe.

2368
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,960
Better words have never been spoken.
Jerry,

2369
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:57,500
you're a bad motherfucker.
Thank you,

2370
01:43:57,501 --> 01:43:58,850
sir.
Pleasure meeting you.

2371
01:43:58,851 --> 01:44:00,100
So glad you did this.
Thank you.

2372
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:02,240
Good night everybody.
We'll be back tomorrow.

2373
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:05,420
Episode nine slash 11 with fucking Alex 
Jones.

2374
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,670
That's right.
You heard it.

2375
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:08,930
And Eddie Bravo.
Holla.
