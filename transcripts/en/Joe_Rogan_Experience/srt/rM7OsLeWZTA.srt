1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,960
Her low freak bitches.
Just keep,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,620
keep it stirring.
It's hard cause it's fun.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,530
It's exciting.
It's exciting to think that there's some

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,800
sort of a gigantic ball of super
geniuses that run the world and they

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,610
decided to blow up tower seven.
You know what's funny about the mountain

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,600
fuck out herself?
Not,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,200
I don't even want to share about the
UFC.

8
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,200
You know it all.
Or you know what's crazy about the moon

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,620
is the hardest shit ever accomplished.
The greatest by the human race.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,670
The greatest accomplishment was landing
on the moon.

11
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,504
Right,
right.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,030
So you would think,
holy shit balls.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,140
I don't think it does.
No,

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,370
it listen.
Okay.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay.
But let's just at the time,

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,050
at the time,
Dan Internet is the biggest,

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,801
okay.
Okay.

18
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,600
But I'm just talking about like a
physical achievement.

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,000
Three dudes,
they got shot up in a rocket.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,150
They were in a,
like a orbiter and then the orbiter

21
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,870
shutout the lunar like the lamb and then
it lands,

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,810
they played golf,
Went Dune bug riding,

23
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,920
did donuts in the sand.

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,220
They get take pictures,
they get back in,

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,460
take off
doc with that orbiter and then fly back.

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,200
That's the hardest she'd ever,
no one died and two,

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,700
can you imagine,
can you imagine that second mission,

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,480
six months later they did it again when,
when they had a break,

29
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:25,260
the news that they were going to use
different astronauts because every

30
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,890
mission they use different estimates.
What did you think they would like a

31
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,840
show like have the same star over and
over.

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,210
Now the three dudes have pulled it off.
Keep doing it dude.

33
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,730
Are you kidding?
They did it before.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,870
Yeah,
but they don't want to keep doing it.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,230
Fucks you up.
Let me do what if,

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,630
what if I got a thank God?
What if they were planning on using buzz

37
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:47,040
Aldrin and Neil Armstrong but they just
fucking got egos and shit.

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,480
They started going to clubs and fucking
like,

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,410
you know,
they want to renegotiate their contract

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,090
because they probably went to the moon
for like,

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,830
you know,
$70,000.

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,110
You know what I mean?
They've got that government cheque,

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,410
they go,
we'll get you two on the second album on

44
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,280
the second.
Uh,

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,470
it just like the record business,
you know what I mean?

46
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,470
My bachelors even make that much.
Of course it say,

47
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,180
listen,
we'll get you on that second on the

48
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:13,880
second and third land.
You know how much money you're gonna

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,850
make.
You're going to come back,

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,340
you're going to be famous.
You can be fucking doing all sorts of

51
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,380
press.
Think about the bitches.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,410
Think about the coke.
Oh,

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,470
they probably got blowed out and got too
cocky and wanted to renegotiate.

54
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,090
Oh my God.
And then NASA said,

55
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,290
we just got to go with some new dudes.
They made $8 per diem.

56
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,400
When Uncle Sam folks,
you raw dog,

57
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:39,810
he was a sand uncle.
Sam Uses broken class on his dick.

58
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,970
When you draw those guys went to the
moon.

59
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,380
Do you remember that?
That this one always got to me,

60
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:47,730
man.
That um,

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,870
those brothers that shot there,
their parents,

62
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,610
the Menendez brothers and one of them
had a wig on memory.

63
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,590
This glorious fake head of hair.
The ma'am take it off.

64
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,230
When he went to jail,
it was really crazy store cause they

65
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:04,020
shotgunned their own parents.
Right?

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,420
Whoa man.
How the fuck does that happen?

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,150
Do you know the one on the left?
Two,

68
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,590
one of them has a total way.
I mean,

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
you look at it now,
you go,

70
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,050
oh,
I get it now.

71
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:18,130
The one on the right was just blessed.
Just straight up blessed with some curly

72
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,590
locks.
What the fuck man,

73
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,250
those,
those,

74
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,100
those sons shotgun,
they're fucking parents,

75
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,860
man.
Do you know Kirk Fox used to teach them

76
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,800
tennis?
That's right.

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,660
That's right.
I do somehow vaguely remember that he

78
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,890
has a whole story.

79
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,580
Well,
teaching them tear up tennis too.

80
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,650
That scares the shit out of me that
people could do that.

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,400
It doesn't scare the shit out to be
nearly as much as people can get so

82
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,900
angry at someone that they could shoot
him.

83
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,920
But it scares the shit out of me that
someone could do that to their dad and

84
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,921
their mom to write and they shoot the
mom to Jesus adopted right where they,

85
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,570
I think the Menendez brothers were
adopted.

86
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,520
Oh really?
Yeah,

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,370
and I think,
I think they're just trying to get

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,630
money.
Oh,

89
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:08,050
what is that sexual and psychological
abuse they had suffered at the hands of

90
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,771
their parents.
Oh,

91
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,730
well,
there you go.

92
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,580
I know.
It's like you always want immediately

93
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,460
blame it on the kids.
Right?

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,550
Because they killed their parents,
but the parents could have been fucking

95
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,570
monsters.
Yeah.

96
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,290
You never know what it's got.

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,380
They have to be monsters.
I mean,

98
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,080
if you think about it,
how do you make a kid that is capable of

99
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,150
shooting you in your sleep?
You've gotta be,

100
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,920
you gotta raise that kid horribly unless
you just by dumb luck,

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,960
have to complete genetic psychopath from
birth that you could have done nothing

102
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,390
to fix.
You've got two guys that are willing to

103
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,340
shoot you while you're sleeping and you
raise him from them time.

104
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,210
They were babies.
That's crazy.

105
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,830
Yeah,
man.

106
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,300
Anyway,
I was going to say their house.

107
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,640
Yeah.
I wonder what happened to their house.

108
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,500
Burnt that fucking thing to the ground.
Probably.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,950
I wonder what happened and shit like
Nicole Simpson's house.

110
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,990
I think it's still there for somebody
live there wasn't Nicole Simpson's,

111
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,390
was that a house or was that an outside
of my apartment building?

112
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,260
Condo.
Yeah.

113
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,900
Dry.
Damn,

114
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,840
man.
Yeah Hoo.

115
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,170
That's a weird one because that's like,
it's a public building.

116
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,090
You got to just deal with it and people
just deal with it.

117
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,690
Is that apartment like still empty hers?
Nah,

118
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,740
that he'd killed them on the street.
Right.

119
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,820
He killed them outside.
But every time you go home you have to

120
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,420
step over a crime scene to walk into
your house

121
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,350
and you've seen the pictures.
Yeah.

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,790
You know the history.
Every time Oj documentary comes out or

123
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,791
every time they have an Oj series on tv
or when his a parole hearing comes up,

124
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,050
you're like walking through the doorway
into that house.

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,730
So I wonder if like,
I want to talk to the person who's like,

126
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,860
doesn't give a fuck and listen,
that motherfucker,

127
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,260
he don't say
deal baby.

128
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,670
Bat,
Sprint would listen.

129
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,460
She should have been nicer dorms.
Dan,

130
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,040
did you ever see the autopsy photos?
Uh,

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,290
did.
I don't know.

132
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,700
If you haven't,
don't,

133
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,080
it's not worth it.
You get it.

134
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,150
I saw it.
A murder scene.

135
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,270
Photos.
It's just so hard to believe that

136
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,860
someone could do that to someone.
Yeah,

137
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,930
it was pretty,
they cared about that they had babies

138
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:21,764
with,
right.

139
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,980
It's just people get crazy game of
thrones out here,

140
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,270
but just rarely.
That's what it is.

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,370
It's like every week it's the game of
thrones.

142
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,530
It's normal

143
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,270
and a Jonathan Hyde who's a social
psychologist over it and why you heat

144
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,670
it.
A really good piece for the Atlantic in

145
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:40,450
2015 about this phenomenon,
this kind of safe space trigger warning

146
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:43,420
phenomenon,
this idea that you must never be forced

147
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,090
into a position where someone has an
idea that opposes yours,

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
and what he said is it basically makes
people crazy.

149
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,690
You know?
It actually makes you crazy that that

150
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,890
the idea in psychology is that if you
have a chain of thoughts leading to a

151
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,090
bad outcome,
if you're depressed,

152
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:55,811
right?
If your depressive,

153
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,670
then you have a chain of thoughts
leading to a bad outcome.

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,370
The way that psychologists deal with
that is with cognitive behavioral

155
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,031
therapy.
They say,

156
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,500
okay,
we're in this chain of thoughts.

157
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,660
Are you going wrong?
Are you attributing to somebody a motive

158
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:05,491
they don't have?
Right?

159
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,310
Is your wife really being nasty or is it
you just attributing nasty to her and

160
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,380
that's why you're getting depressed or
spinning off,

161
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:11,830
right?

162
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,330
Try to control your own chain of
thoughts.

163
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,880
What the microaggression trigger warning
culture does is it actually grants vow.

164
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,230
The more you are offended,
the more value you are granted and

165
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,450
therefore you have actually an interest
in being offended.

166
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,400
We give you awards if you're offended,
right?

167
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,630
Yeah.
Your your treasured.

168
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:27,940
If you're offended because it
demonstrates that you're woke,

169
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:28,420
right?
You're,

170
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,060
the more you are offended,
the more we can show that you are woke

171
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:34,360
and because you are woke.
Therefore your granted this virtue,

172
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,460
you get to Lord it over everyone else.
I mean I say in my speeches,

173
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,720
if we could somehow identify like the
lgbt half black,

174
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,200
half Hispanic,
one quarter native American little

175
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,160
person,
you know,

176
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:48,290
then we would finally have the,
the person who we could go to dance for

177
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,500
all of our questions because their
identity would be unquestionable.

178
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,790
It'd be Yoda,
right?

179
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,310
If we could find Yoda,
we could just get rid of democracy and

180
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,650
discussion all together.
He can just rule from on high.

181
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,440
He,
she,

182
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,870
I don't want to put a gender on Yoda,

183
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,300
right?
I don't think Yoda is gender.

184
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,030
It is Yoda.
Does he do it right?

185
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,890
It's gotta be a guy with deep voice.
Maybe we're being rude by incidents,

186
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,810
but yeah,
you're absolutely right.

187
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,810
There's no one is a,
no one's left enough.

188
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,631
Yeah,
it's,

189
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:13,464
it's,
I,

190
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,990
I don't know where the limit is a and
it's there so far left that they've

191
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,030
actually made common cause with the
people they hate.

192
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,900
Right.
So when they talk about safe spaces and

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,190
is w w it misery it,
all these black students protesting and

194
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:27,730
they actually said we don't want white
people who think like us and who want to

195
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,490
help us in our safe spaces.
We feel insulted by that.

196
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,010
I just thought to myself,
well the KKK agrees.

197
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,740
Like if you want to do safe spaces for
separate races,

198
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,880
I can find some Jim crow racist or
totally up for that from like 1962

199
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,350
well,
there's the really bizarre statement

200
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,830
that I've heard over and over again that
black people cannot be racist against

201
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,990
white people because they don't have any
power over white people.

202
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes.
Wow.

203
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,603
Which is just,

204
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,561
it's an,
it's an eight.

205
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,730
I mean,
it's an inane statement.

206
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:58,260
The this that you have to,
you have to have power in the

207
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,390
superstructure in order for you to even
to be raised.

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,890
I can understand the argument.
If they said,

209
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,200
look,
you being racist is not connected to

210
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,390
racist action.
If you don't have the capacity for

211
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,810
action that affects people,
then your personal racism is not as

212
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,550
important as the racism of people in
power.

213
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,410
Then at least as an argument or the idea
that you can't be racist at all if

214
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,210
you're,
if you're black because black people

215
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,380
don't have enough pat.
First of all,

216
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,370
the idea that black people have no power
in the United States is utterly crazy.

217
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,450
I mean,
it's utterly crazy.

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Well,
especially when it was going on.

219
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,780
Alabama was president.
The attorney general was the president,

220
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,330
and I always said this about Baltimore.

221
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,950
We kept hearing you in Baltimore,
right,

222
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,130
where they had the riots.
They'd bought wood,

223
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,320
they had riots,
and they were saying,

224
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,520
well,
Baltimore PD,

225
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,001
you know,
they're,

226
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,060
they're cracking down on black people.
I'll get the chief of police was black.

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,460
The majority of the city council was
black and Democrat.

228
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,670
The entire,
the,

229
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,540
the deputy district attorney who was
prosecuting the case was black.

230
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,670
The majority of the police department
was minority.

231
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,440
The attorney general of the United
States was black,

232
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,030
and the president of the United States
was black.

233
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,670
But the majority of the city of
Baltimore is black.

234
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,960
But apparently it's the white guy's
fault.

235
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,460
Like I just,
at some point,

236
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:01,260
you're going to have to make your ideas
actually work in concert with reality.

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,850
I can't,
I can't like do this with you.

238
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,470
Do you ever step back

239
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,540
and
[inaudible].
