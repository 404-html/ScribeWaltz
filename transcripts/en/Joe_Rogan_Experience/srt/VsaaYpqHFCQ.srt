1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,590
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the flashlight.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,610
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the 

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,160
flashlight,
you will get 15 percent off the number 

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,050
one sex toy for men.
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,000
And that's what you say right?
When you shoot your load.

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,810
Thinking about the discount.
Oh,

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,250
savings.
Buckle up.

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,220
You dirty bitches.
It's my birthday.

9
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:34,390
And Ari Shaffir.
Yay.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,680
The inevitable slide continues as I hit 
44 today by the death of the slide 

11
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,990
towards the great.
Beyond.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
It will not stop.
It waits for no man.

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,390
40th four.
Which one is the 44?

14
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:03,391
That's what I just turned that.
Is that a special year when the goes 

15
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:03,391
back,
just keeps going.

16
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:08,100
Keeps sliding.
I always say that I keep my eye on 

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,610
semester stallone.
He's my canary in a coal mines.

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,540
Long As.
As long as that guy's still alive.

19
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,680
Like how much Roy can you do and be like
60.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,860
That's incredible.
We would further line for expendables 

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:19,860
too.
You know what he's like?

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,671
He's like an old fucking Carla.
You can take an old 55 Chevelle or a 55 

23
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:28,351
buick rather,
and just put some ridiculous rocket 

24
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:28,351
engine in it and,
and you know,

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,770
and fucking see how long that suspension
last brand new parts all over.

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,340
God's done brand new parts,
but how long before he blows that frame 

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,641
out,
how long for the frame just bends and 

28
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,730
falls off.
He must have like the best scientists in

29
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:45,650
the world just constantly jabbing him 
needles,

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,660
just constantly checking his blood as 
eating breakfast and somebody comes in,

31
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:54,661
sticks out,
someone else comes and draws some 

32
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:54,661
checks,
his blood checks his urine,

33
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,240
the examine them,
and then they hit him with some more 

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
roids.
Make sure you eat a grapefruit and shoot

35
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:05,641
it up.
Give them some of that shit from the 

36
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:05,641
planet of the apes.
Give them that new shit.

37
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,390
Dude.
He's my canary in a coal mine,

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,420
so as long as I'm 44 and he's like 65 or
something like that now I think he's 65 

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,210
to still do an action movies.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,330
Seen that movie.
That planter there will be fun.

41
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah.
We talked about last podcast,

42
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:21,250
Doug Stanhope and canary because he 
drinks he everything.

43
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,610
Yeah.
That's kind of the way he got in a lot 

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,351
of trouble recently.
I guess I've gotten in trouble for 

45
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:30,351
something.
I'll go on.

46
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:34,980
He was,
I believe BBC radio in the host of the 

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,500
radio show.
Just mentioned one of his jokes and,

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,640
and uh,
the,

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,400
what is the disease?
The Red Down Syndrome.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,500
This is what he said.
He said,

51
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,630
Sara,
this is

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,110
Stan hopes.
Joe Sarah Pailin has to retarded kids.

53
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,380
One of them has down syndrome.
The other ones signed up for the 

54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,400
military.
That's a fucking good job.

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,480
It's both with,
what did I say?

56
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,380
Lucy American Dj just mentioned that he 
a panel.

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,350
This is the deal.
He's on BBC radio,

58
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:10,351
which I've done before and they were 
very polite and you don't go into depth 

59
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,750
about anything.
There's no flavor to it at all.

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Yeah.
BBC radio is like the most bland flavor 

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,390
list.
Emotionless.

62
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,390
It's like pbs accent.
It's like pbs.

63
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,110
If it was tired.
Yeah.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,410
PBS.
If he got neutered,

65
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,850
if they had no Saturday.
Oh,

66
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,710
it's fucking terrible.
Terrible radio.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,470
Uh,
but stan hope did it and he's talking to

68
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:32,860
this,
you know,

69
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,230
the,
the,

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
they can't get an in depth about it,
so he's forced to have sort of a polite 

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,611
conversation,
but he doesn't want to give the people 

72
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:41,860
the wrong impression that this is going 
to be like what they come to see,

73
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:46,861
you know,
when people don't know what kind of 

74
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:46,861
comedy you do and Stan hope is,
you know,

75
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:50,940
remarkably offensive and especially if 
you're just some regular fucking square 

76
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,110
out there living in the world,
you know,

77
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:57,000
especially in England,
you're not used to this Arizona trash as

78
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,240
Doug Stanhope,
you know,

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,450
so he,
they wanted to let the people know like,

80
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:05,451
just in case you don't believe us,
that Mr Stan hope has a very offensive 

81
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:05,451
standup comedy.

82
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:08,260
Aca.
Just Google his bid on Sarah Pailin.

83
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,320
That's all they were tired of it.
They just said see the bid on youtube 

84
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:13,720
or.
Yeah,

85
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,790
I think he got in trouble for that.
Yes.

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,340
He got to find even go on that show.
Well,

87
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,480
what he's saying is that what the people
are saying was that what this guy did in

88
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,120
referencing that is like sort of like 
what extent,

89
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,290
what's the rule?
It's like you don't condone it.

90
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,810
Yeah.
It's like condoning it by telling people

91
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,810
about it at all your advertising.
It sort of.

92
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,060
Which I can see that what they were 
saying,

93
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:42,061
but so fucking what on the level of this
is present material.

94
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,570
He's telling you that it's offensive if 
you don't believe in washes bit.

95
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,750
So if you don't believe him,
you know and you've watched the bit and 

96
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,090
you get offended and then you get mad.

97
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,090
You're a fucking moron.
That's one of the dumbest fucking thing 

98
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,000
I've ever heard in my life saying I'm 
not taking your word for it.

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,870
Going there.
I'm like,

100
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,280
wow,
I should have taken your word for it.

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,210
It's outrageous that anyone could 
possibly complain.

102
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,450
This guy is interviewing a comic.
Okay.

103
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:12,451
And in the interview,
the comic stains within the lines of 

104
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:12,520
whatever parameters a behavior,
they,

105
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,520
they find acceptable.
He doesn't go out of those lines at all.

106
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,510
Just polite conversation,
but they wanted to let people know,

107
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,800
so he said,
if you don't believe us,

108
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:25,801
watch this bit,
and then people were going fucking 

109
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:25,801
crazy.
They're calling for this guy's head.

110
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,790
It's incredible how.
What is going on?

111
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Why is everybody becoming such a bunch 
of content and pussies because it feels 

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,470
like more than ever.
So they do.

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,640
Is that that?
Is it right?

114
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Is it frustration and their own lives 
and they find something where they can 

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,240
score on something where they can 
fucking tee off on.

116
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,520
They just go at times.
It really is like A.

117
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,230
I didn't want to hear that and it's 
fucking annoying.

118
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,170
Fucking annoying.
But if it's during their faith,

119
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,910
but I think usually it's just like,
wait,

120
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,120
is that yes,
you shouldn't be promoted event anyway.

121
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,190
And if people just go overboard,
like I don't even want to exist in the 

122
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,840
world.
They get mad whenever anyone references 

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:01,840
is trying to kill it.
Yeah,

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,420
it's that too.
But it's a self righteous indignation.

125
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,760
It's just so fake.
Yeah.

126
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,010
There's so many people that are looking 
for a moment to be angry shit on other 

127
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,510
people for the end.
So you're not Christian enough,

128
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,580
you're not anything enough.
Whatever the fuck.

129
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,780
And that's all it is,
is just a.

130
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,430
it's just a religious thing.
That's all it's left.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,730
Why the fuck is it so hard for people to
leave other people alone?

132
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,650
It's telling you it's offensive stuff.

133
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,470
Yeah.
All right.

134
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,090
If you're,
if you're into Jesus or whatever,

135
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,780
I just don't watch it.
Why is it so hard for kids to watch it?

136
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,340
Even if they watch it and they get 
upset,

137
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,150
like,
Oh God,

138
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,610
he said that guy's an ass.
I'll never go see him live.

139
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,570
Mean why do they get so upset?
They attack the DJ from mentioning it.

140
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I mean,
you gotta be you gotta be a fucking 

141
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:41,560
mess.
That's what you're going to.

142
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,790
You're going to use your time for that.
Like really?

143
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,400
That's ridiculous.
Who does,

144
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,060
what does the house was?
I don't know what it is.

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I Dunno.
I Dunno who the fuck does remember that 

146
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,590
lady that Patrice O'Neal was fighting 
with on MSNBC or Fox News?

147
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,420
Yes.
Yeah,

148
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,370
like that type of woman.
She represents the people who complain.

149
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,860
Yeah.
What the fuck man.

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,750
It's just like,
oh,

151
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,250
you don't even really understand what 
it's even been said.

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,520
I was talking to this woman and she had 
told me in the middle of the 

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,940
conversation about some letter that she 
wrote to some,

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,600
some something I forget it was a show or
a product and shit,

155
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,110
but she was going off about how,
so I wrote them a letter telling them 

156
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,360
that I didn't.
I didn't find the Algo really.

157
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,750
You wrote them a letter,
like really the only reason to do,

158
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,760
to write a letter to accompany is for 
the back to school reason when I'm in 

159
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,591
summer school with Mark Harmon wherein 
you get free shades and things like 

160
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:32,591
that.
Yeah.

161
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,910
Writing a letter I remember hearing that
you all to do is complain.

162
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,430
I got some bunk Gillette razors.
What's up?

163
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,350
I think you're razors rule,
but this is bullshit

164
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,280
all the time and they were mostly 
restaurants were the best because like I

165
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,660
would go to a restaurant and even if it 
was just mediocre,

166
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,780
instead of just writing a review,
I'll just send a letter to like 

167
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:51,780
applebee's.
Like dude,

168
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:51,940
I went to applebee's.
The waiter was like,

169
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,620
coming 20 minutes for a soup.
Really?

170
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,990
They'll send you a gift certificate back
for $50,

171
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,650
and I'm like,
ah.

172
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,450
Ever seen anybody in person trying to 
run that scam and a restaurant?

173
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,050
What complaint?
Fake scam.

174
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,330
I've seen real complaints from like 
Jewish Delis,

175
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,540
but there's plenty of people that 
complained like this soup is cold or 

176
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:11,540
this,
you know,

177
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,210
corn beef is rough.
That's,

178
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,700
that's all legit.
I mean,

179
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,030
I had to send a Pastrami Rueben back 
once at Jerry's famous deli.

180
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,850
It turns out they cut it the wrong way.
It wasn't bad,

181
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:23,280
but if you cut it one way,
it's real rough fight,

182
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:23,860
right?
Yeah.

183
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,020
Yeah.
But if you cut it another way,

184
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:27,490
it breaks up,
which is incredible when you think about

185
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:27,850
it,
right?

186
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,000
It doesn't.
Doesn't brisk is the same way you got to

187
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,080
go with the greater.
It gets good.

188
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,900
I forget which one is you just move your
hand like to the left,

189
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,840
but what it is is cut it.
When you cut it with the tendon,

190
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,840
like w go along the grand attendant,
which is apparently the wrong way.

191
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,610
Then it's like chewing these tendons,
tendons,

192
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,980
wrong word,
muscle fibers,

193
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,350
but if you cut it against it,
I guess,

194
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:52,380
then it comes to that brisket he showed 
me.

195
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,100
He was like,
look,

196
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,530
if I cut it wrong and give me a little,
just takes.

197
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,040
It just

198
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,780
bites rotten.
Wow.

199
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,830
That's what it is.
Yeah.

200
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,670
Fuck,
I was going to say something.

201
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,080
You sent that back.
You can play.

202
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,410
That was the one that was the only thing
ever.

203
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,230
Yeah.
The people that are much more important.

204
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,340
Wow.
I'm.

205
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,420
Oh No.
This is what it is.

206
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,900
I watched this happen in a restaurant.
I was at spa,

207
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,930
which is an excellent restaurant.
I mean spargo in,

208
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,130
in Maui,
in Hawaii.

209
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,160
It's really expensive.
It's the four seasons and it's a five 

210
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,160
star restaurant.
I mean it's jamming.

211
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,420
The food there is intense.
It's really good.

212
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,010
It's one of those places where you can 
puck,

213
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,580
right?
Yeah,

214
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:26,940
yeah,
yeah.

215
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,730
The chef there.
Yeah.

216
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:32,731
You,
you eat there like they have this miso 

217
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:32,731
cod or like you easily.
God Damn,

218
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,460
this is fucking delicious.
It's just they're experts.

219
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,780
They're experts,
chefs.

220
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,810
So,
uh,

221
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,080
it's a high end place.
So there's a lot of rich people,

222
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,420
they're dying in this little,
you know,

223
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,560
you look around and you know,
I'm on vacation.

224
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm like,
how much money this guy,

225
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,940
steele,
who was this corporate criminal,

226
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
you know,
it's that kind of shit.

227
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,940
And at this restaurant,
the people behind us,

228
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,230
there was this English couple and they 
were totally work in a scam.

229
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,570
It was so obvious.
One of them,

230
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:58,300
the guy was like,
you know,

231
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,480
he kept saying like,
you guys,

232
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,100
you've got,
you've got gotta,

233
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,770
get your shit together.
Here he goes,

234
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,180
I've come here,
I've come here,

235
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,870
I've aborted,
get to poke sharp.

236
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,280
You tell me you out the pork chops.
But the pork chops your special like,

237
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,720
mate,
how are you running out of this?

238
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,830
I mean,
this is shoddy,

239
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,660
shoddy stuff.
And the guy's like,

240
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,800
well,
I apologize Sir.

241
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,740
But hopefully the choice,
you know,

242
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,210
and,
and,

243
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:19,050
and so he says,
you know,

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,930
our food didn't come at the same time.
Like hers was over,

245
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:23,840
you know,
he said it was like 10 minutes later was

246
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,830
at Gordon Ramsay.

247
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,090
No,
no,

248
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:25,280
no,
no.

249
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:30,281
It's just some Dick.
And he was asking them to take money 

250
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,591
off,
like surely you can't expect us to be 

251
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,661
paying for this.
And he started talking about the rice 

252
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:35,790
and he goes,
he goes over rice have rice racer.

253
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,550
So hot,
almost benton mouth mate is this.

254
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,360
We sent,
we sent,

255
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,460
they send something back,
we send it back because it's cold.

256
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,510
You bring it back.
It's too hot.

257
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,430
Like come on man,
get your shit together.

258
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,090
Might.
He goes,

259
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,470
this is intolerable.
He goes,

260
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,400
you've got to,
you've got to,

261
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,980
you've got to do something to,
you know,

262
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,640
to fix them.
Sends us.

263
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah,
to whatever the word is,

264
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,780
you know,
to do something to make things right.

265
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,130
And I was like,
wow,

266
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,420
to compensate us,
you know,

267
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,230
you've got to compensate me for this.
You know?

268
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,000
It was like,
really?

269
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,020
It was ridiculous.

270
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,380
And they kept going and the manager,
it was a clumsy one.

271
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:11,010
Like they were there being way too 
honest about it and the,

272
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
what they were complaining about was way
too little.

273
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,830
It was of the.
It's like whether you should get up and 

274
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:18,830
leave immediately.
It's not like you're halfway through the

275
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:18,830
meal.
Then it got bad.

276
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,950
You're complaining from the start.
Well,

277
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,080
he was coming.
They were combined.

278
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,860
They complained about a few different 
things.

279
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,560
It took me a while to tune into them.
There was like a certain,

280
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,860
like certain country noise from behind 
me,

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,010
so it took me a while to tune into it 
and then once I tuned into it,

282
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,250
then we actually watched them try to 
scam these waiters and then,

283
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:40,251
you know,
the waiter had to bring over a manager 

284
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,931
and the waiter clearly said to the 
manager that these people are scamming 

285
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:41,931
because there's,
the manager came back.

286
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:43,920
He was like a stone face killer.
It's like,

287
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,480
how can I help you?
What's going on here?

288
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,370
And the guy that runs this shit,
he'll sir,

289
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,930
we're out of the pork chops.
Any other questions?

290
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:52,140
What can I help you with you?
Like he just like kept them like,

291
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
I'm,
I'm confused.

292
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,070
Here is why you would

293
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,710
think that we would compensate you for 
that sir.

294
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,770
Like,
why would you,

295
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,190
why would your meal isn't satisfactory?
This is an excellent restaurant.

296
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,770
I don't know what you're saying.
I can just shut the guy down.

297
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,850
And.
But it was ugly,

298
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:08,851
man,
that lasted for like 15 minutes and it 

299
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:08,851
required everybody to pay attention to 
it because it was,

300
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:09,910
you know,
when you're in a restaurant and all of a

301
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:14,911
sudden some shit goes wrong at some 
table and you hear people raise their 

302
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:18,121
voices like you have to pay attention at
least part of it because someone might 

303
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:22,621
pull out a fucking gun or somebody might
punch somebody or commands your 

304
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:22,770
attention,
but your,

305
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,090
your warning signals go off.
At least mine do.

306
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,950
When I see people arguing,
I always say,

307
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:27,790
okay,
what is,

308
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,820
what's going on here?
How much do I have to pay attention to 

309
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,891
this?
What is the threat level I'm assessing 

310
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:34,891
here?
You know,

311
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:35,980
when people are in the middle of a 
fucking yelling at each other.

312
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,220
So I had to,
I had to pay attention to these 

313
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,220
scumbags,
but it was weird.

314
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,560
It's weird singling people running 
scams,

315
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,650
like it's one thing to be a kid in Ohio 
trying to get fucking free lollipops or 

316
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:46,990
whatever.
You want to be.

317
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:51,991
A grown man in his forties with a woman 
who was clearly in on it and they're 

318
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:52,900
trying to work this shit.

319
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,950
I feel bad.
That's the idea is that when he was 

320
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,351
younger he robbed banks and mugged fags.
But I feel bad about my past but it's 

321
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:05,541
not as bad.
When I used to do the scam when I was 

322
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:05,541
like 18,
17,

323
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,880
I would go to these diners just to smoke
cigarettes and drink coffee and I had no

324
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:13,881
money and so what I would do is once in 
a while I had chest hair when I was in 

325
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:15,540
high school.
Once in awhile I would just be like,

326
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,570
oh,
who wants free meals?

327
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,670
And I'll just poke it.
And it goes.

328
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,780
Do you guys want some,
you know,

329
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,220
and that'll give it to my friends.
And you know the drill.

330
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,530
The yes.
How many times?

331
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,260
Probably like four or five.
Four or five times at the same place.

332
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,030
Yeah.
Tj is on High Street,

333
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,330
does it?

334
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,210
There's a dude that I know that actually
brings clipped nails to restaurants and 

335
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,790
drop them in soups and this food that 
people may put that in there and they'll

336
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,490
complain about and again get his and he 
does it on purpose and he's.

337
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,670
He gets paid well this guy have it.
Pay Him.

338
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,010
No,
no,

339
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,950
no.
This guy is not a broke guy.

340
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,190
Poor guy running a scam.
But he brings a little plastic bag,

341
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,140
a little ziploc bag of nail clippings.

342
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Me and my friend Shane once I went to 
Arby's and you know there's a fountain 

343
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,480
drinks.
They have these little black nozzles and

344
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:04,481
if you've worked in a restaurant,
it's like what you usually take out to 

345
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:04,481
clean every night.
I put it in and twist it.

346
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,670
Anyways,
we got a drink and that black nozzle 

347
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,521
fell into his glass and so we went to,
we went home and this is like when I 

348
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,660
first got a video camera and he opened 
it up and he was like,

349
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,640
what is this thing after he's drank half
of it,

350
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,470
so what's this thing?
And he pulls it out and stuff,

351
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,510
black nozzle and inside it is just mold 
this most disgusting shit ever.

352
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:28,901
So we filmed it and we went to Arby's 
and he's just like bitching at the 

353
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,081
manager and uh,
and like we filmed the whole thing and 

354
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,081
he's like,
no,

355
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,081
I want some free shit.

356
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,320
And like it was,
he turned it into like,

357
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,960
I wasn't going to pay me.
You're not going to bring it up.

358
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,300
I'll bring it up.
And the funny thing is she wouldn't give

359
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:42,680
him any really anything.
That was an internet video.

360
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,730
Yeah.
In the Internet days,

361
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,840
in the video,
she's like,

362
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,740
she's like,
I don't care.

363
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:50,741
She's like,
here I'll give you a dollar back for 

364
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:50,741
your drink and get a dollar back to the 
drink.

365
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:50,960
And he's like,
are you kidding me?

366
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,330
We could send this to the fucking news.
She goes,

367
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,060
I don't give it,
you know,

368
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:54,930
I don't care.
Bluff.

369
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,590
I know.
And I have that video.

370
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,870
So she was right.
She didn't call,

371
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,590
you didn't do crap.
She's long dead.

372
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,890
But if you look at that video,
you'll come to sky did like it.

373
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.
If it was the internet days,

374
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,940
I sent that picture of just that nozzle 
to argue to find that video.

375
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,880
It's amazing.
The restaurants are as clean as we are.

376
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,030
When you think about,
you know,

377
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,450
all those fucking lazy people where 
they're not cleaning up the restaurants.

378
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,460
They're not.
You ever see a clean kitchen nightmares 

379
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,700
with one of the best TV shows every day 
from Gordon Ramsey,

380
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,620
but I think they canceled it.
They have the UK version,

381
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,650
the American version,
the UK version or an American 

382
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:30,650
restaurants.
Yeah.

383
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,770
Dara.
They go to places where they're just a 

384
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:33,770
wreck.
Yeah.

385
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,951
But what sucks is like there's a 
restaurant down the street from me in 

386
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,011
Burbank that was on that show and it was
one of the worst episodes and in what 

387
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:39,500
you can get on torrents.
But uh,

388
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,100
there's one Mexican restaurant where 
they go in the back and I guess a lot of

389
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:46,630
Mexican restaurants do this.
They have a big bucket that they get,

390
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:51,631
like at home depot and they just put all
the beans in it and they had these 

391
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:52,930
bucket of beans where they just scoop 
out everyday and like,

392
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,350
here's your beans.
Here's your beans.

393
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,600
They show they pulled that bucket of 
beans out.

394
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,750
One side of it was fucking mold.
The other side was like a breakthrough 

395
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,870
where that hard layer and the top layer 
was this.

396
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Uh,
it was a Mexican restaurant on there's 

397
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,040
mold on the beans.
Yeah.

398
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,141
Dot on one side.
It was mold in a top layer was so hard 

399
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:15,100
that they broke through like ice,
like North Pole style to get the beans 

400
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,980
underneath that.
We're still a.

401
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,290
It was exaggerating this.

402
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,760
If anyone's ever seen this episode,
they would know.

403
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,090
I think about every time I go to the 
Mexican restaurant and they served it to

404
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:29,090
him in the show.
That's why this show is so great because

405
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,020
every episode he goes into the kitchen 
and finds the exact same kind of shit.

406
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,410
It freaks you the fuck out where you 
don't want to eat at a restaurant ever 

407
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,410
again after watching that.
But it's on torrence.

408
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:41,510
Get a kitchen nightmares us version.

409
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,750
God Damn.
Yeah.

410
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,650
Yeah.
There's a lot,

411
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,510
man.
You do risk it when you go somewhere and

412
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,480
you buy someone else's preparation,
you do risk it.

413
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,350
You know the risk it.
I've worked in restaurants before,

414
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,890
you know,
whatever.

415
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,910
You got a shot at fucking pupil,
a curl that I was dating got in trouble 

416
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,450
for spitting in someone's spitting in 
someone's milkshake.

417
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,680
She'll get in a lot of trouble for that.
That ruins their faith in the system.

418
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:10,681
That shit happens all the time.
To do that as a waiter all the fucking 

419
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:10,681
time.
Putting my balls on people's breadsticks

420
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:10,950
and shit.

421
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,490
I guess the dude was a Dick,
so she spit in his fucking milkshake and

422
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,250
that's always an option to be a dick.
Just don't do it.

423
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,210
It's so easy.
Don't.

424
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Meanwhile she was kind of pretty.
Probably would have let her spit in his 

425
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,300
mouth.

426
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,790
And you mentioned being a cop,
going to a restaurant.

427
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,920
Can you imagine being a cop?
Go into a restaurant?

428
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,810
No.
How many times people probably see a cop

429
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:29,670
walking into a restaurant and fucking 
fuck,

430
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,020
fuck up that cop.
Oh yeah,

431
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:33,900
for sure.
Especially some maids prison.

432
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:34,740
No one likes them.

433
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,540
Oh yeah,
man.

434
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,820
Ultimately became a meter maid.
Didn't even know.

435
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,560
I think for a little while.
Meet a mate is a terrible job.

436
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,040
You just getting negative energy all day
and nobody's nice to meet her raised.

437
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,290
It would probably change a world if they
would give them the option to stop 

438
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,860
through a ticket if they actually could 
do that and make some people's days.

439
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,670
Yeah,
right.

440
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,630
They can't.
Or can they?

441
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,250
They always say can't stop.
Once it started.

442
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,300
That was always the stereotype.
The cliche is true.

443
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,050
I don't know,
but if they could,

444
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,470
they went over so many more fans,
so God damn ridiculous that you have to 

445
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,040
give someone money to put your car 
somewhere.

446
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,940
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

447
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,060
But without that,
no one will be able to get anywhere.

448
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,340
What?
So put up a sign that says you can't 

449
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,340
park forever and then tow the flux.

450
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,730
It's that simple and it's one thing if 
you live in like one of those places,

451
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:28,731
like in west Hollywood is kind of crazy 
because they have all these spots where 

452
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:32,691
you can only park if you're a resident 
because there's really way too many 

453
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:35,600
people for this area as the residence 
would never be able to park and park.

454
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,710
There's too many for the residents as it
is.

455
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:38,710
There's too many,
there's just,

456
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,910
there's not enough parking spots for all
the cars because it's all these 

457
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:43,950
apartment buildings and everybody in La 
drives,

458
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,030
so if you look at an apartment building,
you're looking at one area that's not 

459
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,241
that big on a block,
but might have 100 units at 40 people 

460
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:53,241
for.
For cars,

461
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,850
that's 100 cars.
100 cars is like the whole block,

462
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but there's a lot of other shit on that 
block besides sides at apartment 

463
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,000
building so it becomes a God damn 
nightmare.

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,440
But that kind of makes sense.
Like resident parking,

465
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,520
like don't park it,
that's,

466
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,080
you know this,
these people live here.

467
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,380
It sucks if you want to visit somebody,
but that's better than if you lived.

468
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,480
If you lived there and it was 
intolerable everyday,

469
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:17,481
he couldn't get a parking spot.
But to charge people for parking on the 

470
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:18,480
fucking public streets.
Fuck you.

471
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,550
You know,
it's just,

472
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,560
it's ridiculous.
You shouldn't get any fucking money for 

473
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,910
someone who's shopping in a store once a
pullover that fuck you,

474
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,740
you get it.
You get a dollar for that.

475
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:29,310
Why?

476
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,730
Well,
the biggest problem would be though,

477
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,000
if not doing that is then people just 
abandoned their cars there in lights,

478
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,070
in their car parking or one hour your 
parking.

479
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,430
There has to be some kind of

480
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,170
no parking for more than two hours here.
Making across the board that I don't 

481
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,340
mind.
I don't mind if someone violates a good 

482
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,340
normal rule and then you give them a 
ticket to kind of keep order,

483
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,040
you know?
Hey man,

484
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,020
you can't just believe in your car 
parked sideways.

485
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,580
Like that Douche bag.
You get a ticket for that.

486
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,250
But all the meters in general,
you're not leaders man.

487
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,270
Fuck that.
That's changed.

488
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,510
Especially the long ones.
Like if you go to la,

489
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:03,970
there's sometimes there's like 20 signs 
and you seriously,

490
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,320
you just have to sit there and it's like
a video game for you to read all the 

491
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,631
signs and you got to take it.
The last time we were in Pasadena 

492
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:12,880
because it was like no parking for this 
hour and this hour.

493
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,340
Tuesdays you can't park here at all 
after this time.

494
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,820
And like I just need to take a.

495
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,060
You got to do the math.
You have to do math when you read the 

496
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,060
fucking parking sign.
Yeah.

497
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,190
The thing is too,
you took a photo and you get a ticket 

498
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,190
and what are you going to do?
You're really gonna fucking fight it.

499
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,720
Yeah.
It takes forever.

500
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,060
You're just like,
it's a fucking major ticket for much.

501
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,190
Is it?
It's like 60 or $70.

502
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,340
Yeah.
It's like there's no way,

503
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:38,510
and I always forget to do that work 
because that's obviously doubles.

504
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,030
He would,
you know,

505
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,040
what really kills me is when cops have 
quotas and no cops have quotas that they

506
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:48,970
have to reach over a certain amount of 
people for a certain amount of things.

507
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,740
I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
Yeah,

508
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,810
and that's why I like certain times of 
the month you'll see just nonstop cops 

509
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,840
pulling people over all the time and 
then next week you won't see anything.

510
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,540
But what's crazy is one,
if no one commits a crime,

511
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,470
I mean,
what if we got everybody to keep their 

512
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,020
shit together for a month and these cops
still have quotas.

513
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,450
That would be a crazy movie like of a 
town command.

514
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,700
If everyone comes,
fine.

515
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:13,190
Yeah.
If you had a big savings like boulder,

516
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:14,720
Colorado,
it's like 100,000

517
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:15,550
people.
If you.

518
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,940
You could almost get 100,000
people to never commit any crimes.

519
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,970
Don't like last week for one month.
Let's show these fucking cops that you 

520
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,740
can't have quotas that say that.
You know,

521
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:30,260
some people have to be the last week.

522
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,680
Let's try to get everybody.
Unfortunately,

523
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,700
our laws are written in such a way where
you could pull you over for anything 

524
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:36,700
they probably want to.
They,

525
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,570
they can find a way to pull you over no 
matter what.

526
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:38,870
Like,
Oh,

527
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:43,871
you didn't turn on your signal three 
seconds before you merged into the next 

528
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:44,010
lane.
That's actually a law,

529
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:49,011
you know,
or something like that where they can 

530
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:49,011
pull you up for a new instructor.
You know what I mean?

531
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:53,231
They get so mad when he,
when he would be with demoed for not 

532
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:53,231
signaling.

533
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:57,200
Did you just say,
remember soul man and then the quota 

534
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,020
scene.
That's hilarious.

535
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,540
Behind him.
When did the guy,

536
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,570
the white guy talked at tanning pills,
pills and turn black and was following 

537
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,630
behind him and then eventually the 
swerve.

538
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:10,600
Because I'm an open their door,
swerved around their door and the couple

539
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,300
of the lights on,
he was switching lanes without a,

540
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,250
without a signal.
How risky was that?

541
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,130
Maybe when that came out last time were 
like,

542
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:23,131
whoa.
And then he started dating a black 

543
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:23,360
check.
Whatever happens,

544
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,290
honored with a c Dot Thomas Howell.
I think of that.

545
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,760
What is it?
That guy?

546
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,080
Well,
that kind of vanished.

547
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,270
Yeah.
He's another Cuba gooding Jr.

548
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,570
A lot of those actors.
Do you understAnd that you reach a 

549
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:36,780
higher level of consciousness and they 
just kind of disappeared into the ether?

550
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,740
They like scientologists.
Yeah.

551
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
It probably did the right thing.
Their money and live on an island 

552
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:43,800
somewhere and just get out of it,
you know?

553
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,650
That's what I would do.
I was in balboa.

554
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,420
If you ever heard a baobella island.
No.

555
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,460
It's this island off of newport beach 
and it costs a dollar to get over on 

556
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,930
this ferry.
It's awesome.

557
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,860
You just Drive onto this ferry that goes
right over.

558
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,330
It's like a kind of window.
Yeah.

559
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,390
Yeah.
It's just like lean is hard to get a 

560
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,390
ferry,
right?

561
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,390
Yeah.
Your car over there.

562
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,381
It's expensive,
it's super small though in the houses 

563
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:07,710
are fucking amazing.
There's not even a cop that lives on 

564
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,740
this island and people just had their 
doors wide open,

565
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,890
so you'd walk by and just see people 
like sitting in their house and they had

566
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,450
a starbucks and it was the most peaceful
fucking shit ever.

567
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,000
I go in small numbers of people with 
money tend to be peaceful.

568
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,870
If I got to a certain amount of money I 
think,

569
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:28,871
I think I would just take that money,
invest in something that makes me money 

570
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,780
every month and just fucking live 
somewhere like that is this,

571
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,800
listen that,
this what the fuck he's an investor.

572
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,910
Invest in something that makes me money.
Every simple,

573
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,600
so simple like property renting out 
property.

574
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,320
That's probably one of the easiest 
things ever.

575
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,270
Not in this day and age,
man.

576
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,130
It's actually really hard.
In fact,

577
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,290
a reason why when you drive around and 
see all these offices for rent 

578
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,820
properties like housing departments,
this is a renter's market.

579
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,540
Believe it or not,
this apartments available everywhere,

580
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,270
which is really crazy.
Like what do they expect?

581
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,540
How many people do expect to move here?
I know there's so many extra apartments.

582
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,300
No,
fucking people are still coming,

583
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,490
you know.
When did you move here?

584
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:08,960
What year was it?
Ninety nine.

585
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,590
Did you do notice a discernible 
difference between 99 and 2011 as far as

586
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:15,620
traffic,
unless you think is less now.

587
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Less than like a.
I noticed this like a year and a half 

588
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,921
ago.
It's way less than three years before 

589
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,541
that.
This because he's just started smoking 

590
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,281
weed and to look at it because were 
sessions really actually noticed that I 

591
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,230
had to stop doing a joke about that.

592
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,120
I was like,
why are the freeway so packed if,

593
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,150
if,
if everyone's supposed to be not 

594
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,150
working,
but then I was like,

595
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,370
I'm doing a junk dude.
Keep doing that joke.

596
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,740
The freeloaders or gundam pack.
How I only noticed the opposite.

597
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm like,
I'm getting to bray away faster.

598
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,720
Getting to all these places.
Wait,

599
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,020
well I think it's just luck.
I think that's just someone not 

600
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,110
crashing.
You fly over in the four or five at five

601
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,880
in the afternoon.
You traffic.

602
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,350
It's just not.
doesn't seem as bad to me.

603
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,510
Orange county is the worst.
That area.

604
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:55,980
Like when you're talking about newport 
beach for a quick.

605
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Oh,
nice.

606
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Jen down there is insane.
Anytime we got to go to irvine and the 

607
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,061
irvine improv,
anytime we're doing that I'm always 

608
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:07,061
like,
oh,

609
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,900
here we go.
I started going to karate up and around.

610
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,580
Really?
InsTead of going by the ocean,

611
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,720
I'd take the 2:10.

612
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,680
I go way the fuck out of my way.
It's like 30 miles longer.

613
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,420
Oh really?
It's way above.

614
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,810
But you cruise when you go away from the
ocean,

615
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:25,811
man,
that's when you can just fucking make 

616
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:25,811
some traffic.
Movement.

617
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:26,270
You can make some movement.
You can get some progress done.

618
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,210
If you go far away from the ocean,
you got to go away from the ocean and up

619
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:34,211
high,
but as soon as you close in on that 

620
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:35,440
ocean,
you get like five goes.

621
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,050
the,
the,

622
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,770
the,
the,

623
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,830
the like.
The five goes the direction of the 

624
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,110
ocean.
It's all along the shore.

625
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,720
I mean it's a couple miles in,
but it's along the shore.

626
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,800
It's You,
you're,

627
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,690
you're traveling the same way that the 
ocean goes and it's everybody going from

628
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:55,691
Mexico to California and san diego to 
California and every fucking weird town 

629
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:56,980
in between.
There's all,

630
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,500
there's just too many god damn people,
but If you could go up to the to 10,

631
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:03,650
you go up high,
get 57 north and go up high.

632
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,360
You can actually move all around it.
It's crazy.

633
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:07,060
Yeah,
there's ways around it now.

634
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,350
California's it's way,
way,

635
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:14,351
way,
way easier to get to where you need to 

636
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:14,351
go.
Then like saint New York,

637
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,370
if you're in New York and you're fucked,
if you're fucked,

638
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,820
like say if you're in the bronx and you 
need to get to manhattan,

639
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,850
you've got a couple of different bridges
you can take and they're both fucked up 

640
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,240
or you can go in on the 95,
you can do that and that's going to be 

641
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,240
fucked up too.
I said,

642
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,520
don't try.
Good luck.

643
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,630
Stupid.
yeah.

644
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,740
The city to get into manhattan is like.
I used to have an active case that they 

645
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,701
made me taking.
This lady was always mad because I was 

646
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:39,701
always like 20 minutes late and I'm 
like,

647
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:39,701
look,
I'm sorry,

648
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:43,890
but it took me two and a half hours to 
get all the time.

649
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,070
All the time coming from were coming 
from new rochelle,

650
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,920
which is like the bronx.
Two and a half hours is normal.

651
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,500
You would get on that highway.
It was one of those.

652
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,470
They built highway so stupid on the east
coast.

653
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:57,270
They didn't get it.
They didn't get it.

654
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,340
They didn't know there was gonna be that
many people there.

655
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,520
So these highlights are all like fucking
three lanes on each side.

656
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,550
Four lanes at the most.
They don't have these giant expansive 

657
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,090
four or five style eight,
nine lane highways.

658
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,650
They don't have them.
They're small,

659
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,240
especially boston,
like Massachusetts turnpike.

660
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,300
I go on the turnpike when I go back home
and I can't believe they call this a 

661
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,510
turnpike.
It's fucking two lanes on each side.

662
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,360
It's ridiculously small.
There's like,

663
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:27,000
it's such a small little ass shitbag 
road,

664
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,850
like the way to get to the cape just 
like my god.

665
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,850
It's a little tiny ass road.
They didn't anticipate that shit at all,

666
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,310
but that's not that long ago,
man.

667
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,490
Think about it.
The invention of the automobile was only

668
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,490
100 years ago.
Right.

669
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,170
A little bit more than that.
It's like the early,

670
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,230
early 1800 does that when it was.
When did Henry Ford.

671
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,470
No,
1900 excuses were always move right up 

672
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,370
to the roads immediately.
When did the automobile get invented?

673
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,590
Nineteen 41.
Yeah.

674
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,140
No,
no.

675
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,130
Holocaust automobile.
It's say the autocar was this 

676
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,960
motherfucker I needed.
Is there a car like an suv that gets 

677
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:14,001
super awesome gas mileage like a Korea 
or anything like that or running 

678
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:14,770
[inaudible],
author of god's knowledge,

679
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,400
like an suv type car,
yet have hybrids.

680
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,630
Three hybrids.
Wow.

681
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Sweat this.
The first fucking steam powered vehicle 

682
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,710
was designed by this dude who was a,
a flemish member of a jesuit mission in 

683
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:30,870
China in 16.

684
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,550
Seventy two.
Really?

685
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah.
It was a scale model for the chinese 

686
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:37,880
emperor.
Wow.

687
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,840
It wasn't even built a carrier driver or
a passenger,

688
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:42,270
but this guy figured that out in 16,
72.

689
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,080
That's fucking incredible.
And then in 1750 to some russian dude 

690
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,580
constructed a human pedaled,
four wheeled auto running carriage and 

691
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,041
propose to equip it with an odometer to 
use the same principle for making a 

692
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,130
cell.
Would it take,

693
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,110
once you sign that steam power model 
till you just fuck it,

694
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,860
put into practice in a real car?
Eight years today?

695
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,450
I dunno,
I have no idea.

696
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,150
But it wouldn't take it off.
It wouldn't.

697
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,890
It wouldn't take as many years as it 
went back.

698
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:12,840
Now back then you had to make somebody 
accountable.

699
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,510
Something similar.
You gotta make your own tools to work on

700
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:17,800
it.
You know about that.

701
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,890
Can't go to hechinger yeah.
You can't just fucking go out a 

702
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,010
business.
I forgot about that name.

703
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
A crazy with that.
But you would have to make a machine and

704
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:34,101
then make the parts and then make the 
fucking tools to work in the machine 

705
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:36,980
called blacks enough.
So apparently it was like they got it.

706
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,690
They got their shit together where,
you know,

707
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,500
it was like the,
uh,

708
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,120
the late 1800 seems

709
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,170
like they started really,
really rocking it.

710
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,570
Yeah,
I thought it was.

711
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:49,450
Um,
I thought that ford,

712
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,330
Henry Ford invented the car.

713
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,620
We're always taught the first class

714
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,390
manufacture because it says that Germany
was the first,

715
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,090
the first automobile powered by its own 
for stroke,

716
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,050
a cycle.
Gasoline engine was built in mannheim,

717
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:09,630
Germany in 18,
85.

718
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,840
Could you imagine how fucking weird it 
must have been,

719
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,960
like even thinking about other countries
that are on the other side of the ocean 

720
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:17,960
and 18,
85.

721
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,940
I mean when we think about Germany or we
think about eating england,

722
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:22,950
at least for me,
I've been there.

723
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,770
I've been to both of them a couple of 
times and when erica succeeded,

724
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,520
people in england were like,
I don't even know anyone who's even been

725
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,870
there.
I don't even know anyone who.

726
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,370
Nobody knew it because if you went 
there,

727
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:33,920
you never went back.
You know,

728
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,780
it takes too long.
It's months like how much does it take?

729
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,640
How long does iT take on a boat to get 
to America?

730
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,030
A long time.
Right now.

731
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,170
a lot of people for a week.
Right.

732
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,750
And a lot of people die along the way,
but that took a boat here.

733
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,020
Oh yeah.
My grandparents to my grandparents both 

734
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,290
came by boat snaking who did not know he
was.

735
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,860
It was a.
They let jews into.

736
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,250
They don't even need green cards.
If they come on in,

737
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,370
we need more juice.
Yeah.

738
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,720
But if you're an arab or a mexican,
they go,

739
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,060
hey,
In that room over here.

740
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,460
That's true.
You don't already doing more amazing 

741
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,460
racist.
But yes.

742
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,830
Are you really interested?
So found the jews are.

743
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,810
Brian said that with a um,
an unhappy tone.

744
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,660
Did you hear that?
Hold on.

745
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,040
I worry about.
I worry about little hurry.

746
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,380
What are you doing?
What's,

747
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:19,660
what are the next ones?
A jews.

748
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,680
Okay.
That's good.

749
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,420
That's goIng into those.
Yeah.

750
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,450
I went to a jewish market,
white people and generally easy to pick 

751
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:27,450
on.

752
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,400
You should go only after white people.
It's hard.

753
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,720
I thought for years of how to get your 
whites and I can't think of anything.

754
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,970
There's no angle Because i'm offended as
a race.

755
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,180
What are you talking about?
It would have to be an individual thing 

756
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180
like marriage,
your thoughts,

757
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,870
no flavor,
but how are you that won't,

758
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,160
that won't get them mad to say,
look at me pointing out that white 

759
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,270
people have little dicks.
So what you're sayIng,

760
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,480
what an angle to do for a sketch.
yeah,

761
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,750
let's throw it up on twitter,
man.

762
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,860
People will come up with an angle for 
you know,

763
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,490
but the thing is would have to make the 
magic of seeing it like,

764
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,520
like the klan makes black people imagine
the only way it's going to be Megan 

765
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,790
White people mad if you make black 
people move into the neighborhood and 

766
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:02,790
start partying.
Yeah.

767
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,570
That's what makes it.
That won't offend them as a race of 

768
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,570
white people and white people see that 
at home.

769
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,730
They won't get offended.
Right.

770
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,350
I see.
What you're saying is the people in that

771
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:13,351
neighBorhood will be upset.
You do racist shit around black people 

772
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:13,900
like were a kkk outfit and they want to 
beat your ass.

773
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,760
They're offended,
but you can't do this by the image.

774
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,110
They get upset about it.
Yeah,

775
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,330
it's true.
White people dominated,

776
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,720
unfortunately a lot of white people.
That was cool to say unfortunately,

777
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,610
but look,
if you want to look historically,

778
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,230
I'd way rather be on the team when.
Yeah aNd

779
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,650
yeah,
and as far as like giant groups of 

780
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:32,770
people that run shit.
What are the optIons?

781
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,300
Is white people,
black people,

782
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,210
asians and arabs,
right.

783
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:39,980
Those are the options of giant groups.
People that are running

784
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,580
shows.
Yeah,

785
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,890
right.
That's the those entire groups and if 

786
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,881
you look at all of them,
it seems like if America is the one 

787
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:52,091
that's run by the white people,
seems like you can get away with the 

788
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:54,461
most corporate crime,
but it seems like a pretty hard on the 

789
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:57,551
other kind of crime and China,
you get away with a lot of corporate 

790
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:57,590
crime,
bootleg stuff,

791
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,590
just a.
It's so easily because they're humaN.

792
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:03,560
Racist.
Camouflaged.

793
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,850
Did you hear what they did?
What?

794
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:05,200
They had

795
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,230
fake apple stores selling fake apple 
products and the employees and the 

796
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,060
people that were working there actually 
thought they were working for apple.

797
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:13,780
Wow.

798
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,240
They didn't learn one and it's actually 
not against the law for them to do that,

799
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:22,241
but they have to get the special permits
and only three of the stores are two of 

800
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:23,040
the stores actually had the permits.
The other ones didn't.

801
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,460
Isn't that hilarious?
Yeah,

802
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,650
but if you looked at that like it seems 
like China would be waste oppressive,

803
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,690
but then you got to look at it and go,
well yeah,

804
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,970
maybe it's because there's a billion 
fucking people over there,

805
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:36,971
man.
If you've got a copy of the fucking 

806
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:36,971
matrix.
Yeah,

807
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,670
I guess copy it and felt that people 
have got other shit to worry about when 

808
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,700
there's a billion fucking people and 
everybody's eating bugs.

809
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,410
There's no food.
No.

810
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,640
You go over to China,
man.

811
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,500
Eat bugs.
That's true.

812
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
He a lot of other things,
but they eat a lot of bugs.

813
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,680
It's real comment.
If it kimchi,

814
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,430
soya sauce,
third babies in bottles.

815
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,930
Really?
what?

816
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,100
No dairy.
I was like,

817
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,600
I love kimchi,
but it's so spicy.

818
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,540
I think it's funny how babies have taste
buds though for for certain shit.

819
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:10,541
Like my littlest baby,
the one that's only a year and three 

820
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:10,541
months,
she loves spicy shit,

821
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:10,541
chilling.

822
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,560
She grabs pepperoni and I'm looking and 
I'm like,

823
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,580
oh,
she's going to hate this.

824
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,940
I can be more like.
She got some hot sauce the other daY and

825
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:17,990
loved it.
Which one?

826
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,190
The little one.
She doesn't.

827
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,270
Don't have the burden buds yet.
He says it wasn't real hot.

828
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,080
It was like tomatillo,
but it was.

829
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,030
It was a little piece of chicken and she
fucking duggin man.

830
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,770
Wow.
Trainer now.

831
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,560
Spicy garlic sauce.
It was a.

832
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,480
It was like a really garlicky sauce.
She was licking it up.

833
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:36,830
She liked it.
It's weird.

834
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,630
Right?
But the other one man,

835
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:39,820
fuck,
you can't give her anything.

836
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,350
She just start crying.
Supervisees by z,

837
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:47,351
like mild ass.
Indian food's super mile and she'll 

838
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:47,880
start crying.
I made my grandfather's pickle recipe.

839
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,260
We did it again.
Me and taylor didn't pick it.

840
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,700
I didn't put it in five times as much 
through salt by accident,

841
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,530
but five times too much.
We have,

842
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:56,640
when we made them,
I put two cups instead of like,

843
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,110
like two pinches it.
We like something ridiculous now.

844
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,990
But I still try to eat those pickles.
I'm like,

845
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:05,991
I made.
I'm not going to give him a go at this 

846
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:05,991
time.
It came out right there.

847
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:09,191
So good.
And they're so spice that you got to 

848
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:09,191
sweat under the eyes.
Really?

849
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:09,191
Yeah.
It's so good.

850
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:09,191
But it's.
Oh,

851
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,260
I was wondering was it wrong?
And we would eat one because we spent 

852
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,320
like,
what a month doing this shit.

853
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,700
Leave my son and then we're good.
Uh,

854
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,250
my favorIte all time hot sauce is l you 
could deca shit.

855
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,140
The mexican hot sauce had that griddle.
The green habanero.

856
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,210
That's good.
It's so good.

857
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,510
I forgot how good it was until we 
started doing fear factor again because 

858
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,510
the caterers always have.
Oh yeah.

859
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,010
And the caterers had something I threw 
on some connie side of

860
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,580
the other day.
I'm like,

861
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,290
damn,
this is good.

862
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,710
It's just so flavorful and powerful.
But that's like the real legitimate 

863
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,830
mexican shit.
Got to spanish label.

864
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,040
That's the real shit.
You can get to like thirty cents a 

865
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,040
bottle.
Yeah.

866
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,270
It's amazing how many different cultures
have just like so much different flavor 

867
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,420
to their foods.
You know,

868
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,900
like mexican food,
so I was like,

869
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:58,330
we,
we,

870
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,530
you know,
there's a certain style of laboring and 

871
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:03,530
eating.
Yeah,

872
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,640
spicy as fuck.
Some of their salsa is incredible.

873
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,540
And then,
You know,

874
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:10,320
you look at like irish food,
it's like boiled potatoes,

875
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:11,850
boiled corn,
beef,

876
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,630
boiled sauerkraut.
That's why the italians have via with a 

877
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:17,630
lot of,
it was a result of like,

878
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,890
um,
industries and stuff.

879
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:19,890
LIke with allianz,
rural,

880
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,990
poor [inaudible],
they just made pasta.

881
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:26,991
It's the cheapest,
easiest stuff to make them and fills 

882
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:26,991
your stomach and they just may shape it 
differently.

883
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:28,800
That's the only variety you get.
As my shaping it slightly differently.

884
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,370
It is really amazing when you think 
about how the food defines how people 

885
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,631
behave to connected to how you feel like
they behave like italians are all about 

886
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:42,740
passion and their food is very 
passionate and rich and delicious and 

887
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,251
flavorful.
But then you go to the irish and the 

888
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,220
ever say anything to bear and they're 
just watering themselves down with beer 

889
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,490
and smoking cigarettes.
How ugly the women are.

890
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,090
Like,
hey,

891
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,240
my mimo irish people listen to this 
podcast talking about,

892
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,180
okay,
I'm ugly too.

893
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,470
Were all ugly but a passionate to mike.
Northern Ireland is the craziest place 

894
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,570
I've ever been where you drive around 
and it was fighting.

895
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,640
Well,
there's a lot of fighting in Ireland.

896
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,690
I saw a lot of fighting,
but one of the things in northern 

897
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:10,690
Ireland,
it was really crazy,

898
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,210
is that all the car,
the cars are armored.

899
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,600
They all have these giant plates of 
steel all around because they had to 

900
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:17,640
deal with a lot of bombings.
Will ira thing,

901
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:20,350
the protestants versus the catholics.
It was like there has been a,

902
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,870
most people in America are unaware of 
how much Ireland in northern Ireland,

903
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,340
how much they went through,
you know,

904
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:30,030
there was a incredible amount of 
bloodshed over there.

905
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,340
And because of that,
like when we went out,

906
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,430
um,
I did a gig with my boy dave bishop,

907
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:40,431
and then we went out and we went into 
some fucking local place and the cars 

908
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:44,490
that were all around us,
it was like we were in a fucking mad max

909
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,220
movie.
They're all like old old cars.

910
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,150
No,
they're all covered with steel.

911
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,560
Like their,
their armored,

912
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,800
like they have guns,
the windows for bombs.

913
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,820
And the windows of the cop cars had 
steel mesh over them and it was like 

914
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,760
plates and plates in the front of the 
car and plates on the side.

915
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,200
They were like these big armored fucking
crazy shelves over there,

916
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,190
cop cars.
I was like,

917
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,770
wow,
what a fucking weird places.

918
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,910
And you couldn't understand a god damn 
word anybody said it's amazing that they

919
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:14,970
call that shit english.
I talked to some dude in a club.

920
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,180
We were in the bar downstairs at the 
hotel we were all staying at and we were

921
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:25,461
all drinking with this dude and he was 
talking to me for two hours and all I 

922
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:26,280
heard at a whole,
the whole two hours.

923
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:31,100
The only words I heard was I didn't 
fight any mind talking to me about bias.

924
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,390
There's rockland chocolate down.
I'll tell you right now.

925
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,100
How's.
Hi tiny tiny man.

926
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,240
Just drinking and talking about how to 
fight anyway.

927
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,890
He really would.
He would have fought anyone,

928
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,900
anyone in front of it.
It was just got his ass.

929
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:44,410
How the fuck?

930
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,030
Come on,
let's turn handed to him.

931
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,300
He'll bite You and fucking tried closer.
Call your eyes out.

932
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,760
So dreary over there,
man.

933
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,460
I've never eaten at a place that had 
worst food.

934
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,550
Northern Ireland,
we had chinese food there that was like,

935
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,180
it was literallY like dogs and cats and 
pigeons.

936
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,210
Who was fucking terrible.
Was it porridge good?

937
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,810
At least it was there anything that was 
good.

938
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,610
You can't fuck up eggs.
So I had a lot of eggs there,

939
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,880
but it was,
I mean it could obviously be just where 

940
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,280
I went,
but the parts that I went,

941
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,740
you know,
I got the worst food ever and we stay at

942
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,630
a nice hotel.
Food Is terrible.

943
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,080
No.
Wow.

944
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,920
Yeah.
They just like,

945
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,440
it was off like you're eating the beef 
and you're like,

946
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,770
what the fuck is wrong with his beef 
tastes?

947
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,500
This is a piece of steak,
but it tastes like completely different.

948
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Like in Australia,
their beef is completely different than 

949
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,560
american beef and it's good.
It's very good.

950
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,150
Don't get me wrong.
Australia's fantastic.

951
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:38,950
Sydney.
I've been to sydney twice.

952
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,750
It's amazing.
No,

953
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,820
because I've had free range to.
I eat grass fed beef.

954
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:44,440
That's what most of the time I ain't,
I,

955
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,490
I like corn fed because it's fattier.
And you get a little bit more fat in the

956
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:51,910
cooking,
but this is a flavor to grass fed that I

957
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:56,911
prefer and it's a healthier animal for 
sure because when you're giving them 

958
00:39:56,911 --> 00:40:00,370
corn that is completely outside of their
diet and in the natural world,

959
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:05,371
it's a grain as opposed to a grass so 
their bodies get super fat and 

960
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,760
disgusting.
That's why they're so delicious.

961
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,940
That grain fed grass fed meat is 
actually fat burner really.

962
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,290
Does that makes sense?
The opposite effect on your system makes

963
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:16,570
sense.

964
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,050
Because we're not supposed to be eating 
an animal that's been forced,

965
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,370
fed some fucked up food to keep it fat.
You know,

966
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,380
that's a weird thing man.
But the difference is,

967
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,120
you know,
the food over in Australia,

968
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,730
like the beef was delicious.
The steak was delicious,

969
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,740
but it was like pink inside.
It was like a piece of pork chop.

970
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,930
It was a completely different shade.
Yeah,

971
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,770
it was a way lighter shade because like 
when I get a medium rare steak,

972
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:45,670
you cut into it and you see that juicy 
red fucking savage flashing.

973
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,670
But meanwhile this was like a pork chop.
I was like,

974
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:50,620
this is like white in there.
It was very good,

975
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,120
but it was like,
this is weird.

976
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,380
You know,
england,

977
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,410
it looked like steak.
It looks similar when I was cutting it 

978
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,900
open,
but it tasted different.

979
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,390
It tasted like,
like,

980
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,840
like it was sick or something.

981
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,250
I just don't put any spice in or 
something.

982
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,170
None in england.
Excuse me.

983
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,870
Northern Ireland.
Um,

984
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I've had some great food in england.
people say that the food in england is 

985
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,041
bad,
but it's nothing compared to northern 

986
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,041
Ireland.
I've had some delicious restaurants that

987
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,710
are going on in england's got some great
places.

988
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:15,550
It's just,
you know,

989
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,920
when you go to a place is different.
Yeah.

990
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,720
You know,
like when you go get breakfast,

991
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,550
like english breakfast,
you get an english breakfast,

992
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,920
they bring you beans.
Crumpets?

993
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,480
Yes.
Awesome.

994
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,570
They're pretty good.
But english breakfast they give you 

995
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,791
beans and and they call bangers bangers 
or sausage and like a broiled tomato all

996
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,500
the time.
It's always,

997
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,120
I don't get that roiling the tomato,
but it's super common.

998
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,240
Falling apart is that they're good.
Zenko falls apart a little.

999
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:45,470
It's just,
it's a little cooked,

1000
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,800
but I don't get it.
I don't know what.

1001
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,130
Just give me a piece of fucking tomato,
tomato.

1002
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,410
Do you have to improve the flavor of 
tomato by cooking it?

1003
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,370
I wonder if that's something I started 
making zucchini.

1004
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,740
If you grilled zucchini,
it tastes kinda cool.

1005
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,790
You know,
tastes different.

1006
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,160
have you grilled tomatoes.
So just not better,

1007
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,840
you know,
I don't know.

1008
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,710
I don't know either.

1009
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,500
I've met a scottish comic,
it was like a 23 in montreal.

1010
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,290
You couldn't understand a word he said 
possible.

1011
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,320
It was like people were trying,
like laughing at the idea of his accent 

1012
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,140
and then it was just like,
we don't understand any of this and it's

1013
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:21,950
all english.
It was amazing to watch.

1014
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,500
Yeah.
It's um,

1015
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,420
it's interesting that the english 
language has,

1016
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
if you,
you go to all these different parts of 

1017
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:30,760
the globe.
Yeah.

1018
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,080
And hear the variations from like 
southern Georgia to northern Ireland,

1019
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,290
you know,
and you hear the variations of the same 

1020
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:40,290
words and what,
you know,

1021
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,950
what they,
what we use and don't use may really is 

1022
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:43,950
almost like,
it's a bunch of different languages.

1023
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,871
Like it's getting close,
it's getting close to like morphing off 

1024
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:50,470
into its own separate branch if,
if people are separate.

1025
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,900
The thing that fucked everything changed
separately.

1026
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,800
Yeah.
But they're,

1027
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,500
they're connected now.
You know,

1028
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,590
now it's like people are inexorably 
connected with the internet,

1029
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:01,600
with mass media.
You,

1030
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,650
you can hear the way people use those 
words all over the world and they're 

1031
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,411
going to stay.
They're going to stay reasonably close 

1032
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:10,411
to the way they are now.
But if they weren't,

1033
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:11,720
if people weren't connected,
you know,

1034
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,240
there were separated if buy big chunks 
of water or something like that.

1035
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:16,880
Yeah,
they're there.

1036
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,240
They would probably develop to a bunch 
of different languages.

1037
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:19,410
Yeah.

1038
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,460
Probably over time.
Because you think it's a scottish ever 

1039
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:25,460
read?
Um,

1040
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,050
a transporting?
Yes.

1041
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,620
Written in.
Oh really?

1042
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,470
You know,
it's written in vernacular.

1043
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,270
It's like you have to like piece 
together what they're saying.

1044
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,990
It's like eventually that would sort of 
become the written language and then 

1045
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:37,810
eventually certain words that you have 
completely different words like the lift

1046
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:42,870
in england for the elevator.
He would just start using those words 

1047
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,660
and it become a different language 
though with our numerals or something.

1048
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,920
Some guy was,
uh,

1049
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,990
there was some,
some guy was on the radio the other day 

1050
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,191
and he was talking about how diverse the
england is and how many different 

1051
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,450
languages are spoken in england.
[inaudible].

1052
00:43:52,451 --> 00:43:57,451
We were talking about the riots and they
were talking about 300 different 

1053
00:43:57,451 --> 00:43:57,451
languages.
And I went,

1054
00:43:57,451 --> 00:43:57,520
what,
three?

1055
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,020
I didn't even know there were 300 
languages.

1056
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:05,470
How many?
I thought there was probably like 30 

1057
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:05,470
languages.
There's like a bunch of indians,

1058
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,870
much different indian languages.
Me and american indian or India,

1059
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:09,740
India.
Really?

1060
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,860
I think there's like a bunch,
like 30 or 40 minutes.

1061
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,890
Jesus christ.
Some of those you might be able to 

1062
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:16,890
understand,
like if you know,

1063
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,840
you might be able to send a couple of 
others like spanish and italian because 

1064
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:19,840
a lot of.
Well how wacky is China?

1065
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,280
There's a bunch all in the same country.
A bunch of different ways to talk 

1066
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,280
chinese.
I thought it's just too.

1067
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,920
I thought it was cantonese and mandarin,
but isn't there various dialects of each

1068
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:30,770
one of them?
We are little areas is so pure,

1069
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,800
so person who speaks cantonese can 
understand a person who speaks mandarin 

1070
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:35,800
at all or that's a completely different 
language,

1071
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,660
but I don't.
Fuck.

1072
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,030
That's insane.
Well,

1073
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,850
who the fuck came up with language 
first?

1074
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,570
We know what the oldest language was.

1075
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,150
Mm,

1076
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,810
no,
no.

1077
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
We know about written.
We know the oldest written shit as far 

1078
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,970
as we know today is assumer.
They,

1079
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:56,160
they,
they think it's the sumerian texts.

1080
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,890
6,000
best.

1081
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,460
The oldest shit we've ever seen written 
down.

1082
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:04,461
But what throws that into fucked up 
makes it mexican questionables this new 

1083
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:06,120
thing they found in Turkey over the last
couple of decades,

1084
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,360
they fund this new site and target 
called go becky tapley and go go 

1085
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,670
beckley,
tempe.

1086
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,850
And it's um,
at least 6,000

1087
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:19,851
years older than summer.
And it's all like really intricately 

1088
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:21,600
carved.
And you know,

1089
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:26,601
there's a,
there's a language that we don't know 

1090
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:26,601
though.
That's the thing.

1091
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:26,670
This is 6,000
years earlier,

1092
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,400
but they didn't find any language.
They just followed that survived.

1093
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,480
Well,
who knows,

1094
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,180
you know,
it's like when you find a culture that's

1095
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,320
that fucking old,
you're lucky you're finding anything.

1096
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,810
You know the,
the land eats everything.

1097
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,290
If you left a car alone for 16,000
years,

1098
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,020
there's no car left when you come back 
to sand.

1099
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,640
Yeah,
it'll give.

1100
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:48,740
It'll get absorbed by the earth.
Slowly but surely one little speck at a 

1101
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:48,740
time.
I mean,

1102
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,630
if you've ever gone to an old junkyard 
and you see a car from like 1940,

1103
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,420
literally it's falling apart,
there's holes in it,

1104
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,440
it's dissolve,
it'll dissolve the earth.

1105
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:01,840
What you did for the,
the metal just goes back into the ground

1106
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:04,080
and metal just becomes,
it becomes dirt,

1107
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,270
becomes a part of the soil.
You know,

1108
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:08,220
when we look at a culture that's that 
old,

1109
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,740
you know,
you only find rock.

1110
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,820
You're not gonna find anything else.
You might find some carbon from a fire,

1111
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,970
you know,
you might find some arrowheads and shit 

1112
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:19,970
like that,
but it's got to be hard,

1113
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,690
hard rock or fossils,
you know,

1114
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:24,150
you're going to find like bodies,
like human bodies,

1115
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:25,890
you know,
semi fossilized state.

1116
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,740
This is too long ago.
You're noT gonna find any paper.

1117
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:30,090
If they made paper,
good luck.

1118
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:35,091
You won't find it.
You're not going to find any metal 

1119
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:35,091
tools.
Those are gone.

1120
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:35,120
The earth ate those.

1121
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200
I thought it was something that was 
really big the other day about one of 

1122
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,200
your theories about,
you know,

1123
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,140
how civilization started over type 
thing.

1124
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,000
Uh,
I met that robot,

1125
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,550
I've not met him,
but I saw that robot at disneyland,

1126
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:47,500
the honda robot,
the how,

1127
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,840
but I got to see it run and do the stair
thing and I'm looking at it and I'm 

1128
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,660
like,
one day this thing is going to kill me,

1129
00:46:55,661 --> 00:46:56,530
you know,
and stuff like that,

1130
00:46:56,531 --> 00:47:01,531
you know,
they're going to make robots that and 

1131
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:01,531
it's going to turn on you and stuff like
that.

1132
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,010
And what if like the robots kill the 
whole entire human race and then,

1133
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:08,011
you know,
like a virus or something like that 

1134
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:08,011
destroys all the robots and kills all 
the robots.

1135
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:09,370
And in a thousand years later,
there's nothing,

1136
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,390
all the,
you know,

1137
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,510
robots turned the sand because they 
disintegrate.

1138
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,280
And then there's two people like humans,
like hiding in a cave somewhere,

1139
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:23,281
you know,
living or the dead bodies and he's 

1140
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:25,560
smoking crack and then they make a kid 
and they're like jesus and stuff like 

1141
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:25,780
that.
And they build the whole race again.

1142
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:30,870
But they're so fucked up on crap.
It's stupid because they were like just 

1143
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,500
living a cave the whole time that uh,
then the human race starts over again,

1144
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:37,650
we.
And then we try to build robots again 

1145
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:37,870
and then they kill us off again.
And crack addicts and the caves.

1146
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,300
That's what I was thinking,
that disneyland,

1147
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,080
that's the entire

1148
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,140
plot of battlestar galactica.
The cylons take over its end.

1149
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:48,480
You know what?
It's a very possible plot.

1150
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,750
The idea that we can make intelligent 
life and we're super close to doing 

1151
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,410
that.
We're super close to having some sort of

1152
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:00,710
an artificial intelligence that you can 
communicate with that actually even 

1153
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,011
developed some motions they're going to 
have like an emotional response is 

1154
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:04,950
programmed into these fucking things and
to,

1155
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,070
for us to be arrogantly assuming that 
that's never going to be a problem 

1156
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,920
because they're not really live there.
Not really,

1157
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,420
but if we create a system that responds 
as if it was alive,

1158
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,420
you know,
if that system has self realization,

1159
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,440
now that system become sentience and 
realizes it has to protect itself and 

1160
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,780
then it defends itself against another 
system that is just as alive as a virus.

1161
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:30,750
It's just as alive as an animal that 
wants to eat you.

1162
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,330
It's just as alive as anything that's a 
live band.

1163
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,340
You've created something that exists 
right now.

1164
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,490
Yes,
it may not have cells in bone as you 

1165
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,911
think of life,
but it's responding and moving and 

1166
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:45,840
interacting and it's intelligent and 
you've actually made this fucking thing,

1167
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,610
a brain.
You've built this thing,

1168
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:49,650
the ability to interact with other 
brains,

1169
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:54,651
other technologically created brains,
and you've got a whole network of 

1170
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:59,271
beings,
beings that have it within their best 

1171
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:01,500
interest to keep you dead and I'm alive.
That's all super duper possible.

1172
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,740
It just seems so foreign to us.
It seems preposterous because our lives,

1173
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:11,991
our whole lives.
The way we have looked at machines is 

1174
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:11,991
like,
this is some shit people made.

1175
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,620
We have full control of it.
We have full.

1176
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,300
We're,
we're out.

1177
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:19,370
We're completely arrogant about it.
We have full control over the stuff we 

1178
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:19,370
make.

1179
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,380
Have you ever seen that robot run as it 
leaves the ground for us?

1180
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,810
Just like a human.
When you run,

1181
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:29,811
you actually there's a point where 
you're both of your feet are off the 

1182
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:29,811
ground.
It does the same thing.

1183
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:30,420
It was.
It was amazing.

1184
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,420
It's amazing and it's just the 
beginning.

1185
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,280
It's just the beginning.
It's like I,

1186
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:36,050
robot I,
robot is going to be legit,

1187
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:41,051
man.
They're really going to have a robot 

1188
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:41,390
that as is as functional as a human 
body.

1189
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:46,391
It's gonna move like a human body,
but it's going to be metal and 

1190
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:46,391
replaceable and you know,
it's gonna.

1191
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:49,130
It's gonna have artificial tissue that 
won't break or rip or tear,

1192
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,890
but it'll look like human tissue.
It's going to be incredible.

1193
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:57,010
It's just a matter of time.
If you look at 1800 and what people had 

1194
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:01,931
in 1980 and 1900 and the beginning of 
this century in 2000 and then compare it

1195
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:03,480
to,
you know,

1196
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,260
a thousand years ago,
you know,

1197
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,220
there's obviously been some radical 
changes in 1900 to 2000 to 2011.

1198
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,880
There's radical radical changes and 
those radical changes.

1199
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:18,881
You took the,
the cream of the crop shit that we have 

1200
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:18,930
today,
like a fucking helicopter and uh,

1201
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,220
uh,
nine slash 11 turbo and you brought them

1202
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,550
to 1600.

1203
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,330
There's no way of leonardo davinci sat 
and looked at that.

1204
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:28,280
He could have ever a nine slash 11 
turbo.

1205
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,840
He would get in that thing.
it'd be like,

1206
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,880
what the fuck?
Like wow.

1207
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:36,881
Really this is fucking crazy.
Like think of someone who like davinci 

1208
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,480
invented so many crazy things,
you know,

1209
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:43,481
is had pat drawings for flying machines 
and all sorts of different things that 

1210
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:47,471
he created.
But if you showed him what actually 

1211
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:48,440
occurred in our lifetime,
which we completely take for granted,

1212
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:51,860
going towards it,
it's like space 1999 shit.

1213
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:53,240
It's like,
it's like science fiction.

1214
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,480
So for sure,
if these guys are making robots like 

1215
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,670
this honda robot,
which is amazing,

1216
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,200
in 2011,
2000,

1217
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,070
211,
fuck man,

1218
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:08,300
it is going to be like blade runner as 
long as I'm the you might not be dead.

1219
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,050
That's the crazy thing with the science 
and technology the way it is today,

1220
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,340
you might not be dead at all.

1221
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,870
There might be a renewed pill where you 
can take within our lifetime that renews

1222
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:21,770
your cells and reprograms your dna to 
behave as if it's young.

1223
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,800
They don't.
They're going to watch someone have a 

1224
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:26,800
vaccine for aging at some point so they 
haven't had it.

1225
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,281
You have to take it.
We're not really babies and people 

1226
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:31,281
haven't got the vaccine.
Are all gonna die.

1227
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:33,620
Maybe that's a possibility.
It locks them all go.

1228
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,040
More likely they'll manipulate the fact 
that the cells recreate themselves every

1229
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:42,041
seven years.
Everything except the neurons is 

1230
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,681
completely replaced every seven years.
So what they'll do is they'll reprogram 

1231
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:49,001
all these,
all these cells to come back fresh and 

1232
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:52,421
young and that's what they'll do.
So over a seven year period and you'll 

1233
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:55,541
take this shit and over seven year 
period you'll go from being some old 

1234
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,990
lady to some hot young 20 year old bitch
him or if he just.

1235
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,160
That'd be cool if he or if he just 
didn't get older,

1236
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,280
you know,
like whatever time you took that 

1237
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,470
probably because I doubt you're going to
be the beginning.

1238
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,640
Oh it will.
It will.

1239
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,960
No,
no question about it.

1240
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:10,310
If you will.
Just think what I said,

1241
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,320
if you're a tissue could recreate 
itself.

1242
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,350
The thing is you got to get it to 
recreate itself in a state that's not 

1243
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:17,350
damaged like scars.
Right.

1244
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,230
I'll give you think about if you have a 
scar.

1245
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,670
That scar.
I have a scar,

1246
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:22,190
a big one on my finger that I got when I
was like nine.

1247
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,800
So that.
But that scar is still here when I'm 44.

1248
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,320
Why is it still here?
Why is it still here?

1249
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:30,380
If everything's recreating because it's 
recreating in damaged state.

1250
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,820
When you would have to get your,
your cells to not recreate in a state of

1251
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,460
an old person who's,
you know,

1252
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,630
fucking engines misfiring.

1253
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,400
You want to get into a mature person of 
around 25 years of age.

1254
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,540
Physically,
that's what you want.

1255
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:49,541
I think it's more like they're just 
going to take your head off robocop 

1256
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,860
style and put you on a robocop body and 
then you're going to find a way to like 

1257
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,210
highs your brain.
Oh your shit,

1258
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,070
and I don't think it will be a 
biological solution of against to that.

1259
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:00,071
I think it'll be a matter of recreating 
your consciousness in a form of like a 

1260
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:00,520
computer code.
You know,

1261
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:02,690
if,
if an operating system works for the mac

1262
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:04,810
and operating system works for the pc,
what?

1263
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,080
What the fuck is a human being?
What do you know?

1264
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:12,090
What?
What is the driving mechanism behind 

1265
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:16,360
what makes a person want to eat and fuck
and and be successful and be curious and

1266
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
what it.
What the fuck is under the surface?

1267
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,910
Is it just a bunch of ones and zeros,
and if it's not,

1268
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,300
is it possible to exactly it with a 
bunch of ones and zeros?

1269
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,420
That's the real question.
Is it possible to take a human being's 

1270
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,481
consciousness and completely recreated 
to the point where all of a sudden 

1271
00:53:35,481 --> 00:53:38,280
you're switched on and you know you're 
switched on in,

1272
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:43,281
in this body,
like you wake up one day and you don't 

1273
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:45,921
even fucking know that you are a 
computer code and a machine and that 

1274
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:49,470
your entire life is absolutely,
completely 100 percent artificial.

1275
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,130
It's just being fed to thIs computer 
code through this,

1276
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:55,020
you know,
this program that someone has created.

1277
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,640
That's,
that is all,

1278
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,110
that's not like completely ridiculous.
that's not like is even as ridiculous as

1279
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,420
time travel and that's not ridiculous.
You know,

1280
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,750
I mean the elder,
there's some scientists that believe 

1281
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:08,750
that you can never bypass the speed of 
light,

1282
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,820
so time travel will be impossible,
but I think they just say that for now.

1283
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,940
I think there's,
there's nothIng that's going to 

1284
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,131
eventually not be possible.
I think It'll just be a matter of how 

1285
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,401
much power can read we generate in order
to manipulate our surroundings to make 

1286
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:23,730
everything possible.
It's a matter of time.

1287
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:24,600
It,
like I said,

1288
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:27,240
you know what's impossible today was 
not.

1289
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,680
I mean,
what,

1290
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,420
what was impossible 200 years ago is not
impossible today,

1291
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,000
so when you hear scientists saying that 
this is impossible,

1292
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:36,330
that doesn't mean it's impossible.
It just means as far as what we know now

1293
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:38,460
and we don't know shit,
you know,

1294
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:41,250
we know a lot.
I mean we're brilliant and comparison to

1295
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:46,251
caveman,
but in comparison to understanding just 

1296
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:46,310
the very nature of the universe and when
you,

1297
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:51,330
you know,
subatomic particles and they lose all 

1298
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,520
fucking rules,
go out the window when you go subatomic,

1299
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,010
you know,
they have things called we're a particle

1300
00:54:56,011 --> 00:55:01,011
can be in a,
in a super state where it's in a state 

1301
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:01,980
of moving and it's still at the same 
time.

1302
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:07,550
What the fuck does that even mean?
And the idea that you can look at 

1303
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,421
something and as you're looking at it,
you change the behavior of it and then 

1304
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:16,101
you can watch an event and the observer 
actually changes the actual atoms that 

1305
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,280
are,
that are,

1306
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,220
that are moving in the fuck.
How is that possible?

1307
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,720
We don't know.
We don't know.

1308
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,500
so to say that people know a lot and we 
know a lot for people,

1309
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,800
we know a lot for people,
but there's some shit that we don't 

1310
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,501
understand at all.
They don't even know why the 

1311
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:35,751
universities together.
They don't know why it doesn't just fly 

1312
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:35,751
apart.
You know,

1313
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:36,900
this dark matter thing is like they 
don't.

1314
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,940
They don't know what the fuck that is.
That's just guessing.

1315
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:41,440
It's probably just with vinegar or 
something like that.

1316
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,910
They've realized it is probably douche 
vinegar.

1317
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,140
You know what they figured out?

1318
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,140
They figured out that there's some sort 
of an anti matter like layer to the van 

1319
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,761
allen radiation belts,
that there's a layer of anti-matter out 

1320
00:55:55,761 --> 00:56:00,081
there.
I don't even know what the fuck that 

1321
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:00,300
means,
but that's incredible that there's some,

1322
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,630
some shit that they've been talking 
about using for weapons forever.

1323
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,690
They've been talking about anti-matter 
weapons forever because if you could 

1324
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:09,360
conceivably create an anti weapon 
anti-matter weapon,

1325
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:13,580
it would be just as big of a leap as 
nuclear weapons were two arrows.

1326
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,660
Yeah.
Things just fucking go.

1327
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,840
Bye bye.
Just cool to imagine.

1328
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,740
Imagine if we went to Afghanistan,
if they tried anti-matter weapons on 

1329
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,760
Afghanistan and we went there in 
Afghanistan was like a bowl,

1330
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:32,850
a ceramic bowl like white and shiny,
and there was literally nothing else 

1331
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:34,780
there.
It was like the whole thing,

1332
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:39,781
which is white and shiny like ceramic.
That's not outside the realm of 

1333
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:41,830
possibility because we were like,
we already.

1334
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,610
Yeah,
yeah,

1335
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:44,290
we did that.
Everyone is.

1336
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:47,260
When I realized that I talked to tony,
but it was like everyone's like,

1337
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:48,730
oh,
we can't trust the russians with nuclear

1338
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,080
weapons.
We can't trust the chinese.

1339
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:55,450
The koreans.
It's like we're the only ones that have 

1340
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:55,450
set.
Set them off.

1341
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:55,630
We're the only ones that we did it 
twice.

1342
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,810
Oh no.
Russians have detonated them for 

1343
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:00,810
practice against people.
Yeah.

1344
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:01,930
We're the only ones that people and 
we're like,

1345
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:02,790
oh,
we can't trust them with them.

1346
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:07,791
We can't trust us.
We're the ones who can trust as us and 

1347
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,880
where these are people that existed a 
long time ago.

1348
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,020
I mean,
the idea that we're at with those douche

1349
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:14,180
bags,
I do shit.

1350
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,910
They didn't just blow up zillions.
the.

1351
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:20,970
The word is that the japanese were 
trying to surrender for a long time and 

1352
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,430
he said no because he wanted to test it.

1353
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,500
Well,
they wanted to fucking do it.

1354
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,920
It was not really a task.
They wanted a letter by.

1355
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,340
No,
it's up twice.

1356
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,520
Drop bombs and car alarms.
The idea that you're going to take this 

1357
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:38,500
fucking thing that harnesses the power 
of the sun and you're just gonna drop it

1358
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:40,090
on.
Some people you don't even know and it's

1359
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,120
okay because we're at war.
This is like,

1360
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,500
it's not a.
These are soldiers.

1361
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,810
These are just some people going about 
their business.

1362
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:51,811
Yeah.
People are politics and then all of a 

1363
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:52,300
sudden they're just.
They're obliterated.

1364
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:55,270
They never were any crazy.
Didn't even know jet engines back there.

1365
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,680
They did their propeller plane

1366
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:03,890
and they dropped it out of this 
propeller plane and then had to do a 

1367
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:04,470
three 60 or one eight.
8 million fucking get out of there.

1368
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,800
Is that what they are?
Do follow like physics bumped follows?

1369
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:13,060
Which?
The planning how high up when they let 

1370
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,060
it go?
I don't know.

1371
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,530
It's amazing.
They have video footage of that,

1372
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,340
of them doing it.
They must've got fucked up by radiation.

1373
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:18,420
No,
probably right.

1374
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,060
Probably hit it.
Fucking went to so many people that got 

1375
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,060
fucked up by radiation.
How long did,

1376
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,240
how long those guys lived?
It's a good question.

1377
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,490
Well,
they,

1378
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:27,450
you know the.
You've seen,

1379
00:58:27,451 --> 00:58:28,950
we've talked about.
I talk about it on stage,

1380
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:33,951
the videos of guys running towards the 
blast and the army where they used to 

1381
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:36,330
blow off bombs and have them run towards
the bomb.

1382
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,220
They did that a lot,
you know,

1383
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:40,770
and obviously that would never happen 
today.

1384
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:45,950
Have you tried to get an american 
soldier today to run towards a blast to 

1385
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,850
shoot you in the dick or.
Yeah,

1386
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,000
he's like,
what?

1387
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,230
No one's come out of there,
man.

1388
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,610
I'm going to run towards effort test.
We know now the average person knows 

1389
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:55,610
that shit will kill you.

1390
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,830
OfficEr kerr dashi and I want you to run
past that.

1391
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:03,670
I watched the kim kardashians 
commercials showing some clothes that 

1392
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,910
she had and she was talking about how 
she likes this look and likes that look,

1393
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:07,300
and sometimes they wear this and I wear 
it with a dress because it.

1394
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:12,460
I wear it with a jacket because it makes
it a little bit more saucy yet and I'm 

1395
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:12,860
like,
wow,

1396
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,730
who's the wise?
Anyone?

1397
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,030
Thank you.
vapid.

1398
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,020
It's amazing how many people sponsor her
or how many to credit her face is on.

1399
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,290
if you walked through jc penny's or 
macy's or whatever it is,

1400
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:29,291
you'll see her face a million times for 
a million different products and 

1401
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:29,291
magazines,
right?

1402
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:29,291
Yeah.

1403
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,200
Every fucking magazine has her face on 
the cover.

1404
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:32,180
It's incredible.
The girls making bank,

1405
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,460
you can't hate her for that.
You can't hate it for any of it.

1406
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:35,840
I don't hate her.
she's just so dumb.

1407
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,810
It's so amazing that we have fixated on 
this and you know,

1408
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,260
she has a very pretty face.
Don't get me wrong,

1409
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,380
but it's always getting worked on like 
every now and then it'll get all puffy 

1410
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,741
and shit because she's getting 
injections and there's all these before 

1411
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:50,741
and after pictures.
It does look good,

1412
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:52,220
but it's,
you know what I'm saying?

1413
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,520
It's like there's certain girls that 
just looked like,

1414
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:59,720
like angelina jolie,
she has this face where like,

1415
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,480
especially when she was young,
like you just look at eagle.

1416
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,390
Wow.
That is a perfect symmetrical face.

1417
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,810
Like I can understand that face being 
everywhere and this girl,

1418
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:10,480
kim kardashians,
she's pretty and she's,

1419
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:15,550
she's hot,
she's got some big titties and ass and 

1420
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:15,550
everything.

1421
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,250
It's all good,
but it's not good enough to be focusing 

1422
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:18,590
so much time on it.
It's not that.

1423
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:21,860
It's like people are addicted to her.
It's like it's cigarettes,

1424
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,660
so cigarettes aren't that good.
you know,

1425
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,750
you smoke one in the beginning we've 
never smoked a cigarette,

1426
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,770
like why would I keep doing this?
But after awhile you get addicted to it 

1427
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,731
and it becomes something you're used to.
Now it's like these magazines are 

1428
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,130
addicted to putting kim kardashian 
everywhere.

1429
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,310
It's like you're making a big deal out 
of absolutely nothing.

1430
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:39,350
She's just a person.
It's not bad.

1431
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,390
Not hating her.
She is the girl out there,

1432
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,400
you know,
getting her is by being in a show that 

1433
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,241
follows her around.
BuT once you start following someone 

1434
01:00:49,241 --> 01:00:49,610
around and you start tuning into that,
man,

1435
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,960
it's,
it's tricky.

1436
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,530
It is like addictive.
They become a.

1437
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,160
It's like you get programmed with 
wanting to know,

1438
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:56,660
well,
there's a conflict going on with her and

1439
01:00:56,661 --> 01:01:01,661
her sister's boyfriend.
I wonder how they're going to resolve 

1440
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:01,661
that.
You want to watch them.

1441
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:01,730
You just can't help it.

1442
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:05,990
She just tried to sue a old navy because
a friend of ours,

1443
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:06,930
um,
are our friend.

1444
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,830
Mine is melissa mala narrow,
uh,

1445
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,850
nor was his friends that have a breeze 
and I don't think you ever met her.

1446
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,580
But uh,
she uh,

1447
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:20,030
was on an old navy commercial and she's 
singing and dancing.

1448
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,600
It was a commercial and a,
the kardashian.

1449
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,630
Kim kardashians said,
no,

1450
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:25,820
that's,
people think that's me.

1451
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,510
You know?
Uh,

1452
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:32,090
and so she tried to sue old navy.
I don't think she does kind of look 

1453
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:32,090
like,
or she looks like a,

1454
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,980
a hotter version of the kardashians was 
like,

1455
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,580
how could you say that?
Hot.

1456
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,130
It's ridiculous.

1457
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,290
How could you say that this is what the 
girl looks like.

1458
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:43,500
You're not allowed to use this girl.
This girl looks like that.

1459
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,810
But you're not allowed to use her 
because she looks too much.

1460
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:47,640
Like actually you should do ads for 
them.

1461
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,610
I don't think even if she did so fucking
one.

1462
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:52,410
It's not like this girl is your own 
face.

1463
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,140
You can't.
You can't sue someone for using a pretty

1464
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:57,090
girls face because that pretty girl that
happened.

1465
01:01:57,091 --> 01:02:02,091
So it was like you.
So what did that pretty girls never 

1466
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:02,091
allowed to work again because she looks 
too much like you.

1467
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:03,640
If they're tryiNg to replace her at the 
chIna.

1468
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:05,880
Like even so what?
So what dude,

1469
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:10,881
if,
if even if they were trying to replace 

1470
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:12,591
her,
if this girl has her own face and this 

1471
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:12,591
company chooses.
You know what?

1472
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:13,290
I like this girl.
She looks like kim kardashian,

1473
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:16,320
but she's prettier and she's unknown.
Let's use her.

1474
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:21,530
That they should be when more than 
allowed to do that when they her as a 

1475
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:21,530
spokesman,
but

1476
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:21,530
they use her voice anyway.

1477
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,720
No,
that's definitely doable.

1478
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:27,810
A perfect example,
say I'm what if someone decides to do a,

1479
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:33,410
some sort of a video game or something 
about fear factor and they have a dude 

1480
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:38,100
pretend to be me and he looks kinda like
me and talks kinda like me,

1481
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:40,560
and they say it's me.
Well then I consider that a problem.

1482
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,190
Then I can say,
hey,

1483
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:46,191
that's not me,
but if you decide to do fear factor and 

1484
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:48,741
you go and get some dude who looks like 
me and he's good at it and he just does 

1485
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:49,590
it,
I can't sue you.

1486
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,140
He's just dealIng.
Even if he's imitating me,

1487
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,320
even if he's imitating that replaces me.
If you replaces me and he's doing the 

1488
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:00,470
show the way I do the show,
I still can't sell them

1489
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:00,840
all.
Right.

1490
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,660
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1491
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,940
I don't think it's wrong or they're 
trying to pass them off as you.

1492
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,990
Yeah,
but the kim kardashians.

1493
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,490
Okay,
well what if it says,

1494
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,560
you know,
fred fucking suck.

1495
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,130
You know the host of fear factor.
This is this,

1496
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,850
this is fred fucking suck just happened.

1497
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:20,860
So we'll probably be the problem with or
another trying to pass it off as her 

1498
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:20,860
not.
Yeah.

1499
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:20,860
Yeah.
Well,

1500
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,410
you know,
you can't.

1501
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:23,240
I don't know.
That's why I asked if she was in middle.

1502
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:23,470
Maybe.

1503
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:29,110
Here's the thing,
you're protecting this giant 

1504
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,870
multimillionaire celebrity image when 
there's a girl who just wants to work 

1505
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,970
and she happens to look like this girl.
She should be able to work.

1506
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,040
This girl should not have to.
You know,

1507
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,530
I can't.
She can't do a shoe ad because she looks

1508
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:45,480
too much like kim kardashian.
Kim kardashian does a shoe ad and it,

1509
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:50,481
you know,
it makes the case swiss people think 

1510
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:50,481
that she's cheating on them or 
something.

1511
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:51,200
Where the fuck she makes shoes for.
You know what I mean?

1512
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,670
Like that's not,
that's not cool.

1513
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:55,880
You don't own other people's face 
because they look similar to you.

1514
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:01,080
I'm like,
what if a chinese person tried to do 

1515
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,080
that?
Right.

1516
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,520
There's no copyright laws in China.
But with what brian was talking,

1517
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:02,510
I mean,
if they tried to do in America,

1518
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:04,490
I mean it was brian talking about how 
many chinese people,

1519
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:06,620
there's so much less variation in their 
appearance.

1520
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:09,830
That's why there's no copyright laws in 
China conveyed to you,

1521
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,090
right?
Well,

1522
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,440
not only that,
it's just so,

1523
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:17,450
uh,
so ridiculous that you would be able to 

1524
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,300
copyright your image when you're images.
Exactly the same image as everybody 

1525
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:22,310
else's.
You know,

1526
01:04:22,311 --> 01:04:25,790
if there's a billion men in China and 
400 million look like,

1527
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:27,410
you know,
holy shit,

1528
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:32,450
dude.
I remember buck rogers and that came on 

1529
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:32,550
that planet that everyone looked like it
was illegal to wear masks.

1530
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:38,120
Realize lee will take your mask off 
really because they want was everywhere 

1531
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,740
and crazy because all the boys looked 
like all the other boys and other girls,

1532
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,690
like all the other girls.
Buck rogers.

1533
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,120
Is this like the really,
really old buck rogers?

1534
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,350
No,
it wasn't a black and white.

1535
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:49,351
It was with a,
it was with chewy or whatever the 

1536
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:51,770
metric.
The robot's name was a little guy that 

1537
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:51,770
walked waddled.
Chewy.

1538
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,860
Not sure if it wasn't that.
It was like a twinkie or something.

1539
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:54,760
Twiggy.

1540
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,120
How many different buck rogers and they 
did.

1541
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:59,550
It was one of the silvers twiggy's 
twinkies.

1542
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,900
That cute little robot.
Yeah,

1543
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,000
absolutely.
The robots back then.

1544
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,390
We just.
I know the mom from supplements,

1545
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,440
but maybe the robots would always roll 
around photos role because we couldn't 

1546
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
see the move because they couldn't get 
that tag.

1547
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,020
You can just slide by you evenly or you 
remember lost

1548
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,600
in space.
Warning.

1549
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:21,530
Warning.
That robot,

1550
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,080
that robot.
That was stupid as fuck.

1551
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:26,530
He looked like a popcorn maker.
He had these big claws for fingers.

1552
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,630
Useless fucking clamp.
By the way,

1553
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,930
if it landed in any planet that that 
robot gets stuck instantly.

1554
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,740
If it wasn't completely paved even he 
has no chance to to get around.

1555
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:37,750
It was stupid.
Rolled around.

1556
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:39,540
They had the technology to get to 
another planet.

1557
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:44,590
They couldn't make an effective robot.
A robot that can act like he's rolling 

1558
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:44,860
around.
Warning.

1559
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:49,890
Morning.
That was the state of the art for a 

1560
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:49,890
while,
right?

1561
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:52,801
Yeah,
and these fucking people were supposed 

1562
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:54,931
to be believed.
That just stuck out there in space and 

1563
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:54,931
they keep landing on places where they 
could breathe the air.

1564
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:59,580
Oh lucky us.
We can breathe the air out here and 

1565
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:04,201
they're hanging out with the one gay guy
that was the first gay guy on 

1566
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:04,201
television.

1567
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:04,540
Remember?
He's always alone with the kids.

1568
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:07,090
Yeah.
He was always alone with the kids and he

1569
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:10,090
was always like the.
The father would fucking quiet them down

1570
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,370
real quick and he would,
he'd be all upset.

1571
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,450
Really.
My nap time?

1572
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1573
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,400
And he was a never a threat to fuck the 
wife ever.

1574
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:23,401
No.
The wife was hot as fuck out there on 

1575
01:06:23,401 --> 01:06:23,950
space.
Really supposed to be competing for this

1576
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:24,850
one woman,
you know,

1577
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,490
like in.
What is it?

1578
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:31,810
I'm fighting the waking,
the walking dead series.

1579
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,190
The two cops.
Oh yeah.

1580
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,170
Fighting over the same woman.
That's how it goes.

1581
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,140
And the real jungle bitches.
That's how it goes.

1582
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,810
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep 
from going under.

1583
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,140
Yeah,
man,

1584
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,020
if there's a zombie apocalypse,
I'd like to die,

1585
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:47,800
please.
Oh yeah.

1586
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:49,870
I just want to read.
Just trying to live through it.

1587
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:55,170
If there's like a meteor impact and the 
meteor contained spores that turns the 

1588
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,610
survivors into zomBies,
please land on my head.

1589
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,420
Just let's get it over with.
Yeah,

1590
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,040
let's end this nice and quickly,
please if you ever seen the road.

1591
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:08,730
I watched it until the video I watched 
bought the blue ray a watch it until it 

1592
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:13,221
was teaching.
The boy had to shoot himself in the 

1593
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:13,221
mouth and I said,
okay,

1594
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:14,830
I've shut it off,
but I said raped before it gets killed.

1595
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,480
I was like,
I don't want this in my mind.

1596
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,760
I read the book.
Yeah,

1597
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,560
I remember when you were reading it.
You were,

1598
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:21,580
you were absorbed,
dude.

1599
01:07:21,581 --> 01:07:22,810
You were reading and we were on the 
road.

1600
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,050
He'd be sitting next to you on the plane
just like rolling his eyes.

1601
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:28,390
Like first book I read in a decade,
it was,

1602
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:29,170
uh,
it was,

1603
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:31,090
uh,
maybe more of the maybe.

1604
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:32,290
Uh,
yeah,

1605
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,960
we were in the airport.
We're thinking to fly planes a day,

1606
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,410
like seven days or that was the canadian
tour that went on.

1607
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,560
You had no direct flights at all while 
we were up in the boondocks.

1608
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:42,080
Man,
we do.

1609
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:45,440
We did a grand prairie and apparently,
uh,

1610
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:48,910
all those weird spots,
we did like weird mining towns and shit.

1611
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,410
I met somebody from,
from grand prairie.

1612
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:50,860
I was like,
oh,

1613
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:51,850
I played there once,
but they were like,

1614
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:52,580
no,
you're kidding.

1615
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,330
That's funny.
They didn't believe it.

1616
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:01,960
Listen bitch,
we played like very light till like 1130

1617
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:04,030
at night.
I'll go anywhere bro.

1618
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,770
Go to grand prairie for the experience.
For the experience.

1619
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:08,640
Yeah,
it's a,

1620
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,270
it's a weird place up there,
man.

1621
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,230
You know when those weird.
Those are the spots that,

1622
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,040
that people only get to go for a few 
months,

1623
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,540
a year.
It's a completely different.

1624
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,090
And he challenged me to go to one of the
places in the winter.

1625
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,980
You'd be crazy.
Don't do it.

1626
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,040
He was like,
experienced man.

1627
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,380
See what it's like.
You could die.

1628
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,660
Die really.
I have a buddy,

1629
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:31,870
one of the people that I work with on a 
fear factor who did ice road truckers 

1630
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:32,390
and he went to someplace a up there 
were,

1631
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:33,590
they were uh,
driving there.

1632
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,660
They drove the trucks across the fucking
lakes.

1633
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,790
Frozen lakes,
like he's crazy shit.

1634
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,490
40 beLow zero.
it was outside.

1635
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,540
Wow.
Yeah.

1636
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,950
He said he fucked up and left his gloves
in the car,

1637
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,380
tried to manipulate something with his 
hands.

1638
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:51,770
His hands were getting stuck to the,
to the metal because it was so cold.

1639
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,280
The fuck crazy man.
How raising.

1640
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,260
there's no way to get laid in an 
environment like that.

1641
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,150
It have to go back to your house so 
fast.

1642
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,370
You couldn't even like,
I'm not going to a bar tonight.

1643
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,340
Amazing.
Yeah.

1644
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,370
Forty fucking below zero.
So in these places when you know,

1645
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:09,380
you go there in the summertime,
man,

1646
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:14,381
it's like there's a,
there's like a happiness to the people 

1647
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:16,610
are so happy that you could go outside 
and not die.

1648
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,340
Didn't you feel it?
You feel like a jewel all summer long.

1649
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:20,200
It's everyone's like,
oh,

1650
01:09:20,201 --> 01:09:23,630
we just love this kayaking and breathing
the air.

1651
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,960
Amazing.
I wonder if they appreciate life better.

1652
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:29,540
I've always thought about that better.
No doubt.

1653
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,490
No doubt.
We're always in the summer,

1654
01:09:31,491 --> 01:09:33,440
man.
I appreciate it that much.

1655
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:35,600
Although I really do.
First time I stayed here,

1656
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:40,601
man,
I stayed here with my friend Gary 

1657
01:09:40,601 --> 01:09:42,850
Valentine when I was doing something for
mtv and they gave me a room with two 

1658
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,270
beds and gary was up here for some 
audition to crash with me.

1659
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,720
We got up every day and we were like 
another fucking shitty day in paradise.

1660
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,740
So we were in our young twenties,
like I was like 24 or 25 or something 

1661
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:52,740
like that.
And we were like,

1662
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,430
this is fucking incredible.
Because we were living in New York where

1663
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:57,070
every day was gray,
you know,

1664
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:02,170
from good luck from october to march,
most of the fucking sky is gray and it 

1665
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:07,610
sucks and it's either as raining or 
snowing or it just sucks,

1666
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,070
you know?
So you get so used to this.

1667
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:12,020
No rain,
no snow,

1668
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:17,230
no have to deal with weather.
But I think that when you take out in 

1669
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,740
nature as a variable,
you don't have to consider nature.

1670
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,710
People get like real cocky.
They get real.

1671
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:26,711
You know what I'm saying?
It was just one of the reasons why the 

1672
01:10:26,711 --> 01:10:26,711
la dude,
like when you think of la dishes,

1673
01:10:26,711 --> 01:10:31,320
at least I think of people who are,
I think of them as not just being soft 

1674
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,260
but delusional about their hardness.

1675
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,300
Like,
oh,

1676
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,580
he's an la douche.
You know,

1677
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:40,610
la douche is like,
always think they're tougher than they 

1678
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,001
are.
Always think they're smarter than they 

1679
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:43,001
are.
They always,

1680
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:44,210
there was cocky.
There's something cocky and I think part

1681
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:46,640
of that is because they're never humbled
by the weather.

1682
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,920
Explain watts.
explain watts.

1683
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:49,880
It's black people.
It's totally,

1684
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,600
totally different.
Run.

1685
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,760
I was talking about,
um,

1686
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,890
I was coming home from a fire once when 
one time we were filming fear factor and

1687
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:02,891
we were driving and it was during the 
crazy wildfires and flying home from a 

1688
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:03,560
firewall.
It was a fire.

1689
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,890
We had a,
we had to evacuate and we had finished a

1690
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,570
stunt.
We got done in time,

1691
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,270
but when we got on the highway for an 
hour,

1692
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,870
a full hour of going 55 miles an hour,
like not fast.

1693
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,210
No one was driving fast,
but it was highway speeds.

1694
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:23,330
The whole right side of the highway was 
engulfed in flames as far as you could 

1695
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:27,351
see it was crazy,
but one of the things I remember is how 

1696
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:31,551
polite everybody was.
People were using their blinkers and 

1697
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:35,181
people were waving and,
and I looked around and everybody was 

1698
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:36,240
scared and slack jawed when you deal 
with snow,

1699
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,560
like if you go up to Maine during a snow
storm,

1700
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:43,730
I was driving up north during the 
snowstorm and my car broke down and I 

1701
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:44,370
had to like hang out with the people and
the toll booth,

1702
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:49,490
like they took me in because it was too 
cold for me to be outside and they 

1703
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:49,920
hooked me up and.
But everybody was friendly.

1704
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:51,170
Can we get you some coffee?
You know,

1705
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,340
like every milan because tHey're all 
banding together to,

1706
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,150
you know,
because there's this fucking crazy thing

1707
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,370
outside that can kill all the people's.

1708
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,210
Not been my experience with new yorkers 
involved.

1709
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,120
Yeah.
There's a lot of the urban,

1710
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,300
you know,
the urban pressure that comes with that 

1711
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,221
to the giant numbers.
Giant numbers of people is a problem 

1712
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:10,380
because people get dehumanized by the 
pressure.

1713
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:14,160
But I think overall people in the east 
coast are more realistic.

1714
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,080
They're more realistic in their 
behavior,

1715
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,910
more realistic in the way they think 
about themselves.

1716
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:19,620
They might be cocky and it might be 
arrogant,

1717
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:22,830
but there's a different different 
version of it.

1718
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:26,040
Then you get in California,
California is missing the element of the

1719
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,600
weather.
You never have to consider it.

1720
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,240
You never have to worry.
Like,

1721
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,710
I just think it has the opposite effect.
I think you're just going to flourish as

1722
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:33,090
a person.
You can do that too.

1723
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,160
Sure.
I mean it's basically a in how you look 

1724
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,160
at it.
I don't think it hurts you,

1725
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,310
but I think it might hurt a dummy.

1726
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:43,490
You know,
I think when you're living in the east 

1727
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,501
coast and hurricanes come and you've got
to fucking batten down the hatches for 

1728
01:12:45,501 --> 01:12:48,771
the hurricane you get out of.
It kind of puts things into perspective 

1729
01:12:48,771 --> 01:12:51,860
when you get out there and you see trees
ripped out of their roots and fucking 

1730
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,790
windows broken and houses and cars 
fucking flipped over.

1731
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:56,460
Like that puts it into perspective.
Like you ain't shit,

1732
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,760
you know,
and everybody better band together 

1733
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,621
because there's some other stuff out 
there besides people and it can fucking 

1734
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:05,550
kill people and some of it is air.
How about that?

1735
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:10,820
How about the air becomes a scary 
monster that rips fucking buildings off 

1736
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:14,691
its foundations,
wipes out entire towns and people are 

1737
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:15,240
running around worried about vampires.
Fuck.

1738
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:18,630
Vampire tornadoes are way scarier than 
vampires.

1739
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:23,810
You know,
a vampire can't just destroy your house 

1740
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,430
in here.
Who's wearing fat girls?

1741
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:29,160
Girls and I'm worried they're hoping 
they're hoping for a vampire.

1742
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:33,390
I don't know if they're hoping they like
to believe.

1743
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,530
Isn't it funny that they like to combine
those twos?

1744
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:41,060
Vampires and romance were something 
about him being undead is sexy.

1745
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,610
Well,
I could never.

1746
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,800
You could never leave you.
Maybe it's that.

1747
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,140
It's also that you know the,
the,

1748
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,990
the futility,
the obvious futility of the relationship

1749
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:55,680
because unless he kills her and eater or
unless he turns her into a vampire,

1750
01:13:55,681 --> 01:14:00,681
she can't stay with him because she's 
going to grow old and he's going to be 

1751
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:02,130
young forever and it's like this romance
and the fact that he loves her.

1752
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:04,410
And you know,
just a metaphor for,

1753
01:14:04,411 --> 01:14:05,940
you know,
everyone has problems.

1754
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:10,650
They'll be able to agree to spend the 
rest of your life with a woman.

1755
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,100
Yeah.
If you agree to make

1756
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,880
that life in eternity,
how much more so romantic would that be?

1757
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,910
Yeah.
And there's also the forbIdden love.

1758
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,250
The fact that he supposed to be 
dangerous,

1759
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,290
but no one knows.
Everybody thinks he's a monster,

1760
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,540
but you know the real him and around 
you,

1761
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,090
he safe.
But around other men,

1762
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,040
he pulls his fangs on every runs and 
they want to kill him.

1763
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,190
But you don't know him and you're like,
look at yourself.

1764
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,170
You're dating a vampire.
stop it.

1765
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,930
She led a vampire fucker in the twilight
movies.

1766
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,900
They've logged vampire.
Fuck the shit out of her.

1767
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,680
Really?
Yeah.

1768
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:46,870
Would you?
Would you fuck a vampire chick if she 

1769
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,870
gave you life forever?
A no.

1770
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,940
What's some crazy big pitcher wants to 
eat me.

1771
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,490
Can you imagine?
Fell in love.

1772
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:52,770
Now listen,
killed them.

1773
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,690
Vampires aren't people you see when you 
got to kill them,

1774
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,340
you got to stick with 10 people.

1775
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:59,110
There's a reason why we don't have 
mountain lions.

1776
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:01,600
Just wandering through our streets like,
you have pigeons.

1777
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,130
Pigeons are helpless.
I'd go,

1778
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,830
I'd go over immediately.
He fucker.

1779
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,470
I go over and then start telling about 
the people,

1780
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:11,410
the mortals I know really telling on 
them like I know where they live.

1781
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,920
Do you say this in january?
Are you saying this in jest?

1782
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,170
I would definitely become a mortal 
really.

1783
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,440
Why?
People want to live longer.

1784
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,490
Yeah,
but what if when you die,

1785
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:26,491
okay,
if we're talking about vampires were 

1786
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:26,770
talking about something so silly,
but if we're talking about vampires,

1787
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,800
then we're talking about evil things and
we're talking about if you die,

1788
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:31,630
you're going to go to hell.
So now hell exists.

1789
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,120
If vampire's exists,
cal probably exist too,

1790
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,790
but you're never going to hell because 
you're on debt and you'd get killed.

1791
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,940
You don't want to kill it,
and then your soul goes to hell.

1792
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,890
Yeah,
you're fucked for each client because if

1793
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:44,160
you accept vampirism,
they would have to accept.

1794
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,830
Yeah,
you've got to accept all kinds of thing.

1795
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,350
Damped by god.
Yeah,

1796
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,740
you got accept a bunch of other stupid 
shit that goes along with.

1797
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:53,290
It just seems like god fucked up there 
agaiN.

1798
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,380
They dammed up to eternal life.
Yeah.

1799
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,970
It's like,
that's pretty cool.

1800
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:03,510
Another fuckup yup.
But isn't there a potion to off being a 

1801
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:08,221
vampire?
Drinks blood and then you gave up your 

1802
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:08,230
vampire power.
I don't believe that.

1803
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,480
That's some shit where people make a 
regular blood.

1804
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:15,610
All these fucking pussy,
cutesy vampires with beautiful hair.

1805
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,350
That's not what a vampire I suppose.
What does it take to?

1806
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:19,210
The heart kills you.
It kills you.

1807
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:24,330
Like garlic kills.
You try all sorts of different 

1808
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:28,110
variations on the vampire theme.
Like there's a book out called the 

1809
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,670
strain is a guillermo del toro and some 
other book on camp.

1810
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:36,210
It starts out bad ass,
but ultimately completely fizzles and 

1811
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,370
becomes stupid.
It becomes like almost like they ran out

1812
01:16:38,371 --> 01:16:43,371
of,
they had like 10 pages where they have 

1813
01:16:43,371 --> 01:16:45,241
to finish,
so they just finished and then he shot 

1814
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:45,241
him and he died.
Yeah.

1815
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:48,871
It's the sort of.
But in it's Weird and literature for 

1816
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:50,140
them because it seems like almost like 
it's written by two different people.

1817
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:54,730
One person was really new doctor.
He's a producer and director.

1818
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,340
He's the guy who did pan's labyrinth 
with a great,

1819
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:58,780
great movie labyrinth.
Sorry.

1820
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,010
um,
but it was,

1821
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:05,070
this book is almost like it's written by
one person than the other person 

1822
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:08,611
finished.
It almost seems like because in the 

1823
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:09,010
beginning they set everything up bad ass
and it's like really?

1824
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,400
And suspenseful

1825
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,910
and you're like,
Whoa,

1826
01:17:10,911 --> 01:17:13,820
this is a good fucking book.
Like a real page turner.

1827
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,810
Like I remember I was reading it,
uh,

1828
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,520
in Germany and everybody else in the ufc
was going to go to some after party.

1829
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:21,920
I purposely.
So now I'm kinda tired.

1830
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,980
I went back to my room to read this book
because it was that good.

1831
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,020
I was so addicted to it.
I stuck with it.

1832
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:29,900
But then it turns into a stupid book,
like the last,

1833
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:32,840
like 40 page story.
All of a sudden you're like,

1834
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:34,340
what?
It didN't do that.

1835
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:36,110
it just,
the detail was gone.

1836
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,870
Like all of a sudden it was just.
And this happened and that happened.

1837
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:39,410
I was like,
yeah.

1838
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:41,930
What are you doing to fix in the,
in the movie?

1839
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,550
Um,
I don't know.

1840
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:48,551
I Don't think it's going to be a movie.
They were trying to make it a mini 

1841
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:50,471
series,
but there's a way they have billboards 

1842
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:50,471
up portland.

1843
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:50,471
I posted bills.
Oh really?

1844
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:50,471
Yeah,
for the strain.

1845
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,950
Oh wow.
For the book,

1846
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:53,510
for the book just came out.
No,

1847
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,070
the,
the second book came out,

1848
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,960
but that was at least a year ago,
I believe.

1849
01:17:56,961 --> 01:18:01,961
The second boat,
or maybe they're making a movie about 

1850
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:01,961
it.
Maybe.

1851
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:04,301
I thought they were going to try.
I thought that I think the original 

1852
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:04,820
thing was a treatment for a mini series 
and then they decided to.

1853
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:07,490
He decided to turn into a book and sell 
the book.

1854
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,120
But like two days ago I started seeing 
the bills for really strain the movie.

1855
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:16,121
Let's google that shit.
But my point is and said it said don't 

1856
01:18:16,121 --> 01:18:17,320
invite them in or something like that.
Or don't.

1857
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,520
Don't have to.
Do you think they're already lands?

1858
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:22,310
Labyrinth?
Porn version would be pam finally have a

1859
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,280
trailer out already?
Um,

1860
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,240
no,
I think they'll do better than that.

1861
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:26,930
Really?
Oh,

1862
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,850
there's a trilogy.
That's what it is.

1863
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:34,180
I think it's the book was the sequel to 
the book because it doesn't say 

1864
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:34,180
anything.
Oh,

1865
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,950
the strain movie.
Hm.

1866
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,340
Hm.
Hm.

1867
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,290
Hm.
So you're getting peed on brian?

1868
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,540
Yeah.
Won't happen again.

1869
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,140
Yeah.
Okay.

1870
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:45,280
It is,
it's a real movie old del toro.

1871
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:50,740
it's a real movie.
But my point about vampires is that 

1872
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:50,740
this,
these guys did another different take on

1873
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,530
the vampire.
This,

1874
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,510
this vampire didn't have fangs.
Yeah.

1875
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:55,250
They always want to reinvent,
which I get,

1876
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:56,180
but it's like,
come on man,

1877
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,930
don't even attack your throat like a 
regular vampire does.

1878
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,450
They put a little tiny incision that you
can't even see.

1879
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,470
You can barely see it.
It's so.

1880
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,230
It's like a tongue.
Their tongue more.

1881
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:12,730
Some like,
like little laser fucking razor blade 

1882
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:12,730
thing.
It's really dumb.

1883
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:17,890
It's like nosferatu nosferatu.
The vampire is supposed to look like 

1884
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:20,750
that old one from the 19 hundreds.

1885
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,120
The one that was like a,
it was a silent radio.

1886
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,800
That's what they're supposed to do.
What it's supposed to look like.

1887
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,140
The undead.
They're supposed to look like a horrible

1888
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:32,141
fucking creeps and it's supposed to have
fangs and it's supposed to jack your 

1889
01:19:32,141 --> 01:19:32,390
throat.
Everything else you're inventing,

1890
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:34,460
you're just.
You're inventing a new thing.

1891
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:37,400
Just didn't invite me in movie.
Yes or yes.

1892
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,050
Yeah,
yeah.

1893
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,870
Check from superbad or whatever.
Yeah,

1894
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,840
that was pretty cool.
Yeah.

1895
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:44,240
I saw the original version two.
I don't remember the name of it.

1896
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:47,690
One of them's invite me and invite me in
as the american version.

1897
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,360
I forget what the other one let me in 
whatever it was.

1898
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:52,890
I saw both of them,
but the thing about it,

1899
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,310
it's about a girl,
girl,

1900
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,120
girl who's a vampire.
It's pretty dope.

1901
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:59,870
It's realistic forever or whatever it 
is.

1902
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,450
Apparently.
Gauge it is really cool.

1903
01:20:01,451 --> 01:20:03,230
I'm super realistic because.
Exactly what it is.

1904
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:04,520
Super realistic.
Yes,

1905
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,260
yes.
Yeah.

1906
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:07,800
I'm not a great ending.
Not sort of happy.

1907
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:08,040
It's sort

1908
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,040
of like the american one wasn't as good 
as the foreign one was.

1909
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:14,070
Well,
it was close.

1910
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:19,071
I wouldn't say it wasn't as good because
whenever you compare something to the 

1911
01:20:19,071 --> 01:20:20,300
old something,
you always go this new batman's gay,

1912
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,750
you know,
just it's just natural.

1913
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,720
But there's that scene in a tunnel where
she jacks that old man.

1914
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,640
Oh my god.
That was good.

1915
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,740
That was good.
And,

1916
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:28,830
and,
and weird.

1917
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,470
You know.
And the new one you mean.

1918
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:36,500
Yeah.
And that's the way she did it was 

1919
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:36,500
frightening.
and that check is good.

1920
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

1921
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,640
But that's a real goddamn vampire movie.
That's how they're supposed to be.

1922
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,290
You can't invent stuff like,
oh,

1923
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,010
they can go out in the sun,
but they sparkled.

1924
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:49,740
Fuck you,
man.

1925
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:50,640
They radiate.

1926
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:54,120
Not a vampire.
This is some,

1927
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,820
some fake shit.
This is some fake shit,

1928
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:58,440
man.
Goddammit.

1929
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,550
Romance.
Real romance.

1930
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,970
so speaking of romance,
your girls pain on you again.

1931
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:05,300
Yeah.

1932
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,350
Yeah.
I don't know what's happening now.

1933
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,670
It happened again and it's like,
it's a nice piece.

1934
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,140
No,
no,

1935
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:12,380
no.
While we're banging,

1936
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,610
when she comes,
it's just explodes.

1937
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,070
And you know,
people sent me a shooting or is it pink?

1938
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:21,780
She's either peeing or she's juicing so 
hard that it,

1939
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,320
it's the p levels of amount.
But you said it smeLled like pee.

1940
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,940
It did.
It did smell like pee.

1941
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,940
And uh,
but.

1942
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:32,430
But what also I've been noticing is when
I'm fucking her,

1943
01:21:32,431 --> 01:21:36,960
it's gotten to the point where it's like
so wet that it's like making donald duck

1944
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,880
noises.
I like thAt.

1945
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:41,370
LIke it's filling up with so much 
liquid.

1946
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,050
Like she needs to go to a doctor or 
anything because I.

1947
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:48,660
You said she's a super nympho like she 
liked vibrates in the car while she's 

1948
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:48,660
driving.

1949
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,680
Yeah,
she puts a little vibrator.

1950
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,590
Maddie's maybe she broke,
broke a voucher.

1951
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,430
She wants dick like three times a day 
and put poor.

1952
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,820
Brian was forced to go to a gym now.
Yeah,

1953
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,730
just trying to get in shape

1954
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,760
because I can't keep up anymore.
It's so much.

1955
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,900
It's,
that's three times.

1956
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:06,901
Is the men by the or that she at least 
has to have it three times god to any 

1957
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:09,640
you cave man fucking or are you just 
whimpering?

1958
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,620
Luckily.
Slowly slide it in.

1959
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,590
Luckily I figure out a girl what she 
likes and stuff.

1960
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,310
You just had that one move that just 
makes them come like crazy.

1961
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:23,570
Well you just,
I just have to keep on doing that one 

1962
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:23,570
move.
Don't say the moon because then the next

1963
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,941
boyfrIend will learn,
want to do it from behind and you're 

1964
01:22:28,241 --> 01:22:30,710
choking her and you punch her.

1965
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,650
You got to drop the elbow to the back of
that.

1966
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,840
so wait.
So what happens if you don't do that?

1967
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:42,470
like whatever,
like I just can't do it a second and 

1968
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,470
third time today.

1969
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,470
Uh,
she gets mad,

1970
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,580
she gets mad.
So I have to in my head I'm like,

1971
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:49,670
oh,
that's not good because she's going to 

1972
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:49,670
go somewhere else and so I have to do 
it.

1973
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:52,260
And what I've been increasing my below 
job,

1974
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,040
I'd,
if you know me,

1975
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:56,670
I'm not a huge blow job fan,
but I have to increase that because that

1976
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,130
gives me some time,
you know,

1977
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:58,800
to like,
all right,

1978
01:22:58,801 --> 01:22:59,950
I'm ready to do this,
you know,

1979
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,590
because it sounds to go home.
Yeah.

1980
01:23:01,591 --> 01:23:01,990
Yeah.
So,

1981
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:04,500
so it's now getting to the point where,
I mean,

1982
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,580
like the other day it was like six times
and it was like fuck.

1983
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,560
And then like 10 minutes later she goes,
fuck me again.

1984
01:23:10,561 --> 01:23:10,630
Okay.

1985
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,410
Okay.
You know,

1986
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:14,340
it's hilarious,
dude.

1987
01:23:14,341 --> 01:23:16,380
this is like a scene from the twilight 
zone.

1988
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,500
This is like an episode of the twilight 
is guy asks for it that much and then 

1989
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,650
then he kept fucking take it back.
She's like,

1990
01:23:22,651 --> 01:23:24,490
you better fuck me.
You better fuck me.

1991
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:29,491
You fuck her.
She gets mad at you and you fucking 

1992
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:29,491
freak out.

1993
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:29,491
Yeah.
It's like,

1994
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:30,590
what does she do when she's gone?
Like on the roads and stuff,

1995
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:35,650
she has a selection of toys by the way.
I don't know if you've ever heard of 

1996
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:39,270
upper women that there's this vibe vibe 
or african.

1997
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:42,200
Remember later,
but it's like an ipod for vibrators,

1998
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:47,550
the vibrator and called.
I forget the name of the company that 

1999
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:47,550
makes it on the ipod.
What do you mean?

2000
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,580
You just got a usb plug in it,
so you just hook it up to your laptop or

2001
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:55,230
charges it charges and it's got like a 
thousand things.

2002
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,470
You could download settings maybe.
Yeah,

2003
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,420
it's great.
It's crazy,

2004
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,680
but yeah.
No,

2005
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:05,870
yeah,
we'll take that vibration programs and 

2006
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:05,870
sort of be like,
you know,

2007
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,960
you get on an elliptical machine that 
simulates stairs.

2008
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:10,380
There's a vibrator hard,
fast.

2009
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,390
So she's constantly trying to get off.

2010
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,520
Yeah.
Nonstop.

2011
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,990
One hundred,
hundred thousand.

2012
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,570
She,
she's seriously spends most of her time.

2013
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,880
It's really good.
They did normal.

2014
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:23,800
Well.
I always,

2015
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:29,300
I always equate obsessive sexual 
behavior with distraction.

2016
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:34,660
I always say that when I'm.
Whenever in my life that I've been 

2017
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,571
obsessed sexually,
whether it was obsessed with 

2018
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:39,791
masturbating or obsessed with fucking 
that it's a distraction and that really 

2019
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:44,381
I was imbalanced and what I needed to do
was get my mind in order and then fuck 

2020
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,620
anymore.
No,

2021
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,990
no,
not that I wouldn't fuck anymore,

2022
01:24:47,991 --> 01:24:50,120
but that I wouldn't be obsessive.
You know,

2023
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:55,121
there's a certain level of fucking or 
jerking off or anything where you do it 

2024
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:58,511
even when you're not even horny,
you do it because this is the thing 

2025
01:24:58,511 --> 01:24:59,120
you're obsessed with this thing you're 
fixating on.

2026
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,740
so like physically your dick is limited 
edition.

2027
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:06,820
You're not horny,
but yet you'll be chasing pussy like 

2028
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:09,611
crazy.
Whereas like there's a big difference 

2029
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:10,070
between that and like say if your 
girlfriend goes out of town for a couple

2030
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:15,071
of weeks,
I don't want to go back and it's been 

2031
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:15,071
weeks.
If you girlfriend goes out of town for a

2032
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:18,611
couple of weeks and you haven't seen her
and then you grab her and you hug and 

2033
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:21,491
you kiss and your decal time and you've 
had that feeling.

2034
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:24,360
Then when you grab her ashley like,
oh fuck yeah,

2035
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,190
that's,
that's real horniness

2036
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,680
real deal stuff that I miss because I'm 
fucking four times a day that now It's 

2037
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:31,860
just like,
all right,

2038
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:32,360
must fuck.

2039
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:34,210
That's what I'm thinking about your girl
too.

2040
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:37,150
I think she can't really possibly be 
experiencing that either.

2041
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,160
She seems to be obsessing.
I mean,

2042
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:43,000
I understand the concept of nympho.
I always wonder if getting all.

2043
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,320
She's getting hard.
Yeah.

2044
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:46,760
But it's different.
It's different.

2045
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:49,840
It's different for a girl.
And so the whole setup is different,

2046
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:50,680
but just,
you know,

2047
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:52,090
it's not like a dick.
Uh,

2048
01:25:52,091 --> 01:25:56,680
dick is a highly complicated biomedical 
condition.

2049
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,760
You know,
hard on.

2050
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:00,370
Hard on is if a guy had a bone,
you know,

2051
01:26:00,371 --> 01:26:03,070
like if your dick was a bone and you can
just fuck all the time,

2052
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:06,560
you would wear the skin after.
I think it would look like a rhino horn.

2053
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:11,770
It would just be pointing at the tip and
all broken down and scabby and fucking 

2054
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,160
hard and you'd just be fucking all the 
time.

2055
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,120
But because of that,
your,

2056
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,220
your dick is,
it's really complicated.

2057
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:22,160
Sort of an arrangement where everythIng 
has to be in line.

2058
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:25,010
You have to have the right amount of 
sexual confidence,

2059
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:30,250
you can't have too much liquor,
you can't have too many distractions or 

2060
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:30,250
bills.
That can be too much noise.

2061
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,830
Nobody can be screaming at you.
You know,

2062
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,650
if you had a horn,
a rhino horn dick,

2063
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:38,800
you could just fuck you.
And people scream that you stopped 

2064
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,520
talking about as far as got a crazy 
bone.

2065
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:41,960
You never have to worry about it going 
dead.

2066
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:45,050
But anything can cause your bones to 
stop.

2067
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,070
You know,
you can get an.

2068
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,010
Have you ever gotten in an argument in 
the middle of fucking uh,

2069
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:49,950
yeah,
uh,

2070
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
thought of bill sometimes,
but it's really wearing on me or like 

2071
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,880
getting some parts just so distracted.
Like,

2072
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:56,850
oh fuck.
And then you,

2073
01:26:56,851 --> 01:26:58,860
dick starts going lamp.
Yeah.

2074
01:26:59,120 --> 01:26:59,780
Yeah.
Well,

2075
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:00,030
I've,
I've,

2076
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:00,590
I've,
I've,

2077
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:02,540
there was a girl that,
I did it a long ass time ago.

2078
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,720
He used to argue about everything.
She always wanted to argue and she would

2079
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,630
argue while we're fucking or fucking 
should just start arguing and I,

2080
01:27:08,631 --> 01:27:10,370
I had to pull out,
I had to pull out and stop.

2081
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,750
What's what I go,
you're a fucking crazy person.

2082
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:19,780
what?
We're having sex and you can't stop 

2083
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:19,780
ours.
We start fucking her in the ass.

2084
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:19,780
No,
no,

2085
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,150
no.
That's when you run away.

2086
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:23,030
Before she kills you.
You've got the wrong advice,

2087
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:25,430
brian.
That's terrible advice.

2088
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,840
Yeah,
so I don't know what to do.

2089
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:30,230
I got a doctor.
Mainly it's,

2090
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,970
I think it's a psychological thing.
I mean,

2091
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:35,420
I don't know physically,
like everyone's different.

2092
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:37,040
Obviously you're different.
Much different than me.

2093
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,580
I'm much different than our world.
We,

2094
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:39,760
there's,
there's level.

2095
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:44,950
Some people are autistic.
I'm sure some girls are sexually just 

2096
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:45,460
chemically imbalanced to some point of 
nymphomaniac,

2097
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:50,480
like it's a physical thing,
but I also believe that a lot of the 

2098
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,010
cases of nymphomaniac is distractions.

2099
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:54,230
Just like a man being obsessed with 
beating off that,

2100
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:59,231
you can call that guy a nymphomaniac.
A girl is just like having a rhino dick 

2101
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:01,490
because he's distracted or did you say 
what you're saying?

2102
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,250
What do you mean?
You're saying it's a distraction.

2103
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:09,251
It's a lot of the reason why they're 
doing it is because they're looking for 

2104
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:10,490
a distraction from somebody else,
from their life,

2105
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:15,491
from focusing on your life.
If you have issues and things that make 

2106
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:15,491
you insecure things or where you're 
you're.

2107
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:16,760
You haven't accomplished what you want 
to.

2108
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:19,820
Things where you're not at a place where
you need to be emotionally or.

2109
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:20,750
Yes,
yes,

2110
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,830
gambling,
all those things.

2111
01:28:21,831 --> 01:28:26,831
They're all completely related to an 
imbalance in your system and imbalance 

2112
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:29,630
of the human being.
when I get into the isolation tank,

2113
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:33,770
the number one thing,
the number one theme when I get in there

2114
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:36,950
is sorting out things that are bothering
me.

2115
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:40,070
It forces me to consider all the things 
that are bothering me.

2116
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,790
The isolation tank is the exact opposite
of going to a hooker.

2117
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,950
See if you got some shit going on like 
gosh,

2118
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:51,040
coast pitcher right now.
She's talking about dick for $500 and 

2119
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:51,040
you get crazy and you start going into a
picker friends.

2120
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:51,980
I don't know,
I'm just making up a number,

2121
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,930
but I know dudes who were addicted.
Doug.

2122
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:00,610
I know dudes who would always lIke bring
hookers out to clubs and they would 

2123
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,310
always pick up hookers and had hookers 
that were constantly texting them.

2124
01:29:01,311 --> 01:29:02,070
Hey babe,
I'm here.

2125
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,160
And they look spent thousands of dollars
on her first and that those guys were 

2126
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,250
all fucked up in the head.
Like all of them.

2127
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:11,340
There's all sorts of imbalanced.
It wasn't a horniness,

2128
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:16,341
It wasn't.
It was an obsession and a lot of that 

2129
01:29:16,341 --> 01:29:19,251
obsession is because you don't like 
certain parts of your own life and 

2130
01:29:19,251 --> 01:29:20,550
you're trying to not think about your 
problems.

2131
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,500
So instead of thinking about your 
problems,

2132
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:26,490
you think about beating off or you think
about gambling or you think about,

2133
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:27,630
you know,
anything else,

2134
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:28,560
like their cars.
Yeah.

2135
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,760
Any.
Whatever the fuck it is.

2136
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:33,900
It's become you become obsessed with 
video games,

2137
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:38,930
you know,
anything where you become obsessed the 

2138
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:39,060
point where it's not even enjoyable 
would.

2139
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:44,061
That is almost always is you trying to 
avoid some shit that's really bothering 

2140
01:29:44,061 --> 01:29:45,210
you.
You try and do ignore it.

2141
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,360
It's evolutionary.
It's,

2142
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:48,750
it's,
uh,

2143
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:50,280
you're,
you're in a rut behavior.

2144
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:55,281
You're like a crazy rat.
Sit in the corner of bobbing back and 

2145
01:29:55,281 --> 01:29:57,981
forth waiting for your heroin.
It's completely unpredictable on 

2146
01:29:57,981 --> 01:29:57,981
unproductive.

2147
01:29:57,981 --> 01:29:57,981
Yeah.

2148
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:03,890
So your girlfriend is crazy.
We need to taKe your girlfriend to a 

2149
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:06,621
doctor,
take her to a psychologist or I may go 

2150
01:30:06,621 --> 01:30:07,650
to one of those car washes with the 
vacuum cleaner to suck out.

2151
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:12,000
Sometimes people need to talk to 
somebody about their shit.

2152
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,290
I,
you asked her what it is.

2153
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,360
If it's p while she's got some issues,
he doesn't know.

2154
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:17,760
It just started like two days ago where 
it's just,

2155
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:18,360
I mean,
seriously,

2156
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:20,790
when we're having sex,
it's really loud.

2157
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:24,450
Is like donald duck on a,
on a carousel.

2158
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:29,480
That doesn't bother me as much as the 
constantly wanting to fuck all the time 

2159
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,150
when someone.
Cause I always think that this just fuck

2160
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,640
me,
get me,

2161
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,060
stop thinking about those.
JusT come on.

2162
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:35,460
Fuck man.
I wonder if you know her

2163
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:40,640
past and you know,
you've talked about her issues in her 

2164
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,801
past.
She really needs to go to someone and 

2165
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:42,801
sit down and talk to somebody.
That's what she needs to do.

2166
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:44,550
I mean,
I think a lot of people need that man.

2167
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:46,710
So it's not a bad thing.
It's not a weak thing.

2168
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:47,690
Other people can help.

2169
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:52,910
The problem is she talked about going to
a sex addiction anonymous type thing,

2170
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,010
but the problem is I don't want her 
Going there.

2171
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:59,760
Were with other sex addict that just 
seems like a bad idea.

2172
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,200
You know,
you'll go there and some dude looks like

2173
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:03,620
the new conan,
so I'm six foot four friend.

2174
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Swore the handsome bastard with giant 
pectorals and a fucking iron chef dick.

2175
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:10,860
I would say tHat if,
if,

2176
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,430
if a girl looks like your girlfriend 
wants to get laId,

2177
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:18,480
she would have zero problems.
Addiction thing to pick up girls.

2178
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:22,500
That'd be what I'm saying is if somebody
wants to fuck her,

2179
01:31:22,501 --> 01:31:24,090
she's going to fuck.
Shouldn't be to be around.

2180
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,350
She's very unfortunate.
She can get dick at the subway,

2181
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,680
throwing,
burning wax on her 12 inch,

2182
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,550
12 inch chastity belt,
pussy eating,

2183
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,530
going back to just listen,
stop,

2184
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,270
stop being scared of.
That's proof.

2185
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,420
Look,
you're gonna die.

2186
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:47,421
Okay.
there's no stability to any of this 

2187
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:49,251
shit.
There's urgent and the sun's goIng to 

2188
01:31:49,251 --> 01:31:49,251
die.
The son only has a billion years left or

2189
01:31:49,251 --> 01:31:50,340
whatever the fuck it has.
Six billion years.

2190
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:52,020
Whatever the fuck they predict.
It's.

2191
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,220
This is all temporary,
bro.

2192
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:53,670
You're,
you're,

2193
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,790
you're fucking this really hot girl.
Just enjoy it.

2194
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,340
Be nice to enjoy it and get that bitch a
doctor because she needs a doctor.

2195
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,710
She's getting,
she's wants too much dick.

2196
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:05,190
It's ridiculous.
Or you know,

2197
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:07,340
I don't know.
Whatever the fuck going on now.

2198
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:12,680
I don't even have a vagina.
Men.

2199
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:17,940
Men are such non experts in the vagina,
whIch no one has completely isolated 

2200
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,970
with.
Squirting is thinking about every single

2201
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:22,190
fucking figure it out.
Yeah.

2202
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:25,300
Every single function of the man's body 
has been cleverly analyzed,

2203
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,430
but woman's body has a lock.
That smile,

2204
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,150
they're hiding something.
that's what squirting it.

2205
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:32,050
Squirting is like the big foot of the 
woman's body.

2206
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:33,730
Like what is this is real.
What is.

2207
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:37,210
This isn't a ufo.
Squirting is like fucking paranormal.

2208
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,060
Well nobody knows what the fuck that is.
There's a lot of debate about whether or

2209
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:45,061
not that's pissed.
There's a lot of debate about whether 

2210
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:45,061
you should be impressed by it or not.
Yeah.

2211
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,450
Well you should drink a website.

2212
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:49,970
I'm really trying to bring some next 
time I'm here to look at it and smell it

2213
01:32:49,971 --> 01:32:50,750
and tell me what you think.

2214
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,260
Smell it.
Yeah.

2215
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:55,060
Bring it in.
I'll smell it on camera.

2216
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,410
You tasted it.
We live it on your chest.

2217
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:01,710
I'll rub a little around my nipple,
but those just for just around the 

2218
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:06,061
nipple.
Imagine if you made me like super 

2219
01:33:06,061 --> 01:33:08,470
sensitive and I started crying into my 
pores.

2220
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,340
They say that men's loads actually help 
cure depression in women.

2221
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,110
That there is some.
Yeah,

2222
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,710
believe it or not that there's.
There's somethinG in male semen.

2223
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:25,940
What absorbed by the woman's body.
The reaction actually alleviates 

2224
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,010
depression,
friends and whatever.

2225
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:29,110
So maybe that's why she wants dick all 
the time.

2226
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:31,960
It could be that a male scientists do 
this research,

2227
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,330
but yeah,
we should.

2228
01:33:34,331 --> 01:33:36,880
I should use condoms.
Condoms.

2229
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,290
Wow.
Bill.

2230
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,000
Really?
That's the problem.

2231
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:41,590
That's what I have.
Not given any real dick.

2232
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:45,850
that's what you have to tell him.
that's hilarious.

2233
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,510
Semen acts as an anti depressant science
journal,

2234
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:51,190
man.
This is a new science

2235
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,010
to say how.
HoW'd your,

2236
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:53,690
uh,
you just got an std test.

2237
01:33:53,691 --> 01:33:54,020
How did that go?

2238
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:55,660
Hold on.
Sweat this before we get into that,

2239
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:56,290
there.
Up until.

2240
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,170
This is really true,
semen actually makes you happy.

2241
01:33:59,171 --> 01:34:04,171
The remarkable conclusion of a study 
comparing women whose partners were 

2242
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:05,500
condoms with knows whose partners don't.
That's the problem,

2243
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:06,730
dude.
You're wearing condoms.

2244
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,760
Clank.
Yeah.

2245
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,740
The study Is bound to pervert ca provoke
controversy.

2246
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:13,540
Okay.
This is sort of anecdotal evidence.

2247
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:17,620
They could have just got lucky and found
10 people are fucking.

2248
01:34:17,621 --> 01:34:22,621
Feels better.
I don't think simon makes you better 

2249
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:22,621
when you fuck without a condom.
It feels better.

2250
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:23,560
You know,
you could just say that.

2251
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:28,561
You know,
people heard girls calling it with a 

2252
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:30,640
condom,
calling it like it's like getting a 

2253
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:30,640
massage with your t shirt on.
Oh wow.

2254
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,240
That's a good way of putting it.
Yeah.

2255
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:36,370
Yeah.
That's probably why they feel better 

2256
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:39,220
about the relationships because the sex 
actually feels really fucking good.

2257
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,310
You know,
It probably has nothing to do with qa.

2258
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:43,590
You should talk to.
People will pull out the.

2259
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,600
But nobody wants to admit they pull out.
Nobody wants to admit they're so stupid 

2260
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,450
that that's their method of birth 
control.

2261
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:50,290
You know,
you could,

2262
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,120
you could analyze them.
You know,

2263
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:57,121
nobody wants to admit that man is a bit 
from my act and it's absolutely fucking 

2264
01:34:57,121 --> 01:34:58,010
true how I made my

2265
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,040
first daughter that was 100 percent 
pulling out.

2266
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,590
That was all pulling.
I pulled the fuck out.

2267
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,540
I didn't leave it in there.
I wasn't drunk.

2268
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,490
I know what I was doing.
It doesn't matter.

2269
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:10,610
There's some really determined sperm 
that will make shit happen.

2270
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,770
So don't,
don't try the pull out method.

2271
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:18,050
Now you're so lucky.
Well,

2272
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:23,051
it's hard.
It's not as easy to knock someone up as 

2273
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:23,051
easy thing because,
uh,

2274
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:23,870
when we were trying to have the second 
baby,

2275
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:27,010
I fucked her a lot and I'm just shooting
loads in their dog.

2276
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:31,340
Yeah.
But it took like a couple of months.

2277
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:34,180
I was like,
jesus christ fucking you every day,

2278
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,900
you know,
this is getting ridiculous,

2279
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,700
you know,
rally the time when she was oscillating,

2280
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:42,701
whenever she's obviously eating I.
It was a mall session of fuck the shit 

2281
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:42,701
out of like seven,
eight days in a row.

2282
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:43,040
She said,
well,

2283
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,840
we're going to make some babies.
I got fired up,

2284
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:49,870
smoke a lot of.
We'd listen to some good music and go 

2285
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:49,870
and just fucking attack,
You know,

2286
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:50,760
but it doesn't always work,
man.

2287
01:35:50,761 --> 01:35:55,761
It took a few months of that.
I shot loads and our every single day 

2288
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:56,990
that she was operating and it still took
months.

2289
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,390
Eddie bravo,
you know it's taken him.

2290
01:35:59,391 --> 01:36:00,830
He's trying to have a baby.
I shouldn't talk about that.

2291
01:36:00,831 --> 01:36:01,200
And he went,

2292
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:06,270
nobody wants to release that.
My girlfriend played practical joke on 

2293
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:08,681
me because she did that.
We got a birth control test the other 

2294
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,610
day at target and she got a red sharpie 
and made the mark so it was pregnant and

2295
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:13,520
she just laid it on the bathroom floor 
and didn't say anything.

2296
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:18,550
They say it's a practical joke,
but she probably wanted to see your 

2297
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:21,401
reaction because every girl,
every girl deep down inside wants to 

2298
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:21,401
have babies.

2299
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:21,401
Yeah,
well I.

2300
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,580
My actual reaction with god,
yes,

2301
01:36:23,581 --> 01:36:25,780
and I gave her a hug and I was like,
god,

2302
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:26,510
it really no

2303
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:31,310
manchild.
It's not quite.

2304
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:36,950
If you really told me you had a baby,
I was like all flashed in my head.

2305
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:38,840
Okay.
I got to get them to join the army,

2306
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:45,750
get out of this now.
I was just shocked and I was thinking 

2307
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,460
about in can you get a guy in boot camp 
without having them

2308
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,350
being the actual arm?
I don't want them to go overseas,

2309
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,420
but he needs to go fuck your right to 
being a cook guy.

2310
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,480
He needs to go to Afghanistan and 
fucking run around with a backpack on 

2311
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,290
and become a man.
You guys know it'd be an awesome dad.

2312
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,850
You wouldn't be a good day.
You're great with your,

2313
01:36:59,851 --> 01:37:02,310
your look.
He got so depressed that is cat hurt her

2314
01:37:02,311 --> 01:37:03,970
foot and he started smoking.
Okay.

2315
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:07,140
He's very controlled.
You would freak out.

2316
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:10,410
That's why I always tell eddie bravo.
He'd be a great dad because he's fucking

2317
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:13,380
dotes over his bunnies.
BunnIes and white dude.

2318
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:16,920
Wait until you have a kid that's so much
responsibility with kids.

2319
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:22,610
They are.
They're an amazing procrastinate at all 

2320
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:22,610
with them.
No you can't,

2321
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:22,610
but you know,
louis c,

2322
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:27,261
k told me this once you get more shit 
done when you have kids because you 

2323
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:29,931
know,
you don't sit around and just fart 

2324
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:29,931
around and think about getting things 
done.

2325
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:30,110
Like you only have a certain amount of 
time like it forces you to.

2326
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:31,300
Oh,
by the way tonight,

2327
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:32,410
Doug,
stand hopes on louis.

2328
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:33,710
Oh is.
Oh cool.

2329
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:34,180
Awesome.

2330
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,710
Um,
I saw doug on the greenroom episode with

2331
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:41,040
the jury janeane garofalo and he went 
after jenny groth.

2332
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,550
Well,
because of the day after nine slash 11,

2333
01:37:44,551 --> 01:37:49,551
she was onstage and Texas saying that we
need to support the president's port 

2334
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:49,710
George Bush.
And that should change.

2335
01:37:49,711 --> 01:37:50,170
Yeah,
yeah,

2336
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:50,880
yeah.
Of course.

2337
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,060
Yeah.
No,

2338
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:57,140
that whole fucking liberal intellectual 
with one finger in the air and that they

2339
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:02,400
send the check out the fucking political
wind blowing which ways of billowing.

2340
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,280
I don't mind people changing their mind.
I told you kevin.

2341
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:09,290
Then,
but then you're going to harshly judge 

2342
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:09,290
everyone who hasn't changed their mind 
fast enough that she denied it,

2343
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:11,580
which is much more interesting.
Oh really interesting.

2344
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:13,000
To watch someone deny it.
Yeah.

2345
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,090
And what,
there was video of it.

2346
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,450
Well,
I had,

2347
01:38:15,451 --> 01:38:16,090
um,
what,

2348
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:21,100
why you said it didn't happen and doug 
was very adamant about it because I 

2349
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,320
remember him telling me about it,
how ridiculous he thought it was when it

2350
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:22,770
happened.

2351
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,310
At the time,
you know,

2352
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,410
that the support,
any.

2353
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:30,411
Why wOuld you ever fucking support any 
of these folks that are running this 

2354
01:38:30,411 --> 01:38:31,200
country?
They're all god damn Criminals,

2355
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:32,190
their,
they're all.

2356
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:34,500
Everything they do that's legal should 
be illegal.

2357
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:36,540
Everything they do that secret should be
open.

2358
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:42,050
Transparency in government is the number
one reason why all the shake and take 

2359
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:42,660
place.
I've firmly believed that they have fake

2360
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:47,661
spies and fake data breaches and fake 
hacks just so they can tighten down 

2361
01:38:47,661 --> 01:38:50,010
security and just so they can make more 
things secret.

2362
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:55,220
I really Truly believed that.
I think if I was trying to run shit the 

2363
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:55,220
way this United States government is 
run,

2364
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,960
the way they and what's you're 
constantly taking money,

2365
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
what do you think the reason would be 
for them to all money and finding where 

2366
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,710
the money goes?
Oh,

2367
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:03,870
hiding money.
WeLl look,

2368
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,420
you know,
about this whole thing where there was a

2369
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:06,960
bailout.

2370
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:11,990
We thought it was a certain amount of 
money and it turned out to be 

2371
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,390
$16,000,000,000,000
in secret bail outs.

2372
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:14,560
Yeah,
because the ron paul and uh,

2373
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:18,630
someone else audited the fed and they,
they got a detailed list.

2374
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,810
You didn't hear him going to.
Couldn't be $60 trillion bro.

2375
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,090
Look,
secret owe $800,

2376
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:27,150
billion to trillion secret bail outs.
Hold on,

2377
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,750
I'll read you the article.
And these are in mainstream publications

2378
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:35,780
20 times as much as they might end up 
the federal federal reserve or reveal 

2379
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,120
16,
$16,000,000,000,000

2380
01:39:37,121 --> 01:39:39,670
in bail outs.
This is not just on one site.

2381
01:39:39,671 --> 01:39:41,260
This is on many,
many sites.

2382
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:42,310
And it's,
uh,

2383
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:47,490
the first ever government accountability
office audit of the federal reserve was 

2384
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,540
carried out in the past few months due 
to the,

2385
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:54,570
due to ron paul allan grayson amendment 
amendment to the dodd frank bill,

2386
01:39:55,511 --> 01:39:58,300
which passed last year,
and jim dement,

2387
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:03,630
a republican senator and bernie sanders 
and independent senator led the charge 

2388
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:04,630
for the federal reserve audit in the 
senate,

2389
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:07,720
but watered down the original language 
of the house,

2390
01:40:07,721 --> 01:40:08,260
blah,
blah,

2391
01:40:08,261 --> 01:40:08,800
blah,
blah,

2392
01:40:08,801 --> 01:40:09,280
blah,
blah,

2393
01:40:09,281 --> 01:40:09,550
blah.

2394
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,820
What was revealed iN the audit was 
startling.

2395
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,000
Sixteen trillion.
Brilliant.

2396
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:21,180
Listen to this,
but there's a bunch of websites with a 

2397
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:21,180
very similar article.
But listen to the trillion,

2398
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:21,250
listen to them.
And he zeros.

2399
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:22,300
One,
two,

2400
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,380
three,
four,

2401
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:24,280
five,
six,

2402
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:25,180
seven,
eight,

2403
01:40:25,181 --> 01:40:26,230
nine,
10,

2404
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,130
11,
12,

2405
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:32,140
12 fucking zeros.
That is 16,000

2406
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,270
billion dollars.
That's what that is.

2407
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:39,450
So amazing.
And this is 16 trillion had been 

2408
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,801
secretly given out to us banks and 
corporations and foreign banks 

2409
01:40:43,801 --> 01:40:48,661
everywhere from France to scotland.
The period between December,

2410
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,350
2007 and June,
2010,

2411
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:54,910
the federal reserve had secretly bailed.
Many of the world's banks,

2412
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:59,911
corporations and governments,
the federal reserve likes to refer to 

2413
01:40:59,911 --> 01:41:02,770
these secret bay Laos as an all 
inclusive loan program,

2414
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,860
but virtually none of the money has been
returned.

2415
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:10,890
Oh wait.
It was loaned out at zero percent 

2416
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:10,890
interest.
Wow.

2417
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:13,990
Now why isn't this on mainstream news?
Why isn't this the sources that a lot of

2418
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:14,950
different to.

2419
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:19,950
Oh,
I'll find the ones whose website is 

2420
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,620
called the plain truth is,
but it's been on the daily cause it's 

2421
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,740
been on a cause.
Yeah.

2422
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:25,050
K ios,
which is like a,

2423
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,840
a real liberal.
I'm a news source,

2424
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:32,000
but it was in the huffington post.
It was in her is in like,

2425
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,090
I know secret panels,
huffington post,

2426
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:36,340
because I know it was in that.
So we need you to collect that money.

2427
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:39,370
Ari did the Bobby Lee choke.
Many people do voguing.

2428
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:42,070
Huffington post is not too liberal rag.
That's.

2429
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,160
It is true,
but okay,

2430
01:41:43,161 --> 01:41:45,640
let's go.
Yet the more reputable.

2431
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:47,440
Try seeing overdose,
trust cnn.

2432
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,300
Cnn has a too.
Yeah.

2433
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:54,240
Sixteen trillion is what we said we've 
spent on bail outs.

2434
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:59,250
That's 20 times 20 of those in secret on
top of the one we did for real that 

2435
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,970
people argued against.
Yeah.

2436
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:04,690
This one's saying 9 trillion this other 
play press corp,

2437
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,360
ca canadian website.
Same 9 trillion.

2438
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:09,770
Either way it's okay.
Market observe,

2439
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,610
observation.
There's a lot of websites that have this

2440
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:13,540
story.
Well,

2441
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:18,541
there's only one that has 9 trillion.
Everything else seems to be sticking 

2442
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:20,390
with between 13 and 16 trillion until 
like totally adding it up.

2443
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,130
Yeah.
There's,

2444
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:22,360
there's a lot of websites,
man.

2445
01:42:22,361 --> 01:42:25,180
I mean the google hits.
I got 4 million,

2446
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:26,830
200,000
results.

2447
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:32,130
Wow.
So it's obviously this has been talked 

2448
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:32,130
about on a bunch of different websites.
Yeah.

2449
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:36,810
Speaking of politics,
scary shit fucking at the way you're 

2450
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,190
going to be the atlas performing arts 
center.

2451
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,410
How come you're not at the improv?
Those cons are they're not booking,

2452
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:46,411
you know,
they don't look like what kind of 

2453
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:46,411
ridiculous shit is that?

2454
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:46,411
Listen,
you dirty bitches.

2455
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:50,790
Just because ari shaffir came up at the 
improv does not mean that he can't go 

2456
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:54,360
there and headline I be.
Or like allison.

2457
01:42:54,361 --> 01:42:54,710
Yeah,
yeah,

2458
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:55,390
yeah,
yeah,

2459
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:57,700
yeah.
Headliner ari should fear.

2460
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,020
Listen,
we'll make you a deal.

2461
01:42:59,021 --> 01:43:02,590
We'll pump it up on twitter.
We'll talk about it on the podcast.

2462
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:04,570
That's what we're doing with the atlas 
performing arts center.

2463
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,570
And you know what we're going to do?
We're going to pump it up the same way.

2464
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:08,710
Well,
I'm gonna pump up this weekend,

2465
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:11,530
August 13th in milwaukee,
Wisconsin at the palace theater.

2466
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:12,850
Oh,
that'll be fun.

2467
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,710
Holla at your boy.
I've ever played Wisconsin before.

2468
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:16,990
Um,
yes.

2469
01:43:16,991 --> 01:43:18,460
A long time ago.
Brian.

2470
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,210
We still need to put that um,
denver data up on the ustream page.

2471
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,230
It is on this one.
You hit refresh.

2472
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,430
I did.
Good.

2473
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,110
Yeah.
I don't know.

2474
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,460
Something happened when you go into 
denver.

2475
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:33,170
Oh,
that's September 23rd.

2476
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:34,320
What are you playing?
A,

2477
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:39,020
the paramount theater boy tried or used 
to do the comedy works,

2478
01:43:39,021 --> 01:43:44,021
but Joe Diaz cannot get booked at the 
economy works and I get tired of going 

2479
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:44,021
to denver and everybody asking.
Yeah.

2480
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:45,410
And uh,
you know,

2481
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,360
is wondering,
promoting that or somebody else should.

2482
01:43:47,361 --> 01:43:49,360
I think she's said something to do with 
her to go.

2483
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:54,410
She can't stop.
Can't stop Joe Diaz from coming into 

2484
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:54,410
town.

2485
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,160
I'd say it's like,
what do you guys do when that happened?

2486
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:58,520
Twenty years ago.
Version of that story too,

2487
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,020
as far as the store is that the girl she
was on the stage,

2488
01:44:01,021 --> 01:44:06,021
she jumped off the stage.
I kuchta and I asked him my hand for a 

2489
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:09,971
brief second and comics talked to 
understand that that was sexual 

2490
01:44:09,971 --> 01:44:13,931
harassment.
I bet it's a lot of comics just not 

2491
01:44:13,931 --> 01:44:15,761
being cool with crazy stuff that happens
at comedy clubs where somebody's 

2492
01:44:15,761 --> 01:44:15,761
complaining.
Well,

2493
01:44:15,761 --> 01:44:19,631
Joe Diaz style craziness.
Joe diaz is perfectly fitted to the 

2494
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:23,111
comedy store when he talks about that 
girl that he got to suck his dick every 

2495
01:44:23,111 --> 01:44:23,630
time she got on stage and the belly 
room,

2496
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,500
she had to suck his dick.

2497
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:28,070
Some girls,
but she quit.

2498
01:44:28,071 --> 01:44:29,630
She quit comedy and then she said,
uh,

2499
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:34,690
she said a letter to the comedy store.
So angry and he did that and joey talks 

2500
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:38,330
about it and laughs or animals.
I lOve it.

2501
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:43,720
Well,
he was probably running it like that in 

2502
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:43,720
Colorado,
you know,

2503
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:43,820
knowing that joey,
that we know from back in the day he was

2504
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:48,821
making a party,
just make it a party and someone 

2505
01:44:48,821 --> 01:44:51,460
panicked and you know,
some fucking really white guy probably 

2506
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:54,920
just couldn't handle it.
I mean Joey diaz was a criminal from New

2507
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,920
Jersey who all of a suDden lived in 
Colorado and it was robin people with 

2508
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,750
machine guns and fucking rock kidnapping
cocaine dealer,

2509
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:08,950
but not real kidnapping.
I just robbed someone's cocaine stash 

2510
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,220
with a machine gun has so much better.
I love it.

2511
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:12,990
I love it.
So much hArd.

2512
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,150
Yeah,
it was crazy.

2513
01:45:14,151 --> 01:45:15,740
It's amazing how nice he is.

2514
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:17,150
He was so hard.
He's like,

2515
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:19,130
it was a straight criminal.
It's great.

2516
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:24,190
It's a complete change.
He went on a 10 minute rant about how 

2517
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:24,290
the weed sucked.
The last time we had a podcast,

2518
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:29,240
he was calling it a weed stuff to.
Hannah was a hat company from the laurel

2519
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:32,140
and hardy show,
like calm them down for five minutes for

2520
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,530
explained it over and it goes off.
I'm right.

2521
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:38,590
He was gone,
so could you give me this fucking saw 

2522
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:38,590
hannah?
We'd just fucking side.

2523
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:38,590
And I was like,
what is he saying?

2524
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:38,720
Is that like a,
you know,

2525
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:40,430
joey diaz.
Mr pronounces words.

2526
01:45:40,431 --> 01:45:41,780
I thought he was saying like hannah 
Montana,

2527
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:44,500
we'd call it sauce,
but I thought he was callIng it.

2528
01:45:44,501 --> 01:45:45,110
Yeah,
me too.

2529
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:45,800
right?
You did.

2530
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:47,150
I like,
I like that name better.

2531
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:48,860
Anyway,
susko hannah weeds hilarious.

2532
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,900
But what it was is,
here's a tip,

2533
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:52,520
ladies and gentlemen,
don't do this with your weed.

2534
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,820
Don't grind your weed up in a,
um,

2535
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:59,150
a coffee grinder.
I've done that for a little bit and it's

2536
01:45:59,151 --> 01:46:04,151
a matter of how many times you press it 
down because it gets chopped up really 

2537
01:46:04,151 --> 01:46:08,201
quIck.
Have you put it in bowls or vaporizer 

2538
01:46:08,201 --> 01:46:08,201
like that?
Uh,

2539
01:46:08,201 --> 01:46:08,300
that is good move.
Yeah.

2540
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,660
Vaporizer at works like that because you
don't have to worry In a vaporizer about

2541
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:16,661
sucking air through,
but when you roll a joint with it and 

2542
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:16,820
it's powder,
it's too hard to get oxygen through.

2543
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:21,821
And so I don't think you'd get as high.
So that's what joey was responding to 

2544
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,000
the other day.
That and the fact that he was in traffic

2545
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:24,800
for like an hour and a half getting 
here,

2546
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:29,810
hair screaming at his gun's bike.
You fuck.

2547
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:32,500
And he made a video of it.
It's a layer it.

2548
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:33,440
Yes.
Yes.

2549
01:46:33,441 --> 01:46:38,441
And he showed it to us after the show.
So we're going to add that video to the 

2550
01:46:38,441 --> 01:46:40,850
end of the blog videos that we do on it.
You go to joe rogan.net.

2551
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:42,360
There's always,
if he sends his blogs,

2552
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:45,080
videos sent to us it sounds like.
Yeah.

2553
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:47,300
And if it doesn't,
if he lives down the street from you,

2554
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:48,680
you can just go to his house and upload 
it.

2555
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:49,740
I'll just recreate it,

2556
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:53,400
create it.
Why would you recreate it?

2557
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:55,110
But what he did was perfect.
Yeah.

2558
01:46:55,160 --> 01:47:00,160
We said it was perfect and he's fucking 
screaming at people going nuts because 

2559
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,271
he's stuck in traffic.
We're going to go with the buffalo 

2560
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:03,271
together.
You are when?

2561
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:04,150
Next?
February 17th.

2562
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:07,510
September 17th at the town.
What a ballroom.

2563
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:09,340
You and joey,

2564
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:10,090

2565

2566
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,410
literally working out the details.
It was just fucking.

2567
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:15,920
Yeah.

2568
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,000
September 17th.
Is that what you said?

2569
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:22,170
Nice.
September 17th is a saturday.

2570
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:25,440
There's a ufc that night in new orleans.
Oh really?

2571
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,210
Yeah.
That's awesome.

2572
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:28,740
Yeah,
that should be good man.

2573
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:31,410
So what is the name of the place?
Town ballroom.

2574
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,760
The town ballroom.
You own a well,

2575
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,440
make sure you come on both.
You guys come on that week and uh,

2576
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,580
and pushes a.
Yeah,

2577
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:41,400
we know wIll do fine.
I have that wednesday open.

2578
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,530
I'm not filming fear factor that 
wednesday.

2579
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:48,531
So we'll do a podcast with you and joey 
that wednesday and we'll talk about a 

2580
01:47:48,531 --> 01:47:49,560
lot that we can.
Yeah,

2581
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:54,770
I think I can try to hit New York for a 
few days after that we got to do a 

2582
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:54,770
daytime podcast to nighttime podcast.
Joe,

2583
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:56,220
he gets too angry when nighttime.
Oh,

2584
01:47:56,221 --> 01:47:57,990
how's it going?
Is that why you did my time?

2585
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,250
Yeah,
I had a film all day.

2586
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,620
It's going easy,
so it's easy as fuck man.

2587
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:06,090
The easiest job in show business.
Three days for an episode there.

2588
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,300
There's,
you know,

2589
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:12,740
the easy stuff is the where they have to
eat things or do those usually take a 

2590
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:13,230
couple of hours?
The other day is take like five hours,

2591
01:48:13,231 --> 01:48:15,240
six hours and set up.
EverythIng is fucking easy man.

2592
01:48:15,241 --> 01:48:20,241
It's,
it's going into a show like the people 

2593
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:20,241
were running it.
There's a long.

2594
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:21,270
Yeah,
they ran it.

2595
01:48:21,271 --> 01:48:21,750
The,
the,

2596
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,100
the uh,
the old days.

2597
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:28,160
So it's a single dose.
They know exactly what the fuck they're 

2598
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:28,160
doing.
So its easiness.

2599
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,720
Yeah.
It's just a still getting easy money.

2600
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,540
Wow.
What was that?

2601
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:34,860
I know it just dropped off.

2602
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,870
Yeah.
Oh,

2603
01:48:35,871 --> 01:48:38,100
you know what that is.
That's that limiter that we have on now.

2604
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:43,340
Keep allowed to keep the joey diaz 
limiter sounds from getting too crazy.

2605
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,140
If we don't make any sense of drop stuff
extra hard.

2606
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:47,850
It just turns off the mind like a prius.
Yeah.

2607
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:53,290
Yeah.
It's like a shitty hybrid just stops 

2608
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:54,200
recording when no one's talking about 
buying one of those

2609
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:55,140
hybrid.
Yeah.

2610
01:48:55,141 --> 01:48:56,940
I'm getting alif,
alif oR a bolt.

2611
01:48:56,941 --> 01:48:58,240
One of the all electric cars.
yeah,

2612
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,250
I'm sold on it.
All the details have read it.

2613
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:06,320
You buy two batteries,
you charge one inch or house you 

2614
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:06,690
charged,
you keep one going to give you all these

2615
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:08,970
tax incentives to get one.
Really,

2616
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:13,971
if you got a home charger they give you 
a ton more taxes than if I'm talking 

2617
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:15,090
about like four to 8,000
for each one to go towards the cost of a

2618
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:17,760
car.
And then the fuck the amount of oil,

2619
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:21,300
Texas virtually none of them has like 
most like almost.

2620
01:49:21,301 --> 01:49:21,600
No,
no.

2621
01:49:21,601 --> 01:49:23,010
The other one that has completely 
electric.

2622
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:24,410
And how long can it go?
What?

2623
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,340
So one of them's a hybrId.
Which one's the hybrid?

2624
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:31,370
I think that's the chevy volt.
The voltage of the nissan leaf is the 

2625
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:31,370
only.
All electric car.

2626
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:33,330
And so both with both of them.
Yeah.

2627
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:36,490
I think I keep an extra.
You keep an extra battery in the car and

2628
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:38,280
they said this.
They said more stuff can go wrong.

2629
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,810
Wrong.
There's only one thing.

2630
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:43,110
That engine is way simpler.
You just took out this battery,

2631
01:49:43,111 --> 01:49:45,630
put another one in that's there's 
nothing can go wrong.

2632
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,990
The way more can break on a regular car.
They have prius

2633
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:49,830
is down pretty good right now.
Yeah,

2634
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:51,300
they have an even better thIng.
Oh look,

2635
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,590
I think.
I think if you're somewhere and you need

2636
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:56,890
fucking energy,
you can't rely just on energy.

2637
01:49:56,891 --> 01:50:01,891
You have to have gas because what if.
What if this whole thing fails and they 

2638
01:50:01,891 --> 01:50:01,891
decide to add,
fuck this.

2639
01:50:01,891 --> 01:50:03,240
I at least want your car debt and being 
able to save.

2640
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:08,410
What would it be?
One of these batteries become,

2641
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:10,400
you know,
like they stop making the car,

2642
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:15,450
the company goes out of business.
They've got a busIness just like pontiac

2643
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:22,690
or just like all the other business.
Maybe they stopped.

2644
01:50:22,691 --> 01:50:27,691
They stopped making these batteries and 
how that would happen to the bay for 

2645
01:50:27,691 --> 01:50:28,090
$50,000,000.
how long would it have to be?

2646
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:30,100
Well,
how long would have to be a.

2647
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,690
It's around until you get a car like 
that.

2648
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:33,310
I,
I will get a hybrid.

2649
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:38,340
I'll get a like a prius type thing or 
like how long would electrical stuff 

2650
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:38,340
have to be around before you say,
okay,

2651
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,660
it's going to be around.
It's not just going to enter to win.

2652
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:44,230
It's a win.
All the batteries are the same for every

2653
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,570
single car or what's the law?
We're completely happy.

2654
01:50:46,830 --> 01:50:48,080
That's the only time,
the

2655
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:50,970
way I feel,
the way I feel where I know that there's

2656
01:50:50,971 --> 01:50:55,971
some sort of a peak oil situation and 
we're slowly going to run out of 

2657
01:50:55,971 --> 01:50:56,930
resources and electric cars will slowly 
take over.

2658
01:50:57,330 --> 01:51:02,330
I fucking love driving a big fat stupid 
v eight right now because I know this 

2659
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:03,120
is.
These are the last of the mohicans.

2660
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:07,260
I never get any pleasure out of it.
My mustang to drive my mustang.

2661
01:51:07,290 --> 01:51:08,880
I'll let you drive.
You've been in that room before.

2662
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:11,160
You want to drive it.
you'll get it once you drive it.

2663
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:13,740
Once you get behInd that thing in that 
aluminum block,

2664
01:51:13,741 --> 01:51:18,690
550 fucking horsepower.
The snarl of four inch tailpipes.

2665
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:24,140
Can they not make a fast car like that?
It won't sound right.

2666
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:26,880
It won't be right.
It'll be cool.

2667
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,340
They have a tesla,
the tesla roadster.

2668
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:31,210
That's very.
Yeah,

2669
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,100
the tesla roadster is a very fast car 
and it's uh,

2670
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:36,120
it's interesting because it's a little 
sports car,

2671
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:37,870
but it's all balanced all.

2672
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,240
Fuck,
I got a honda right now,

2673
01:51:39,241 --> 01:51:41,150
so I'm not getting that job anyway.
Right.

2674
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,260
I know you're not getting the joy,
but you should.

2675
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:46,720
You should you because you have.
You drive a have a five slash six speed,

2676
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,210
right?
Yeah.

2677
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:51,420
Your car is a manual to manual that 
manual,

2678
01:51:51,421 --> 01:51:55,470
not a manual man.
You know what it's like to shift all the

2679
01:51:55,471 --> 01:51:56,100
time.
okay.

2680
01:51:56,120 --> 01:52:00,630
That's dotson olag manuals.
I liked them for cars.

2681
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,900
I dOn't like them for traffic,
but I liked him.

2682
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,470
I like him for real cars,
man.

2683
01:52:04,471 --> 01:52:06,530
When you drive a mustang and it's,
you know,

2684
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:11,600
one of the gt $500 and a manual and you 
didn't really go through the fucking 

2685
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:11,600
gears.
You feel it though.

2686
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,710
You feel the mechanics,
you engage the gear,

2687
01:52:13,711 --> 01:52:17,340
you're selling a lot more,
how long you're going to go in overdrive

2688
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:19,830
to downshift how much speed you can get.

2689
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:24,830
You can't do that with an automatic car.
You're just hoping it keeps shifting 

2690
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:24,830
with the right time you have.
Yeah.

2691
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:25,280
Well you can definitely.
The.

2692
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:30,290
Today they have these called a double 
clutch boxes like m three has a double 

2693
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:33,120
clutch box and what that is is an 
automatic,

2694
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:37,920
but it's a standard like you can set it 
up to shift gears where you could rev it

2695
01:52:37,921 --> 01:52:42,921
up as far as you want and use the 
paddles to shift gears like all the 

2696
01:52:42,921 --> 01:52:43,440
ferrari so you can do yourself new fires
to the bicycle.

2697
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,920
Exactly a little higher.
I'm still trying to speak to as long as 

2698
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:54,470
your heart's content,
but you shift with the paddles and it's 

2699
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:56,900
instantaneous.
The shifts are like franco section.

2700
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:58,850
Almost many,
many cars have it now.

2701
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:04,280
Porsche has.
It's called a double clutch gearbox 

2702
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,640
double.
What it means is it's actually a seven 

2703
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,341
speed with the m three has one and it's 
a seven speed and what it is is there's 

2704
01:53:09,341 --> 01:53:13,901
one gear that's inside one gear,
you're engaged one gear and then the 

2705
01:53:13,901 --> 01:53:15,470
clutch will already pick up the second 
gear.

2706
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:18,590
So as you're shifting gears the next 
gear,

2707
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:20,920
it's like instantaneous.
Like when it,

2708
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,780
when it releases the first gear and 
picks up the second gear,

2709
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,280
it does it with no,

2710
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:27,300
like when you're shifting into a regular
car,

2711
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:31,170
you have to go with a neutral to 
neutral.

2712
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:33,810
When you hit the clutch,
you put it into second gear and then you

2713
01:53:33,811 --> 01:53:38,811
release the clutch and now it's in 
second that press on this thing you 

2714
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:38,811
don't.
It's first gen,

2715
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:40,290
second game.
It's instantaneous.

2716
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:41,880
That electric car.
How many?

2717
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:43,680
How long does It take to charge a 
battery?

2718
01:53:43,681 --> 01:53:45,360
Like 12 hours?
No,

2719
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:47,250
not nearly that long.
You can charge it overnight.

2720
01:53:47,251 --> 01:53:52,251
You can sit.
You can have an ipod program that sets 

2721
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:52,251
it to charge during non peak hours.
Each charge is what?

2722
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:53,940
Eighty miles?
No way more than that.

2723
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,980
It's way better than what you think.
300 matalan.

2724
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:03,020
You look into the stats about 300 right 
now because right now you're asking me 

2725
01:54:03,091 --> 01:54:06,520
to quote yourself and I don't know if 
you guessed 80 and I don't know.

2726
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:07,740
He got excited.

2727
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:12,830
Notice he raised his voice.
So you want to look in here trying to 

2728
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:12,830
make points and stuff.
We're all just guessing.

2729
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:17,510
I know I'm not the haters,
But at the point was to say like you 

2730
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:17,510
want to go 80 miles away,
way too little,

2731
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:19,200
80 miles would not be willing to drive 
to Texas.

2732
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:21,210
Okay,
so you need seven batteries?

2733
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:23,160
No,
you still up at gas stations?

2734
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:29,010
They have seconds to you laugh and like 
anyone's driving to Texas.

2735
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:31,440
When the fuck is the last time you drove
to Texas?

2736
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:36,450
He like 20 minutes trying to take a road
trip is one.

2737
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:37,950
Okay.
Yeah.

2738
01:54:37,951 --> 01:54:39,580
Let's wait a minute.
Hold on.

2739
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:41,940
Sorry.
This thing only gets 99 miles.

2740
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:45,030
Nine miles total belief per charge?
Yes.

2741
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:46,650
So you want to go to vegas?
Got ain't shit.

2742
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:51,930
You just have to stop at 99 miles.
Charge for six hours.

2743
01:54:51,931 --> 01:54:56,931
How about that?
Here's what I liked that you got happy 

2744
01:54:56,931 --> 01:54:58,560
that it wasn't as good as 300 miles 
because it made the point earlier.

2745
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:03,310
I'm just saying that if you're going to 
get a car for the most part,

2746
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,550
we get a mix.
You don't want all batteries.

2747
01:55:05,551 --> 01:55:07,260
What I'm saying,
if I didn't have 300 miles,

2748
01:55:07,261 --> 01:55:10,590
I would want a better.
If I get to go 300 miles on a charge,

2749
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,350
actually this is up to 100 miles,
which means you're probably.

2750
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,720
That's way too low.
60.

2751
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,760
How much is the volt?
That doesn't seem like it should be out 

2752
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:19,760
in the market yet.
Yeah.

2753
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:19,760
Well,
you know what?

2754
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,350
The epa has rated the nissan leaf a 
driving range of 73 miles per charge 

2755
01:55:25,081 --> 01:55:27,900
range will vary with driving habits,
conditions,

2756
01:55:27,901 --> 01:55:32,901
weather and battery age,
but that's whack and it's ugly as fuck.

2757
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:39,710
Dude,
I'm taking you to the ford website and 

2758
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:39,710
show you a gt 500.

2759
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:39,710
You know what?
I do want to get some of that.

2760
01:55:39,930 --> 01:55:44,080
I want to get one of those little ones.
The little baby markers.

2761
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,160
Smart cars just for like driving to the 
store.

2762
01:55:47,161 --> 01:55:49,930
just totally easy to park.
Smart,

2763
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:51,240
smart cars.
Not as bad as you think.

2764
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:53,550
Safety wise,
no fun.

2765
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:58,650
You don't feel the growl of the va and 
get that store you don't like.

2766
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:06,010
That gives you a thrill that that's what
I'm getting on an open highway are how 

2767
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:06,010
old are you?
Thirty seven.

2768
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:07,110
You're going to like it in about five 
years.

2769
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:08,810
What?
Open highways,

2770
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,940
you know what's great though?
Windy roads,

2771
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:13,350
that's when it's great to have a fun 
car.

2772
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,750
I get too scared now.
Don't even have to drive fast.

2773
01:56:15,751 --> 01:56:17,370
You don't have to drive fast.
Used to feeling of,

2774
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:22,570
you know,
just a little bit of a windy road and 

2775
01:56:22,570 --> 01:56:25,431
make sure you're controlling the car.
You feel the tightness of the 

2776
01:56:25,431 --> 01:56:25,431
suspension.
Okay.

2777
01:56:25,431 --> 01:56:26,580
The nissan volt.
Jesus christ,

2778
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:28,920
I mean 50 miles.
Fifty miles.

2779
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:30,540
Fifty miles on it's fucking battery.

2780
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,340
Oh,
that's where you can't even get to work.

2781
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:35,880
The all electric rang the epa.
All my god.

2782
01:56:35,881 --> 01:56:40,881
Is it electric range?
According to the epa is 35 miles.

2783
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:45,980
Yeah.
You get stalled traffic on the four or 

2784
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:46,950
five.
The total range is 379 Miles.

2785
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:50,310
So that means if you got to fill up a 
gas,

2786
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:54,000
your fuel economy is through the roof.
It's 93 miles per gallon.

2787
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:58,080
That's incredible.
So that is um,

2788
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:01,380
that's if you go a half an hour.
Yeah,

2789
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:03,660
37 miles.
Thirty seven.

2790
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:05,820
Yeah.
37 miles an hour.

2791
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,930
TheY have the recharge thing,
like where the breaks retarded it.

2792
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:10,890
okay,
this is what it is.

2793
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:14,910
He goes,
it's 93 miles per gallon in all electric

2794
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:16,350
mode.
I don't understand that.

2795
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:20,670
And 37 miles per gallon in gasoline only
mode.

2796
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:24,480
So I guess you have the.
You have the option.

2797
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:27,690
So a combined gas and electric fuel 
economy.

2798
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:31,120
Reading of 60 miles per gallon.
I'm pretty fucking good man.

2799
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,560
My car gets 15 and that's what it's 
rated at,

2800
01:57:34,561 --> 01:57:37,560
so probably gets 10.
my card is like 27 or something.

2801
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,560
I need to switch my car but I want an 
suv and I don't want.

2802
01:57:40,710 --> 01:57:42,760
I might get the.
I think they have to do so much,

2803
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:44,990
but this is kind of interesting though.
The chevY and it.

2804
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:47,790
What else?
What it does is it operates the battery.

2805
01:57:47,791 --> 01:57:52,791
It operates on pure battery power until 
it's battery capacity is depleted,

2806
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:58,610
at which point it fires up the engine 
and then the gasoline engine powers and 

2807
01:57:58,610 --> 01:58:02,550
electric generator to extend the 
vehicles range so that how it operates,

2808
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:05,820
it mostly operates on electricity as 
long as you have enough power in there.

2809
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:09,430
So it's almost like that's why it wasn't
the same as it was like how.

2810
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,770
How is it different if it's half and 
half,

2811
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:11,550
it's not quite happening.

2812
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:16,700
It definitely seems like a better move 
than the volt because at least you can 

2813
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:16,700
get gas.
Yeah,

2814
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,280
yeah,
yeah,

2815
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:18,030
yeah.
The.

2816
01:58:18,190 --> 01:58:20,280
Yeah.
The volt is better than the leaf because

2817
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:22,170
it's.
The hybrid seems to be the way to go.

2818
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:27,380
Especially 76 miles.
Unless you're just drIving five miles 

2819
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:27,380
back and forth to work.
There's not,

2820
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:29,340
that's not really realistic at all.
Any road trip is you're fucked.

2821
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,060
I always,
yeah.

2822
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:35,061
I always think what if I had to go on a 
road trip and I know you say there was 

2823
01:58:35,061 --> 01:58:37,020
some sort of 70 percent charge you can 
get in 20 minutes really quick charge on

2824
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,820
don't know one of them,
but um,

2825
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:43,880
but the problem is you don't want to,
you don't want to stop and have to do 

2826
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:46,000
that in you miles that's weak.
But this thing sounds better.

2827
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:49,630
This thing can go 370 million miles and 
this is like a normal car.

2828
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,080
You just go into the gas and it can keep
going and that one keeps shifting,

2829
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,290
changing.
They just have weekends,

2830
01:58:55,300 --> 01:59:00,300
engines sound like shit.
I know that these are for 

2831
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:00,300
transportation,
but this is,

2832
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:04,020
we're going to miss this.
Something we're already missing in the 

2833
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:05,120
transition between the gasoline powered 
cars like you,

2834
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:05,860
you,
you know,

2835
01:59:05,861 --> 01:59:08,180
you get in an old mustang smell.
Um,

2836
01:59:08,181 --> 01:59:09,430
and yeah,
we missed a smug.

2837
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:12,370
We definitely do.
But we also missed the analog connection

2838
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:16,270
between the person in the vehicle.
This is a fun connection between cars.

2839
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:20,160
my aunt got up,
she got some nice parallels like a lexus

2840
01:59:20,161 --> 01:59:25,161
or infinity or something and uh,
it had an analog clock on it and I was 

2841
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:25,410
like,
well,

2842
01:59:25,411 --> 01:59:26,380
why don't you have that?
She goes,

2843
01:59:26,381 --> 01:59:31,381
because it's class here.
She was so excited to have this thing 

2844
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:31,381
and I was like,
wait,

2845
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:31,381
it's harder to read.

2846
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:33,520
Why that class?
Why don't you get a stick shift then?

2847
01:59:33,521 --> 01:59:35,080
What are you talking about?
Writes in cursive.

2848
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,720
I was like,
well,

2849
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:39,840
that's not easy to read clock.
They do that with lexuses.

2850
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:43,180
Maybe with alexa,
you're looking for a split second.

2851
01:59:43,181 --> 01:59:46,600
It's your time and it's not supposed to 
figure out what were the big hand is.

2852
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:49,480
Isn't it funny that digital watch has 
never really caught on?

2853
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,560
No.
Especially if you want to be classy,

2854
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:56,620
like get yourself a rolex.
Get yourself a nice cardiay yeah.

2855
01:59:57,221 --> 01:59:59,980
Not so much easier to read.
No more exact.

2856
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:01,780
You don't have to wind it.
What is it?

2857
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:05,370
What is it about that?
It's all aesthetic better.

2858
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:10,060
They used to make core with digital 
speedometer and it was so weak.

2859
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:12,680
Oh really?
You'd hear the growl again?

2860
02:00:13,610 --> 02:00:16,790
Put the fucking foot and gear.
You put the clutch in.

2861
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:19,900
Engaged ball.
You see the digital numbers.

2862
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:23,420
Like what kind of stupidity is this?
Something about it.

2863
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:27,160
You want to see that needle move?
You want to see it.

2864
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,360
You don't want to just.

2865
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:31,600
Did they ever remake of the kuda?
Because that's what I got.

2866
02:00:31,601 --> 02:00:33,890
I saw at brand new kuda the other day or
barracuda.

2867
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:34,630
Yeah.
Other people.

2868
02:00:34,631 --> 02:00:35,690
So yeah.
The challenge.

2869
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:37,200
Challenge challenge.
Yeah.

2870
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:42,940
Barracudas shape the,
the shared a lot of the same body shape 

2871
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:45,100
in a lot of the same challenges.
The hemi engine.

2872
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:45,850
Well,
you know,

2873
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:48,340
there's some would have somehow.
How are those cars?

2874
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:50,620
Because that was doing awesome.
Chris has one.

2875
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:52,150
Excuse me.
Oh bob,

2876
02:00:52,151 --> 02:00:54,160
or did you know that?
Aubrey,

2877
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:55,480
I'm going to tell you this before I 
forget.

2878
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,820
He runs a nail.
His website.

2879
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,230
Oh,
I found out about men.

2880
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,040
Uh,
yeah.

2881
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:03,300
My girlfriend told me about the same 
dude that sells,

2882
02:01:03,410 --> 02:01:05,640
that sells alpha brain,
which is legit.

2883
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,670
It's fine.
If you made fun of guys wearing nails on

2884
02:01:08,671 --> 02:01:10,410
that podcast,
I believe at one point.

2885
02:01:10,411 --> 02:01:12,750
And I looked over and I'm like,
the clam out hearing these.

2886
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:13,430
He did?
Yeah.

2887
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,130
You said something and maybe that made 
fun of dudes getting pedicures.

2888
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:22,220
Yeah,
but I think or like a ordinary people 

2889
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:22,220
that get nail polish now.
I'm like,

2890
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:23,880
I love over.
Yeah.

2891
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:26,790
You made some of the guys getting 
pedicures.

2892
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:31,940
I've met a ton of guys like manicures.
I'm sure I do iT all the time for 

2893
02:01:31,991 --> 02:01:32,850
manicures,
you know,

2894
02:01:32,851 --> 02:01:36,070
it's just like guys who get like a clear
gloss over.

2895
02:01:37,530 --> 02:01:39,090
You're just trying to look pretty.
I know.

2896
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,010
Taint used to do

2897
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,880
his nails,
you know,

2898
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:43,140
he's always painting his nails guys 
anytime.

2899
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:45,140
I was in college and a little bit 
afterwards.

2900
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:47,390
Well this guy runs on website.
Yeah,

2901
02:01:47,391 --> 02:01:49,210
it's a,
I forget what it's called.

2902
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,340
The alpha nails,
nails got alpha brain.

2903
02:01:52,341 --> 02:01:57,341
It's got alpha nails for that.
Do it like I love to put a little bit 

2904
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:02,560
before going out to suck some dick.
Dave navarro was on howard sTern the 

2905
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,910
other day and I was listening was 
fucking really compelling,

2906
02:02:04,911 --> 02:02:06,110
especially one part where they said 
that,

2907
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:11,170
you know america's most wanted.
They found his mom's murderer whose 

2908
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:13,730
mom's birthday's.
Navarro's mom found the guy on america's

2909
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:16,220
most wanted and that show got canceled.
Yeah.

2910
02:02:16,221 --> 02:02:21,221
You know the america's most wanted man.
They were talking about how many people 

2911
02:02:21,221 --> 02:02:21,440
have been caught because of america's 
most wanted.

2912
02:02:21,441 --> 02:02:24,080
It's a lot fucking directly because of 
that.

2913
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:25,490
They showed,
got caught.

2914
02:02:25,491 --> 02:02:27,110
He got caught directly because of that 
show.

2915
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:27,710
Amazing.
Well,

2916
02:02:27,711 --> 02:02:29,030
If you think about that show,
man,

2917
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,030
that does more good than how many people
watched millions.

2918
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,750
Millions of people are watching it and 
then that person is a fucking target.

2919
02:02:35,751 --> 02:02:39,570
Now turn this off.
Everybody turned stands,

2920
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,430
man.
People you know,

2921
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:42,340
you go,
you're working at a gas station.

2922
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,430
This guy pulls in.
Yeah,

2923
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:44,420
look,
get changed for 20.

2924
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:46,870
Like you motherfucker and you make a 
phone call and next thing,

2925
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:48,910
the next exit.
Bam.

2926
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:51,410
Good luck.
You can't go bonnie and clyde today,

2927
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:52,400
man.
It's too hard.

2928
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:55,130
Did you hear about those kids in Florida
that tried them?

2929
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:57,980
Try to do about a stripper and her two 
brothers,

2930
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:03,160
one of the fucking shooting spree and 
robbing banks had automatic weapons and 

2931
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:06,581
shit and they to start out in Florida 
and they just got caught in Colorado in 

2932
02:03:06,581 --> 02:03:06,581
a shootout.
Really?

2933
02:03:06,581 --> 02:03:08,770
The broad got hIt in the leg with a 
bullet and yeah,

2934
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:11,270
they were shooting at the cops and they 
didn't kill him.

2935
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:13,250
That's another car.
That's another warm country.

2936
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:15,980
Warm area,
Florida.

2937
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:19,100
It's another warm area.
Storms dude.

2938
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,110
Oh yeah.
Florida,

2939
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,050
Florida,
Florida.

2940
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,510
Florida is the land of the lost.
We've said it a bunch of times,

2941
02:03:26,511 --> 02:03:30,650
but it's true.
That is the most vacant city or the most

2942
02:03:30,651 --> 02:03:32,270
vacant state?
The most.

2943
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,630
There's something mentally,
mentally,

2944
02:03:35,631 --> 02:03:38,210
emotionally.
They're detached.

2945
02:03:38,211 --> 02:03:39,460
They're fucked up.
It's a.

2946
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,770
It's a weird.
I like going there.

2947
02:03:40,771 --> 02:03:41,630
It's a lot.
A lot of fun.

2948
02:03:41,631 --> 02:03:41,940
I mean,
there's.

2949
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:43,720
Don't get me wrong.
There's a lot of cool people there.

2950
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:46,940
My fucking parents live there.
It's not that everyone there is shitty,

2951
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:52,180
but there's so much.
So many people moved to Florida to 

2952
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:52,190
escape and to hide,
you know,

2953
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:57,191
somebody,
New York gangsters went down to Florida 

2954
02:03:57,191 --> 02:03:57,410
to lay low.
It's like whether,

2955
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:58,000
you know,
it's like,

2956
02:03:58,001 --> 02:04:01,430
it's like it's way worse style.
It's way worse.

2957
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:03,500
It's more like,
I would say it's,

2958
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:08,560
it's like the worst parts of parts of 
rural Florida.

2959
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:12,560
Jacksonville area or in between tampa or
something.

2960
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:17,840
Land dog.
that's where we're going to put our 

2961
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:17,840
keeper.
Had like real spells.

2962
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,070
That's we're going to put our compound.
Yeah.

2963
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:24,071
We're goIng to make it all out of cement
and steel so that know her it down like 

2964
02:04:24,951 --> 02:04:26,690
the um,
like the evil,

2965
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:29,070
um,
justice league that they have with that.

2966
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:30,140
Yeah.
They had an evil justice league.

2967
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:32,840
There was some swamp land.
Really not horse America,

2968
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,700
because if you wanted to be evil,
you'd go to a swamp,

2969
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:35,080
right?
yeah.

2970
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:35,810
No,
I could see them.

2971
02:04:35,811 --> 02:04:38,170
It was like the mix of plex,
that the anti

2972
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,830
superman.
I think that's tough.

2973
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,660
Watching this documentary on the Congo 
and people actually tried to move to the

2974
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:48,450
Congo,
like wealthy europeans came well because

2975
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:53,451
there's immense,
immense amount of resources in the 

2976
02:04:53,451 --> 02:04:55,401
Congo.
The Congo has diamonds and gold and 

2977
02:04:55,401 --> 02:04:55,401
there's this,
you know,

2978
02:04:55,401 --> 02:04:56,940
minerals,
there's a lot of money to be made in the

2979
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:59,970
Congo and that's why there's so much 
civil war they're going on right now.

2980
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:05,150
So many people getting murdered in the 
Congo because they're trying to rob all 

2981
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:08,211
the shit out of that region.
That's why all these women are getting 

2982
02:05:08,211 --> 02:05:08,211
raped.
I get the Congo is a terrible,

2983
02:05:08,211 --> 02:05:10,840
terrible place,
but at one credit for raping her,

2984
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:11,460
like,
what are you doing?

2985
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:16,620
Like because of the goal they want to 
take over villages that women 

2986
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:18,240
internalize.
The men won't demoralize the men,

2987
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:18,660
the,
the,

2988
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,220
the,
uh,

2989
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:21,990
a shoot the young men and rape the 
women.

2990
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:22,740
But,
um,

2991
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,790
the,
um,

2992
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,850
these wealthy europeans at the turn of 
the century tried to build mansions 

2993
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:28,850
there.
They,

2994
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:32,950
all this wood court,
they have these beautiful mansions in 

2995
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:32,950
the Congo,
completely abandoned.

2996
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:38,090
It was overrun with jungle and monsters 
and fucking spiders that act in packs 

2997
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:41,520
and big cats.
And chimpanzees,

2998
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:46,550
I mean,
you can't fucking just build a house 

2999
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,550
there,
dude,

3000
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:47,100
and play polo in your backyard because 
you got some money,

3001
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,520
like a lot of really wealthy people.
Like this is an amazing place.

3002
02:05:50,521 --> 02:05:55,521
We're going to build a home here and 
this is back when people didn't even 

3003
02:05:55,521 --> 02:05:55,521
have,
you know,

3004
02:05:55,521 --> 02:05:56,520
they didn't even have like powerful 
boats,

3005
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:57,810
you know,
they didn't have planes,

3006
02:05:57,811 --> 02:06:02,811
they didn't have cars,
but they're moving fucking big boards 

3007
02:06:02,811 --> 02:06:02,940
and all this,
uh,

3008
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:07,941
you know,
construction equipment in there and 

3009
02:06:07,941 --> 02:06:07,941
they're trying to build houses in the 
Congo.

3010
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:10,650
That's just like building in a swamp.
You know,

3011
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:11,550
the same thing.

3012
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,830
Look at these body kits for these 
electric cars.

3013
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:17,680
If you searched google for a body kit,
they have like little cafe,

3014
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:20,040
boz,
little porsches.

3015
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,630
Look at that little,
little mini cars.

3016
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:26,570
The court vet whole.
No,

3017
02:06:26,571 --> 02:06:26,810
no,
no.

3018
02:06:26,811 --> 02:06:28,140
These you drive.
Scroll up,

3019
02:06:28,141 --> 02:06:29,340
scroll up,
scroll up a little bit.

3020
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:32,310
I can scroll up a little.
You put like a different bottle one that

3021
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:32,660
corvette

3022
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:34,350
gt.
That is,

3023
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:36,630
I Mean the career gt,
the porsche.

3024
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:37,370
That is nasty.

3025
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:39,250
And that's like a smart car.
Yeah.

3026
02:06:39,251 --> 02:06:43,510
It's just like body kits you can buy for
the smart a lot of money.

3027
02:06:43,511 --> 02:06:45,550
Do those look pretty,
pretty fancy schmancy?

3028
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:46,480
Yeah.
That's pretty sweet.

3029
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:49,630
But the batteries for that,
that leaf thing,

3030
02:06:49,631 --> 02:06:52,210
you're talking about $10,000
a battery.

3031
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:55,090
$10,000
a may take eight hours to charge.

3032
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:56,440
Eight hours.
Whoa.

3033
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:01,520
Yeah.
They'd have to get a little better than 

3034
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:01,520
those little smart car.
Fake ferrari's are the time.

3035
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:03,430
I see you mentioned this all driven 
around with these things.

3036
02:07:03,431 --> 02:07:04,300
Yeah.
It's $10,000.

3037
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:07,800
You get $5 back.
The government immediately you get 5,000

3038
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:09,220
back from the government immediately.
Yeah.

3039
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:10,930
So it's $5,000
for a battery?

3040
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:11,950
No,
for the charging.

3041
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:16,540
Could I would get this new charges?
Those are fucking bad ass a cool.

3042
02:07:16,541 --> 02:07:19,330
I'd like to talk.
I like to go to the goldman.

3043
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:19,930
Yeah.
Like that.

3044
02:07:19,931 --> 02:07:22,570
Yeah.
Why doesn't someone make like a real one

3045
02:07:22,571 --> 02:07:24,040
like that?
Like make it fast?

3046
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:24,820
Yeah,
right.

3047
02:07:24,821 --> 02:07:26,680
I'll give it some power.
What looks like a micro machine.

3048
02:07:26,950 --> 02:07:28,030
That's what.
That's exactly.

3049
02:07:28,031 --> 02:07:31,540
They look,
someday they'll be laughing at all this.

3050
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:34,990
You had to actually go somewhere and 
just beam up

3051
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:38,170
old man.
Go to the baCk.

3052
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:39,610
Yeah.
People will,

3053
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:43,090
will have on the body.
They'll have some ability to fly through

3054
02:07:43,091 --> 02:07:44,750
the air and manipulate,
you know,

3055
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:47,800
manipulate the matter around them to fly
around.

3056
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:48,690
That'S gonna.
That's,

3057
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:51,430
that's definitely gonna happen.
Some Day they're going to be laughing at

3058
02:07:51,431 --> 02:07:56,431
stupid people in their cars.
They rely on traCtion to slow down.

3059
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
What if the rubber pop.
I know they were getting into accidents 

3060
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,000
all the time.
They didn't blow outs.

3061
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,790
They were idiots.
Yeah.

3062
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:09,310
The lady,
we look at people on horses with the 

3063
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:09,310
horse legs broke.
You gotta shoot it.

3064
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:09,310
No,
your car.

3065
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:14,450
Your car.
That's what if the car dies so you can 

3066
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:14,590
just get rid of it.
Let's just get rid of it.

3067
02:08:14,591 --> 02:08:19,591
They just got rid of their cars.
Like someday there'll be no need to 

3068
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:19,591
recycle because we,
we,

3069
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:19,990
we,
we will never,

3070
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:25,020
you know,
we don't ever look at resources that 

3071
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:25,020
way.

3072
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:25,020
We'll,
we'll,

3073
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:27,400
we'll be in harmony with nature.
Maybe.

3074
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:31,240
Maybe not.
And we were just fucking pigs.

3075
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:36,690
Gluttons.
Maybe we are here to eat the sandwich 

3076
02:08:36,690 --> 02:08:38,851
world and maybe if the sandwich.
That was my thing and my beginning of my

3077
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:44,341
showtime special,
but I said that I look at people like 

3078
02:08:44,341 --> 02:08:44,341
mold on a sandwich.
You look at mold on a sandwich,

3079
02:08:44,341 --> 02:08:47,230
you don't see individual mold spores 
with individual personalities.

3080
02:08:47,490 --> 02:08:52,490
If you were an alien life form 
completely alien to earth and you saw 

3081
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:52,750
human beings,
you would go there as a growth.

3082
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:57,870
This is a girl.
You look at cities and you know the fly 

3083
02:08:57,870 --> 02:08:57,940
into los angeles.
He looked at the the nature.

3084
02:08:57,941 --> 02:08:59,530
Look at the ocean,
the mountains.

3085
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:01,560
It's all beautiful and natural and then 
you see cities.

3086
02:09:01,561 --> 02:09:04,030
It really does look like something's 
growing there.

3087
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,100
And I said,
well maybe that's what we're here for.

3088
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:10,720
Maybe we are just like mold or sandwich 
maybe over here to we're here to meet,

3089
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:12,460
eat the sandwich.
You know,

3090
02:09:12,610 --> 02:09:13,900
it's really.
Maybe that's it.

3091
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:17,230
Maybe we're here to fuck things up.
Probably noT.

3092
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:21,340
Maybe we don't have a fucking purpose.
Build the robots to kill us.

3093
02:09:21,810 --> 02:09:22,530
It's just,
it's.

3094
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:27,590
So.
It seems to be the process of 

3095
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:29,431
complexity,
like we're a part of the process of 

3096
02:09:29,431 --> 02:09:31,351
complexity and that definitely seen if 
there is a purpose or a need or a 

3097
02:09:31,351 --> 02:09:32,320
direction that everything's going in,
it's going in that way.

3098
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:34,060
everything is getting more and more 
complex.

3099
02:09:34,061 --> 02:09:39,061
It seems to be inevitable.
It seems to be an ethic seems to be 

3100
02:09:39,061 --> 02:09:39,460
this.
The way things work well,

3101
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:42,640
when you think about it,
of what everything.

3102
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:45,550
Everything is moving in a direction of 
complexity.

3103
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:48,850
It's all a lot more advanced really 
fast,

3104
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:53,550
but the whole universe is.
The universe starts out with a,

3105
02:09:53,551 --> 02:09:54,610
you know,
a small,

3106
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:57,430
tiny spot,
smaller than the head of a pin blows up,

3107
02:09:57,431 --> 02:10:00,040
expands multicellular life forums.

3108
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:03,940
That book comes intelligent sent in,
able to change its environment.

3109
02:10:03,941 --> 02:10:08,941
Then it starts changing at a rapid pace.
It all seems to be a direction and 

3110
02:10:08,941 --> 02:10:09,040
ethic.
So what do you think?

3111
02:10:09,041 --> 02:10:11,380
What are you going to do differently?
I can't do anything differently.

3112
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:16,381
I think what we're trying to pretend 
that we have it solved and we're trying 

3113
02:10:16,381 --> 02:10:16,580
to pretend like,
oh,

3114
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:20,020
we as people we need to get together.
It would be nice if we were cool to each

3115
02:10:20,021 --> 02:10:21,250
other.
That would be nice.

3116
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:24,520
It would be nice if we could all enjoy 
our time here and.

3117
02:10:24,521 --> 02:10:25,900
And you know,
and not be concerned.

3118
02:10:25,930 --> 02:10:29,750
That would be nice sources.
Yes.

3119
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:32,410
Either way before those codes,
even when it's not nice at san francisco

3120
02:10:32,411 --> 02:10:33,940
is still people are cooler.
Nicer.

3121
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,940
Yeah.
Well let's.

3122
02:10:34,941 --> 02:10:36,500
Because they moved away from the east 
coast.

3123
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:41,800
Everybody initially landed on the east 
coast and the ones who couldn't take it 

3124
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:41,800
anymore,
so fuck this.

3125
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:45,230
I'm Going west and they kept going.
I think the one thing that we can do,

3126
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,790
everybody says y'all we need to,
you know,

3127
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:51,290
people need to figure out a way to work 
this out and we need to work together to

3128
02:10:51,291 --> 02:10:56,291
change the way that.
I don't know if that's gonna I have a 

3129
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:56,291
feeling that what we're doing is 
natural.

3130
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:59,300
I have a feeling what we're doing,
war corruption,

3131
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:04,510
the depletion of resources.
It seems to me that every other animal 

3132
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:07,790
that does fucked up things,
whether it's hyenas kidnapping dogs.

3133
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:10,090
Have you ever seen that?
Or if you're seeing that not heinous.

3134
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:13,190
Baboons kidnapping puppies,
so they raised puppies.

3135
02:11:13,191 --> 02:11:14,660
They have feral puppies that go.
Yeah,

3136
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:17,120
they become dogs.
They stay with them their whole life and

3137
02:11:17,121 --> 02:11:20,420
they guard their camps so the babylon 
and sleep at night and the dogs bark.

3138
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,970
It's intense.
It's complicated though,

3139
02:11:22,971 --> 02:11:23,630
you know,
but.

3140
02:11:23,690 --> 02:11:26,360
But people look at it and they don't go,
oh my god,

3141
02:11:26,361 --> 02:11:27,710
what is this?
They go,

3142
02:11:27,711 --> 02:11:28,820
oh,
well this is natural.

3143
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,730
The baboons have figured out that if 
they kidnap these puppies,

3144
02:11:31,731 --> 02:11:33,110
they can get these puppies to guard the 
camp.

3145
02:11:33,111 --> 02:11:35,870
It's like natural for humans to war with
each other.

3146
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:38,720
Yes.
One hundred percent natural doesn't mean

3147
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:39,610
it's good for us.
No,

3148
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:44,620
it doesn't mean it's good for us,
but it's sorta means that it's going to 

3149
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:44,620
see.
But you say good for us.

3150
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:46,280
You're talking about,
you're talking about you.

3151
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:50,210
You is definitely good for those people 
that are getting money out of the war.

3152
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:51,820
You know,
you say it's not.

3153
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:56,980
But for those dick cheney characters 
that are getting billions of dollars 

3154
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:57,560
while a little brown people get bombed 
on it is good for them.

3155
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:02,590
They profit for yes.
So it is natural for someone who is 

3156
02:12:02,590 --> 02:12:07,301
unscrupulous to pursue those,
those paths because there's money to be 

3157
02:12:07,301 --> 02:12:07,301
made from it.

3158
02:12:07,301 --> 02:12:08,020
And I think that,
you know,

3159
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,460
even though my print out short,
should it mean it's,

3160
02:12:10,461 --> 02:12:15,461
it's frowned upon for a bunch of reasons
because we're all in this together and 

3161
02:12:15,461 --> 02:12:18,611
you know,
and we all think that people shouldn't 

3162
02:12:18,611 --> 02:12:18,611
be treating each other like that and I 
completely agree,

3163
02:12:18,611 --> 02:12:22,070
but on a natural starfish or how's that 
work?

3164
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:27,080
Never hear that thing where it's like a.
The guy picked up a starfish on the 

3165
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:27,080
beach,
throw it back in the ocean.

3166
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:29,300
yeah.
It was another friend was like,

3167
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,310
there's thousands of starfish on the 
beach,

3168
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:32,870
like you can't possibly hope to save 
them all.

3169
02:12:32,871 --> 02:12:34,910
Like what difference are you making?
Right?

3170
02:12:34,911 --> 02:12:35,330
Then he goes,
well,

3171
02:12:35,331 --> 02:12:40,100
it matters that wants to go first.
So I'm more of like an individual,

3172
02:12:40,101 --> 02:12:41,540
smaller level.
Somebody to traffic.

3173
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,400
Yes.
Well look,

3174
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:45,590
anything you'd really easy to make a 
difference.

3175
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:47,090
Anything you do that makes the world 
better,

3176
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:48,980
whether it's telling jokes to make 
people laugh,

3177
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:52,220
making a song that people like,
just saying hi to someone at the grocery

3178
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:54,260
store and it gives them a nice warm 
smile.

3179
02:12:54,890 --> 02:12:59,890
AnYthing you do that's positive is good.
Anything you do that helps people is 

3180
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:03,191
good.
Anything you do that makes this 

3181
02:13:03,191 --> 02:13:03,191
experience better,
but ultimately it's all temporary.

3182
02:13:03,191 --> 02:13:05,180
The entire experience of life on this 
planet,

3183
02:13:05,181 --> 02:13:06,650
for everyone,
including your,

3184
02:13:06,651 --> 02:13:09,730
your future children.
It's all completely temporary.

3185
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:10,820
Enjoy it.
Yeah,

3186
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:15,620
you got to enjoy it,
but the direction that it's going,

3187
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:18,560
if you were looking at this direction,
if you are looking at human behavior,

3188
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:22,250
if you were looking at any other animal 
that was behaving like this,

3189
02:13:22,251 --> 02:13:25,190
you would assume that it's natural.
When bees make beehives,

3190
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,230
you assume it's natural.
This is what they do,

3191
02:13:27,231 --> 02:13:29,750
and ants make some giant complicated ant
farms.

3192
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:31,680
You know they make Incredible anthills 
man,

3193
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:35,430
monstrous giant constructions.
We just assume that it's all natural.

3194
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:40,640
When,
when human beings act crazy and selfish 

3195
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:44,541
and delusional and fuck up the 
environment and war with each other and 

3196
02:13:44,541 --> 02:13:47,931
dropping bombs on each other,
we should probably assume that it's 

3197
02:13:47,931 --> 02:13:47,931
natural.

3198
02:13:47,931 --> 02:13:49,290
We should probablY assume that this is 
a.

3199
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:52,680
This is what this species does.
We just are so cocky.

3200
02:13:52,681 --> 02:13:55,320
We think that we can avoid.
Our nature were so cocky.

3201
02:13:55,321 --> 02:13:57,980
We think that we can manipulate our 
nature and maybe we can recount.

3202
02:13:57,990 --> 02:14:02,990
That's what I put laws out of.
It just kind of slows it down.

3203
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:08,650
It's.
It stops it from being completely 

3204
02:14:08,650 --> 02:14:10,821
chaotic and that mean most of the laws 
are set up so people can have more fun 

3205
02:14:10,821 --> 02:14:15,290
and enjoy more time here and have more 
pleasure and less to protect both of 

3206
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:15,290
them.
Yeah,

3207
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:15,600
yeah.
Less,

3208
02:14:15,601 --> 02:14:16,830
less,
less pain,

3209
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:21,831
more pleasure.
Make this this transient moment feel 

3210
02:14:21,831 --> 02:14:22,410
better for the people that are 
participating in it,

3211
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:24,120
but when you get past that,
man,

3212
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:26,340
what is it?
What the fuck is all this welcome?

3213
02:14:26,341 --> 02:14:27,680
War never ends.
How come?

3214
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:29,940
How come we're always coming up with new
reasons for it?

3215
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:32,460
How about corporate corruption?
Never ends 2011.

3216
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,860
This belief,
this $16,000,000,000,000

3217
02:14:34,861 --> 02:14:36,930
bail out thing that we're hearing about,
you know,

3218
02:14:36,931 --> 02:14:41,931
how come you know,
how come there's so much money missing 

3219
02:14:41,931 --> 02:14:44,751
in Iraq and Afghanistan?
It's billions of dollars and cash went 

3220
02:14:44,751 --> 02:14:44,751
over there.
I don't know where the fuck it is,

3221
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:48,780
but yet or rolls on,
despite all protests,

3222
02:14:48,781 --> 02:14:52,710
corruption rolls on despite our pro.
All protests on people agree with it.

3223
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:54,840
Yeah,
they was another Corruption.

3224
02:14:54,841 --> 02:14:56,730
But with war,
a lot of people agree with it.

3225
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:59,180
It's because they're ignorant.
They don't understand me.

3226
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:02,190
Go read war was a racket by general.
Smedley butler.

3227
02:15:02,670 --> 02:15:04,560
Nineteen 33.
This fucking guy,

3228
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:07,990
major general,
major general in the marines wrote,

3229
02:15:08,010 --> 02:15:11,190
wrote this fucking incredible book and 
incredible paper about,

3230
02:15:11,191 --> 02:15:12,210
uh,
about war,

3231
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:16,830
about how all his career.
He thought that he was protecting people

3232
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:22,510
and trying to promote freedom.
And really he was just making things 

3233
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:24,240
safe for bankers,
making things safe for oil companies.

3234
02:15:24,241 --> 02:15:27,600
It's all about money and that's why he 
wrote war is a racket,

3235
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:28,210
you know,
you know,

3236
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:33,230
the idea of a racket being something 
that's corrupt and set up the only army 

3237
02:15:33,230 --> 02:15:33,240
really because other people have 
artemis.

3238
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:34,590
Yeah,
exactly.

3239
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:37,710
Otherwise it's really important at all.
Yeah.

3240
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:40,230
Um,
what a fucking bummer.

3241
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:45,380
Stupid way then.
So on a positive note,

3242
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:50,720
you're,
you're fucking touring all over the 

3243
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:50,720
country now,
man.

3244
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:50,720
you,
you've completely over the last,

3245
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:53,580
like year and a half.
You completely broken through.

3246
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:55,630
Yeah,
I feel like I feel like a,

3247
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:57,490
like a more of a draw,
just like,

3248
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,650
I don't know if that's happening.
you're a real comic now.

3249
02:16:00,190 --> 02:16:02,170
How much of that is your podcast?
A lot.

3250
02:16:02,230 --> 02:16:07,230
A lot.
That's the only been for four or five 

3251
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:07,230
months,
but that four or five months.

3252
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:08,200
Big pockets too.
It helps us a shit ton.

3253
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:13,590
Um,
and then I feel like my comment has 

3254
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:15,841
gotten better.
It's hitting those sort of a new little 

3255
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:15,841
down and dirty

3256
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:16,820
norton and all the internet exposure.
you've got a lot of internet exposure.

3257
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

3258
02:16:18,230 --> 02:16:21,420
Well this podcast is just like being on 
a radio station.

3259
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:21,980
It's like being on there

3260
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:27,280
radio stations,
like every time I go on stage now 

3261
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:27,280
somewhere there's people workout sets.
I don'T promote it all.

3262
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:27,570
Just,
you know,

3263
02:16:27,790 --> 02:16:30,120
comedies with him and then it's like you
hear people clapping,

3264
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:30,970
I getS your heart.
Yeah.

3265
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:32,020
it's nice.
It's really Nice.

3266
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:33,310
Yeah,
it's crazy.

3267
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:38,490
You alwaYs needed something.
You always needed that and we always 

3268
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:38,490
thought that it would be something like 
comedy central.

3269
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:43,260
I met robbie from just for laughs.
Told me this like two years ago when I 

3270
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:43,260
went.
He was like,

3271
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:44,290
yo,
I ain't going to do a special man.

3272
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,300
That's just not going to be your path.
Look at your comedy.

3273
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:47,860
Really.
You think comedy central?

3274
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,780
Let me think about it.
To comedy central.

3275
02:16:49,781 --> 02:16:51,850
Put my special on.
I know it's kind of ridiculous,

3276
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:54,670
but he was like,
it's just not going to be your path.

3277
02:16:54,671 --> 02:16:56,590
They're not going to book you,
so fuckiNg find another waY.

3278
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:57,910
Right?
I dunno.

3279
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:59,470
Maybe it's internet stuff.
I have no idea.

3280
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:01,660
That's what did it.
It's all human merit.

3281
02:17:01,770 --> 02:17:03,240
Definitely.
Yeah,

3282
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:05,450
for sure.
Selling out because of it.

3283
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:06,520
Yeah.
It's,

3284
02:17:06,521 --> 02:17:07,730
um,
it's a,

3285
02:17:07,731 --> 02:17:10,270
it's a totally new ball game man and you
know,

3286
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:15,271
and it's,
it's a much more intimate relationship 

3287
02:17:15,271 --> 02:17:17,341
with the people that are listening first
of all because it kind of goes right 

3288
02:17:17,341 --> 02:17:17,341
into their ears.

3289
02:17:17,341 --> 02:17:20,490
They're wearing earplugs and shit a lot 
or they're in their car alone and it's 

3290
02:17:20,490 --> 02:17:24,630
like you're sitting with them in traffic
or you're sitting with them while they 

3291
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:24,630
work.
Sorry about traffic.

3292
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:28,880
So maybe you're in waiting to use the 
treadmill and someone's talking,

3293
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,880
just give out to standing on the 
treadmill,

3294
02:17:30,881 --> 02:17:33,460
talking to the fat girl next to him,
get off the treadmill.

3295
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:35,400
Um,
but it's,

3296
02:17:35,401 --> 02:17:37,150
it's the,
the connection is different.

3297
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:38,230
It's different than.
yeah,

3298
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:42,430
there's never been a time like this man.
Tons of people in Canada don't have tons

3299
02:17:42,431 --> 02:17:43,420
of people there.
More than one.

3300
02:17:43,421 --> 02:17:48,421
But number one in Canada all the time.
We're number one on itunes of all 

3301
02:17:48,421 --> 02:17:49,060
podcasts.
We've been on a bunch of times.

3302
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:51,850
I met that guy president,
remember him and kept scott.

3303
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:53,170
Yes,
I met him when I want.

3304
02:17:53,171 --> 02:17:55,150
It's kind of cool,
like it used to be a comic.

3305
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:56,500
yeah,
yuk.

3306
02:17:56,501 --> 02:18:01,501
Yuks is a good change to,
but I think they keep comics were doing 

3307
02:18:01,501 --> 02:18:01,501
other chains,
you know,

3308
02:18:01,501 --> 02:18:01,730
they do it.
It's annoying as shit.

3309
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:04,310
I just don't.
Well you don't have to,

3310
02:18:04,930 --> 02:18:06,060
but that's weak.
You have to.

3311
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:08,470
And vancouver's and cooks anymore.
I think that one's done.

3312
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:11,560
I think I just did it though.
It was another club.

3313
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,270
I forget the name of it.
Absolute.

3314
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:17,020
I don't remember guys going to be mad 
because he was a nice guy and I hung out

3315
02:18:17,021 --> 02:18:17,710
with them.
What?

3316
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,080
The yucca,
I think it's called absolute comedy,

3317
02:18:20,081 --> 02:18:23,680
but my max out because it in toronto.
I don't know.

3318
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:25,600
It's in vancouver,
but it's a,

3319
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:30,750
it's the same place.
It's still a great tight little blocks 

3320
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:30,750
off the main street.
Yeah.

3321
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:35,790
Whoever knows it.
Just send it to me on twitter and I say 

3322
02:18:35,790 --> 02:18:35,790
it because I feel bad.
But uh,

3323
02:18:35,790 --> 02:18:35,890
we did it.

3324
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:38,320
Um,
when I was down there we did the,

3325
02:18:38,321 --> 02:18:43,321
uh,
the club and then we went over and did 

3326
02:18:43,321 --> 02:18:44,110
the next day we did it after the ufc.
Yeah.

3327
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:44,740
It's fun,
man.

3328
02:18:44,741 --> 02:18:45,550
It's great.
Yeah.

3329
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,740
It's fun to go to work.
Have somewhere.

3330
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:47,930
Oh,
I did it after the williams.

3331
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:49,240
I did it friday night.
Yeah,

3332
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:54,270
it's great.
And Canada is just the one of the best 

3333
02:18:54,270 --> 02:18:55,090
place to fucking perform of smart 
audience.

3334
02:18:55,420 --> 02:19:00,420
Like they understand what comedy is 
where you're supposed to be quiet and 

3335
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,100
listen in graphite crazy and then be 
quiet again and listen.

3336
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,730
They just understand.
I know,

3337
02:19:03,731 --> 02:19:06,390
it's weird.
It's like a festival stuff too,

3338
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,290
but it's just like,
it's not just a sMall.

3339
02:19:08,291 --> 02:19:10,800
Those are the gigs we did always well 
behaved.

3340
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,900
Especially even your show.
Yeah.

3341
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,050
Savage,
they don't really.

3342
02:19:14,051 --> 02:19:16,090
There are different types of animals in 
Canada.

3343
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:18,850
They're like smart cottey it comedy 
audience animals.

3344
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:23,910
Yeah.
And so you're doing a lot of just for 

3345
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:23,910
laughs yet you just did the montreal 
comedy festival,

3346
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:28,830
right?
Was what'd you do after you did your 

3347
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:28,830
storytellers shit up there.
That's another

3348
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:33,040
thing you've gotten really good at.
You've sort of organized a series of 

3349
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:36,551
shows.
What's all storytellers shows where you 

3350
02:19:36,551 --> 02:19:37,040
get up and people just,
it's a theme.

3351
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:42,070
Everybody has a material they do about 
whatever fucking theme it is and made 

3352
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:44,170
that part of my game a lot stronger.
Your storytelling part.

3353
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:45,180
Yeah.
Um,

3354
02:19:45,310 --> 02:19:50,310
yeah,
because you could stretch out on that 

3355
02:19:50,310 --> 02:19:50,310
stage,
right?

3356
02:19:50,310 --> 02:19:52,150
Yeah.
And I have to keep coming up with 

3357
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:52,150
stories and figuring out where,
what funny is,

3358
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:55,541
you know,
and like working at them like I got to 

3359
02:19:55,541 --> 02:19:55,541
fucking show and four weeks I have a 
story.

3360
02:19:55,541 --> 02:19:55,541
I don't have one.
that sounds good.

3361
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,970
Yeah.
You were hurting for a long time,

3362
02:19:56,971 --> 02:20:01,971
man.
Trying to break through the comedy 

3363
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:03,321
scene,
but now you've become a legit 

3364
02:20:03,321 --> 02:20:03,321
professional comedian.

3365
02:20:03,321 --> 02:20:06,200
Yeah.
I met these people that run the comic 

3366
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,511
strip in edmonton.
The husband's like a comic and the wife 

3367
02:20:08,511 --> 02:20:09,090
has just runs it,
you know,

3368
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,140
and uh,
it was like,

3369
02:20:10,141 --> 02:20:10,710
oh,
nice to meet you.

3370
02:20:10,711 --> 02:20:12,470
Another 15 year old son was like,
to me it was like,

3371
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:13,500
can I take my picture with you?

3372
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:15,580
Amazing.
And I was like,

3373
02:20:15,581 --> 02:20:16,150
yeah.
You were saying,

3374
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:19,000
who is this kid?

3375
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:22,810
Serious,
you're fucking ruined in.

3376
02:20:22,811 --> 02:20:26,890
This kid's brain is going to get beat up
by some mexicans.

3377
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,950
He's going to be out.
I haven't gotten that far taco.

3378
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:33,280
But there's mexicans up there and do 
know is there's a job,

3379
02:20:33,281 --> 02:20:35,290
there's mexicans,
they'll find a way,

3380
02:20:35,291 --> 02:20:36,760
man,
they'll find a way.

3381
02:20:36,761 --> 02:20:41,200
I do.
It's called comedy mix comedy max.

3382
02:20:41,201 --> 02:20:42,040
Yeah.
Thank you.

3383
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:44,080
The whatever.
That's the guy's name,

3384
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:46,600
but what a brilliant fucking thing.
Twitter is,

3385
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:48,360
man.
Just being able to ask,

3386
02:20:48,430 --> 02:20:51,040
ask a question like that.
It's like your own little wikipedia.

3387
02:20:52,660 --> 02:20:55,840
How many a friendship now to followers?
19,000

3388
02:20:55,841 --> 02:20:56,200
dollars.
Shit.

3389
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:58,660
Samson.
Follow our issue.

3390
02:20:58,661 --> 02:20:59,650
Fear.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3391
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:04,680
a r I s h a f f I r and follow red band.
I'm a little dirty though,

3392
02:21:05,531 --> 02:21:07,210
so if you're a christian you don't.
Yeah.

3393
02:21:07,211 --> 02:21:10,090
That was funny that you said some girl 
got kidnapped,

3394
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:13,090
a 14 year old girl who kidnapped and he 
goes.

3395
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:16,750
I remember sometimes when I was young I 
wished I had a different family

3396
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:21,020
that's too far and I thought about it.
I was like,

3397
02:21:21,021 --> 02:21:21,800
alright,
well maybe.

3398
02:21:21,801 --> 02:21:22,810
And I was like,
no,

3399
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:25,730
I appreciate it as a job.
It's not my own experience getting red.

3400
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:29,500
Fortunate that that girl got a kid now.
But you were talking about writing.

3401
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:32,000
If I write it like,
oh god,

3402
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:37,680
did you have kids?
I have kids and I didn't really like 

3403
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,180
that.
My favorite is my favorite is the people

3404
02:21:38,181 --> 02:21:41,180
who let you know there aren't following 
you on follow,

3405
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:42,560
so rude.
It's like,

3406
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:43,580
all right,
if you don't like it,

3407
02:21:43,581 --> 02:21:44,290
you can just go.
You're.

3408
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:46,430
You're trying to make some point.
I don't care.

3409
02:21:46,431 --> 02:21:47,660
It's totally cool.
Not that like me.

3410
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:48,620
It's totally cool.

3411
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:50,420
Yeah.
I had a bunch of matter.

3412
02:21:50,421 --> 02:21:52,900
Unfollow me because I was making fun of 
easter ones,

3413
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:58,300
so yeah,
the easter bunny rabbit.

3414
02:21:58,701 --> 02:22:00,430
Every easter.
Just a piss your faces.

3415
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,360
don't say that to eddie bravo.
He loves rabbits.

3416
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:03,200
Really?
Yeah,

3417
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:04,660
he's on a rabbit kick.
My lover.

3418
02:22:04,661 --> 02:22:05,930
I frank.
Harvoni has a rabbit.

3419
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:06,630
Yeah,
loves it,

3420
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:10,190
but I got a bunch of my yard and now I'm
going to eat them when the shit hits the

3421
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:11,540
fan.
boom.

3422
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:12,980
Schelok lock.
Boom.

3423
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:16,820
So just to reiterate to her this 
weekend,

3424
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:22,060
August 13th,
we're in milwaukee at the papp's 

3425
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:22,060
theater.
That's this saturday night.

3426
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:24,280
It's me and joey diaz.
Oh,

3427
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:29,290
rare combination support.
It's one of the few places where joey 

3428
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:31,710
diaz apparently has no warrants.
Just hasn't been there.

3429
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:38,070
It has actually told me he's played some
cool places in Wisconsin in a long time 

3430
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:38,070
ago.
He's been there back in the day.

3431
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:40,710
He knows apparently some great places 
where we can get good italian food.

3432
02:22:40,711 --> 02:22:43,320
That's what he keeps rant about the 
fucking spaghetti and meat sauce.

3433
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:44,460
So,
uh,

3434
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:45,030
that is,
uh,

3435
02:22:45,031 --> 02:22:46,950
this weekend,
August 13th.

3436
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:49,230
This saturday night we're fucking fired 
up the papp's theater.

3437
02:22:49,231 --> 02:22:52,680
It's supposed to be a beautiful place.

3440
02:22:55,310 --> 02:22:56,190
Um,

3441
02:22:56,490 --> 02:22:59,460
ari shaffir will be joining us on 
September 23rd.

3442
02:22:59,461 --> 02:23:01,600
Ari should is also coming.
That's the denver.

3443
02:23:01,601 --> 02:23:03,260
Why denver?
Colorado is always amazing.

3444
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:08,480
Zam was pitches and there's courses at 
ufc the next night we're already will 

3445
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:10,890

versus quentin rampage junior.

3446
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:16,940
Motherfucker at altitude.
Very difficult to have a five round 

3447
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:16,940
fight title,
altitude.

3448
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:19,320
A title fight in the fucking place where
the air is.

3449
02:23:19,321 --> 02:23:20,810
Thin is shit.
I love total funds.

3450
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:21,930
Fuck yeah.
You're doing.

3451
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:27,010

Thank you very much.
I'm 44 bitches.

3457
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:37,170
That's right.
You can still be retarded at 44.

3458
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:39,780
You can still be a child and never grow 
up.

3459
02:23:39,810 --> 02:23:43,020
It isn't.
It is possible to be a peter pan.

3460
02:23:43,021 --> 02:23:45,360
I will not mature.
I will stay this way.

3461
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:49,250
As long as my body stays healthy,
I will not get any more cranky than this

3462
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:54,350
is how I will get off my lawn.
KidS had that exact age.

3463

3467
02:24:07,191 --> 02:24:09,060
face knowing how much money you're 
saving and you can use that money to buy

3468
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:12,270
the new alpha brain pills that were 
selling from onnit.com.

3469
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:17,290
O n I t everY single fucking report I've
gotten back as positive.

I'm getting testimonial after 

3471
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:24,240
testimonial brian's been using.
I've been using iT.

3472
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:26,490
It's safe.
It's not dangerous.

3473
02:24:26,491 --> 02:24:29,410
These things that have all been.
Everything has been researched.

3474
02:24:29,411 --> 02:24:34,411
There's a frequently asked questions 
thing that we're putting together for 

3475
02:24:34,411 --> 02:24:37,401
[inaudible] dot com,
but there's actual science behind this 

3476
02:24:37,401 --> 02:24:40,010
and it's not like that fucking pill that
the bradley cooper took in that 

3477
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:43,340
limitless movie.
It's not going to make you into a 

3478
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:43,340
genius,
but it does make your brain feel good.

3479

You just took mushrooms from some dude.

If I get a perfect circle,

3491
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:19,200

Maynard is a weird guy.
I read a lot of weird things about him.

3496
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,250
It was a culture that he's good at

So I take him.
