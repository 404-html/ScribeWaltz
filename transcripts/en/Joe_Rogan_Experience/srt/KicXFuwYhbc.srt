00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,230
The,

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,610
I mean people ask me like why
would they want to be on TV?

4
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:07,530
Cause everybody wants to be on TV.

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,530
Like we talked to a bunch of
different clan groups and are they,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,393
the producers did,

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,920
most of them didn't want to be on TV but
there was like three or four that did

8
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,610
cause they,

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,230
they thought they were spreading the word.

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,280
Maybe they were,

11
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,230
you know,

12
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,430
what was their message like
when you were talking to them?

13
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:20,900
Like what,

14
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,220
what was the reason for them doing this?

15
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,160
They believe America is a
white country ordained by God.

16
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,320
That way they believe the
Bible says that's true.

17
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,930
They believe the Bible talks about a man.

18
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,961
That's what I'm saying.

19
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,440
It's like,

20
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm not telling you what I believe,

21
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:37,110
but they believed that the Bible doesn't
think that the racist should mix.

22
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:37,950
The Bible doesn't,

23
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,311
you know,

24
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,630
all these things that
people quite at the Bible,

25
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,490
the Bible is talking about
donkeys and they were like,

26
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,110
you know,

27
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,990
so the data and they believe that America
is a white country founded by white

28
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:47,210
people and that,

29
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,780
that the,

30
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,500
that the people who like the black people
in the Mexican people and eventually

31
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,540
the Catholics and the Jews only they
can say a cooler with Catholics.

32
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,310
Now these days the Catholics
should get to leave,

33
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
go back home.

34
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,960
And because America is a,

35
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,560
and the,

36
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,810
and the whole America is for white people
is the whole white is just a different

37
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,540
way of saying the white ethno state
thing that a lot of the people or the alt

38
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,374
right and the national,

39
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
the white nationalist movement say then,

40
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:10,770
so you know,

41
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,633
they,

42
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,770
they think that this is,

43
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,000
that they,

44
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,360
they think America's,

45
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
they think this,

46
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,340
the whole idea of America is that it's
for whites only and that the rest of us

47
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,174
need to go home.

48
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,410
I feel for you.

49
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,010
I mean I'd be standing there with these
people in the woods in Kentucky looking

50
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,490
into the eyes of madness,

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,200
whether we're in satin sheets over their
head with holes poked out for eyes.

52
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,870
Well it's sort of,

53
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,180
there was a lot of it that was fun.

54
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,470
I mean it was like we got there,

55
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,060
I got out of the car and
there's a line in the,

56
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:41,460
in the show where you can hear me
before you see that I'm going like,

57
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,260
oh this wasn't a good idea.

58
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,380
And that was really me saying
this was not a good idea.

59
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:49,740
That was not me making a joke cause I
see a phalanx of them and they're all

60
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:50,700
standing there at attention.

61
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,810
And right when we got there,

62
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,020
the guy who was an all blue was like
immediately goes into a rant about

63
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:55,471
Ferguson.

64
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:58,640
It was in 2014 so it was
all about Ferguson and how
black people aren't policed

65
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,610
themselves and do the
white man is going to Dah,

66
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:00,801
Dah,

67
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:00,961
Dah,

68
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,200
Dah.

69
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,290
While at the same time they don't
advocate violence cause it's clear that at

70
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,040
some point they were told if you talk
about violence the FBI will be here every

71
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,040
weekend.

72
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,610
You know,

73
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,061
so they're like,

74
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,871
we don't advocate violence.

75
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:10,760
We advocate self defense.

76
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,610
We don't hate black people,

77
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,240
we just love our people but also black
people can't look what they're doing in

78
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,510
Ferguson that shows that black people
aren't whatever blah blah blah are the

79
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,590
equivalent of the white man.

80
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,693
And uh,

81
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,870
and so I had to,

82
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:23,160
so when we first started shooting,

83
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,380
I,

84
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,950
there was this like this guy was just
gone off and I just heard it was like

85
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,770
having to take it and wondering is
this going to be the next three hours?

86
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,240
It's this kind of just like yelling.

87
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,800
And the producer stepped in and said,

88
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,634
all right everybody,

89
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,450
let's just,

90
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,040
oh we got to check the
camera for a second.

91
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,680
And we slowed it down and then we set
up chairs when we sat down and started

92
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,360
talking and it from that point forward,

93
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,280
they were so excited to talk about their
clan thing cause they don't get asked

94
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,090
that a lot.

95
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,150
That they sort of like eventually you
would if you weren't thinking that it was

96
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:48,721
the Klan,

97
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,081
you'd be like,

98
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,201
yeah,

99
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,520
it's just people talking
about their lives.

100
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,271
I don't agree with them,

101
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:51,580
but they're,

102
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,110
they're not,

103
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,100
they didn't stay angry.

104
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,950
I was talking to this photographer,

105
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,820
I was at this festival
this weekend and she had a,

106
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,230
uh,

107
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,810
a film camera you don't like,

108
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,910
do you develop your own Phipps?

109
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,130
She's,

110
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,581
oh no,

111
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,880
you can always develop black and
white because if you develop,

112
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,420
you know,

113
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,920
color pictures,

114
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,754
the fumes,

115
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,920
well they'll knock you right out.

116
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,301
And so I said,

117
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,180
so just a little bit of
that would be a great time.

118
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,163
It's a small,

119
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,870
so just get a little bit of that
and you can just huffing paint.

120
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,141
Yeah,

121
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,640
you could do a Goddamn job interview.

122
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Naylin maybe just a little bit us just
like crack a vial in front of Mike,

123
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,820
grow dose of a little bit of that.

124
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,050
Have you ever tried poppers?

125
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,010
Poppers are,

126
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,160
those are the things that they
crack them and they sniff it.

127
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,500
Emile nitrate or thing it's called no,

128
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,090
I did whip us in college.

129
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:43,781
Oh yeah,

130
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,700
I did that when I worked at a creamery.

131
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,010
I worked at Newport creamery.

132
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,790
It was like a ice cream
place and they had a,

133
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,080
the ice cream.

134
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,510
Those a big vats that,

135
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,620
what is the gas?

136
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,090
Nitrous oxide oxide,

137
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,281
right.

138
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

139
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,951
That's what it is.

140
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:57,430
Yeah.

141
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,941
And we would,

142
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,121
uh,

143
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,954
we would do

144
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,630
like socks off of it.

145
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,250
That killed a lot of brands.

146
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,400
That kills a lot of brands.

147
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,970
I remember I did one weekend in college
and then I think I did it on a Friday

148
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,590
night and on the Sunday I was just
walking around yelling all weird.

149
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,450
I don't know if I was forced into Yale
just because I was trying to justify it

150
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,650
how I felt or if it was a natural yell,

151
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,390
but yelling was happening.

152
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,230
Wow.

153
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,590
Yeah.

154
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,460
And you couldn't help it.

155
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,530
I don't know.

156
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,970
You know,

157
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,330
sometimes you ever just tweak
out by yourself just to,

158
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,280
you haven't you?

159
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,850
Never just,

160
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,070
you absolutely do.

161
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,180
After like a crazy workout.

162
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,390
Hi ma'am.

163
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,731
Yeah,

164
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,270
I have to work.

165
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,270
I'm usually spent week out just of Connor
at the way in was just tweaking out,

166
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,870
but it was for show which was shelf.

167
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,370
Sometimes you put a show for yourself,

168
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,420
change your state of
mind just by yourself.

169
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:52,751
Yeah.

170
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,231
Like people say,

171
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,040
if you smile,

172
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,060
change your mind.

173
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,510
Right.

174
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,760
It will change the way
your brain actually feels.

175
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,181
Well,

176
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,140
if you freak out,

177
00:04:59,141 --> 00:04:59,980
it probably does that too,

178
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,660
right?

179
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,170
Yeah.

180
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah,

181
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,350
definitely.

182
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,160
There's ways to do it.

183
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,410
I mean,

184
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,570
why Wildwood Indians,

185
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,501
native Americans,

186
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,280
when they would do those,

187
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,480
those battle cries.

188
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,560
Why else are they doing that?

189
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,783
But getting fired up.

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,300
Yeah.

191
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,400
You get hyped up by
yelling or singing a song.

192
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,480
Viking.

193
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,260
Yeah.

194
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,550
Is that New Zealand,

195
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,791
New Zealand,

196
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,540
isn't it?

197
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,960
Yeah.

198
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
Well they uh,

199
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,581
they would play,

200
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:25,900
it's this video of them plan the USA team.

201
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,950
Oh yeah.

202
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,830
And they're doing this
elaborate thing they're doing.

203
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,410
It's very elaborate.

204
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,580
And when just energetic and
they cut to the USA team.

205
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:37,930
And that kind of looking back,

206
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,670
Kinda just con,

207
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,511
not confused,

208
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,040
but just what's going on.

209
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,540
And they went through this whole thing.

210
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,200
Is this right here?

211
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,960
Yeah,

212
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,301
it did.

213
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,330
In a basketball game.

214
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:47,860
He had a basketball volume.

215
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:48,694
This is ridiculous.

216
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,743
Basketball

217
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,773
and

218
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,920
dusted by 45 points.

219
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,133
Yeah.

220
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,800
You playing NBA superstars,

221
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,970
you fuck the dummies?

222
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,631
What is this?

223
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,690
What a cult is for the it means
that's what they do all the time.

224
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,970
But it's just,

225
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,460
it seems so stupid.

226
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,780
Well,

227
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,700
it seems stupid if you
have you played basketball,

228
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,713
this is stupid.

229
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Something can have evolved as a virtue
in some circumstances and still be of the

230
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,450
type that if magnified beyond its
proper limits becomes pathological.

231
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,970
So let me tell you something
I learned about Hitler,

232
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,660
which really I haven't recovered
from my shock from this.

233
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,080
So we'd been looking at the relationship
between political belief and

234
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:36,914
personality.

235
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,641
Okay?

236
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,490
And your political belief is strongly
determined by your temperament.

237
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,670
So liberal left types are
high in trait openness.

238
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,650
That's creativity and
low in conscientiousness.

239
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:49,550
But you can fragment conscientiousness
up into industriousness and orderliness.

240
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,580
And the real predictor for
conservatism is an orderliness,

241
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,720
not industriousness.

242
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,681
And you might think,

243
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,670
well that's no surprise,

244
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,020
right wingers are more orderly,

245
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,730
hence Hitler's call for order,

246
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,211
let's say.

247
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,840
But it's one thing to s two to posit that.

248
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,130
And another thing to measure it,

249
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,050
now it's measurable and it appears
that orderliness is associated with

250
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,520
sensitivity to discussed.

251
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,950
And this is actually a really big deal.

252
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,970
It's a really big deal.

253
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:17,630
So there's a paper that was published
in plause one about three years ago

254
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:21,800
looking at the relationship between the
prevalence of infectious diseases and

255
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,360
authoritarian political attitudes.

256
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,200
And they did it country by country
and then within countries by state or

257
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,034
province.

258
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,820
And the correlation between the
prevalence of infectious diseases and

259
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:35,600
authoritarian slash right wing political
beliefs at the local individual level

260
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:36,620
was 0.6.

261
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,650
And so I want to take
this apart a little bit.

262
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,281
Okay.

263
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:45,200
So the idea is that this is part of
what you might describe as the extended

264
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,520
behavioral immune system.

265
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,540
And one of the problems with
the interactions between
groups of human beings in

266
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,890
our evolutionary past was,

267
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,471
well,

268
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,580
exactly what happened to
the native Americans is,

269
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:54,861
you know,

270
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,500
they came out and shook hands with
the Spanish can keystone doors,

271
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,420
and then within a couple of generations,

272
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,690
90% of them were dead of
smallpox and measles and mumps.

273
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,690
And so it's been a truism
in our evolutionary past
that if you meet a group of

274
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,260
isolated,

275
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,020
if you're a group of isolated humans
and you meet another group of isolated

276
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,670
humans and you trade pathogens,

277
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,300
there's a real possibility that you and
everyone you know are going to be dead

278
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,320
in no time flat.

279
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,920
And so we have a disgust mechanism
that that produces this implicit,

280
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,750
let's call it racial,

281
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,130
racial and ethnic bias.

282
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,710
That is part and parcel of
the human cognitive landscape.

283
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,710
But the problem with that is that it's
rooted in a disgust mechanism that

284
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,420
actually serves as a protective function.

285
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,260
Now,

286
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,460
when I was sorting this out,

287
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,330
I was reading Hitler's table talk and
Hitler's table talk is a very interesting

288
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:41,631
book.

289
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:42,470
It's a book,

290
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,670
a book of his spontaneous mealtime
utterances from 1939 to 1942 and I went

291
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,790
through with this new knowledge because
people think of conservatives as if like

292
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,010
or fascist as afraid of
those who are different.

293
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,973
They're not afraid,

294
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,000
they're disgusted.

295
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,600
And that's not the same thing because
you burn things you're disgusted by.

296
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,080
And so it was terrifying to me to
read it because then I also thought,

297
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,580
oh well disgust,

298
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:09,630
sensitivity is associated with orderliness
and you need to order in a society in

299
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,560
order to maintain it.

300
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:13,920
And the Germans are very orderly and that
was actually a canonical part of their

301
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:14,701
civilization.

302
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,370
And part of actually what
makes them great and powerful.

303
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,080
And that just had to tilt a little
farther than necessary and all of a sudden

304
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,790
everything needed to be get cleaned.

305
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,601
And you know,

306
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,360
Hitler talked about cleanliness all
the time and he actually meant that.

307
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,460
And so this thing that's emerging,

308
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:29,671
you know,

309
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,410
you talked about its biological basis,

310
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,730
it's evolutionary basis.

311
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,391
It is,

312
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,770
it's part of this deeply rooted disgust
system that protects us from dangerous

313
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,780
pathogens that can manifest itself in.

314
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,090
And does manifest itself
in the political realm.

315
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,380
It's not good.

316
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,070
So.
