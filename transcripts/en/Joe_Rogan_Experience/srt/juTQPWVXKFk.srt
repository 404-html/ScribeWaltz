1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,121
Here's Hillary.

3
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:05,090
Hillary turned brown.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,350
Yeah.

5
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,980
Flat earthers um,

6
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,380
forests aren't real.

7
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,161
Is that what they're saying?

8
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:09,610
Jamie?

9
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,880
The flat earthers we're gonna talk
about the flat earthers for one reason.

10
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,810
Um,

11
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,220
the reason why I wanted to bring this
up is because I think there's a lot of

12
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,640
folks out there that are super gullible
and I think they're being trolled.

13
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,400
I think they're being trolled by
people who put together these,

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,620
it's one of two options.

15
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,940
Either they're being trolled by people
who put together these elaborate

16
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,270
arguments for something that they don't
believe because they're just trying to

17
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:35,830
make money off of youtube views,

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,240
which is entirely possible.

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,920
And this needs to be thought of.

20
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,480
I mean really needs to be
considered because Lou youtube
videos can be extremely

21
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:47,530
lucrative if you can get a youtube
video with millions of hits and a lot of

22
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,560
these videos on all sorts of different
conspiracies and all sorts of different

23
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:53,410
crazy things can generate
that kind of volume.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,640
You're making real money,

25
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,780
pennies on the dollar.

26
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:56,521
But if it's millions,

27
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,010
yes,

28
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,340
Yup.

29
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,570
It starts becoming real money.

30
00:00:58,571 --> 00:00:59,051
It starts in,

31
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:00,340
if you do a bunch of them and you can,

32
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,570
you do them on a regular basis,

33
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,560
it becomes a Gig.

34
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,910
It becomes like what they do.

35
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,430
They create these silly videos,

36
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,850
but people who just don't have the time
or the inclination to actually read

37
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:16,540
scientific papers and
articles and journals and all
these different things that

38
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:21,160
explain how we've known for a long time.

39
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,183
The earth is round,

40
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,093
right?

41
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,541
Yeah.

42
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,300
It's a myth that a Columbus
proved that the earth is not flat,

43
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,134
that it's round.

44
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,730
They,

45
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,541
the ancients knew,

46
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,321
the Greeks knew.

47
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:31,154
Columbus knew.

48
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,190
Everyone knew a little bit then that it
was round and Koreans knew absolutely

49
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,710
depictions on clay,

50
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,181
right?

51
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:41,001
Drew it in clay.

52
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,160
They drew all the planets as circles.

53
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,610
Right?

54
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,330
They knew,

55
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,960
right.

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,390
I mean there's some obvious
simple ones anybody could do.

57
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,860
If you see an eclipse,

58
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,970
like a lunar eclipse,

59
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:52,220
you can see the Earth's
shadow on the moon.

60
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,054
It's round.

61
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,260
Uh,

62
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,590
you know,

63
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,130
if you,

64
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,510
if you're high enough and you know,

65
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,950
the ships are sailing out,

66
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,970
you can see the mass does.

67
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:03,290
The last thing you would see as the
whole drops over the horizon for slowly.

68
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,011
You know,

69
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,480
there's things like that that
we know the earth is round,

70
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,100
you know,

71
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,600
you traveled around,

72
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:09,770
you come back to where you started.

73
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,060
Um,

74
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,271
you know,

75
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,320
now their explanation,

76
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,460
the flat earthers is that,

77
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:13,701
yeah,

78
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,990
it's round like a pizza,

79
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,910
but around flat pizza and
all the continents are on
the one flat face side up

80
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,970
and that the satellites
are up there going around.

81
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:23,360
It's like,

82
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,601
yeah,

83
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:28,370
but the satellite photos don't show all
the continents in one picture because

84
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,140
some of them are on the
other side of the globe.

85
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,280
So that refutes that.

86
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,660
Well not only that,

87
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,470
but they think that satellites
are actually in planes.

88
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,740
They're in planes and roll Orthopro
over that or just circling around.

89
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,970
There's no actual satellites.

90
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:42,520
They don't even believe
in saddle satellites.

91
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,001
Yeah.

92
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,310
So back to your original comment,

93
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,970
I,

94
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,150
some of these recent ones are so
crazy that you can't help but think,

95
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,750
okay.

96
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,530
They don't believe that they're just
yanking our chain for maybe financial

97
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:54,340
reasons.

98
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,260
But that does get to the
question I always get,

99
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,910
which is do these people
really believe it?

100
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,780
The cult leaders,

101
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,140
the,

102
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,330
that make a extraordinary claims,

103
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,860
are they just making this stuff up?

104
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,071
You know,

105
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,360
people make shit up all the time.

106
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,860
It's called fiction fantasy.

107
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,640
Uh,

108
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,960
or do they really believe it or they,

109
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,171
you know,

110
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,430
true believers and you know,

111
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,151
it's hard to tell.

112
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,770
It's hard to get inside people's heads.

113
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Uh,

114
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,710
the old flat earthers in the 19th century,

115
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,090
I think they really did believe it.

116
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:16,780
Uh,

117
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,040
there wasn't much money to be made,

118
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,581
you know,

119
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,750
on those kinds of things.

120
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,470
I mentioned the Alfred Russell Wallace
who was the co-discoverer of natural

121
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,400
selection with Darwin.

122
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,090
I wrote my dissertation on him and wrote
a biography of him and he was quite the

123
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,560
colorful character who is so open minded
to new ideas that he was also gullible.

124
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,510
So open minded enough to see this radical
new theory of the evolution of life by

125
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,920
natural selection that's good.

126
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,910
Pioneered other fields like
biogeography and so on.

127
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,840
But he also was really into
spiritualism and phrenology,

128
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,320
seances handling all that stuff.

129
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,330
And then he encountered an ad in one of
the natural history magazines for this

130
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,360
500 pound bet.

131
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,160
If anybody could prove the earth is round.

132
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,300
So he devised a test and he
went down to the Bedford canal,

133
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,021
which is a long,

134
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,531
straight,

135
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,250
like 10,

136
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,330
10 kilometers long.

137
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,920
You can see the whole distance and if
you put these little sticks in the ground

138
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,500
with markers on them and you
get a little telescope like,

139
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:14,860
uh,

140
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,550
um,

141
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:15,641
uh,

142
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,130
surveyors scope and you line it up,

143
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,690
you can see that it bends.

144
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,180
So at each point the stick is,

145
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:22,361
you know,

146
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,430
three meters above the
ground at each point.

147
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,420
And uh,

148
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,640
but you can see that it's
dropped down in the last one.

149
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,270
So it's been,

150
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,110
so he won the bet,

151
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,420
but he didn't get paid of course,

152
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,620
because these people are cranks.

153
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,401
And uh,

154
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,390
so we had to take him to court.

155
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,810
This ended up costing him
about 15 years of his career,

156
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:37,991
you know,

157
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,130
just wasting time,

158
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,411
you know,

159
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:42,990
writing letters and getting court
dates and suing this guy and you know,

160
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,421
whatever.

161
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,290
The try to win the bet.

162
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,441
Yeah,

163
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,280
just try to win the bet.

164
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:45,940
So,

165
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,440
and of course what happens,

166
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,140
you get caught up emotionally,

167
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,330
like,

168
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,340
I'm not going to let this
bastard get away with this.

169
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:51,851
You know,

170
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,560
you should have just cut
his losses and laugh.

171
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,394
But anyway,

172
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,910
and I found these letters that this
guy wrote to the National Jager or the,

173
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,250
um,

174
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,600
uh,

175
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
the Royal Geographical Society about,

176
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,960
uh,

177
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,950
Alfred Russell Wallace.

178
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:03,131
You know,

179
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,520
you have one member of your
society that should be,

180
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:06,671
you know,

181
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,140
he's a quack and a crank and,

182
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,860
you know,

183
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,350
and he wrote letters to
the two Wallace's wife,

184
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:11,621
you know,

185
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:15,370
you better not sleep in your bed at night
quietly because I'm coming to get you

186
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:15,701
guys.

187
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,050
And it's like,

188
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,960
you look like death threats.

189
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:17,560
Yeah.

190
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,981
So,

191
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,370
uh,

192
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,571
it,

193
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:18,801
you know,

194
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,060
you're,

195
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,990
it's always questionable deal with
cranks because some of them are a little,

196
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,590
uh,

197
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,820
mentally deranged.

198
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,661
Sure.

199
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:29,860
And they can attach themselves to
someone like Wallace or Darwin or anybody

200
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,230
else.

201
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,150
If you can somehow or another connect
yourself to them and some sort of an

202
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,720
argument,

203
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
it's kind of legitimizes you,

204
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,180
at least in a way,

205
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,950
because that person's
giving you attention.

206
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,040
The person is engaging you
and it elevates your standing.

207
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,020
And then whenever two people are arguing,

208
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,780
a certain amount of people
are going to choose sides.

209
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,280
There's,

210
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,960
they're just gonna.

211
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,970
Even if that,

212
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,530
what you're saying doesn't make any sense,

213
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,820
there's going to be a
gang of people that go,

214
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:52,091
all right.

215
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,361
Like,

216
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,194
what are you saying?

217
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,870
And they're going to
join in and people love,

218
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,760
they love to be on a team.

219
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:07,990
Okay.
