1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,661
Dib.
Dib,

2
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:01,051
Dib,
Dib,

3
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:01,560
Dib,
Dib.

4
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,940
Dumb.
What's up man,

5
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,220
thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

6
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,054
Thanks for having me.
And thanks for introducing me to your 

7
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,590
dog.
Cause I,

8
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,433
I have to tell you that that video of 
you grabbing that raccoon and chucking 

9
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:17,550
it down the stairs was easily one of the
most gangster things I've ever seen.

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,950
He lets you do.
Is this it?

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,410
I had to put a little disclaimer up here
so that you know the animal rights folks

12
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,830
wouldn't get pissed off.
Uh Yeah.

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,740
Well that's you're going to,
they're going to get pissed off anyway.

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,380
So right now I hear him crying cause 
there's no audio on the cameras but he's

15
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:35,214
like just getting mauled by this thing 
and you just picked it up and fucking 

16
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:43,830
chucked it like gangster dude.
I mean you didn't just push it away.

17
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:44,664
You picked it up over your head,
went back behind the head like you're 

18
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,960
throwing a medicine ball.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Cause another angle.
Yeah.

20
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:54,690
This is the best tackle over the back of
the head and show boom bang.

21
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,080
We're talking to Kevin Rose,
the founder of dig.

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,260
I got to say though,
it was a little liquid courage.

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,840
I'd had a couple of glasses of wine and 
number two,

24
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,540
my intention was to go down there and 
just kick it.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,613
Right.
But it was on top of my dog so it'd be 

26
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,520
punting my dog at the same time.
It was tangled.

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,110
Who's tangled?
So I mean,

28
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,780
you know,
then I grabbed it and it's,

29
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:17,820
it's greasy and kind of bristly.
Ooh,

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,110
so,
but you know,

31
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,944
whatever,
it's kind of,

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,120
it's one,
it's your baby.

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
I know it sounds weird to say what the 
dog,

34
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,020
but it's just like I thought he was 
dying.

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,913
He was getting,
he was howling like he was getting 

36
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,500
shredded.
But with this clause,

37
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,570
you know,
so I'm thinking my dog is being killed.

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,770
Did you think it was a coyote?
No.

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,753
You know,
we had seen recommends in the backyard 

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,633
before and it was just one of those 
things where they always just kind of 

41
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,900
like run away.
The second that the lights come on.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,650
And this time I don't know what he was,
I don't know if he had babies.

43
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,484
Actually,
there were some other records that we 

44
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:49,380
saw with him at the same time,
so I dunno man.

45
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,603
Those weird sort of a fringe wildlife 
creatures like raccoons and coyotes to 

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,780
kind of hang around.
Cities are so creepy.

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,670
Yeah.
There's a ton in San Francisco.

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,813
It's just all over the place at night.
They just dig through the trash 

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,500
basically.
We'll San Francisco,

50
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
believe it or not,
at least the outside edges has a bit of 

51
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,840
a mountain line problem.
I've heard that.

52
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,920
Yeah.
They've,

53
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,783
they did this study recently where they 
check the digestive tracks of all these 

54
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:19,620
mountain lines and they thought you were
going to find deer and rabbit.

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,450
No,
they found mostly pets.

56
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,630
Yeah.
It's like 50% cats and dogs is what they

57
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,450
found.
You don't want to tangle with a mountain

58
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,800
lion.
That's crazy.

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,663
Well,
it's just weird that they've chosen to 

60
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,530
exist in the periphery of the cities and
sort of feed on these,

61
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,870
these pets house animals.
Yeah.

62
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,120
It's too bad.
Yeah.

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,940
It's not normal though that a raccoon 
attacks a dog like that,

64
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,331
right?
Yeah.

65
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,900
They typically just take off that.
That's been our experience with them.

66
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,890
And then I proceeded to go on Amazon and
buy a trap.

67
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,023
Uh,
and so then I was able to trap what a 

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,993
few days later and it was evil.
I mean like I went down there just to 

69
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:56,754
check out the trap and I saw it from 
above and when I got down there it was 

70
00:02:59,831 --> 00:02:59,980
just

71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,230
hissing and trying to scratch the cage 
at me.

72
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,080
And I mean they're not the friendly ones
that you see on youtube.

73
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,400
Like there's some that are like kind of 
domesticated where they,

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,000
the people feed them and then they come 
and you can pet them and whatnot.

75
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,440
These,
these wild ones or,

76
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,890
or just like the,
I will cut your throat kind of animals.

77
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,420
I had a feral cat for awhile and I love 
tats but feral cats,

78
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,400
it is a completely different experience.
Like mine was a kitten.

79
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,320
It was a little baby will,
I mean it was really young,

80
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:30,820
like maybe three months old at the most 
and you couldn't get anywhere near it.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,893
He'd go near.
Anyone would run up the side of the 

82
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,194
wall,
tear apart the curtains shit away from 

83
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,550
you.
Just get rid of it or no,

84
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,380
I kept it.
I um,

85
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,250
I locked myself in a bedroom with it for
a couple days,

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,150
aiming it,
break it.

87
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,920
It's not even that I had a break it,
I just had to get it used to me it was,

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,460
it was a real weird experience.
My friend Lanie,

89
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,200
she and her boyfriend lived in this 
apartment in west Hollywood,

90
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,820
like us,
like west La,

91
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,654
like Santa Monica area,
and there's these feral cats that had 

92
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,870
had babies underneath the apartment 
building.

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,430
And so they're like,
oh my God,

94
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,780
what are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

95
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,920
All right,
we have to trap them.

96
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,710
And so she knew that I already had two 
cats.

97
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,850
So she's like,
do you want a cat?

98
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:13,690
And I was like,
all right,

99
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,920
fuck it.
Give me a cat.

100
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,903
Yeah.
And if you give those to the animal 

101
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:19,190
shelter,
they'll just terminate him.

102
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,440
I tell him he,
that's too bad.

103
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,010
Well,
it was,

104
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,460
it was so hard to get used to this thing
but with hiss at you.

105
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,293
But when you pick it up it would go,
it would like be the loudest pervs and 

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,210
he's so happy that someone was touching 
it,

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,580
but then you put it down just for a 
second and be like,

108
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,260
it would run away again.
It took forever and like it took,

109
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,450
it took years before it would let anyone
else get even close to it,

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,460
like hiding under furniture and things 
like that.

111
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,560
It would hiss at you and run away from 
you.

112
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,290
I was the only one that could touch it.
And even me,

113
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,221
I had a little,
I go,

114
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,210
hey dude,
it's me.

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,073
You know me,
right?

116
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,390
Yeah,
we're cool and I get close to him,

117
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:58,240
but he would swing at Ya.
He'd definitely bite you.

118
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,630
About a month ago I was looking up how 
to break a horse.

119
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,340
I just thought that because it kind of a
fun thing.

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,133
Why?
Why not?

121
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,390
They would be amazing.
The bond he would have.

122
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,560
I know they'll kick your ass though.
That'd be fun though.

123
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,580
Yeah.
I think good like weekend project.

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,570
No,
get off the computer.

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,413
I could break a horse.
I know a bunch of people that have 

126
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,094
gotten hurt from horses.
They're falling off horses and broken 

127
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,630
arms and legs and stuff.
It's just,

128
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,440
I know a dude got kicked by a horse that
can be death.

129
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,990
Oh yeah.
They kill like all kinds of animals.

130
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,440
Like dogs barking dogs.
They kick them in the dump.

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,753
That's it.
Over.

132
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,691
Yeah.
I mean,

133
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,910
you're getting hit by a telephone pole.
This is fucking,

134
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:39,250
things are giant.
I mean,

135
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,084
it's an animal that can take a 200 pound
man and run with it on its back for 

136
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,050
hours.
Right.

137
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,323
Just there's raw power there.
I was in Montreal and there's this 

138
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,630
amazing restaurant called Joe beef and 
um,

139
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,260
they serve horse there and it's one of 
those places where,

140
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,143
um,
I know the owners through Anthony 

141
00:05:59,630 --> 00:05:59,630
Bordain.

142
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,700
He introduced me to them and so they 
said,

143
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,320
just let us cook for you.
And so we're like,

144
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,430
okay,
go ahead man.

145
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,180
He goes,
fuck,

146
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,400
fuck them in and you'd just let us cook 
for course three ways.

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,693
Will they,
that was just one of the things they 

148
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,060
brought over.
We didn't know that what it was until it

149
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,290
like they set it down and they're like,
this is horse tar tar.

150
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,603
And we're like,
wait,

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,070
wait a minute.
What raw horse.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,460
I've had lamb tar tar one time when I 
was in Dubai.

153
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,000
That was a little funky.
It's very fatty.

154
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,650
And so it's a,
it's a lot of like,

155
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,484
um,
film on your mouth after you get done 

156
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,441
eating it,
you know,

157
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,270
like the roof of your mouth.
Kind of like a little filming,

158
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,104
not,
not fun.

159
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,540
Well,
I'm a fan of lamb until I found out what

160
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,374
Lam is.

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,320
That it's,
it's baby sheep.

162
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,790
That's what it is.
You think of cheap though too,

163
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,240
right?
No,

164
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,950
that's mutton.
Oh,

165
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,300
interesting.
Yeah.

166
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,800
It's like veal is,
it's like the feel of the mutton world.

167
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,390
Yeah.
Um,

168
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,980
and I,
I went,

169
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,980
oh,
babies will really young.

170
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,170
Immature.
Hmm.

171
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,480
Yeah.
That's too bad.

172
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,460
It is too bad.
It is tasty.

173
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,720
It's the most delicious.
Well that's why when you get lamb chops,

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,060
it's a very small boat.
Interesting.

175
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,450
Yeah.
We would just assume,

176
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,800
right.
That's too bad.

177
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,930
You just kind of tainted me forever.
Bombed it.

178
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,730
Well,
it's really easy for you to digest.

179
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,564
For some reason lamb is a much more 
digestible meat protein wise like for 

180
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,270
it's very good for you.
Hmm.

181
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,720
A lot of people feel like it's a more 
high quality meat,

182
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:34,640
closer to like a a wild game than say 
like cows and you know,

183
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,600
things along those lines.

184
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,060
How do they measure that?
It's a good question.

185
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,103
They,
I know they can measure protein content 

186
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,800
somehow and they know that like some 
animals,

187
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:47,300
like I think moose as like the highest 
protein content like per gram.

188
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,213
Yeah.
Yeah.

189
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,063
But I think it's also,
that's probably based on how lean it is 

190
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:52,814
too,
because you would assume that it right 

191
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,423
down it's piece of Moose would be far 
less fat than an eight ounce piece of 

192
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,910
domestic beef.
Right.

193
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,520
So that's probably how they measure it.
Crazy.

194
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,653
Well it looks different.
You know like lamb looks different than 

195
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,560
beef when you look at it as like a 
redder sort of a,

196
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,620
unless it's grass fed beef,
grass fed beef.

197
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,420
Pretty Rad.
Have you tried to bear?

198
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,120
Yes.
See I,

199
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,140
that's when I haven't tried it.
But I've been curious.

200
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,000
I've heard it's pretty oily though.
Uh,

201
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,200
no it's not.
Oh sorry.

202
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,010
No,
I'm,

203
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,580
well it really depends on how you 
prepare it in the field and uh,

204
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,433
what you do with it.
But bear sausage is delicious and bear 

205
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,190
backstraps the Loin is really good 
grilled,

206
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,200
but bear you have to be really careful 
because uh,

207
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,203
you can get tricky gnosis a lot of bears
up tricky analysis so you have to make 

208
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,890
sure it's cooked to 165 degrees.
Oh,

209
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:40,940
interesting.
Yeah.

210
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,820
It's like,
um,

211
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,900
it's actually so there's no medium rare 
bear.

212
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,860
No,
no,

213
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,693
you're going,
the only way you could ever do that is 

214
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,880
if you got tested first.
You could do that.

215
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,714
Like you'd send it to a lab,
like you take the bear tongue and you 

216
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,410
send it out to a lab and they test it.
Or is that a,

217
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
I think you might have to actually send 
the actual meat itself or a piece of 

218
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,324
meat,
but if it has trick analysis is 

219
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,220
throughout his whole body.

220
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,750
Is it tough?
No.

221
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,681
Oh,
interesting.

222
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,740
There's weird men,
their bodies are very mushy.

223
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,813
You,
you would think of their bodies like 

224
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,643
like an elk or a deer is a very strong 
like they're very muscular like a horse 

225
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,890
is right,
but a bear is almost like gushy.

226
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,310
Like when they die and when you pick 
them up they like a fat person.

227
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,523
It's weird.
Well they hibernate and they have those 

228
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,170
big fat stores.
I guess that makes sense.

229
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,300
But they have what you would,
the way you would describe it,

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,500
like they have a soft body but the,
the meat is very good.

231
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,100
Yeah.
It's like a,

232
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,450
it's the way I describe is like a pig 
fucked a deer.

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,110
That's a bear.
Tastes like really cause I like pig.

234
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah.
You would like it to dear.

235
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,390
If I had some men,
I'm having some delivered on Thursday.

236
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:50,340
How long are you going to be in town for
me and I take off tomorrow.

237
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,073
Next time I'll bring you some a bear 
sausage and I'll have it frozen for you 

238
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,230
that you'd take it back.
It's really good.

239
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,910
And it's all,
it's,

240
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,893
it's also one of those animals were my 
friend Steve Rinella calls them 

241
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,770
charismatic megafauna.
Or if you say you eat bear,

242
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,060
there's a bunch of people that have 
this,

243
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,520
oh,
this like knee jerk.

244
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,310
Right.
But it's one of those game animals where

245
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,144
it's actually imperative that people 
hunt them because they don't have any 

246
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,280
natural predators.
So if they don't get hunted,

247
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,050
if someone doesn't control the 
population,

248
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,680
they decimate the moose and the deer 
because they eat all the Fonz.

249
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,150
Interesting.
They eat,

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,250
uh,
all the ground nesting birds.

251
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,350
Then they just,
and then also eat each other.

252
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,213
So I,
I have a friend that collects 

253
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,650
butterflies,
uh,

254
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,513
my friend's wife and apparently there 
are places in the world where the 

255
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,830
butterflies are a serious problem.

256
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,070
Like they overtake and eat crops and 
like decimate everything.

257
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,780
Wow.
And that these beautiful like,

258
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:46,411
you know,
six,

259
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,244
seven inch butterflies,
but she sources them from there where 

260
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,144
they actually have to kill them,
otherwise it's going to ruin the whole 

261
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,820
environment.
Wow.

262
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,710
I didn't know.
Collects the dead ones.

263
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,401
Dead ones.
Yeah.

264
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,480
So she has him like,
you know,

265
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:01,350
up on the wall kind of in one of those 
those cases so you can see them and when

266
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,180
you first walk in you're like,
okay asshole.

267
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,043
Like you know,
cause there's like all these beautiful 

268
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,470
butterflies all over the place.
But uh,

269
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,304
yeah apparently that's,
that's the deal is you have to just 

270
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,730
source them.
Well those really,

271
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,740
Really Cool Butterfly Butterfly Pavilion
in Denver is really awesome.

272
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,530
And it's a,
you go there and um,

273
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
when you go inside of it,
they have all these mres everywhere and 

274
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,410
the entire place is just filled with 
butterflies.

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,420
San Francisco has one of those as well.
Oh that's cool.

276
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,254
Yeah.
And the lands on your head and then 

277
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,020
they're all around you and when you 
leave you,

278
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,360
they have to like dust you off cause 
there's so many butterflies on you,

279
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,610
but they die while you're there.
I mean there's shelf life or their,

280
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:38,340
their life is very short,
right?

281
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,080
So they,
they die constantly.

282
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,540
Like you find them dead all throughout 
the place.

283
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,730
Not that anybody killed them.
They just die of old age.

284
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,773
Like we watched a couple of them just 
sit down on a leaf and all of a sudden 

285
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:49,950
they like,
that's it.

286
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,880
We're good.
Wow.

287
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,780
You're only good.
I mean,

288
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,070
I don't know.
How long has the butterfly live?

289
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,060
It's okay.
Does it say how long a butterfly lives?

290
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,800
Sure.
It's a super zen moments.

291
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,320
Yes.
I say a butterfly lives a week.

292
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,420
Yeah,
I think a week sounds about right.

293
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,220
It's probably a little last week.
I think so I'm looking,

294
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,280
you say a week,
but I'd say a little less than that.

295
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,143
There's so amazing looking.
It's such a strange thing that nature 

296
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,893
can create all of these beautiful 
designs and shapes and they'll just 

297
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,990
different forms of life,
you know?

298
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,220
Yeah,
absolutely.

299
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,450
Especially in bug forum,
you know,

300
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,633
bugs are some of the most were,
I think we entirely take bugs for 

301
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,460
granted this,
the idea of them,

302
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,710
they're so common.
What does it say?

303
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:30,610
A month.
Oh,

304
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,840
they will.
They last a month.

305
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,733
Interest.
Have you done any of that bug protein 

306
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,720
powder?
Yes.

307
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,930
I haven't done the cricket stuff.
Tim Ferriss has entail.

308
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,490
Do you like that?
Um,

309
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,360
I like bugs.
I mean,

310
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,180
I really think that's probably because 
of my time on fear factor.

311
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,590
I got super used to people eating bugs,
but I liked the idea of it because it is

312
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:51,370
like probably one of the most ethical,
um,

313
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,443
proteins.

314
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,283
Like it's the easiest to source.
It needs very little like land and 

315
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,920
ground and for whatever reason,
even vegans,

316
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,500
most vegans don't have a problem with 
you eating bugs.

317
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,200
Like most vegans will slap a mosquito,
right.

318
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,034
You know,
they're not going to let some mosquito 

319
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,850
just vampire off right there.
We'll kill a mosquito.

320
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,040
So we have these,
this hierarchy of life.

321
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,930
You know,
plant life is at the lowest.

322
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:14,764
You're allowed to kill and eat plants 
and then it gets up to weird animals 

323
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,970
like bear.
We've heard of fruitarians.

324
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,550
Those are even more extreme than just 
the general plants.

325
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,990
They only eat fallen fruit.
Yeah.

326
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,880
I had an aunt that was a fruitarian.
Oh God,

327
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:26,320
that's scary.
She was crazy.

328
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,154
Was she in bad shape?
Because they don't get a lot of 

329
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,960
essential stuff.
We haven't talked in a long,

330
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,970
long time,
but she was,

331
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,090
she was crazy when I was a little kid.

332
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,970
She was a vegetarian when I was,
um,

333
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,580
I think I was like seven,
seven or eight and it was,

334
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,810
she only fallen fruit like fruit that 
has fallen off the tree,

335
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,410
cause extreme version of that.
I think she probably picked it.

336
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,603
I didn't,
I didn't really know her very well and 

337
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,400
she wasn't very close even to our own 
children.

338
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,300
She'd have her on the crazy,
I don't think she'd be into it.

339
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,134
And she's probably,
I don't even know if she's around 

340
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,474
anymore.
She's probably in her late sixties at 

341
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,360
this point.
Yeah.

342
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,680
Yeah.
But she was,

343
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,360
she was a nutty hippie from,
you know,

344
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,470
the 60s had some kids and my cousins 
just lost her fucking mind.

345
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,940
Yeah.
Rotarians man.

346
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,570
Yeah,
she was deep in the,

347
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,460
the world of plants,
but she had,

348
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,840
she wasn't healthy like mentally or 
physically,

349
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,670
so it wasn't like someone that would go,
wow,

350
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,870
maybe that's the way to go.

351
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,610
It was like,
oh look at this crazy bitch.

352
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,260
You know,
like,

353
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,540
cause she didn't even like her kids.
Like she didn't have a good relationship

354
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,010
with her own children.
It's like,

355
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:38,080
how am I going to take you seriously 
about fucking fruit,

356
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,580
right?
How will you be nice to people?

357
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,000
Crazy bitch.
No,

358
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,363
I mean there's certain,
I think we've all looked at like 

359
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,870
vegetarians had been like seeing someone
really healthy and thought,

360
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,810
wow,
you're glowing.

361
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,820
Yeah.
Like I would also like to glow.

362
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
Like yeah,
I could see myself doing that,

363
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,790
but the,
the fruit stuffs a little too far.

364
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,170
Well,
before I started hunting,

365
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,090
I had two thoughts in mind.
One,

366
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,540
this was going to turn me into a Vegan 
or to become a hunter.

367
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,120
So those are the two things that I went 
into it with.

368
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,153
I,
I,

369
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,890
I think there's a lot of health benefits
to eating a lot of vegetables.

370
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,080
I think everybody agrees.
Sure.

371
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,983
100% it's,
this is the real issue is it becomes 

372
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:15,980
sort of a weird religion.
It becomes almost like a,

373
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,450
an ideology,
like a cult.

374
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Like it can't,
there's no variables.

375
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,953
It's like eating animals is evil and 
animals are sentient beings in this 

376
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,753
despite what they do to each other,
despite the fact that like I had a 

377
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,140
friend who's a Vegan,
we had this conversation and I said,

378
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,510
so no animal should be killed ever.
He's like,

379
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:32,990
no.
Okay,

380
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,820
okay.
I have two words for you.

381
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,860
Wild pigs.
What do you do?

382
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,840
Yeah.
And he's like,

383
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,160
well,
they have to be controlled somehow.

384
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:41,480
I go,
how the fuck are you going to do that?

385
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,020
You have hundreds of millions of acres 
and you have wild pigs.

386
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,080
The amount of wild pigs in this country 
is staggering.

387
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,480
Staggering.
It's exploding.

388
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,580
And there's [inaudible],
there's a highway that they opened up in

389
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:56,930
Texas and they had built this highway 
and then they opened it up one night and

390
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:57,764
then that one night they opened,
they had like 40 car accidents with 

391
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:00,560
pigs.

392
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,550
That's crazy.
Oh,

393
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,060
Texas is out of feathers as Rana pigs.
You can get his pets.

394
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,580
Pigs are taken over.
Nanopay have using seen the nano pink.

395
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,350
Oh,
tiny pet pigs.

396
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,210
They're like the size of a small toy 
poodle.

397
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,640
But then they always have those like 
didn't,

398
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,680
I couldn't fuck,
I ain't been around for awhile.

399
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,840
But they're becoming very popular.
Especially here in la.

400
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,520
I can't believe you don't.
You haven't seen them in la?

401
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,240
He'll walk them like dogs.
You would think that I would like,

402
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,240
because I live out here that I would 
understand this place,

403
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,690
but my interaction with La is going to 
the comedy store and the Improv going to

404
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:35,000
the comedy clubs,
going to where I buy food,

405
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,870
going to my neighborhood and being with 
my friends and going to the gym,

406
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,370
like whatever,
wherever I work out.

407
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,050
That was pretty.
Do you enjoy the city then?

408
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,580
Or,
I think there's too many people here.

409
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,840
Yeah.
I just think,

410
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,910
oh look at these little cute little 
fucker.

411
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,570
They're cute little bastards.
Look at that little ball.

412
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,320
But that's a baby though.
I mean that's a baby naming a question.

413
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,500
Let's say you get them though.
Wow.

414
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,850
And how big do they get when they're 
full grown?

415
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,420
I think just like toy poodle size.

416
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,210
Great pets.
Apparently.

417
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,060
They're really smart.
Look at they look guitars.

418
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,230
Well,
I don't think that's real.

419
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,950
They entertain you apparently.
And it makes for them.

420
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,230
What a little cutie.
They're very cute.

421
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,243
But again,
it's like there's a big goddamn 

422
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:21,140
difference between a domesticated pig 
that you raise yourself.

423
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,180
That becomes like a pet and a wild pig.
I'll,

424
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,630
you're fucking scary.
We were in,

425
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,470
no,
this ranch,

426
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,333
this tone ranch,
we were hunting wild pigs were walking 

427
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,780
down this road and it was the first time
I had any contact with them.

428
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,490
I didn't see them.
I heard them.

429
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,473
And they were in this tall grass and 
they were maybe like 20 yards from us 

430
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,340
and they were fighting.
So we're walking down this row were like

431
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:44,900
tip toeing down this road and we here 
and I'm like,

432
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,910
this is like some Lord of the rings.
Shit man.

433
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,530
They have like the full tusks and 
everything.

434
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,220
So these are Moore's basically.

435
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,083
Well that's where it's weird.
See a pig is something called sue 

436
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,940
Scrofani.
I think that's how you say it.

437
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,020
And that genus is there.
They're all the same thing.

438
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:01,854
They're like dogs,
so they could breed with each other and 

439
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,900
they're the same animal,
which means is,

440
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,470
this is a weird thing about pigs.
If you take a domestic pig,

441
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,760
regular pig,
pink pig,

442
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,450
and you leave them out in the wild,
they transform into that really well.

443
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,450
They grow tusks,
they grow tusks,

444
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:20,520
their nose,
their nose extends,

445
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,560
their body for gets thicker and more 
dense and it happens really quickly.

446
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,740
I believe that transformation starts to 
take place within six weeks.

447
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,670
So it was in within six weeks of being 
wild and out in the wild,

448
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,100
having to fend for itself,
not having food given to it.

449
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,270
It's body starts to transform.
It's a very strange animal.

450
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,153
Yeah.
Do they know how to fend for themselves 

451
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:45,030
and eat and all of that?
Like I think instincts take over.

452
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,830
They get desperado mean whatever.
Instincts are still left in the genes.

453
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,010
The fasting and ketosis brings it out of
them with,

454
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,950
yeah,
well they made a lot of carbs I think.

455
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:56,520
Right?
That's what,

456
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
but they'll eat everything.
I mean,

457
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,250
that's the thing about,
again,

458
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,120
ground nesting birds get decimated.
Everything in front of them.

459
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,160
I mean,
and for agriculture,

460
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,880
for places where they have farms,
they're absolutely devastating.

461
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,930
It costs millions and millions of 
dollars worth of damage.

462
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,063
But the,
the idea that you can leave all animals 

463
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,060
alone like,
well you won't be able to go outside,

464
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,650
you'll have a very dangerous 
environment.

465
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,380
Right.
Like the mountain lion issues,

466
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,430
a big issue in California,
you know,

467
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,010
and right now it's pretty much under 
control.

468
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,030
Kinder,
there's good,

469
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,110
there's good things to it too though.

470
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,990
Like one of the good things to it is 
that we don't have deer ticks.

471
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,123
We don't have a lot of ticks out here 
like they do on the east coast because 

472
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,000
the east coast doesn't have mountain 
lions.

473
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,320
Right.
So because of that,

474
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:37,560
and they don't have nearly as many 
coyotes and see coyotes,

475
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,740
kimberly take out a full sized deer,
they can really,

476
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,350
they fuck up the Fonz and they kill a 
lot of the babies,

477
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,950
but they can't relate to the big deer's 
can kind of fend off a coyote,

478
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,500
but they can't fend off I'm outline.
Gotcha.

479
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,940
And Mountain Lions,
Jack.

480
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,670
So many deer that we don't have problems
with.

481
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:57,210
Like lyme disease out here.
Like lyme disease is a huge problem.

482
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,580
I've had coast,
I had a friend that got it here a couple

483
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
of years ago out here to fun.
No,

484
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,280
east coast.
East Coast.

485
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:03,270
Yeah.
He's coast.

486
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:03,900
It's real bad.

487
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,711
They were,
they,

488
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:05,544
there was some estimate that there was 
something in like the Hudson valley 

489
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,723
where they did a test of all these 
different ticks and some ungodly 

490
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:13,860
percentage had lyme disease.
Yeah.

491
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,470
More than 50% of the ticks had lyme 
disease,

492
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,060
which is terrifying.
Yeah.

493
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,530
Cause that'll socks.
It's,

494
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,500
and it's what's fucking devastating to 
your immune system.

495
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,240
It really wrecks your body and some 
people get it and they keep it forever.

496
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,580
I mean it just fucks with their system 
forever.

497
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,710
Yeah.
I had a buddy that had to go on hardcore

498
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:34,350
antibiotics right away.
The second you get diagnosed with it and

499
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,360
you have to do cycles of those to try 
and get it out.

500
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,800
It's really brutal.
Well,

501
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,040
I have a friend who got it and he 
brought his son.

502
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,040
His son got it too.
And he brought his son to the doctor and

503
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,923
it was a shitty doctor.
The doctor didn't want to believe that 

504
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,710
the kid had disease

505
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,200
and then all of sudden the kid's face 
went palsy.

506
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,500
He had bell's palsy where his mouth 
started drooling and his,

507
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,334
his,
his lips wouldn't move to that comeback 

508
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,860
or is that,
yes.

509
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,240
Hardcore antibiotics.
Intravenous antibiotics.

510
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,640
And they had to do it for a long time,
like a month of hardcore antibiotic.

511
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,000
It's brutal.
Well it's,

512
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,870
it's a scary disease man,
because it also was related to,

513
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,280
um,
there's that more Jerilyn's disease,

514
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,383
which for a long time they thought more 
jealous might be some sort of a 

515
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,034
psychosomatic disorder where people 
believe they had like fiber's going out 

516
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,980
of their skin and they're itching 
themselves constantly.

517
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,850
And they would,
they would bring these fibers to doctors

518
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,300
to exam and they say,
my body's growing these fibers.

519
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,090
Weird.
Yeah.

520
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,923
But it wasn't really going on.
What was going on was that the fibers 

521
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:42,070
were like carpet fibers and things that 
were stuck to their skin.

522
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,203
And so I interviewed this guy who was a 
more gel and suffer and he was also a 

523
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,910
doctor.
So it was kind of fascinating,

524
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,920
um,
to get his perspective on it.

525
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:51,754
And He,
and he was very frustrated by the way 

526
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,783
the medical establishment treats us 
disease because they were treating it 

527
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,070
like it's like a completely 
psychological disorder.

528
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,140
And he's like,
I don't think so.

529
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:05,050
He goes,
I think there's a neuro toxicity to this

530
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:05,884
disease.
And that one of the things about this 

531
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:12,640
disease was a vast majority of the 
people who hadn't made more jealous also

532
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,220
had lyme disease.
So what he thinks,

533
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,590
and this is,
there's not enough people that have it,

534
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:21,190
but he thinks his lyme disease affects 
your brain.

535
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,053
There's some sort of a,
of neuro toxicity to this lyme disease 

536
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,930
when it gets to some people.
And the other thing he said,

537
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,070
when you get lyme disease,
like you have a,

538
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:31,904
a tick that gives you this,
this disease and the tick carries it in 

539
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,454
his body gives to you.

540
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,890
He goes,
it's not like it's giving it to you in a

541
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,440
syringe and it's a pure form of this 
disease.

542
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,880
It's like you're getting a variety of 
different pathogens along with that.

543
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,860
And the,
when he was describing it to me,

544
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:48,401
I was like,
oh,

545
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,234
this totally makes sense.
It's probably just as very small sample 

546
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:54,610
size of people who have this problem.
But the people haven't,

547
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,590
man,
they get fucking crazy.

548
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,570
Do you go out to the east coast at all 
then?

549
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:02,410
Do you avoid all the tapes like I go but
I'll spray stuff.

550
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,660
There's clothing that they can,
um,

551
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,523
that they've designed for people that 
are in those areas that you make sure 

552
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,560
socks up to like the beltline kind of 
thing.

553
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,860
But you can get bit even through socks.
It's really pants and,

554
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:16,600
and,
um,

555
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,433
boot gators and all these different 
things to make sure that they don't get 

556
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,070
in the crevices.
And,

557
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,490
and if you come in contact with an 
animal that has it,

558
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,324
you have to be really careful that makes
sure those ticks don't come off and get 

559
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:30,320
onto you and you gotta be careful.
It's,

560
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,360
it's no joke.
Yeah,

561
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,340
that's not fun.
What's so scary?

562
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,340
Because it fucks with your immune system
and it really,

563
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,480
depending upon how bad you get it and 
who you are and what your makeup is,

564
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,553
you know,
some people just have a really nasty 

565
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:44,980
averse reaction to it.
It's a matter of fact,

566
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,220
my friend's dad got

567
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,053
it from a vaccine.
They used to give a vaccine for lyme 

568
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:54,350
disease and they don't do it anymore 
because it could turn into full blown.

569
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,120
Wow.
That's the stuff you always worry about.

570
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,800
Yeah.
Well it's one of those things like,

571
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,693
you know,
it's like the people that get the flu 

572
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,850
shot every once in a while somebody 
comes down with a full blown for sure.

573
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,320
Yeah,
absolutely.

574
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,940
Well,
that was always the argument about,

575
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,590
um,
vaccines too.

576
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,900
Like people were always saying,
you know,

577
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,120
there's this always this,
this thing like,

578
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,270
hey vaccines give people autism vaccines
do this.

579
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,790
And then there's the other campuses,
vaccines are harmless.

580
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,900
Well,
it's never harmless.

581
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,230
He shoot a chemical in your body.
It's harmless.

582
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,310
The vast majority of the time,
it's beneficial the vast majority of the

583
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,144
time.
But if you're one of those one out of a 

584
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,843
thousand people,
there's not that much comfort in the 

585
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,064
fact that your brain gets fucking fried 
because they tried some experimental 

586
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,660
fucking weird vaccine on.

587
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,640
Do you do any of that stuff?
Do you do any of the,

588
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,190
uh,
flu shots every year?

589
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,831
No.
No.

590
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:41,664
I don't do flu shots,
but I did it this year and I came down 

591
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,880
with the flu.
I got decimated.

592
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm one of those guys that has a really 
strong immune system until I don't,

593
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,240
and then I'm like out for like a month,
you know?

594
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,560
Like I'm like,
you know,

595
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,370
licking my fingers all the time and like
you don't need to just feel invincible.

596
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,204
Yeah.
Like I haven't gotten sick for like 10 

597
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:02,070
months and I don't wash my hands 
sometimes and it's disgusting.

598
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:05,040
But uh,
then I just went down hard this year.

599
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,270
Well,
there's so many factors,

600
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,130
right?
It's like health,

601
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,200
sleep,
diet.

602
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,840
I think I was doing too much cold 
therapy stuff.

603
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,441
Cold,
terrible.

604
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:14,160
Like Wim Hoff.
Stop.

605
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,690
Yeah.
When I'm off stuff too much.

606
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,090
Too much.
I was talking to Rhonda Patrick,

607
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:20,400
who you've had on the show before about 
this and um,

608
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,653
you know,
just too many stressors cause that's a 

609
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:23,274
stressor.

610
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,480
You know,
you have green teas,

611
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,100
a stress or you have,
turmeric is a stressor.

612
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:26,934
You have exercise as a stressor.
And if you're doing that every single 

613
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,920
day.
And I was doing the cold stuff,

614
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,940
uh,
you know,

615
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,850
five,
six days a week along with,

616
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,670
and not,
not talking cryo but like cold ice,

617
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,350
cold showers.
Um,

618
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,640
and then along with exercising and 
interval training and everything else,

619
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,320
cold showers,
your northern California,

620
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:47,040
right?
Yeah.

621
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,900
That's all I'll say is actually in New 
York.

622
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:52,440
So they were really went to my gym has a
freeze.

623
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,274
I don't know why,
but their showers when he turned to the 

624
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,070
cold setting,
I'm lucky at home.

625
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:56,904
I don't have that.
I go to the gym and on the cold setting 

626
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,960
I put my hands,
uh,

627
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,190
you know,
as I'm washing my hair,

628
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,083
uh,
under the cold shower and my hands are 

629
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,680
numb within 45 seconds.

630
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,930
Like it's really,
really cold.

631
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,300
Jesus.
Yeah.

632
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,490
Well New York has some fucking severe 
cold winter.

633
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,563
Yeah.
And you get that cold water in the 

634
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,060
winter.
That's real cold water.

635
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,953
Oh I love it.
People call it to talk about cold water 

636
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,710
California.
It's kind of cold.

637
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,401
Right?
Let's,

638
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:22,540
he'd go into a glacier river.
Yeah.

639
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:26,280
I'm so bummed when I come out here cause
I go and I stay at a hotel or something.

640
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,114
And the first thing I do when I get in a
hotel is on cold setting in the showers 

641
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,100
to see what we're dealing with.
It's all week.

642
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,960
Yeah.
You know,

643
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,640
you have to go do proper cryo if you 
want to do that.

644
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,250
Well it's great after yoga in the 
winter,

645
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,113
like there's,
you can actually get pretty cold water 

646
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:44,070
here in like January in the,
but like

647
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,100
after a hot yoga class it feels 
unbelievably cold.

648
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah.
And like you can't breathe.

649
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,920
It's like a probably more of a reaction 
even in Cryo.

650
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,293
Oh interesting.
Was cry was weird cause it's cold as 

651
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:57,390
fuck,
but it's dry.

652
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,613
So get in there and there's something,
that's where they talked about the 

653
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:00,900
desert.
They're like,

654
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,370
it's a dry heat.
Like you know,

655
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,203
it's a dry cryo.
Well that's California's heat too in 

656
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:09,720
comparison to like praxis.
I give you ever been to Houston in July.

657
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,710
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

658
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
It's brutal.
It's like trying to breathe through.

659
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,440
It's like you're getting waterboarded 
right?

660
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,630
Like nonstop.
Yeah.

661
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:17,910
It's like a hot fucking wet blanket on 
your face.

662
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,040
But,
um,

663
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,760
the,
the,

664
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,593
there's,
there's a definitely difference in that 

665
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,880
cold.
That's where you're not getting wet.

666
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,863
Like Wim Hof actually prefers ice baths.
He thinks the ice baths or better for 

667
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,060
you and,
and,

668
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,870
and the way he describes it better for 
your spirit.

669
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,410
Hmm.
Yeah,

670
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,190
I've done the ice pass a few times.
That was week 10 for me on his,

671
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:36,330
uh,
his course.

672
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,080
I went and got 10 bags of ice from the 
corner store,

673
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,980
filled up my bathtub with cold water and
then put all 10 bags of ice in there,

674
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,000
a submerged myself up to my neck and did
that for 15 minutes.

675
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,710
Wow.
Did you get anything out of it?

676
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,200
You know,
I will say I am a,

677
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,460
I'm a huge believer in just cryo and 
cold therapy in general in that,

678
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,020
um,
I would,

679
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,750
my mood is elevated.
It's more than anything else.

680
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,020
It's my mood.
Yeah.

681
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,540
I find myself,
like I'm,

682
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm generally a really happy guy.
Like I,

683
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:09,240
you know,
we all have their ups and downs as as it

684
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,120
were,
but this kind of just raises the bar and

685
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,580
additional,
I would say like 20%.

686
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,150
And so you have a higher high,
if that makes sense.

687
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,860
You know,
always gonna stay up pegged up there and

688
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:22,530
be like a whole new person.
But it's just different.

689
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,121
It's,
it's,

690
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:25,620
it's amazing.
It's been a game changer for me.

691
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,020
And so I've gotten really deep on the 
research side,

692
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,540
different than Rhonda.
Rhonda goes the science route.

693
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,823
I go into the history.
So I've been researching people that 

694
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,214
have done this for hundreds of years now
and their protocols and what they've 

695
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,880
done.
And what have you found?

696
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,440
Ah,
I'm not ready to release it yet.

697
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,570
Dare you teased?
No,

698
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,340
I've got like,
I've been doing a ton of research.

699
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:45,174
I'm either going to put out like a big 
pdf on it or a little mini ebook or 

700
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:49,260
something that'll give away.
I don't,

701
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,011
I don't know.
But,

702
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,570
um,
you can't give us a like a taste.

703
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,300
Well,
a good taste would be,

704
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,800
uh,
let me think here.

705
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,500
There's some people in Russia that have 
done it for a long time,

706
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,334
hundreds of years,
and I got ahold of their original 

707
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:04,290
documents and had them translated so I 
could figure out what the protocol is to

708
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,410
Banja and then for freezing water.
That's right.

709
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,080
Yeah.
Fado or Amelion Inco,

710
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,930
like probably the greatest heavyweight 
UFC or mma rather fighter of all time.

711
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,670
He was a pride heavyweight champion,
you know,

712
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,540
he is,
no,

713
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,463
that was his thing.
He would do the Banya when they beat 

714
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:20,550
each other with those eucalyptic 
branches.

715
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,181
Right,
right.

716
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:23,850
I've done that ton of time by the 
private other branches,

717
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,170
but I've watched it being done.
It's fast.

718
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,460
It's cool.
It does look cool.

719
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,080
I bet it would be refreshing,
you know,

720
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,000
and get,
I mean,

721
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,420
they're not hurting each other.
No,

722
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:31,254
they just slap you around with some 
branches and they climb from the hot 

723
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,440
sauna and the climate to the water.
But when I always thought of it was just

724
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,240
like something that makes you feel a 
little bit better.

725
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,010
But when you read and to Rhonda

726
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,083
and her research on Sauna and 40% less 
mortality across the board from all 

727
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:50,110
factors,
whether it's cancer,

728
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:51,520
disease,
heart attack,

729
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,720
all these different things,
you're like,

730
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,740
what percent drop in mortality?
Like that's incredible there.

731
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,603
And then she ducks about the actual 
physical measurable responses to Sauna 

732
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,350
to extreme heat,
heat shock proteins,

733
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,380
and then also cold shock proteins.
You realize like,

734
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,243
oh,
there's some something really going on 

735
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,110
here.
Yeah,

736
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,943
absolutely.
And you could feel it after a couple of 

737
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,230
weeks for me,
my friend,

738
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:12,970
I've had friends do one and they're 
like,

739
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,361
I didn't,
I,

740
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:14,680
it's too cold.
I can't do this.

741
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,820
And I'm like,
you don't understand.

742
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,090
It's not about just that one time,
I don't know about for you,

743
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:23,040
but it was about week two to week three,
we're all of a sudden I just woke up and

744
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,490
I'm like,
wait a second,

745
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,440
I feel like I'm 16 again.

746
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,820
Or you know,
just like a little bit.

747
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,800
My mood was just crazy.
Good.

748
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,580
Well,
no,

749
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,350
what does she call it?
North northern epinephrine,

750
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,060
norepinephrine,
norepinephrine.

751
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,103
It's a weird word,
nor epinephrin nor [inaudible] nor 

752
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,640
epinephrin norepinephrine.
Yeah.

753
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,820
That stuff,
that feeling that you get,

754
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,010
it's very tangible.
It's like a drug.

755
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,290
It's almost like [inaudible] like 
getting a little,

756
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,140
just a tiny taste of pot.
Just a little,

757
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
just a little text.
Hi.

758
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,350
I brought that up in our podcast that I 
did with her.

759
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,120
It was,
it's like,

760
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,953
it's like you're at a concert and you 
have like a little hitter and then 

761
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:57,631
you're like,
whoa.

762
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:58,464
Okay.
All right.

763
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,190
Yeah,
yeah,

764
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,001
yeah.
It does.

765
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,340
It makes the sun feel better.
It just,

766
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,490
it's great.
And,

767
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,450
and also for aches and pains and you 
know,

768
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,284
for someone who,
who trains a lot the measurable effect 

769
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,560
that they found as far as like reducing 
the inflammatory markers in the blood,

770
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,070
you can feel that.

771
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,903
You can absolutely feel the response to 
that when you do it like a week or two 

772
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:22,804
in a row.
Yeah,

773
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,950
that's right.
Um,

774
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,010
so do you know that cold therapy used to
be,

775
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,903
um,
like it was used as a treatment for 

776
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,470
insanity?
Did you know that back in the day?

777
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,813
So van Gogh,
when he cut his ear off and they put 

778
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:39,380
them in the insane asylum,
um,

779
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,550
they've forced him to do two weekly,
two hour long sessions of cold therapy.

780
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,053
And he writes about it.
This is a little teaser of some of this 

781
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,074
stuff research I've been doing.
He writes about it in his letters to 

782
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:53,974
friends and so his letters are 
documented online and you can find the 

783
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,114
Vango letters.
And then I've dug into all of his 

784
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,340
letters and found any mention of cold 
therapy and what it's done to his mood.

785
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,653
It's fascinating.

786
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,060
And what was he saying?
He was just saying that,

787
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:07,900
yeah,
I mean you could look it up.

788
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:08,734
He was just saying that he was a big 
believer and he's feeling so much 

789
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,490
better.
And then,

790
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,550
and then I found pictures of the tub 
that they used to use.

791
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:16,384
So what they would do is he would lay 
down in a bathtub and they would put 

792
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,020
this like wood,
um,

793
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,460
cover over the top,
but just with your head's sticking out.

794
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,990
So almost like a guillotine kind of 
thing.

795
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,870
It's a gay teen was the one where they 
chop your head off getting okay.

796
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,093
And so they have his head sticking out 
and then they would just pour ice cold 

797
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:36,120
water through the tub if for two hours,
twice a week.

798
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,930
Yeah,
it's a,

799
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,770
you can't do anything.
You're stuck them.

800
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,950
And they would do this to treat insanity
and it worked.

801
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,530
And then of course drugs came along and 
everything else.

802
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,210
And then all of this just gets 
forgotten.

803
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,070
Um,
but that's one example.

804
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:51,300
Another one is I found some monks out,
uh,

805
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,930
in Japan that study this,
um,

806
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,410
this form of meditation and Buddhism 
that where they sit underneath,

807
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:59,390
I'm waterfalls,
the waterfalls,

808
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:00,224
and they meditate and I found their 
chance and all of that that go along 

809
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,554
with that.
So that's something I'm going to put in 

810
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:06,430
this document as well.
So you know,

811
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,680
Hixon Gracie is,
it sounds familiar.

812
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:12,590
Hicks and Gracie is the grappler Gracie.
Yes.

813
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,700
He's hoists.
Gracie is the guy won the original UFC,

814
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,293
but he had his brother,
his brother Hixon as almost like a 

815
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,313
mythical creature in the world of 
martial arts because he's universally 

816
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,580
hailed as the greatest Jujitsu fighter 
of all time.

817
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,630
Okay.
Universally by,

818
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,180
this is the guy they call it the Michael
Jordan of Jujitsu.

819
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,140
Jujitsu is one of those things where 
there's so many good guys.

820
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,730
It's so hard to figure out who's the 
best.

821
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,210
Like this guy might be that guy and the 
next year that guy can beat this guy,

822
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:44,030
but this is Hickson.
He's also a legit Yogi,

823
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,790
like you practices yoga on a regular 
basis.

824
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,760
This guy,
he,

825
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,623
he's amazing and you know he's,
he's actually been on the podcast too 

826
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:54,250
and I had to check to talk to him.
That's the buffets.

827
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,860
Yoga was very buff,
especially when he was young.

828
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,560
Well,
he was a mixed martial arts champion,

829
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,590
a Brazilian Jujitsu champion,
but he was also the champion.

830
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,640
He was in that movie,
the Hulk.

831
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:05,474
He was,
the guy was teaching Ed Norton how to 

832
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:07,940
control his,
his,

833
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,953
his calm.
A control is a his anger to try to keep 

834
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:12,740
them from turning into the hulk.

835
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,903
But there's this documentary called 
choke and it documents Hicks and 

836
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:19,550
competing in the 1994 Japan valley to 
doe.

837
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,000
He went over to a [inaudible] 96,
maybe 96,

838
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,440
I don't remember what year it was.
Um,

839
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,563
but he went over to Japan and competed 
in this big mixed martial arts 

840
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,194
tournament and when he was over there as
part of the time that he spent was 

841
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,063
climbing into these freezing cold rivers
and getting out of these waterfalls and 

842
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,270
meditating.
Oh that's awesome.

843
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,133
And there's video of him doing it in 
like his other family members tried to 

844
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:41,654
do it.
They get in the water for a couple 

845
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,711
seconds.
I'm like,

846
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:46,310
fuck this right there he is.
He's in there doing these,

847
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,380
a yoga,
breathing exercises.

848
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:51,020
That's what women teaches a lot of that 
breathing to go along with.

849
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,120
You have to be really,
really careful.

850
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,230
There's been people that have passed out
doing the breathing exercise cause there

851
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,450
there's so deep and it's really like 
giving you all that oxygen.

852
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,403
Yeah,
I put it oxygen meter on my finger when 

853
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,990
I do the breathing exercises and I take 
it,

854
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,040
I have a right around 98 like no one's 
ever really at a 100 all the time.

855
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:07,874
Some people weird people are,
but I can bring myself up to a hundred 

856
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,760
percent and what does it measuring the 
oxygen and the level in your blood?

857
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,190
I just pure oxygen.
Yeah.

858
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:16,024
It's like a,
you know those little meters that they 

859
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:18,620
clip on you when you go to the doctor's 
office,

860
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,200
you can buy those for $15 on Amazon.
So,

861
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,860
but how's it did?
Was it tapping into your blood somehow?

862
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:25,694
Like how it measuring?
It's a little led light that it shoots 

863
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:31,340
into your finger and through looking at 
the led through finger,

864
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:32,174
like the same way,
like your phone can measure your heart 

865
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:34,820
rate,
right?

866
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,380
So this does heart rate along with a 
blood oxygen level.

867
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,570
How the fuck does it know your blood 
oxygen level?

868
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,400
I think magic and think,
damn,

869
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,234
this what a wonderful world we live in 
and it's available on Amazon prime for 

870
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,104
$15 not only is it amazing,
it's also will be here in one hour of 

871
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,543
use.
Postmates I'm fucking the JC to one 

872
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:56,040
click and I'm so addicted as the fall of
Western civilization.

873
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,173
The people that run those ups stores 
that get packages delivered to them and 

874
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,354
shit like that,
they did not know what they're signing 

875
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:06,060
up for with one click and came around 
suicide rates through the roof.

876
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,303
Like you gotta be hating life.
I guess maybe they just really in the 

877
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:13,350
packages and they love it.
I love it.

878
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,570
Someone who has like a package fetish,
there's like,

879
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:16,321
fuck you,
I'm more,

880
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,660
Amazon's coming.
People are in a weird shit.

881
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:19,890
They are into weird shit.

882
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,753
I mean,
I don't think there's ever a one thing 

883
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,940
that people have been into where I was 
like,

884
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,170
ah,
I can't believe it.

885
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,363
You know how there's those people that 
get into video games like Farmville and 

886
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:30,940
all that and they spend like hundreds of
pounds.

887
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,850
There has to be the equivalent of 
Amazon,

888
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:33,421
right?
Oh,

889
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:34,254
you don't have people that just want to 
click the shit out of Amazon every 

890
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,490
single day.
My grandfather was dying.

891
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,503
My grandfather,
when he was really old after my 

892
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:41,694
grandmother died in particular,
he was like super depressed and he got 

893
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:47,100
addicted to catalogs.
It's really sad.

894
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,570
They like my dad before he passed away,
he started,

895
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:52,381
you know,
as he would give us,

896
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:57,030
getting into his seventies started doing
just more qvc shopping and just stuff to

897
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,010
shows up and you're just like,
damn,

898
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,930
why'd you buy that?
And granted,

899
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,140
I mean he always had you always get cool
stuff.

900
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,980
I was always like,
oh,

901
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:07,410
that's a cool way to slice tomatoes or 
whatever it may be that showed up,

902
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,120
but it was like,
you don't need it.

903
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,740
I think old people,
they just are,

904
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:11,574
as our brain starts to go,
they just come more susceptible to that 

905
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:15,060
kind of stuff.
That is by everything.

906
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,953
Yeah.
That's why those late night 

907
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:20,440
televangelists are so dangerous.
Super Dangerous.

908
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,553
They are preying on people with faulty 
mechanisms and then they call it and 

909
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,424
donate $100 or whatever and they think 
they're going to save their child from 

910
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,480
diabetes or who knows.
You know,

911
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,853
they found a method a few years back 
that was really troubling and what the 

912
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:38,690
was is they would pray on the poorest of
poor people and would do,

913
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,710
would explain his late.
They would say,

914
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:43,860
I know you don't have any money.
I know your bills are due.

915
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,670
I know that you need this money,
but if you send that money,

916
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:51,330
God will multiply that money tenfold and
they'd have all these people.

917
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,021
They'd say,
I,

918
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:53,250
you know,
my rent was due,

919
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,770
you know my carpet.
They were going to repossess my car,

920
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,310
but I sent $100 and the whole audience 
is clapping and cheering.

921
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:02,420
I give a $100 to God.
That's all this first,

922
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,530
and then all of a sudden I hit that 
lottery ticket and a lottery ticket.

923
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,420
I said,
good Lord,

924
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:07,254
it's $500 it's true.
Jesus gave me $500 and everybody's 

925
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,400
clapping and cheering and they would go 
on to another story.

926
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,960
Meanwhile,
this guy's got a fucking f $5,000

927
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,710
suit on.
It's probably driving a Bentley.

928
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,120
It's,
it's dark.

929
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,690
It's the preying on people that have 
just faulty mechanisms.

930
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,524
Their brain is not working right and at 
their lowest possible point and then 

931
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,360
you're just kicking them.
They're down.

932
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:28,860
It's really,
really sad.

933
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,900
The old ones,
we're worried about death.

934
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,763
I mean death is imminent.
It's on the way the body's feeling and 

935
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,040
as body's failing,

936
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,700
here's some guy on television that's 
saying a bunch of things that you know,

937
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,690
and I think there's like sort of the,
a window of,

938
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,890
of cognitive function that starts to 
close and it's very hard to,

939
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,793
to perceive and you're on the outside.
You have to kind of like talk to them a 

940
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,040
lot to see like,
oh,

941
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,460
your ability to think is really clearly 
compromised right now.

942
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,330
Right?
And,

943
00:38:58,331 --> 00:38:59,164
but you know,
they talk and they talk and they seem 

944
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:03,520
fairly normal.
But if you're around them a lot,

945
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,400
then you kind of get the full picture of
what's going on.

946
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,260
And those,
those types of people,

947
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,300
like man,
that's what they,

948
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,630
they're going to prey on.
Yeah.

949
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,070
I mean it happens.
This is,

950
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,970
I don't know if you ever get forwarded 
those email chains that like people send

951
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:16,804
around.
My mom is obsessed with this kind of 

952
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:20,650
stuff in her,
in her seventies and it just like,

953
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,230
you know,
people saying that something is a fact,

954
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,260
especially in politics as well when it's
just made up,

955
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,830
you know?

956
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,663
And then it's like,
well I got it an email and it said that 

957
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:29,980
it was from CNN.
I'm like,

958
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,180
mom,
did you click the link to,

959
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:32,014
to actually take you to CNN?
Did it actually should say that in the 

960
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:34,581
article?
You know,

961
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,580
it's,
it's just difficult because they believe

962
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:38,890
anything that is on the Internet.
Yeah.

963
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,740
And there's also,
I mean obviously confirmation bias.

964
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,260
Like you could always find a form that 
will tell you that the world is flat.

965
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,450
There's a whole flat earth community out
there.

966
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,360
They've openly mock me.
They're angry at me.

967
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,740
Are you serious?
Oh yeah,

968
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:53,680
they've made videos.
How big or how big is the flat k?

969
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,150
Look,
if you,

970
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,990
if you stop and think about the sheer 
numbers of people just in this country,

971
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,460
just let's,
let's go with America.

972
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,590
There's 300 million people in this 
country plus,

973
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,424
right?
At least one out of a hundred is a 

974
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,090
fucking idiot,
right?

975
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,923
At least.
So you have 3 million fucking idiots 

976
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,330
just in this country and out of those 
fucking idiots,

977
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,940
you can tell.
I have a friend of thinks here.

978
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:18,970
If it's flat,
that really fully believe I'm talking to

979
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:19,804
you,
bitch,

980
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,780
he's crazy.
He's great guy,

981
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,643
great pool player.
A professional pool player thinks the 

982
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,200
fucking world is flat.
Who's,

983
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
he was arguing with my friend Justin 
about whether or earth was flat,

984
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,270
uncle Max.
There's all these fucking pictures.

985
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:32,440
He goes,
I think those pictures and fake.

986
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,453
So everyone's in on it from the 
beginning of time since they started 

987
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,510
taking pictures of planets,
all those planets,

988
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,610
The sun,
the moon,

989
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,503
Jupiter,
all that shit just happens to be round 

990
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,860
and you're not buying it.
Holy Shit.

991
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,990
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

992
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,260
You just have to feel compassion for 
those people then.

993
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,790
Right?
It's circular.

994
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,790
But it's flat.
It's something's not right upstairs.

995
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,060
Well,
I think people love to be the person who

996
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,310
does.

997
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,143
I think there's like a,
there's something going on in the human 

998
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,420
brain or the human brain has always been
curious and we're trying to innovate and

999
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,254
it's like there's like a,
a part of the brain that has this 

1000
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,530
insatiable desire to create better 
things and to innovate and to constantly

1001
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,613
find a better way in that.
We're always constantly searching for 

1002
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:19,720
secrets as well.
Oh,

1003
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,580
well if you do that,
then it works.

1004
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:22,414
Hey,
you take this flint and you're banging 

1005
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,720
it against this steel,
you can make a fire.

1006
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:26,554
So we find these things and then we're 
always trying to find the things that 

1007
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:30,970
people are hiding.
Like what are they hiding from us?

1008
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,140
Right.
What kind of secrets?

1009
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:32,974
And he find out about some secrets that 
are true and some conspiracies that 

1010
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:40,700
absolutely do exist,
whether it's William Randolph hearst,

1011
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,980
whether it's fucking Rockefeller trying 
to keep,

1012
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:43,883
you know,
alcohol from being legal because he 

1013
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:47,120
wants to protect the gasoline market.

1014
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,983
It's like all these like real 
conspiracies that you find out and they 

1015
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:54,050
fuel the speculation and then they want 
to be the one that tells you,

1016
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,210
you know that the sky is falling.
Right.

1017
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,130
They want to be the one.
There's no way around that.

1018
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,720
It's just going to happen until the end 
of days,

1019
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:03,380
2000 and you know,
it's a weird aspect of people.

1020
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,670
It's a,
well it's also,

1021
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,040
but I bet you believe in a few of those 
as well.

1022
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,660
I mean like what is your take on Ufo 
shows?

1023
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I don't think it's impossible that we 
have been visited by see no evidence.

1024
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,670
Don't think it's impossible.
So you do think it's possible?

1025
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,593
I think it's absolutely possible that we
could have been visited by a life form 

1026
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,800
from another planet and one point in 
time,

1027
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:23,750
but there's no evidence.
Zero,

1028
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,610
zero.
So you don't think any of the photos,

1029
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,453
any of the videos and those objects 
moving in my possession is the thing 

1030
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,660
that I've seen some objects that move in
space that are fascinating.

1031
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,550
Yeah.
Like some fast.

1032
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,110
And you're like,
how did that jump across?

1033
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,430
I mean,
that's amazing to me.

1034
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,264
I don't know what that is,
but also there's also some weird shit 

1035
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:41,804
that's,
that absolutely exists that they can 

1036
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,540
prove on earth.
Like bald lightening.

1037
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,070
Have you ever seen ball lightning?
No.

1038
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,030
This video is a ball lightning.
Paul lightning is like sums,

1039
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,060
weird phenomenon where lightening 
instead of coming down to the ground,

1040
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,790
it can fly around like a ball.
Yeah,

1041
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,690
yeah.
That's probably half of the videos.

1042
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,843
You have a good percentage.
There's a lot of them that are just 

1043
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:04,240
stars for people who are just retarded 
and they,

1044
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,971
they look,
oh,

1045
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,320
it's all like move.
Yeah.

1046
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,480
I mean there's been firefighters that 
have launched missiles,

1047
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:13,040
it stars planets or whatever.
It's like there was something about that

1048
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,030
Venus,
you know,

1049
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:16,970
people think the Venus is a spaceship 
and I think there's,

1050
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,900
there's also absolutely been 
experimental aircrafts,

1051
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,710
right.

1052
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,940
When we were filming fear factor in,
um,

1053
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,070
I'm way out in the middle of the desert 
and Palmdale,

1054
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,220
which is near Edwards air force base and
they had the stealth bombers,

1055
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:35,570
it was like right after September 11th 
and you watch those things fly over,

1056
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,250
you swear to God,
you're in Star Wars.

1057
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:37,911
Like,
okay,

1058
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,890
that's spaceship.
Darth vader lives on that,

1059
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:41,720
right?
He's flying that like this is,

1060
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,110
this is not a person in there because it
looks like a star ship.

1061
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,191
I've,
uh,

1062
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,024
I spent a lot of time out in the desert.
I used to work at the Nevada test site 

1063
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,350
by,
uh,

1064
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,183
area 51.
He did back way back in 2000 and you do 

1065
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,400
out there?
Well,

1066
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,610
I was into technology and uh,
this was,

1067
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:59,444
um,
kind of when I was studying computer 

1068
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:03,230
science and so I was working out there,
pretty low level job,

1069
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:05,330
but I had to bounce around between the 
different areas.

1070
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,000
So there's,
the test side is divided into,

1071
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,720
you know,
50 plus areas and like groom lake,

1072
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,650
like that area lake is one of them.
That's area 51 that's the best known,

1073
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,484
but there's so many other areas like,
and there's different things on every 

1074
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,600
plot of land.
And so,

1075
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:22,640
um,
there's one called a beef,

1076
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,430
which is the big explosive experimental 
facility.

1077
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:26,843
Um,
there's a lot of sub critical nuclear 

1078
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:31,380
testing has done underground so it 
doesn't break any treaties,

1079
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,010
but they can figure

1080
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,890
out,
um,

1081
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,100
the yield based on the test that they 
do.

1082
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,090
So they can still do kind of nuclear 
tasks,

1083
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:37,924
but it's not actually producing a,
but it's still closed off all the areas 

1084
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:41,610
when they do it.
Um,

1085
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,250
and then there's every three letter 
agency you could imagine,

1086
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,160
rents out a piece of the test site to do
tests and experiments.

1087
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,400
So it was my job to set up all the,
at the time,

1088
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,263
no Ville networking equipment between 
areas so that they can talk to each 

1089
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:55,770
other.
What year was this?

1090
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,640
2000,
uh,

1091
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,550
just before that,
99,

1092
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,440
98.
98.

1093
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,283
99.
2000.

1094
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,133
What was the year where they had to 
admit that that was actually a base 

1095
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,940
because they had to expand the area that
was forbidden to trespass on?

1096
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,760
Yeah.
I'm not sure what,

1097
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,030
what was in the 90s,
because they had denied it forever.

1098
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,890
They did when I was there.

1099
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,950
But it was so obvious,
like you would go into the,

1100
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,740
um,
it was weird because they were just,

1101
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,130
you would go into the,
well first of all,

1102
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:26,964
you couldn't go to any,
any area unless you had a reason to be 

1103
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:29,424
there.
And he also had to have a proper 

1104
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,210
security clearance.
So I had what was called the q clearance

1105
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,400
and then even if I had,
which was top secret,

1106
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:39,210
but even if I had top secret in less,
I had a request.

1107
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:42,150
And then if I went into an area that had
sensitive information,

1108
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:43,950
I would also have to be escorted at the 
same time.

1109
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,090
But some of the areas that weren't 
really classified,

1110
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:50,160
they were just secret areas.
Like,

1111
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,320
um,
the power facility for example,

1112
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:53,723
you'd walk in and they'd have the 
chilled power clearly going to groom 

1113
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:57,660
lake.
Like it would,

1114
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,380
you could see the line going straight to
groom lake,

1115
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,293
but they would say it didn't exist,
but it would show the line going up 

1116
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:02,970
there.

1117
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,590
And it was just like,
that's so silly.

1118
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:06,750
Like why would you even show that if 
that was the case,

1119
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:07,360
you know?
Well,

1120
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,750
I think they probably feel like no one 
can go there.

1121
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,100
So what are you going to do?
Right.

1122
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,860
We just,
it's easier to deny it go fuck off.

1123
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,970
It's not real.
Yeah.

1124
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,720
The air force took that over,
um,

1125
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,840
when I was there.
So the air force was running it.

1126
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,300
Um,
it was department of Energy,

1127
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,160
which handles all of our nuclear 
program.

1128
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,990
Uh,
but then the air force,

1129
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,390
and then there's another,
there's extra guard gates before you get

1130
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:29,220
there.
So when you head into mercury in Nevada,

1131
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,530
you get through one guard gate,
which is show your badge.

1132
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,640
Um,
guard comes on,

1133
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:33,474
the bus touches your badge,
looks at your id all if I could touches 

1134
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:37,740
it touches,
it has to physically touch it.

1135
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,120
I don't know.
It was just a thing.

1136
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:41,340
It was a requirement.
They have one them feel that it was real

1137
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,140
because it was just like laminated a 
certain way.

1138
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:44,430
So I didn't know what they had to touch 
it.

1139
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,560
Um,
and then once you get through the,

1140
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,090
the,
the front gate there,

1141
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,940
then to go and do a further areas,
you could drive out there but you,

1142
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,030
there'd be other gates if there was 
secret information going on between,

1143
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,163
um,
where you left and where you were 

1144
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:58,020
headed.
So if you want to get to groom lake,

1145
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,320
there was one other guard station just 
outside of,

1146
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:02,390
um,
the,

1147
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,960
the sedan,
sedan crater.

1148
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:04,794
If you look up sedan crater on Google,
there's this massive crater that was 

1149
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,560
done via nuclear test and right past 
that is one,

1150
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,310
one more guard station.
So it's severely compartmentalized.

1151
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,203
Oh,
absolutely.

1152
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,493
Wow.
And then a in an area can go dark and 

1153
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,380
then then,
you know,

1154
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,214
department of defense can come in and 
take it over and just do test there for 

1155
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:23,364
three months and then it's dark again 
and they just destroy everything they 

1156
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:26,704
were working on now,
like this massive crater from the 

1157
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,030
nuclear tests,
like they're all over the place.

1158
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,520
So the test that is just filled with 
craters,

1159
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,590
craters,
that's so crazy.

1160
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,010
And you can stand on the edge of their,
they have a little platform there.

1161
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,330
It's kind of fun.
Well,

1162
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:41,164
they did some,
some pretty extensive nuclear tests out 

1163
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,120
there.
Oh yeah,

1164
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,953
absolutely.
We had to wear a little dishonor around 

1165
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:51,460
our necks and make sure you're okay.
Well it wasn't real time,

1166
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:52,294
sadly.
So you would send it in and get it 

1167
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:54,394
analyzed afterwards and they tell you 
how much radiation exposure you had 

1168
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:58,150
fucking Christ.
But you know,

1169
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:00,820
we were all going in.
It was so mellow back then.

1170
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:04,450
It was already kind of all cleared out.
That's so spooky though.

1171
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,313
It is spooky.
There's all these craters all over the 

1172
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,010
place where they were just like a 
warning.

1173
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,280
Just drive up to,
yes.

1174
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,680
Yeah.
Tribes would like to get out.

1175
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,570
Now,
when you were there,

1176
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,600
was there anything that made you think 
that the government had any knowledge of

1177
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,490
extra terrestrial aircrafts?

1178
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,440
Was there any whispers of it?
Where's her?

1179
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,010
Uh,
there was whispers of a few things,

1180
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:31,120
but they weren't like Iti related stuff.
It was just a,

1181
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,640
it was government projects,
like other,

1182
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:36,460
other secret test projects that were 
going on.

1183
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,910
So you think that's what a lot of people
were seeing when they're talking about,

1184
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,670
I think it was five flying.
I truly believe,

1185
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,490
even though this isn't,
I never heard of anything,

1186
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:47,830
but I had,
I dunno,

1187
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,723
there was friends that we had that 
worked out in those areas and I think 

1188
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:55,300
they were experimenting just based on 
the skill sets that were going out there

1189
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,170
on a kind of antigravity related stuff.
Ooh.

1190
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,123
So that's,
that's kind of what groom lake wasn't 

1191
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:06,460
being used at that point in time for any
more research and development.

1192
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:07,294
I think all that had been,
I think it was all kind of underground 

1193
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,180
cause a lot of that is underground.

1194
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,460
It's an underground base as well.
So there's hangers out there and there's

1195
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:16,720
a really long runway.
But that was all for testing.

1196
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,430
That was done in like the,
you know,

1197
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,800
the seventies and eighties that were 
done out there.

1198
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,693
Fuck man,
I would love to go see what an 

1199
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,490
underground base looks like.
Yeah,

1200
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,090
they must raise the state of the art.
You would think that.

1201
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:28,924
But it,
a lot of this is underfunded stuff 

1202
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,640
really went underground one time in one 
of the areas and they make you take this

1203
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:35,590
respirator training before you go 
underneath there.

1204
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:36,424
So you have to know how to use these 
emergency packs in case just no air in 

1205
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:42,040
case there was no air.
First of all it's really cold.

1206
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,670
It gets really cold immediately as you 
start to go ground.

1207
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,940
Um,
and like,

1208
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,940
you know where I was wearing a jacket,
like it was,

1209
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:51,190
it was 40,
I don't know,

1210
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:52,420
it was so long ago,
but it was,

1211
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:54,310
it was where I had to wear like a 
lightweight jacket,

1212
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,170
like a meat locker or like refrigerator.

1213
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,740
Well it was once we got down in there,
it was kind of during the,

1214
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:01,930
when you go down into the,
the shaft that was,

1215
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:02,764
that was when it was a chilly.
But once we got in there was a little 

1216
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,300
bit more climate controlled.
Um,

1217
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,820
but you know,
they go down underneath the ground to do

1218
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:10,654
some of these experiments and so that's 
part of the reason why I had to go down 

1219
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,810
there.
Whoa.

1220
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,820
The other big thing out there is really 
awesome.

1221
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:17,380
It's called the Daft,
the,

1222
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,780
uh,
device assembly facility.

1223
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:22,150
Daff you can,
you can go with that one as well.

1224
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,690
This is where they assembled nuclear 
weapons in the United States,

1225
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,310
which is just,
um,

1226
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,260
so that was,
that was another fun one to check out.

1227
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,660
That was a super,
super guarded facility.

1228
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,523
That one was extremely hard to get into.
So these underground bases are 

1229
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:37,670
underfunded.
Well,

1230
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:39,800
this one in particular was used for 
experiments,

1231
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,690
so it wasn't like a permanent thing.
Right.

1232
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,010
A lot of these,
so for example,

1233
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:44,600
when they did the subcritical nuclear 
tests,

1234
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,450
they would have you go all the way 
underground.

1235
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,060
They'd set up all the test equipment,
they would seal it with concrete,

1236
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,000
they would detonate it and then they 
would close off the whole,

1237
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,000
so it was always locked down in,
just underneath there.

1238
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,940
And so that's,
that's Kinda just underground forever.

1239
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,190
That sounds like such a crazy way to do 
it.

1240
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,473
I mean,
they just didn't have the funds or you 

1241
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:05,270
know,
they're not going to go in there and dig

1242
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,820
up a bunch of busted equipment that 
already detonated.

1243
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,611
So it's like,
well,

1244
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:11,000
it seems like a halfway thought out 
idea.

1245
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,851
Like someone goes,
well,

1246
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,760
how are we going to contain the 
explosion?

1247
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,960
Okay,
okay,

1248
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,920
okay,
okay.

1249
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,143
This is what we're gonna do.
We're going to blow it up and we're 

1250
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:19,970
going to seal it off.
Okay.

1251
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,370
And then they just went with it.
Like nobody came along and go,

1252
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,090
hey,
fuck head.

1253
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,180
You can't do that.
Right.

1254
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,303
No,
that makes that place like toxic for 

1255
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:27,300
100,000
a year.

1256
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:28,460
You know,
this is,

1257
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,250
this is a facility that's the size of 
Rhode Island.

1258
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:32,270
I mean,
it's massive.

1259
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,163
There's so many wacky nuclear 
experiments that they did between 1940 

1260
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,510
oh yeah.
Like when they stopped.

1261
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,560
This is one of them is the most bizarre.
It's called operation starfish prime,

1262
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,980
where they detonated a nuclear bomb in 
the atmosphere.

1263
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,510
They shot a nuclear bomb up into the Mag
Nino's fear just to kind of,

1264
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:50,490
to see what it had happened.

1265
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,730
Why would you do that?
They wanted to see what would happen.

1266
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,400
I don't mean,
I don't know what their experiment,

1267
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,234
I mean you would have to actually talk 
to the original scientists because then 

1268
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,630
the fact that we know about it at all,
it's fucking insane,

1269
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:03,351
right?
They did this,

1270
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:04,184
but they,
they shot it like up into the van Allen 

1271
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:08,960
radiation belts and just launched a 
fucking bomb up there.

1272
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,630
I don't know to see if they could blow a
hole through it.

1273
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,840
This was when they were doing manned 
space missions too,

1274
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,030
so they might have been trying to blow a
hole,

1275
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:17,864
so to make it less radiation up there 
when they're sending astronauts through 

1276
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,094
it like crazy and who the fuck knows,
but the fact that they didn't know what 

1277
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,740
was going to happen and they decided to 
try it anyway,

1278
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,001
just like,
okay,

1279
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:31,700
we'll just shoot a fucking megaton bomb 
up into the atmosphere.

1280
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,070
The worst case scenario though is really
bad,

1281
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,100
right?
Like really,

1282
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:35,841
really,
really,

1283
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:36,890
really,
really bad.

1284
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,173
Yeah.
Like fucking a million people die of 

1285
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,100
cancer or something.
I mean,

1286
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:42,670
who the hell knows?
What does this one asking?

1287
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,960
Is that real picture?
It says that operation,

1288
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,650
is starfish happened during operation or
would you say starfish?

1289
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,290
Starfish prime.
It's called during operation.

1290
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,320
Dominic and his picture pops up.
Well,

1291
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,640
they,
it's probably real.

1292
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,533
I mean they did so many of them.
The one of my favorite ones of all time 

1293
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:03,410
was one where they did it in the ocean 
and they really didn't know what kind of

1294
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:07,490
a reaction they would have inside the 
ocean from a nuclear bottle.

1295
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:09,110
I've seen that one.
They video footage of that.

1296
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,011
Thank God.
Yeah,

1297
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:11,420
absolutely.
Jamie.

1298
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,390
See if you could see that detonated 
nuclear bomb in the ocean to find that,

1299
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,650
but it is.

1300
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,460
It was beyond what they thought the 
impact is going to be like.

1301
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:21,670
They actually had bowel shipstation.
Right.

1302
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,250
I saw them.
That'll ship wrecked me.

1303
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,093
I don't know how many people died and 
didn't know if there was even people on 

1304
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:28,320
those battleships.
I think they were telling me ships.

1305
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,090
Right.
I thought that was hopefully,

1306
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,490
hopefully,
because when it happened,

1307
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:34,650
I mean,
what in the fuck?

1308
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:37,800
I mean that water goes a mile high up 
into the sky.

1309
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,490
It's insane.
This is not the best video.

1310
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,353
There's a way better video where there 
is a bunch of ships around it and you 

1311
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:50,300
see the ships just get overwhelmed by 
the water airs.

1312
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,143
One of them look at that like there,
there is a perspective shot cause you 

1313
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:57,630
kind of get a sense,
I mean fuck man,

1314
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,650
nuclear power is insane and nuclear 
bombs are way more insane.

1315
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,130
The idea that you're going to split 
Adams and it's going to cause a reaction

1316
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:13,131
that is just so almost inconceivably 
powerful to the average person.

1317
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,460
Like what could be when we have like 
sort of a metric in our head about,

1318
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:19,880
okay this is a firecracker,
right?

1319
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,750
And then this is an mat.
It's here's,

1320
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,550
here's the video.
Yeah this is the big one.

1321
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,110
It's so fucking,
it's a mile into the air.

1322
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,450
You know,
here is an mat,

1323
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,640
here is a stick of dynamite.
Okay,

1324
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,830
here's a nuclear bomb.
Like oh well it's just,

1325
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,660
it's so,
it's so exponentially more powerful than

1326
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:42,090
anything that we can kind of wrap our 
brains around.

1327
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,160
And this is also,
you know,

1328
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,690
what was this,
what year was this shaming?

1329
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,553
This happened.
1950 [inaudible] 58 imagine what they 

1330
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:51,240
have now.
Right.

1331
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,320
I mean,
the 2016 version of that,

1332
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,660
I mean there's just no more water.
Right?

1333
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,610
The oceans gone,
you know,

1334
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:02,970
the ocean becomes a Sahara desert.
That's crazy.

1335
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,660
Yeah.
I mean,

1336
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,190
humans are bananas,
man.

1337
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,750
We're a weird little animal.

1338
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,573
And how long did you work out there at 
this test facility that was out there 

1339
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,740
for about two and a half.
Close to three years.

1340
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,590
Were you familiar at all with Robert 
Lasar?

1341
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,910
Yes.
What did you think about that?

1342
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,610
Ah,
I had heard that he was a contractor and

1343
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:22,660
it wasn't,
the story wasn't all that right.

1344
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,123
Um,
I heard that the area he talks about s 

1345
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,240
three I heard that's true.
That is a real thing.

1346
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,790
But I,
I don't know about his stories.

1347
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:36,540
His whole thing was a folding space and 
time and yeah,

1348
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,650
I don't know about that.
Well,

1349
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:38,484
he's a,
he's one of those guys that if you're a 

1350
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,920
dummy and you listened to him,
I mean you,

1351
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:45,770
you go,
oh well he makes it,

1352
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:47,340
he's making sense.
And he seemed so confident.

1353
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:48,174
Like I listened to him,
I don't know what the fuck he saying 

1354
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,843
like he's talking about magnetic drives 
cause I'm a dummy so I'm listening to 

1355
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:54,174
this,
this magnetic drive talk and talking 

1356
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:57,240
about these space ships and I'm like,
Oh my God,

1357
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:58,370
this guy is telling the truth.
Right.

1358
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,880
Because I don't know any better.
But if,

1359
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm sure if I was a real physicist and I
listened to him and be like up to this.

1360
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,400
That's not how it works.
What you saw,

1361
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:06,390
what?
What'd you say?

1362
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,620
No,
that doesn't work like that.

1363
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,300
You just have him on the show with yeah,
with exactly.

1364
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,550
I don't even know if he gives it 
interviews anymore.

1365
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,770
I mean I haven't heard about the guy 
forever.

1366
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,691
Yeah,
he was a,

1367
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,450
they were saying he was a contractor 
working for,

1368
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:23,890
was it dod or something like that or

1369
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,130
I don't remember.
It was weird because he was never in any

1370
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:29,650
of the official like catalogs of books 
or anything like that.

1371
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,760
So his story is a little bit,
I dunno,

1372
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,813
we'll also,
one of the guys is a guy named Stanton 

1373
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,990
Freedman who's one of the premiere uff 
ologists.

1374
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:41,270
He's actually like a highly educated guy
that's very skeptical,

1375
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:43,930
but most ufo claims was still believes 
it's possible.

1376
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,243
He did some research into the guy's 
background and believes that he lied 

1377
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:53,260
about his education and lied about like 
different places that he worked.

1378
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,090
But I dunno,
you know,

1379
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:55,840
it's,
it's,

1380
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,390
it's not,
it's fun to,

1381
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,283
to pay attention to,
but it's one of those things where 

1382
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:01,991
you're like,
man,

1383
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:04,150
I'm not really going to get a resolution
here.

1384
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,200
Right.
So it's just,

1385
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,300
for me,
it's the once a year,

1386
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,860
1130 at night youtube video fest,
right.

1387
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,703
To sit back and I'm just like,
I watched like three hours of youtube 

1388
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,184
videos.

1389
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,060
I'm like,
oh my God,

1390
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:16,943
Ufos.
And then I go to bed and the next day 

1391
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:19,450
and then it happens again in a year.
So,

1392
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,063
well I think for sure it's possible that
there's life out there in the universe 

1393
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:26,883
that is as intelligent as us.
But it's also possible that we're the 

1394
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:32,560
only one.
And the reason why I think it's possible

1395
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:33,394
that we're the only ones,
there's hundreds of millions of life 

1396
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,484
forms on earth,
but we're the only one with an atoll 

1397
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,700
where the only one with iphones,
we're the only one that knows how to use

1398
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:42,880
the Internet.
We're the only one out of these hundreds

1399
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,770
of millions of life forms on this 
goldilocks planet.

1400
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,271
It would make,
oh,

1401
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,104
you mean that up just our pos planet.
So you were saying out of all planets 

1402
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:52,450
were the only ones that use an iphone.
I was like,

1403
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,160
well that kind of makes sense.
We kind of invented it,

1404
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,500
but I mean out of this,
at this planet,

1405
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,543
you know,
it's not like we go into the fucking 

1406
00:57:58,631 --> 00:57:59,464
Congo and we find some strange species 
that knows how to send emails to each 

1407
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:02,830
other.

1408
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,560
You know,
we're the only one and then again,

1409
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,050
dolphins,
they do weird shit with each other.

1410
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,884
They can talk and whatnot.
We can only that you can't do most of 

1411
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:11,320
that stuff.
Well,

1412
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,760
not only that,
we don't understand what they're saying,

1413
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,710
which is kind of weird because we're 
supposed to be top being here.

1414
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,110
Are you familiar at all with John Lilly?
No.

1415
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,410
John Lilly's the guy who created the 
sensory deprivation tank.

1416
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,370
Oh yes.
I've done that.

1417
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,760
And he was also a pioneer of 
interspecies communication.

1418
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,790
He used to do acid and get in this,
uh,

1419
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,030
so keep your deprivation tank next to a 
dolphin tank and he tried to communicate

1420
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:36,350
with the dolphins and his did that work?
Oh,

1421
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,650
who the fuck man?
It sounds like it kind of could probably

1422
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:39,484
kind of good.
I mean maybe at the moment while he was 

1423
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,894
tripping balls floating and hearing,
he probably kind of got a sense of what 

1424
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:52,414
they were saying.

1425
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,730
I was in a tank once and I swore that it
was an experience that,

1426
00:58:57,731 --> 00:59:01,150
I mean the imagination is a very strange
thing.

1427
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:01,984
You know?
Imagine imagination is very weird 

1428
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,410
because it's a lot of people,
when you think of the imagination,

1429
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,131
you think of,
oh,

1430
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,770
he's making things up in his mind that 
aren't real.

1431
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,633
That's like the standard way of looking 
at the imagination and really like 

1432
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,930
pragmatic hard nose.
People would go,

1433
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,780
ah,
all he's doing is sitting around all day

1434
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,663
imagining things.
But imagination is responsible for that 

1435
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:24,740
clock,
this computer,

1436
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:27,380
the coffee mugs,
how to you ceramics,

1437
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:28,214
microphones.
Every fucking object on earth is all 

1438
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:31,184
created out of the imagination.
And I was in a sensory deprivation tank 

1439
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,830
and I had this experience where I was in
the jungle.

1440
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,843
And not only was I listening to these 
people speak this strange language but 

1441
00:59:44,851 --> 00:59:45,920
are still understood.

1442
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,920
You were not an Ios guy or anything?
No,

1443
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:51,440
I was high as fuck.
I forget what it was on.

1444
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,413
It was most likely edible po edible pod 
is my drug of choice in sensory 

1445
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:57,660
deprivation tanks.
Cause I think um,

1446
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,593
I think it'll pop first of all is one of
the most underrated psychedelic 

1447
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,114
compounds.
I just think people don't realize that 

1448
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:05,864
there is a profound difference between 
thc and what happens when your liver 

1449
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,530
processes it,
which is 11 hydroxy metabolite,

1450
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,290
which is four to five times more 
psychoactive than thc.

1451
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,393
Which is why a lot of people think when 
they eat pot cookies that it was laced 

1452
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,710
and something was in there.
No,

1453
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:22,340
no.
That is,

1454
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,500
that's what happens when you eat 
cannabis.

1455
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,200
That's what's responsible for the vedic 
texts.

1456
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,480
A lot of the ancient Hindu uh,
documents like all of their,

1457
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:34,070
um,
like a Yogi practices.

1458
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,710
Like I was a lot of that was about 
eating hash.

1459
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:37,663
Really eating hash has been a tradition 
amongst people for thousands and 

1460
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,233
thousands of years.
Eat the hash like this sticky hash that 

1461
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,810
yeah,
you can eat that for sure.

1462
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,644
I didn't know that that you have to 
smoke it because it's already been 

1463
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,590
broken down.
So it's,

1464
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,880
well especially when you cook it,
you cook it in something fat soluble and

1465
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,300
then you then,
and then you eat it.

1466
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:59,210
Like that's how you get it.
Right.

1467
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,493
And even in candy form,
I don't know exactly how they're making 

1468
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:03,290
it,
but you're eating it,

1469
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,243
you know,
so it's whatever it is that allows your 

1470
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:07,784
body to process it.
But when you do that inside a sensory 

1471
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:13,520
deprivation tank,
like on a a pretty decent size dose,

1472
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,540
you have some wild ass experience bad.
And one of mine was,

1473
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,780
I was in the jungle and I was with these
people,

1474
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,090
these,
these indigenous people and whatever,

1475
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:24,260
wherever this jungle was.

1476
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,393
And they were talking,
and not only did I understand what they 

1477
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,100
were saying,
but I was thinking in their language.

1478
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,560
It was very brief.
It was very brief.

1479
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:34,573
And then I was,
and then I realized what I was doing 

1480
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:36,884
that I woke up,
but I could never bring myself back to 

1481
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:40,670
that state again.
But I remember that this experience,

1482
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:43,430
which probably only lasted a couple 
minutes at most,

1483
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,640
was sensational.
It was very strange.

1484
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:47,474
And I was trying to think like maybe 
this is like some sort of like a deeply 

1485
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:57,161
tucked away genetic memory from back 
when you know the great,

1486
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:00,230
great,
great ancestors of whoever was,

1487
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:01,064
you know,
if you have to think any person that's 

1488
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:05,390
alive today,
somehow or another,

1489
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:08,600
your genes must be traced back to 
ancient people.

1490
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,220
Those,
there's only one way.

1491
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:14,810
You didn't get come out of a fucking a 
three d printer six weeks ago.

1492
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:18,590
You are a product of hundreds of 
millions of years of life.

1493
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:20,670
Right?
So if that is the case,

1494
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,200
some of that is probably tucked away 
inside your jeans.

1495
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:29,480
Interesting.
And there's this guy named trick.

1496
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,953
Well,
I think it's possible that there are 

1497
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,670
little like you know how sometimes 
someone will bring something up,

1498
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,930
like a,
someone will say,

1499
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,764
hey man,
you remember that guy who went to high 

1500
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:40,260
school with and then they go,
oh yeah.

1501
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,094
And then all of a sudden you remember 
Mike and then you remember Mike's Weird 

1502
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:47,280
car and you remember Mike's Girlfriend 
who beat him up and had that person.

1503
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:50,070
I've given you that cue.
It would have been gone forever.

1504
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,610
I think it's like,
I think there are folders and one of the

1505
01:02:53,611 --> 01:02:56,190
reasons why I say this is because,
um,

1506
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:59,310
I have,
I have a very obvious folders.

1507
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,830
Like when I'm talking about certain 
things,

1508
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:04,890
like say if we're talking about um,
you know,

1509
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:07,620
whatever psychedelic drugs or monkeys or
anything,

1510
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,360
it's like my mind has like a bunch of 
information that they can draw upon.

1511
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,193
But if you bring up something that I 
normally would be very knowledgeable 

1512
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:17,790
about,
like maybe mixed martial arts,

1513
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,950
like start asking me about certain 
fights are fighters.

1514
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:20,701
I have to go,
oh yeah,

1515
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:21,534
hold on.
But if I was commentating on a UFC and 

1516
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:26,700
it came up,
it would be there for me.

1517
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,340
It'd be right there.
It's like that folder would be,

1518
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,753
and I'd be able to access it.
So you just take it saying it takes a 

1519
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:33,960
little while for the folder to get open 
sometimes.

1520
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,880
Sometimes like that has to be your point
of focus.

1521
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,040
I mean,
I don't understand memory entirely.

1522
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:43,041
I don't necessarily understand how it 
works and how it varies so much.

1523
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,120
Like there's sometimes where like what 
does that fucking word?

1524
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,850
What's that fucking word?
And then it comes out and go,

1525
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:48,990
yeah,
how could I forget that?

1526
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,330
Worried.
That happens all the time and it's,

1527
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,480
it's worse as you get older too.

1528
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,110
What is,
what's happened to me my whole life?

1529
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:56,550
I don't think it's gotten any better or 
worse.

1530
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,703
It's,
it's always been that thing like what's 

1531
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,054
that fucking word?
And then someone will say it and he's 

1532
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,720
like,
yes.

1533
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,190
Right,
but what is that like?

1534
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:07,320
Why is memory variable?
Like,

1535
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:12,321
why has it come and why is it go and why
is it enhanced by certain compounds like

1536
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:14,730
per acetone and things along those 
lines.

1537
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:15,564
Coleen,
there's like certain different things 

1538
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:17,634
that will enhance your,
your ability to memorize things or 

1539
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:21,030
remember things,
recall things.

1540
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,420
But I think that it's got to be possible
that somewhere deep,

1541
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:30,720
deep down in our DNA or genome or 
something.

1542
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,360
There's some memories like,
and I think those,

1543
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,700
a lot of those memories are instincts 
like,

1544
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:37,200
um,
rupert sheldrake,

1545
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:38,790
who's a guy who's been on this podcast 
before,

1546
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,624
he's a,
he like evolutionary biologist or 

1547
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:42,024
something like that.

1548
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,450
One of his,
um,

1549
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,423
theories was about why children who live
in cities or afraid of monsters and he 

1550
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:50,244
thinks that there is a deep seated 
genetic memory of us being preyed upon 

1551
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:57,120
by cats,
by Jaguars and leopards and things along

1552
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:57,811
those lines.
You know,

1553
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,580
back when we were,
you know,

1554
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,433
less evolved hominids and that we're 
living in the trees and that these cats 

1555
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,514
are jack and us and they do it at night.
And that's why we're terrified of the 

1556
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,670
night and the darkness and monsters,
you know,

1557
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,760
we think kids,
they live in their cities.

1558
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:12,594
They should be scared about bullets and 
crime and car accidents and train 

1559
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,064
derailments and things that are really 
probably will be in several thousand 

1560
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,580
years once we'd like.
Right.

1561
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,590
That's becomes a part of the genome,
right?

1562
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,060
Yeah.
Who knows,

1563
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:25,894
man.
I mean,

1564
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,003
but I,
I,

1565
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,190
I found that experience being in the 
tank.

1566
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,323
It was so real.
That was what was bizarre and it easily 

1567
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:38,710
could be marijuana plus imagination plus
sensory deprivation creates this.

1568
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,640
Really,
I mean,

1569
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:41,300
that's a good comment.
That's amazing.

1570
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:42,310
Strong.
It's amazing.

1571
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:44,200
What do you think about Iowaska and all 
these other,

1572
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,660
it seems like that's the hot thing 
everyone's doing these days.

1573
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,431
Well,
it's time.

1574
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:48,510
Ethel.
Tryptamine right.

1575
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,353
I mean,
that's what I would ask is if chemo 

1576
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,620
smoke that on their own.
Yeah,

1577
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:55,380
I've swiped it.
Oh,

1578
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,300
you have?
Yeah.

1579
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,243
Yeah.
I've never done Iowasca because I've 

1580
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:00,094
never found anybody that's willing to 
get it to me without going to the 

1581
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:03,030
jungle.
Ah,

1582
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,913
you got to do the ceremony.
But the DMT experiencing itself is 

1583
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,860
unbelievably intense.
And just dmt itself is,

1584
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,953
it's,
it's a more powerful version of Iowasca 

1585
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,650
like Iowasca from what it's been 
explained to me,

1586
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:22,651
for everyone who's done it is longer and
oftentimes more introspective and it can

1587
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:26,650
be more profound even because it lasts 
longer and you have more time to sort of

1588
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,090
take in the experience.

1589
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,820
But as far as the intensity of the 
experience,

1590
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,654
it's not as intense as when you smoke 
dmt Andrew's day and smoking dmt is not 

1591
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:37,564
as,
it's not as powerful as when it's 

1592
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,933
injected intravenously.
And that's how they did it with Doctor 

1593
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:47,080
Rick strassman under the University of 
New Mexico did a series of tests,

1594
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:47,914
clinical trials on plank,
and he documented it in a book called 

1595
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:52,960
Dmt,
the spirit molecule.

1596
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,883
I've heard about that.
Isn't there a documentary on that as 

1597
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:55,421
well?
Yeah,

1598
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:56,770
I narrated it.
Oh,

1599
01:06:56,771 --> 01:06:58,180
you tell the host of it.
Yeah.

1600
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:58,990
Oh,
that's awesome.

1601
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,390
Yeah,
that's a,

1602
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,233
it's a really interesting documentary 
because it deals with a lot of 

1603
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,384
scientists and their experience with a,
with dimethyltryptamine and trying to 

1604
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:11,140
understand like what this compound is 
and why it exists,

1605
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:14,500
but the trips that people had when they 
took it intravenously,

1606
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:15,334
we're like half hour long just journeys 
into insanity into this like bad 

1607
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:23,704
insanity.

1608
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,371
No,
no,

1609
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:25,810
no.
All of them,

1610
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,190
I believe afterwards said that it 
profoundly enhanced their life and their

1611
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:35,191
perspective and gave them a view of 
reality that forever change the way they

1612
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:40,120
look at things about interactions,
life and,

1613
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,130
and I,
I could say that about myself,

1614
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:42,964
like my experiences with dmt have 
definitely profoundly changed the way I 

1615
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:47,584
view possibility because it's so 
impossibly dynamic and insane and it 

1616
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:56,620
just doesn't seem like anything that you
could have ever imagined.

1617
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,323
And what I Wasa is,
is an orally active version of DMT 

1618
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,910
because DMT is insanely common.
It is.

1619
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,793
It's in thousands of different plants.
It's in all sorts of different 

1620
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,770
ecosystems all over the world have 
plants that have DMT,

1621
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,870
including a lot of grasses,
like full Eris grasses,

1622
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,000
which is really common.
It's rich and tmt.

1623
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,950
Hmm.
But you can't extract it.

1624
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,420
Well,
you can't extract it for sure.

1625
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:24,283
Absolutely.
Like you have to just know what you're 

1626
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:26,630
doing.
If you're a chemist,

1627
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:29,570
it's actually not that difficult.
It's a reason why DMT,

1628
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:32,930
if you know people who know how to get 
DMT,

1629
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,093
the actual raw plants that's have dmt,
you can't make illegal because there's 

1630
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:39,290
too many of them.
Interesting.

1631
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,390
It's like you would have to make like,
it's one of the,

1632
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:42,224
um,
there's some scholars out of Jerusalem 

1633
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,533
that believe that this is the literal 
interpretation of what Moses was 

1634
01:08:48,411 --> 01:08:49,244
experiencing when experiencing,
when experiencing the burning Bush and 

1635
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:53,234
talking to God.
They believe that burning Bush is the 

1636
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:55,934
acacia tree because the Acacia tree is 
very rich and dmt and extremely common 

1637
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:05,090
in that part of the world.
So it was Moses smoking most likely,

1638
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,060
like if you smoke the Acacia tree,
do you get the DMT?

1639
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:08,894
I'm sure.
I'm sure if you light those trees on 

1640
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:11,204
fire,
you're going to absorb a certain 

1641
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,240
quantity of DMT.

1642
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:19,450
It wouldn't be as pure as like 
extracting it in a lab,

1643
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,070
breaking it down to the Rod dmt 
crystals.

1644
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,170
Then freebasing it,
which is what you do.

1645
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,880
That's probably way more intense,
but it's entirely likely that there is a

1646
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:32,420
method of doing it because the method 
that they found in the Amazon,

1647
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:36,230
it's extremely convoluted.
Like what they did was when you,

1648
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,200
when you eat,
if you eat a plant right that has dmt in

1649
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:41,180
it,
your body produces something called Mano

1650
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,020
Amy and oxidase that breaks down the 
dime.

1651
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:45,260
Ethel tryptamine in the,
in the plant and you won't,

1652
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,420
you won't experience it like eating 
we'd,

1653
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,670
it does nothing unless it's been already
pre broken down,

1654
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,533
but even more different because we'd has
to be like cooked in something in order 

1655
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:57,500
to activate it.
But if you just eat it straight up,

1656
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,110
just like the plant itself,
you won't feel anything.

1657
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,130
I don't think so.
You don't,

1658
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:02,700
you're supposed to really good for you 
though.

1659
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,140
If you eat like juicing,
juicing it like it's supposed to be like

1660
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:10,310
really rich in phytonutrients and it's 
supposed to be really rich and CBDS too,

1661
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,144
which don't necessarily get you high,
but a really good for you and good for 

1662
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,230
inflammation.
She was seeing it.

1663
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,210
Yeah,
it's a big thing,

1664
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:18,260
man.
People juice it.

1665
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,640
It's really,
really super common.

1666
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,470
Like wheat grass juice.
But they do it with cannabis.

1667
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,540
They take the leaves and they throw it 
and choose her.

1668
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,250
You get those at like the dispensaries 
here?

1669
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:25,760
Um,
no,

1670
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,440
no,
but I've seen it online.

1671
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:30,470
I've never actually seen it in person,
but I definitely have seen it online.

1672
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,663
So what these people have done when they
created Iowasca and they've been doing 

1673
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,390
this for,
no one knows how long,

1674
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,280
but they believe it's been thousands and
thousands of years.

1675
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,100
It's really hard to try to figure out 
how long they've been doing it.

1676
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:44,750
But they take the leaf of one plant 
which contains harming,

1677
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:45,584
which is a natural Mao inhibitor and 
they take the roots or the vine of 

1678
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:49,934
another plant,
which has the dimethyltryptamine in it 

1679
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,030
and they boil it.
So sort of a that process.

1680
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,593
So they figured out how to make their 
own pharmacological solution to love 

1681
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:04,730
absorbing dmt orally,
which is crazy.

1682
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,850
Well they say the plants told them how 
to do it.

1683
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,480
Of course they said that.
I don't know if that's wrong.

1684
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,980
I mean,
I just think our,

1685
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,010
our view of what

1686
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,090
a plant is,
it's like,

1687
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:16,640
Whoa,
I talked to my firm,

1688
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,483
it never says anything.
He got a plant that's in a fucking 

1689
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,124
plastic cup.
I think it's probably analogous to the 

1690
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:25,104
difference between that little tiny pig 
that's like a little baby pig and a 

1691
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:32,040
fucking wild paid who's out there 
hustling,

1692
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,350
making shit happen.
You know,

1693
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:35,783
there's a picture I met money put up on 
my instagram a few days ago of a wild 

1694
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:42,810
boar running off of the fon and its 
mouth.

1695
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:44,560
And you know,
and it's,

1696
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:48,930
it's a very shocking picture because we 
don't think of pigs as being predators.

1697
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,813
Right.
But there are opportunities and they 

1698
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:53,430
absolutely will prey on something if 
they can catch it.

1699
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:58,700
But that image is like as far removed on
the spectrum from that little pig,

1700
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,980
that little tiny pig that's got a guitar
on his lap,

1701
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,270
you know,
like look at this thing.

1702
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,580
Wow.
That bore and that is a,

1703
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:07,670
that that picks that playing guitar.
Yeah.

1704
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,513
And that's America.
That's a bore in America running off of 

1705
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,950
the deer farm.
And it's its,

1706
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:15,000
uh,
its mouth that the spores are big,

1707
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,160
they're fucking huge.
They get enormous,

1708
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,010
they get enormous.
And you know,

1709
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,510
there's ones that,
uh,

1710
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,373
they've,
they've caught them or kill them that 

1711
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:24,390
are,
you know,

1712
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,060
pushing a thousand pounds out there in 
the wild.

1713
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,240
But I think that,
that,

1714
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:31,740
that is a wild animal,
you know,

1715
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:32,663
and I think these wild plants that it 
living in the jungle that are alive in 

1716
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:38,274
the rain forest and had been there for 
thousands of years and this deep canopy 

1717
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,624
of moisture and nutrients and plants and
bugs and mammals and cats and all these 

1718
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:47,784
different things.
And then you got these people who live 

1719
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,840
like the,
the Toumani,

1720
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:52,674
they're walking barefoot through these 
fucking woods and Bolivia and throwing 

1721
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:58,350
fucking spears at monkeys and shit and 
cooking them over the fire.

1722
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:01,350
Like these people have been living like 
this for thousands of years.

1723
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,000
They're eating cocoa leaves and tripping
their balls off monthly fun cookies.

1724
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,980
Yeah.
It's supposed to be pretty awesome.

1725
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,240
Yeah.
You've never tried it before?

1726
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,480
I've had the t yeah,
I've had the coca demato tea,

1727
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,940
which I thought was pretty interesting.
I couldn't shut the fuck up.

1728
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:17,820
I didn't like that aspect of it.
The leaves are legal.

1729
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:19,500
You can buy the leaves.
Can you,

1730
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,230
you can.
I saw him on a Amazon actually.

1731
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,450
Yeah,
they was fucking dea hustle.

1732
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,710
Well you need the,
um,

1733
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,640
they had the compound to go with it.
It's a little bit of that uh,

1734
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,500
lime or these baking soda.
Baking soda.

1735
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:32,334
Yeah.
And then you just chew it and basically 

1736
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,970
it's like having a cup of coffee.
Well it's supposed to be better for you.

1737
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:38,700
And it also has,
it's actually like a healthy plant.

1738
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,940
The phytonutrients,
the,

1739
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,793
the,
the vitamins from the actual leaves of 

1740
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:43,350
the plant itself actually.
Good for you.

1741
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,213
Yeah.
It was actually chewing some with a 

1742
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,680
doctor friend of mine and he's like,
yeah,

1743
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:47,250
it's great.
I don't,

1744
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,660
so you could just order it.
Yeah,

1745
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:50,610
you can just order it and you just start
ordering a Jeremy,

1746
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:54,360
I'm going to do a podcast with a big 
fucking baseball sized cha.

1747
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,970
That's exactly what you did.
Put like a little wad in your mouth that

1748
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:57,870
it's a like,
you know,

1749
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:58,853
the conversation started.
I think it's entirely possible that 

1750
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:06,060
these people that are eating plants that
have psychedelic properties to them,

1751
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:06,923
whether it's mushrooms and you know 
there's a lot of mushrooms that you can 

1752
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:12,010
eat that and also in the same areas with
a lot of

1753
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,510
silicide been.
So they're,

1754
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:14,344
they're chewing these siliciden 
mushrooms and they have these ideas of 

1755
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:17,764
iconic combined these things.
You're talking about hundreds of 

1756
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:21,724
different species of plants and these 
fucking guys have figured out how to 

1757
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:24,574
take these two and combine them in some 
really crazy involved way where you 

1758
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:32,710
boiling it and how,
what's the explanation?

1759
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:33,693
There's no explanation that makes any 
sense other than the plants gave them 

1760
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:38,531
the hints.
Yeah,

1761
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:40,830
I think that I've always believed,
and I've my,

1762
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,733
my wife's a neuroscientist,
so we talk about this stuff a lot in 

1763
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:46,660
debate it,
but I've always believed that,

1764
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,523
you know,
we know about the senses that we've 

1765
01:14:48,821 --> 01:14:49,654
documented and I think that there's 
certain things that we can take the 

1766
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:53,344
activate other senses that we didn't 
know were there and allow us to do 

1767
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:57,970
certain things.
Like for example,

1768
01:14:57,971 --> 01:14:59,620
talk to plants or whatever it may be.

1769
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:02,590
It's not going to be the,
you know,

1770
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,080
I'm having a conversation and it's 
talking back to me.

1771
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:05,914
But it could be a feeling or a vibe or 
they know some way of anything else 

1772
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,500
there.
You know,

1773
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,423
we'll do you know,
when scientists first found harming and 

1774
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:16,114
a,
I want to say this was in the early 19 

1775
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,150
hundreds,
I forgot what you,

1776
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,990
what year it was,
but when they first found harming,

1777
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,860
they wanted to call it telepathy mean 
the,

1778
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:27,694
I think it was psychiatry is Veritas.
I think that was the plan that they 

1779
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:31,270
found it in.
I forget what the plant,

1780
01:15:31,271 --> 01:15:33,220
they found that it was,
but the,

1781
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:35,140
um,
the compound,

1782
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:38,230
whatever it was,
had allowed these people,

1783
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,093
these scientists to feel like they were 
experiencing some sort of communal 

1784
01:15:43,511 --> 01:15:47,370
thoughts and so they wanted to call it 
telepathy,

1785
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,633
but because of the fact that once they 
had isolated the compound figured out 

1786
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:52,564
what it was,
they realized that had already been 

1787
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,240
named harming,
you know,

1788
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:59,160
due to the,
the rules of scientific nomenclature and

1789
01:15:59,161 --> 01:15:59,994
they decided to just keep that name,
but their name for it was going to be 

1790
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:03,730
telepathy.

1791
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,790
Raisie yeah,
you want to hear it?

1792
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,380
This is a somewhat related topic,
but I,

1793
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:09,250
I have,
um,

1794
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:14,370
someone that I met that has a startup 
that catalogs people's dreams,

1795
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,053
so they,
they fill out like a little small 

1796
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:21,580
questionnaire after they have a dream 
and something that they've discovered.

1797
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:24,010
I don't know that they've published this
or come out with any data,

1798
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:24,844
released it publicly,
but people are dreaming the same thing 

1799
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,110
on the same night.
It's,

1800
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,500
it's,
it's a thing.

1801
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:34,900
And so like in like masses of people are
having the same dream.

1802
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,890
So what kind of dream?
I don't know.

1803
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,953
I,
this is like over a beer that we had 

1804
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:40,750
this conversation at a,
at a party.

1805
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:44,110
So I need to get back to them and say 
let's get this data out there.

1806
01:16:44,111 --> 01:16:45,790
I'm curious as to what it is.
Shit.

1807
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,340
Yeah,
that's wild.

1808
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,331
Like,
um,

1809
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:51,190
so how many people they're studying?
Um,

1810
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,433
it's not as official study.
It's just like an app for people that 

1811
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:56,820
like to catalog and keep track of their 
dreams.

1812
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:00,400
So he's looking at it in aggregate and 
finding these patterns.

1813
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:02,080
So they recorded at nightly like,
yeah,

1814
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,090
like you wake up in the morning and then
like you write down,

1815
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,910
I dropped about sharks eating dolphins 
or whatever it is,

1816
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:09,590
and then they're seeing patterns and 
large groups.

1817
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,813
It's really trippy,
imaginative dreams or like a gigantic 

1818
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:14,144
Sydney Opolis.
And you could pick which movie you go 

1819
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:17,024
into and there's a bunch of other people
in the movie with you watching the same 

1820
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:20,390
thing.
It's a really weird,

1821
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,700
but also like movies,
some thinking.

1822
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:24,920
It's beautiful.
Others thinking it's shit.

1823
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:25,880
Right.
You know,

1824
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,480
incredibly subjective.
It's really a truck man.

1825
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,960
Crazy.
That is God damn crazy.

1826
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:34,303
If that turns out to be something today,
discover and that starts getting 

1827
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:41,450
expanded upon and people start really 
bringing this up on a regular basis,

1828
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,760
we find out that that's,
that's real hard data.

1829
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:47,630
That's going to be amazing.
What a game changer that would be.

1830
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,890
Yeah,
absolutely.

1831
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,950
Have you ever taken things before you go
to bed to enhance dreams?

1832
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,240
I know,
no.

1833
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,470
I'm gonna give you something before you 
leave.

1834
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:55,221
Yeah.
Yeah.

1835
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:56,870
Have you ever tried Alpha brain?
No.

1836
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,050
Alpha brain is a nootropic and then 
there's this company on it.

1837
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,883
My company produces coal.
We have double blind placebo controlled 

1838
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,054
studies showing that from the Boston 
center memory sewing that enhances 

1839
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,010
memory,
enhances executive function,

1840
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:10,940
enhances,
um,

1841
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,320
reaction time.
Wow.

1842
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:16,220
Also that your body,
it puts your body in an Alpha state.

1843
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,083
It puts your mind in Alpha state.
But one of the big things from it is if 

1844
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:22,160
you take it before you go to bed,
it gives you lucid dreams,

1845
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:26,330
like really vivid dreams.
And the way I describe it as an,

1846
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,340
I try not to take it sometimes before I 
go to bed,

1847
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:29,840
just cause I don't want to wake up in 
the middle of night,

1848
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:32,310
freaked out,
have to pay then can't go back to bed.

1849
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:34,220
I like,
my sleep is precious to me.

1850
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:37,880
Like I need at least six hours to be 
functional.

1851
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:38,600
Oh,
I'm the same way.

1852
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,710
And if I don't get it,
I just,

1853
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,510
I preserve that sleep.

1854
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,363
I guarded.
Are you tracking it with like a fitbit 

1855
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:45,310
or something?
You No.

1856
01:18:45,311 --> 01:18:46,420
And just sleep.
But um,

1857
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:50,960
I sleep well but I'm really like 
diligent about it so I don't,

1858
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:52,063
I don't fuck,
I don't go online late at night and 

1859
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:54,754
freak myself out if I know I have to go 
to bed and I'm not going to like watch 

1860
01:18:57,231 --> 01:19:01,280
animal attacks or some fucking cops 
shooting some kid and just tripping out,

1861
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:02,490
you know what I mean?
Oh absolutely.

1862
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,280
Yeah.
There has to be a two hour window for me

1863
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,730
every night.
I try to not do electronics and get flux

1864
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:09,080
too,
which I'm sure you already have.

1865
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:11,330
What does flux?
It's a for your laptop.

1866
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,450
It shuts off all the blue light.
You know what I'm talking about?

1867
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,901
Oh,
oh,

1868
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:15,734
so also apple,
just a introduce this in the latest 

1869
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,374
version of Ios you can turn on and takes
out of the blue light out flux does it 

1870
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:21,380
for the laptop.

1871
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,360
Oh.
And so at sunset this,

1872
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:26,030
the screen starts to remove all the blue
light and it just,

1873
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,123
they're,
they're saying it helps you sleep 

1874
01:19:27,681 --> 01:19:29,060
better.
And I found that was the case.

1875
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,140
Yeah.
There was this,

1876
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,430
um,
this,

1877
01:19:31,431 --> 01:19:32,264
uh,
this futurist convention in New York 

1878
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:38,990
City,
a few back a few years back,

1879
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,540
2042,
they think that a,

1880
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,280
in 2042,
you know,

1881
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:46,940
that's the going to be the year that 
artificial intelligence takes off.

1882
01:19:46,941 --> 01:19:51,500
And there was all these Weirdos that 
were creating these robots so they could

1883
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:52,334
talk to and thinking they're going to 
download their consciousness and 

1884
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,290
computers.
Well,

1885
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,124
there's a bunch of guys who had these 
screens over their phones because they 

1886
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:03,350
were convinced that the artificial light
that's emanating from phones is damaging

1887
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:04,184
your brain and damaging sleep patterns 
and giving you an artificial light 

1888
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:09,810
source,
especially right before you go to bed.

1889
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,120
Could potentially disrupt your sleep.
Yeah.

1890
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,141
Yeah.
That's,

1891
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,610
that's the whole theory behind all of 
this stuff.

1892
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,043
Yeah.
My wife was wearing these wacky glasses 

1893
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:18,300
for a while,
like,

1894
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:19,134
uh,
like you remember the Baas Brian 

1895
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:22,590
Bosworth,
remember those fucking goes,

1896
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:23,663
those blades that would cover your whole
face is this shoot led light and you're 

1897
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:27,953
just like,
uh,

1898
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,990
like it's like a orange.
It's like,

1899
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:32,430
and that it was,
the idea was that was,

1900
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,060
it would filter light.
So the blockers,

1901
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,150
yes.
In a way.

1902
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:41,180
Yeah.
But it was designed specifically to calm

1903
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,330
the,
uh,

1904
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,100
the interaction of your,
your eyeballs with like,

1905
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,520
yeah.
Amazing.

1906
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,053
We're looking at a photo of Brian 
Bosworth who was a famous football guy 

1907
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:54,594
from the 1980s,
I guess with these ridiculous glasses 

1908
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:59,550
that no one wants anyone to hearing to.
Yeah.

1909
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,393
Let's terminator glasses.
Those were the things right after the 

1910
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:05,010
terminator.
But these,

1911
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:06,750
um,
goggles,

1912
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:07,584
these things that people wear,
they wear them and they think that 

1913
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,340
somehow or another like filtering the 
light will enhance your sleep and,

1914
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,110
hmm.
Is there science behind all that?

1915
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:17,720
Like the flux thing or is she doesn't 
know.

1916
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:20,190
There was,
I didn't look into the science.

1917
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:22,320
Um,
but if apple's adding it,

1918
01:21:22,321 --> 01:21:24,750
there must be something they wouldn't 
just do that for funsies.

1919
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:27,750
Yeah.
I assume data behind it.

1920
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,930
Do you use all apple products?
For the most part,

1921
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:31,764
I have an android phone as well,
just to kind of mess around with stuff 

1922
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,520
to stay current.
But um,

1923
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,660
yeah,
almost all apple.

1924
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,520
Yeah.
I have an android phone to,

1925
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,513
um,
I think the galaxy phones or they're 

1926
01:21:40,921 --> 01:21:43,620
probably pretty commensurate.
I mean,

1927
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:44,340
I,
I'm,

1928
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,690
when I go back and forth,
I mean it's,

1929
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:46,524
one of them is to get used to it and the
way it communicates with laptops and 

1930
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:53,040
other apple people and the ability to 
airdrop stuff.

1931
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,960
There's like some definitely benefits.
Sure.

1932
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,420
But there's also some benefits of the 
android platform to,

1933
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:58,201
you know,
I liked the,

1934
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:00,120
uh,
all the new Amazon prime stuff.

1935
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:02,700
Like they're the new TV.
It's great.

1936
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,500
Yeah,
it's got all the streaming.

1937
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:05,630
It's,
it's better Ui,

1938
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:07,770
I think the new apple stuff.
Yeah.

1939
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:10,710
I mean Amazon,
I wish that it would catch up and become

1940
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:12,780
like a real competitor to Netflix.
I think it's,

1941
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,643
they're kind of closing in there,
creating their own content now and 

1942
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:16,560
they're trying,
they're trying to,

1943
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:17,394
uh,
to really become like there are some 

1944
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,230
options to where you can download the 
movie,

1945
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:25,530
the movies to your device,
which you can't really do with Netflix.

1946
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:27,090
So if you're on a plane or something 
like that,

1947
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:27,924
flying over the ocean,
you're kind of fucked if you want to 

1948
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,960
watch netflix.
Um,

1949
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,850
but there's,
there's also some stuff that I think,

1950
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:37,980
um,
you can,

1951
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:38,843
you can definitely,
you can definitely make the argument 

1952
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,083
that it's probably a good idea to 
support emerging pot or other platforms 

1953
01:22:45,511 --> 01:22:46,950
as well.
Like there's,

1954
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:50,220
it's not a good thing for everybody to 
be on apple.

1955
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:50,971
Right.
You know,

1956
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:51,804
I think the more android's come up with 
more sophisticated devices and more 

1957
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:58,140
interesting options and features and 
applications more,

1958
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:00,150
it's going to force apple to raise their
bar as well.

1959
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,110
Yeah,
absolutely.

1960
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,780
And I think that a lot of the Amazon 
stuff like the echo,

1961
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:06,130
like those devices in your home,
you can speak to those

1962
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,180
are,
those are a lot of fun.

1963
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:09,110
I'm actually finding it pretty useful.
Yeah.

1964
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,770
What do you use it for you that you're 
seeing there in the kitchen?

1965
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:12,604
You're like,
I ran out of trash bags and you just 

1966
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:14,920
say,
you know,

1967
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:19,390
order me new trash bags and then it 
looks into your previous purchases.

1968
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:21,340
It knows that you've bought those bags 
before.

1969
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,290
It knows your home address and as your 
credit card.

1970
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,490
And I just thought I'd make this ends it
out.

1971
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,920
And do you have to press a button to 
Santo,

1972
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,190
but just say it now.
You just,

1973
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:30,910
you just query the device and just say,
order me trash bags.

1974
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:31,744
That's it.
So you have to talk to the device and 

1975
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:33,490
say,
Hey Alexa.

1976
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:38,200
And it's like people get mad when I say 
hey theory on the podcast,

1977
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:39,520
because then their phone starts going 
off.

1978
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,110
Turn that shit off folks,
that,

1979
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,550
that series stupid.

1980
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,340
She doesn't know what the difference 
between a podcast in your own voices.

1981
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,200
It's not ready yet.
She's not the vest.

1982
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,050
She's not ready.
Is there a Google version of Siri?

1983
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:50,351
There?
It is,

1984
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:51,184
right?
Yeah.

1985
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:52,390
What's it called?
A okay.

1986
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:53,380
Google.
Oh,

1987
01:23:53,381 --> 01:23:54,970
and that's what you say it's same thing.
Yeah.

1988
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:56,690
Google now.
So they call ejc.

1989
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,180
Okay Google.
And then it just,

1990
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:59,403
the Google one's actually quite good.
I've been wanting to fuck around with a 

1991
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:04,990
windows laptop for awhile.
I can't bring myself to do it.

1992
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:08,710
And they got the new tablet and I use it
for about a week and I send it back.

1993
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,290
Well,
what's funny is you get it and you're so

1994
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,460
excited and you're like,
oh,

1995
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:13,294
it looks cool.
Like you know they've sold me because 

1996
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,860
they come up with these like fun little 
videos and stuff and,

1997
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,720
and then you realize you're like,
fuck,

1998
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,780
I'm in windows in your backend.

1999
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,340
Like it'll reappear.
Like you'll go,

2000
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,500
it'll look like this beautiful interface
and you're like,

2001
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:27,334
oh cool apps and all this and whatnot.
And then you go into settings and it's 

2002
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:30,970
like,
there's like a 10,000

2003
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:31,804
options and it,
it defaults back to that old windows 

2004
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:36,310
feel.
I don't know if they fixed that with the

2005
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:38,500
latest version,
but I mean that was my problem with it.

2006
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:39,334
I just,
I realized this is just windows again 

2007
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,640
and it,
was this a tablet?

2008
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:46,330
It was a tablet.
Can you still go into dos?

2009
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,673
Yeah.
I think he can still go and still in 

2010
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,850
command prompts.
Yeah.

2011
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,180
Which I kind of liked.
That brings back the old school.

2012
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,800
It's just um,
there's some new laptops.

2013
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:00,230
Like Lenovo has some,
a new thinkpads.

2014
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:03,370
They are pretty interesting.
Really good keyboards.

2015
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:05,320
And what about the chromebook?
Have you played around with that?

2016
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,980
No,
haven't,

2017
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,760
those are pretty cool.

2018
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,440
Well,
I had a friend who worked for Google and

2019
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:10,000
she had one of those and I was like,
okay,

2020
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:12,010
where do you store things on this?
We can't,

2021
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,450
it's all in the cloud.
What?

2022
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:16,120
You can't the fuck out of here?
Like you can't,

2023
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:18,670
you don't have anything on your laptop,
fuck off.

2024
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,533
No,
I'm kind of like that now with the 

2025
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:20,890
apple.
Yeah.

2026
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:21,790
Yeah.
Why not?

2027
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,430
Because then you can smash it.
You can lose it,

2028
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:25,510
whatever.
Who Cares?

2029
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,670
You just get a new one and you're back 
up and running in like 10 minutes.

2030
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:30,040
Do you,
but do you have any of your writing that

2031
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,560
you don't want people to access that's 
up there in the cloud?

2032
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,480
You just use two factor auth and all 
that stuff?

2033
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,343
What is that?
That's where it has to send you a text 

2034
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:40,270
with a code in order for you to log in 
with a new device so that way,

2035
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:42,460
even if they know your password,
they can't get into your stuff.

2036
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,140
That makes sense.
Yeah.

2037
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:46,180
So I have that turned on for everything 
and then yeah,

2038
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:47,530
everything's in the cloud.
All photos,

2039
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:49,540
all videos,
all documents,

2040
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,290
everything.
You're a man with no porn.

2041
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,263
No,
no,

2042
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,680
no.
Dick pics are floating around.

2043
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,000
Spike.
You feel real confident.

2044
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:55,661
You're like,
yeah,

2045
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:57,910
it's in the cloud.
Go ahead and look at pictures of my dog.

2046
01:25:57,911 --> 01:26:00,290
Who gives a shit I saw.
Yeah,

2047
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,233
there was a sticker I want to get.
Is it like the cloud is really just 

2048
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,980
someone else's computer,
which is very true.

2049
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,480
It is it just someone else's computer?
No clouds up in the sky.

2050
01:26:09,481 --> 01:26:12,260
You fucks like why are you calling it 
the cloud when it's on the ground?

2051
01:26:12,261 --> 01:26:14,090
That's so stupid.
It's just someone's computer.

2052
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,650
It's a weird name.
Like why?

2053
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:18,080
Why say the cloud?
I don't understand why you would say the

2054
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,550
crises.
Cyberspace.

2055
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:21,063
Yeah.
I guess we don't really use cyberspace 

2056
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:22,904
anymore.

2057
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,850
That really wasn't that brought up.
But the cloud is,

2058
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,200
is weird,
but what would be a good replacement for

2059
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:31,640
what the clipboard,
the cloud,

2060
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,750
uh,
expression.

2061
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:34,580
I Dunno.
I kinda like it.

2062
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:37,460
It's kind of stuck.
It makes me think of this like,

2063
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,010
well,
the thing about the cloud easy,

2064
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:42,230
it's redundant.
Like you can never lose.

2065
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:45,290
Your data is distributed.
So clouds are everywhere.

2066
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,940
So in theory,
so as your data,

2067
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,760
which is concerning slash awesome.
Hmm.

2068
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,250
Yeah.
But if she,

2069
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,690
I just am always in this position where 
I say,

2070
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:57,740
well,
what if,

2071
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,173
um,
I can't get online and I want to have 

2072
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:04,070
access to my stuff.
Most of it is low,

2073
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,600
locally cached,
right?

2074
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,430
So if you have a,
you know,

2075
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,130
icloud on your desktop or dropbox or 
anything else,

2076
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,670
even if you're an airplane mode,
it's still gonna be there.

2077
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,670
You just double click to open it.

2078
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,040
You're good to go.
It syncs the changes later.

2079
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,420
Um,
you know,

2080
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:19,700
what you're doing it for is really just 
a fancy backup.

2081
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,560
You know,
in case he ever lose the device,

2082
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:23,960
everything's there.
The fancy backup is a great idea.

2083
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:27,860
But what would it actually disturbs me 
is the idea that we're going to get to a

2084
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:28,694
point where you don't have any hard 
drive space and so you're not storing 

2085
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:32,294
anything.
You're just accessing things that are 

2086
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:34,910
somewhere else and you're paying for 
that service.

2087
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,123
I pay apple probably $150 a year for my 
cloud storage and it backs up all of my 

2088
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:43,030
devices to have cloud.
Do you do the apple music thing when you

2089
01:27:43,031 --> 01:27:45,950
pay the eight bucks a month?
I did play with it.

2090
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,670
I thought the interface kind of socks.
Itunes is so bloated right now.

2091
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:54,260
What is cool though is Siri could call 
up songs and you just have on your phone

2092
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,461
like,
Hey Siri,

2093
01:27:55,461 --> 01:28:00,140
play Michael Jackson and it'll say what 
song and then you say thriller bitch.

2094
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,420
Amazon does that too.
The echo does that.

2095
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,733
Yeah.
Yeah.

2096
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:07,040
You can just tell it to play anything 
and if you have Amazon prime,

2097
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,980
you get access to all their free prime 
music and then it just plays it.

2098
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,710
They're all doing it now and spotify.
Everybody's doing it.

2099
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,753
Yeah.
I feel like I want to fuck around with 

2100
01:28:14,691 --> 01:28:17,990
other platforms just because I'm just 
been such an apple dork.

2101
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,003
But then part of me goes,
but that's just cause you're a 

2102
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:21,260
procrastinator and you don't want to 
work.

2103
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,350
You want to start playing with some,
oh I'm but I'll get to work.

2104
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:25,184
Once I figured out how to run this new 
lamp option and figured out how to 

2105
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:31,160
format my hard drive now how do I de 
Frag on this windows device,

2106
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,950
what we all do it and then you always 
come back to apple.

2107
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:34,784
At least that's my,
I've been in my experience cause you're 

2108
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:36,650
just like,
ah,

2109
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:39,860
there's some little things that it 
doesn't do right the way you're used to.

2110
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:42,440
And then he'd go back to also apple 
keeps getting better.

2111
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,363
The devices keep getting better.
They just get it better and better and 

2112
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:46,940
better.
And like this one then I have,

2113
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:50,810
here is no his flash drive,
which I'm fucking addicted to.

2114
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,410
So it powers on like that accesses data 
like that.

2115
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,493
I'm just so addicted to that because I 
remember the spinning spinning of the 

2116
01:28:58,401 --> 01:28:59,390
hard drive.
Right.

2117
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,590
And if you dropped it the hard drive 
break.

2118
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,220
Yeah.

2119
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,840
These things are bulletproof.
They are,

2120
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:04,850
yeah.
Is that one?

2121
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,660
That one's not retina display.
That is,

2122
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,470
it is,
yeah.

2123
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,070
That is,
no,

2124
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,500
it's,
Oh that's a Mac book pro.

2125
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,940
Yeah.
Okay.

2126
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:10,860
That's,
yeah.

2127
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,570
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2128
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,550
Rather displays a big difference.
Pretty Slick.

2129
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,000
Especially when I had my glasses on.
Yeah.

2130
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,720
On a reading.
Like when I don't have my glasses on,

2131
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,530
what's the point?
It doesn't matter at that point.

2132
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,790
Barely can read text.
I mean I could,

2133
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,460
I could kind of like this is in front of
us.

2134
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,130
We were looking at it like normal size 
type like that.

2135
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:29,964
Right.
Like I have to kind of like opened my 

2136
01:29:31,561 --> 01:29:34,430
eyes up wide and I can read it but it 
um,

2137
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,500
it's not good.
I just bought it.

2138
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,820
It's hilarious cause I bought a book on 
how to correct your eyesight and how to,

2139
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:42,750
is that a real thing?

2140
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,820
Yes.
There's bates method,

2141
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:47,970
the base of bates method of improving 
your visions to dates method.

2142
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:50,010
Yeah.
It's not like exercises for your eyes.

2143
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,440
Katy Bowman,
Katy Katy Bowman,

2144
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:53,274
Katy Bowman who was on the podcast is 
kind of an expert and physical movement 

2145
01:29:57,691 --> 01:29:58,524
and she's got a lot of interesting ideas
about biology and one of her thoughts 

2146
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,860
about,
about glasses and about,

2147
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:05,694
uh,
when you spend a lot of time looking at 

2148
01:30:07,621 --> 01:30:09,360
computers,
looking at a screen,

2149
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,313
she was like,
you're looking at something that's a 

2150
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:11,724
very fixed distance,
which is unusual and the is not really 

2151
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:17,610
designed to focus constantly on a fixed 
distance for eight hours a day.

2152
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:20,430
Your body's supposed to look at things 
that are over there,

2153
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:22,200
things that are up here,
things that are everywhere.

2154
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,213
And in that way your body gets this 
broad range of things that you're 

2155
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,310
viewing all of these different 
distances.

2156
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,250
And when you look at something that's in
a fixed distance,

2157
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:36,630
she likens it to being in a cast like a 
year and a cast your,

2158
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:37,920
your muscles atrophy.

2159
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:38,783
Ah,
I hate that technology slowly killing 

2160
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:41,760
us.
I love it and hate it.

2161
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,190
I think it is.
Absolutely.

2162
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,200
You know,
I found myself,

2163
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,093
uh,
w first Sandona wake up in the morning 

2164
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:50,340
is like going to my phone and I stopped 
doing that.

2165
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,320
But it's just,
it's taking over,

2166
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:53,070
you know,
like look,

2167
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:56,670
just look around you like take one day 
and when you're,

2168
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,593
I walked to work in New York and I put 
my phone in my pocket and I just walk 

2169
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:04,350
around and observe other people.
Everyone is heads down in their phone.

2170
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:05,243
Oh yeah.
Like if we were like visiting as this 

2171
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:09,534
planet,
it just observing this species called 

2172
01:31:10,741 --> 01:31:12,240
human,
like you would say,

2173
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,103
oh,
they're being controlled by this little 

2174
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:17,100
thing that's telling them what to do.
It looks like we're being controlled.

2175
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,560
Well,
what's interesting is people say back in

2176
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:20,394
the day people didn't do that,
but there's a photograph of the subway 

2177
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:26,850
from like 1960 or something like that.

2178
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,000
The reading papers,
all of them,

2179
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,480
every fucking person is in their reading
a newspaper.

2180
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:33,750
I think Peter,
at least it was one tab,

2181
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,640
you know,
he was like,

2182
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,240
it's like one page,
like these people.

2183
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,690
Right.
But like they're not,

2184
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:43,350
there's no tab browsing there but not 
jumping around reading the paper.

2185
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:44,550
All of them,
man.

2186
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,940
They're not looking at each other.
That's fair.

2187
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,330
This,
this idea that we used to be amazing and

2188
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:53,760
we used to be gregarious and want to 
turn off tad browsing.

2189
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,390
It's,
it's,

2190
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:57,840
that's what's killing me.
Tabbed browsing on your phone just on,

2191
01:31:57,841 --> 01:31:58,674
on your desktop computer.
And I always say while leave that tab 

2192
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:02,134
open,
cause I'm definitely gonna need to get 

2193
01:32:02,591 --> 01:32:04,060
the APP tabs that have been open for 
months.

2194
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,193
How about this?
Have you ever gone back to your email 

2195
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:11,030
tab and like there's an email that 
you're supposed to hit send all yeah,

2196
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:16,070
like eight hours ago you're like,
oh fuck yeah.

2197
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,403
Yeah.
Well you know it's definitely not 

2198
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:20,890
perfect but I'm,
I dunno,

2199
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,770
I'm a big fan of technology.
I just,

2200
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,710
I'm also a fan of self discipline.
I think you need,

2201
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:31,570
you need your own sort of boundaries 
that you won't cross.

2202
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:31,980
Right.
Like,

2203
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,810
you know,
x amount of time per day,

2204
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,390
you know,
or six o'clock at night,

2205
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:38,890
I put everything away.
We're done.

2206
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,840
That's it.
If you need to get ahold of me,

2207
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:42,070
call me.
You know,

2208
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,220
nobody fucking calls me on my phone.
I shouldn't even have a home phone.

2209
01:32:45,221 --> 01:32:47,440
It's fucking useless.
Never answered that God damn thing.

2210
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:49,250
Yeah.
Somebody calls me exactly,

2211
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,950
exactly.
Why don't I have it?

2212
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,800
I was a little bit one.
One was a fire on the right.

2213
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:55,380
You just need to get ahold of you.
In fact,

2214
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:57,460
the neighborhood.
Um,

2215
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,250
but there's levels.
Like if someone,

2216
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,263
like I'll check my phone in the morning 
and I'll see text messages and I'll see 

2217
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:04,570
if anything's important.

2218
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,360
If someone I care about sends me a text 
message,

2219
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:08,860
then something might be important.
That's level one.

2220
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,410
Level two is I'll check my email.
That's like next level.

2221
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,980
Then level three is like,
I started going into social media,

2222
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:16,190
instagram,
instagram,

2223
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,810
facebook and twitter and you know,
that's,

2224
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,140
and then there's level four.
I started googling shit and checking out

2225
01:33:23,141 --> 01:33:25,220
forums and reading information about 
stuff.

2226
01:33:25,221 --> 01:33:27,090
But that's then,
then you're going deeper and deeper into

2227
01:33:27,091 --> 01:33:28,760
it.
Then you're looking to be distracted,

2228
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,550
you know,
I'll go to dig,

2229
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,980
you know,
like get that for real man.

2230
01:33:32,981 --> 01:33:35,340
That's like one of my main sources have 
been for years.

2231
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,560
My main sources of wacky shit going on 
in the world.

2232
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,510
It's still got a lot of wacky shit on 
there.

2233
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,430
You are you involved in it at all 
anymore?

2234
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:43,503
I mean technically I'm kind of an 
advisor to the company and now that I'm 

2235
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:46,360
out in New York,
I,

2236
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,350
they're based out there.

2237
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,510
So I spend,
I see the team from time to time.

2238
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,340
Uh,
but he was just,

2239
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:54,250
man,
it was so many years of blood,

2240
01:33:54,251 --> 01:33:55,990
sweat and tears that I kind of got burnt
out.

2241
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,940
I was like,
I can't look at any more cat videos,

2242
01:33:58,350 --> 01:33:59,183
check out the window.
It's just a great resource for someone 

2243
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,350
who's just curious.
Yeah.

2244
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:07,830
Let's see what's interesting out there.
Ha ha ha.

2245
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:08,920
Oh,
okay.

2246
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:09,933
You know,
I'll look at it every day and I'll find 

2247
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:12,304
at least one thing everyday that a half 
to read like holy shit and I have to 

2248
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:16,324
click on it.
But it's interesting because I'll send 

2249
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,224
someone a dig link and there's a desire 
that people have a completely unfounded 

2250
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:28,420
desire to be over something.
You know,

2251
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:31,060
like my space,
my space is a good example.

2252
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,740
If you sent someone,
hey man,

2253
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:34,510
I want you to check out my thing.
It's on my space.

2254
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:37,810
I've always wanted to bring back my 
space or I want to get an AOL.

2255
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:38,644
If I was in charge of AOL I would make 
their emails so bad ass that no one 

2256
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:43,590
could deny it.
Like just go,

2257
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:44,773
just go crazy.
Do all the encryption shit that people 

2258
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:49,600
are talking about.
Do like unlimited space.

2259
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:52,680
Just like make it the most amazing bad 
ass email platforms.

2260
01:34:52,681 --> 01:34:53,514
So it's like the cool thing again.
So it's like g male plus like taking 

2261
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,720
everything from like email.

2262
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:00,860
Email's probably the best three email 
platform.

2263
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:03,290
Right?
How much better is it than Yahoo?

2264
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:05,510
Uh,
I mean Yahoo has ads in there.

2265
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:08,930
Stuff like visible big ass ads.
Those fucks.

2266
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,420
I know.
What about hotmail?

2267
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,293
It's still around.
How mill still around hot mill would be 

2268
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,514
another one.
You could probably turn into something 

2269
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:15,130
pretty bad ass.
Yeah.

2270
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,750
We'll get all the Microsoft prep out.
Other though they own hotmail,

2271
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:18,320
right?
Yeah.

2272
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,153
Mm.
They make you sign on with a Microsoft 

2273
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:23,630
account and all that weird stuff like 
prefers windows.

2274
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:24,493
Is there anyone that likes us?
They try apple and they try windows and 

2275
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:30,650
they go those windows things better.
There's a lot of people out there,

2276
01:35:30,651 --> 01:35:34,110
hardcore windows fans,
but are they really windows fan?

2277
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:35,920
Massive country,
right?

2278
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:38,090
Gamers.
The gamers still love windows.

2279
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:41,600
You can't run oculus on a Mac yet.
Well it's also,

2280
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,960
some people love all those options too.

2281
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:47,420
They'd love Oculus rift on a map down.
Oh No,

2282
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,070
not yet.
That's a game chiller.

2283
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,270
Yeah.
Change the game changer.

2284
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,490
The video cards aren't good enough.
They're saying whoa.

2285
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:54,200
Really interesting.
Yeah.

2286
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,720
Hmm.
Yeah.

2287
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:00,440
Well,
when you play video games on a Mac,

2288
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:03,280
do they have native versions of a,
what?

2289
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:04,910
Do you have to switch over?
Do you know?

2290
01:36:04,911 --> 01:36:05,960
Like there's that,
what does that,

2291
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:07,910
um,
application that you can switch back and

2292
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,300
forth between windows and Mac?
Yeah.

2293
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:12,020
They had like the boot camp,
they called it where you could boot into

2294
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:13,040
the,
that's still around.

2295
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,620
Yeah.
The good news is that it's,

2296
01:36:14,621 --> 01:36:18,440
it's all a intel hardware so you can 
boot into windows if you want to,

2297
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:21,140
but it's still like the,
the graphics cards are a few generations

2298
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:22,730
behind.
That's a weird,

2299
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,980
yeah.
It's just like apple doesn't care.

2300
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:28,120
They don't have really anyone doing 
super high end gaming on their rigs,

2301
01:36:28,121 --> 01:36:29,570
so they don't,
that's not their,

2302
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,493
their game anymore.

2303
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:33,470
Well you remember when Steve Jobs came 
back and they killed the clones?

2304
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:35,660
Yeah.
That's when it was kind of weird because

2305
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:39,800
before then,
like you could buy a Mac online.

2306
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:41,840
That was way more powerful than anything
out.

2307
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,630
Apple was selling way more hard drive 
space.

2308
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,800
Sli video cards.
They do an sli video.

2309
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:48,723
He's already done us a lie now that was,
this was before then they had souped up 

2310
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,290
like,
uh,

2311
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,390
processors though and like much more 
power.

2312
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,760
Much more storage space.
And then,

2313
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,470
you know,
apple,

2314
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:00,680
it's like,
fuck you.

2315
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,120
Yeah,
but you can't,

2316
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:06,500
you still can't run Mac os on a PC.
It's,

2317
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:07,620
it has,
it has to have this,

2318
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,370
it's own rom like a special apple.
Right.

2319
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,650
But I know people who've done it.
There's hacks around it,

2320
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:14,020
but it never works,
doesn't it?

2321
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:14,710
Never.
Percent,

2322
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:15,543
uh,
people are going to go crazy anytime 

2323
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:17,234
there's like a software update,
they just like patch it so you're not 

2324
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:19,550
always running the latest.

2325
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:22,250
Uh,
he was always a war like that.

2326
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,301
It's,
it's,

2327
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:25,870
it's really interesting.
It's really,

2328
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:26,713
really interesting the,
the dual platform thing because it kind 

2329
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:32,810
of becomes a tribe thing.
You know,

2330
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,680
like people get addicted to rooting for 
one particular sprites team.

2331
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,543
You know,
like I've been with the cubs since the 

2332
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:39,950
beginning getting on know we went to 
clubs to the end.

2333
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,870
Yeah.
You know,

2334
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,130
go cubs.
They get that way with windows.

2335
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:44,690
They can take it the way the websites 
and everything.

2336
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:46,260
Like you were saying with my space and 
all those others,

2337
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,790
the same thing with dig.
People were like pissed off at dig for a

2338
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:50,240
while.
It changed.

2339
01:37:50,241 --> 01:37:51,890
It's a look.
Yeah.

2340
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:54,410
And when it changes its look,
I got all these people are fucked,

2341
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:55,220
dude.
What are they doing?

2342
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,053
I'm like,
well when you're just looking to say 

2343
01:37:56,521 --> 01:37:58,170
fuck you,
that's what you're looking to do.

2344
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,820
It's like you look in to be over 
something.

2345
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:04,260
It's not like this is not a rational 
disagreement or a grievance you have.

2346
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,520
Yeah,
there was a lot of,

2347
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:07,440
I mean there's a couple things.
One,

2348
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:08,400
it's,
we've,

2349
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,870
one thing we learned is that people,
uh,

2350
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,310
they love when they get into something 
and really into it,

2351
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:16,890
they're hesitant to change.
Like anything that you change,

2352
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,410
you move an icon or change a color or do
any of that stuff.

2353
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:20,543
I think it's part of the reason probably
why read it hasn't made a whole lot of 

2354
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:25,980
big over arching changes to their 
product.

2355
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:26,814
It kind of feels the same.
It looks the same functions the same is 

2356
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:31,520
because people fell in love with that,
you know?

2357
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,453
And it's a hard thing to do.
You make any changes there and you have 

2358
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:35,190
a revolt on your hands,
you know?

2359
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,473
So for us it was difficult because we 
had taken a lot of investor funding and 

2360
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:42,930
they wanted us to go very mainstream.

2361
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,101
You know,
there was like,

2362
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:45,630
there was always like,
well,

2363
01:38:45,631 --> 01:38:48,990
how can we get your mom reading,
dig or whatever it may be.

2364
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,310
And I think that,
you know,

2365
01:38:50,311 --> 01:38:51,660
in retrospect,
that was the,

2366
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,210
that was the wrong approach apps because
we were,

2367
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,073
we should have been a loyal to our core 
audience and kind of been all about 

2368
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:00,690
that,
which the site is today.

2369
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:02,950
It's a lot more like it was back then.
I mean the,

2370
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,760
granted the design has changed,
but um,

2371
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:09,760
I think the content is more like that.
And the mistake that we made is we tried

2372
01:39:09,761 --> 01:39:10,594
to push into more kind of mainstream 
news when really what date may dig so 

2373
01:39:14,671 --> 01:39:17,490
special is that was able to unearth and 
find the really kind of unique,

2374
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:20,310
obscure random stuff from around the 
web.

2375
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:22,470
Right.
So that was a,

2376
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,780
but it was a crazy ride.
I mean we were,

2377
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:28,170
gosh,
it was probably seven or so years that,

2378
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:31,260
um,
we were kind of riding that wave,

2379
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,390
you know,
and like all Internet properties,

2380
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:36,030
it's like if you can last five years,
it's amazing.

2381
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,620
If you can last seven,
that's unbelievable.

2382
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:39,780
And if you can last 10 that's like 
almost unheard of.

2383
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,230
I go to it every day.
So to me nothing's changed.

2384
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,770
That's how I,
that popularity,

2385
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,470
there's hasn't dropped off at all.
I met,

2386
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,830
I met with the,
uh,

2387
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,683
the John Borthwick,
a heads up Beta works and he was saying 

2388
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:54,201
it's something like a total of 42 
million across all platform a month.

2389
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,063
Dig still receives.
That's across mobile and desktop and 

2390
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:02,940
everything else that they do.
That's still a man,

2391
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,890
which is crazy.
It's a lot of fucking people,

2392
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:06,300
man.
It's nuts.

2393
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,253
It's just an,
I love when someone can just collect 

2394
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:11,880
things for you.
There's some aggregates.

2395
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:13,410
All those interesting,
weird,

2396
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:15,390
bizarre shit.
It's a one stop shop.

2397
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:17,490
This is kind of always going to be in 
market for that.

2398
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:19,680
That's kind of my,
what I'm doing now with my newsletter.

2399
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,460
I don't know if you saw that.

2400
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,220
I launched a new newsletter.
Yeah,

2401
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,063
launch a newsletter here just a few 
weeks ago and I only put it out once a 

2402
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:27,180
month.
Like I hate,

2403
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,500
I hate that.
You know,

2404
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:31,800
when I was in television on techtv and 
some of the other stuff that we did,

2405
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,680
it was always about producing new 
content every single day.

2406
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:37,410
And you can never really put the best 
stuff out there.

2407
01:40:37,411 --> 01:40:39,270
You're always in a rush to produce your 
segment.

2408
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:39,691
You're like,
okay,

2409
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:40,680
what am I going to do today?
Blah,

2410
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:41,300
blah,
blah.

2411
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,133
And,
and so I create a newsletter that is 

2412
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:45,230
basically just,
um,

2413
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,690
my favorite stories,
videos,

2414
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:49,943
products,
but things that are fully vetted that 

2415
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:53,500
has spent a lot of time collecting.
And I just,

2416
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:55,540
I released it once a month on the first 
of every month.

2417
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,673
Oh,
that's great.

2418
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,780
The fully vetted things great.
Because God,

2419
01:40:58,781 --> 01:41:01,090
there's so many,
well first of all,

2420
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,043
how many stories do you get that are 
completely contradicting something that 

2421
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:06,880
was a story just a week ago.

2422
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,870
Exactly.
And you're like,

2423
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:08,800
well,
who the fuck is right?

2424
01:41:08,801 --> 01:41:10,520
Well now you've got to make me do 
research right now.

2425
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,363
I got to snopes this and figure this out
and try to figure out who's team Amman 

2426
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:17,230
and which articles seems most rational.
And if then,

2427
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:18,064
if you can't do that,
then you have to go into scientific 

2428
01:41:19,151 --> 01:41:19,984
papers and I'll fucking Christ.
Then you have to contact people and 

2429
01:41:22,091 --> 01:41:22,924
search forums and see what the people 
that are actually studying this shit 

2430
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:28,510
think.
And it's nice if someone vents it out in

2431
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:29,740
advance.
Yeah.

2432
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,180
So if I,
if I put a product on there,

2433
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:34,270
it has to be something that like a 
technology product that I've used for at

2434
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:35,860
least a month.
So I can tell you,

2435
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,510
you know,
there's a lot of that kind of like I get

2436
01:41:37,511 --> 01:41:38,344
hyped up on something for a few days and
it actually ends up sucking and you've 

2437
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:42,010
already plugged it in your life to give 
me an example of that.

2438
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,843
Like what?
I don't know it just like any new 

2439
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:45,040
product that comes out,
like,

2440
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:47,590
um,
when the echo first came out,

2441
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,740
the Amazon Echo,
it's like I,

2442
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,240
I think it got better with a few 
software updates.

2443
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:56,290
So I'm glad I didn't plug it initially 
cause I kinda thought it sucked but it,

2444
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,660
but it's a lot better now,
but it took some time to get there.

2445
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,360
Um,
I just want to make sure that if I'm,

2446
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,613
I feel like our time is really precious,
all of our time is really precious and 

2447
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,400
if you push someone to go read something
or to buy something,

2448
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,260
it should be worth their time.
And,

2449
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:13,570
and so I want to put a lot of effort 
into that,

2450
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:14,440
so,
well,

2451
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,090
that's a great way to approach it for 
sure.

2452
01:42:16,091 --> 01:42:16,924
And if someone's going to really get 
committed to paying attention to you on 

2453
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:21,850
a regular basis,
on a monthly basis,

2454
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:23,350
it's probably the best way to do it.

2455
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:23,931
Yeah,
sure.

2456
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:25,870
That you're filtering it out before it 
gets to them.

2457
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,531
Yeah.
Yeah.

2458
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:27,071
So,
uh,

2459
01:42:27,071 --> 01:42:29,890
it's called the journal.
You can set up@thejournal.email.

2460
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,900
There's that email domain extensions 
down.

2461
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:32,561
Really?
Yeah.

2462
01:42:32,561 --> 01:42:34,660
It's a email list.
Yeah.

2463
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,500
It's just an email is to put an email 
address to send one a month and um,

2464
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:39,683
and you can use it for anything.
You can use a domain for it or whatever 

2465
01:42:40,991 --> 01:42:42,430
you want.
But they came out with a dot.

2466
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:43,660
Email,
domain extension.

2467
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:45,071
Um,
but yeah,

2468
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:46,120
weird extension.
What does it,

2469
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,590
cause usually they're from countries,
right?

2470
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:48,311
Why?
Yeah,

2471
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:49,144
it's normally from countries,
but now they're opening up to 

2472
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:51,850
everything.
There's like.wine.

2473
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:54,520
Now there's dots like you know they 
have.porn

2474
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:56,410
yet there's dot x x,
x.

2475
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,341
Oh,
okay.

2476
01:42:57,341 --> 01:42:58,174
And that's all porn.
So expensive tography for my website 

2477
01:43:00,861 --> 01:43:01,694
there.
Who Do?

2478
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,321
Ooh,
look at,

2479
01:43:02,321 --> 01:43:03,250
you can gene me.
Dot.

2480
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:05,500
Photography.
Um,

2481
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:08,050
what is something that's really got you 
hyped up?

2482
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:10,660
Uh,
the Arrow wifi system.

2483
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,650
E.
R.

2484
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,483
O.
What does that,

2485
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,480
ah,
it's crazy.

2486
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:14,343
So you know how there's always been,
we've had wifi units that it's like one 

2487
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:19,114
base station to rule them all.
Like you have one base station and they 

2488
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:23,890
look,
they get crazier every year.

2489
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:24,724
They have get more antennas on them.
And this idea of one master base 

2490
01:43:28,121 --> 01:43:29,890
station,
that blankets here entire house.

2491
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,033
It's,
it's great if you have a small 

2492
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:33,454
apartment.
If you have a house or two bedroom or 

2493
01:43:34,571 --> 01:43:35,404
three bedroom,
it's next to impossible to get like 

2494
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:40,360
streaming video down at bedroom number 
three down the hall.

2495
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,860
So arrows like,
okay,

2496
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:42,694
screw it.
We're not going to make one master 

2497
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:44,674
massive base station.
We're going to make these little tiny 

2498
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,433
like hockey puck style little stations 
and you get three of them in a pack and 

2499
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:52,214
then you just plugged them in and around
the house and they work off a mesh 

2500
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:56,900
network.

2501
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,210
So they all mesh with each other.
They're not extenders.

2502
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,270
They're like using their own dedicated 
little wireless signals to do Mesh.

2503
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:04,490
Almost like the way a Sonos would 
operate in your house.

2504
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,753
Um,
and then you just have universal 

2505
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:07,754
blanket,
a high speed coverage and so it doesn't 

2506
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:11,840
vary no matter where you walk.
Amazing.

2507
01:44:11,841 --> 01:44:14,390
In New York,
I was having issues like trying cause my

2508
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:17,450
Wifi or my um,
cable modem was all the way on the other

2509
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:21,410
end of the house and I have a long 
hallway kind of going between the dining

2510
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:23,830
room,
the front room and um,

2511
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:26,150
I plucked three of men all going down 
the hallway.

2512
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:28,190
And normally with these boosters or 
anything else,

2513
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:30,050
they just kind of like,
they kind of suck.

2514
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:31,130
They just didn't ever work.
Right.

2515
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:32,390
Yeah.
And this one just,

2516
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,880
I mean set up on your iphone,
how do you spell it?

2517
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,920
E R O.
Dot Com.

2518
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:37,880
Yeah,
there they are right there.

2519
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:40,050
There's a three units,
um,

2520
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,180
uh,
on the screen there.

2521
01:44:41,181 --> 01:44:42,070
But yeah,
they're,

2522
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:45,080
they're pretty amazing and it's a,
it's a new technology.

2523
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,120
One of their investors was telling me 
about it.

2524
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:48,203
Um,
I bought them on Amazon and this is 

2525
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:50,984
something that I just mentioned to my 
newsletter because I had some time to 

2526
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:53,640
spend with it.
And,

2527
01:44:53,641 --> 01:44:56,150
and that actually really I,
if you have wife,

2528
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,490
if your wife works great at home,
don't mess with it.

2529
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:00,200
It's not worth it.
But if you're having issues,

2530
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,160
this,
this works,

2531
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:02,023
why does it have a phone there?
They have an APP that we're set up is 

2532
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:05,384
just what the phone,
they don't even make you use a desktop 

2533
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:10,480
to set it up at all.
So just plug it into your,

2534
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:12,510
whatever you use.
Like a,

2535
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:15,380
some sort of a,
a cable that connects into your router.

2536
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,243
Yeah.
You just plug it right in your router 

2537
01:45:16,611 --> 01:45:18,800
with the first base station and then you
go and take the other ones.

2538
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:21,140
I'm just them around your house.
Yeah,

2539
01:45:21,141 --> 01:45:23,880
it's great.
And how does it work with uh,

2540
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,630
the Apple Wifi system?
I just got rid of the apple.

2541
01:45:26,631 --> 01:45:29,270
I unplugged it all together and just use
only that and that's only use this.

2542
01:45:29,271 --> 01:45:31,410
Yeah.
Interesting.

2543
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,950
Ooh,
I like it better,

2544
01:45:33,951 --> 01:45:34,701
Huh?
Yeah,

2545
01:45:34,701 --> 01:45:37,170
it's been getting great reviews.
Um,

2546
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:38,600
you know,
again,

2547
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,520
but it's,
if your Wifi is working fine,

2548
01:45:40,521 --> 01:45:41,730
don't mess with it.
Like that's,

2549
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:43,310
but mine,
I've,

2550
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:44,144
I've had,
I must've like pissed off some kind of 

2551
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:46,100
Wifi.
God,

2552
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,020
in a previous life,
I've never had good wifi.

2553
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:50,720
Some issues.
I think everybody does.

2554
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,033
The wifi is,
we're two hours a wondered what's going 

2555
01:45:53,841 --> 01:45:54,674
on with those signals.
Just fucking flying around your house 

2556
01:45:56,271 --> 01:45:57,060
too,
right?

2557
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:58,250
It's like,
is that good?

2558
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:00,740
I think you're fine.
I think you're fine too,

2559
01:46:00,741 --> 01:46:01,574
but I don't know.
It's like that same thing you were 

2560
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:03,554
saying about there could possibly be 
senses that we don't necessarily have 

2561
01:46:06,531 --> 01:46:07,364
like that we could measure and weigh,
but there's a feeling that you get when 

2562
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:11,324
you're like at the top of a mountain.
If you go hiking and there's no wifi 

2563
01:46:13,161 --> 01:46:14,750
signal,
it just feels cleaner.

2564
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,520
But it also could be the amazing fresh 
air could be,

2565
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:18,410
right?
Yeah.

2566
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:21,410
Or maybe we can do some dmt at home and 
start reading people's email.

2567
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,353
Let's just like by intersecting nursing.
Do you think there's gonna come a point 

2568
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:29,210
in time where there is no longer any 
privacy,

2569
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,550
any privacy at all?
I don't think so.

2570
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,300
I think privacy is a hot topic right now
and people are,

2571
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:36,260
are really starting to get into it for 
the first time.

2572
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,100
Right.

2573
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,840
So they definitely were concerned when 
you hear about the NSA thing,

2574
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:45,950
the Edward Snowden thing,
and you find out that it's really pretty

2575
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:48,620
easy to access your information and you 
know,

2576
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:50,930
people worry about being hacked,
right?

2577
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:52,330
Being fished,
you know,

2578
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:55,350
someone sends you an email and people 
were worried about privacy.

2579
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:56,184
But my concern is that it seems like 
what what's going on with technology in 

2580
01:46:59,941 --> 01:47:02,610
general is,
especially when it comes to the Internet

2581
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:06,780
and anything information based is your 
access to information is getting quicker

2582
01:47:06,781 --> 01:47:07,614
and quicker.
Right?

2583
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:08,453
It's like you have more access to more 
data and more access to each other and 

2584
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,133
each other's data and eventually that 
means that keeps going and keeps going 

2585
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:18,570
and keeps going.
There's gonna come a point in time where

2586
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:20,250
we're just fucking reading each other's 
minds.

2587
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,470
Right.
And when that happens,

2588
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:25,530
it's really not going to be a lot of 
privacy if at all.

2589
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,330
Yeah,
I think that there is,

2590
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,193
there's certainly people trying to push 
the envelope there and there has been 

2591
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:34,200
over the last few years and in startups 
that I've seen like a,

2592
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:37,030
there was a startup that at one point,
um,

2593
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,883
you would often all of your credit cards
and it would share out socially the 

2594
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:41,694
stuff that you were buying with friends.
And so basically if you went on there 

2595
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:46,920
and bought a,
a blood,

2596
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:49,440
a sensor on Amazon,
I would see that.

2597
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,453
And then I could then use that as a 
cover more or less an endorsement from 

2598
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:56,640
you and go buy something similar.
It blew up and it went out of business,

2599
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:59,010
but they were kind of pushing that.
But there has to be a trade off,

2600
01:47:59,011 --> 01:48:00,930
especially when it comes to free 
services.

2601
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,153
Like you can't expect to be a private 
person if you're getting something for 

2602
01:48:04,321 --> 01:48:05,540
free.
You know,

2603
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:09,240
like if you're getting g mail,
they are reading your emails and they're

2604
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:10,350
putting ads against it.

2605
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,273
Now it's not a human reading them,
but their machines are reading them and 

2606
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:14,964
placing relevant ads and it's not spooky
moment when you were looking something 

2607
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:20,490
online and then you go and look to the 
corner of your,

2608
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,280
your website page and it's that exact 
ad.

2609
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,300
Right?
But that's fine.

2610
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,193
I'm fine with that because it's free.
I don't have to go drive down to the 

2611
01:48:29,251 --> 01:48:32,280
library and look up a book and trying to
figure out what I was trying,

2612
01:48:32,281 --> 01:48:34,080
you know,
Google is providing that service and I'm

2613
01:48:34,081 --> 01:48:35,220
like,
thank you very much.

2614
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:39,540
Google and I will gladly take your ad.
And if you're looking for like a pair of

2615
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:42,030
shoes and you went and researched a pair
of shoes,

2616
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:44,790
then all sudden that pair of shoes is 
staring at you on the website.

2617
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,160
It's creepy,
but I get it.

2618
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:49,260
It's terrible.
It's not terrible.

2619
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,143
Yeah,
because it's something that you already 

2620
01:48:51,241 --> 01:48:53,100
expressed intent towards.

2621
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,410
You're like,
I want that mct oil.

2622
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,330
Right.
And now it's there again,

2623
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:59,980
it's not like sexual deviants shit.
Right.

2624
01:48:59,981 --> 01:49:02,280
You know,
sometimes it could be a is it depends on

2625
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:04,470
the targeting.
But if they do that though it,

2626
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:06,270
Google doesn't allow that now.
Yeah,

2627
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:07,590
that would be rough.
Yeah.

2628
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,260
Try explaining that.
Yeah.

2629
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:13,650
That's a cause for bitten by the terms 
of service.

2630
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:14,713
Must be,
which it's funny because that's where 

2631
01:49:15,961 --> 01:49:18,270
people draw the line.
It was like sexual pleasure,

2632
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:20,640
like sexual pleasure and sexual 
fantasies.

2633
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:22,080
That's where we draw the line.
Right.

2634
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:24,810
But what you can talk about openly and 
have,

2635
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:25,823
you know,
I mean you could have a shoe fetish and 

2636
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:27,834
you'd be like really into shoes.
Have you ever met anyone that openly 

2637
01:49:29,971 --> 01:49:32,110
says they have a shoe fetish?
I don't think that that's a,

2638
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,280
that's a,
um,

2639
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,133
you can tell him.
He might not say it's a welfare sexual 

2640
01:49:35,881 --> 01:49:36,714
fetish.
No,

2641
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:40,140
but all those fucking Weirdos that are 
connect collect sneakers.

2642
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:41,700
You know who you are.
Right.

2643
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:45,390
All those years thinking the Nike 
sneaker collectors are also,

2644
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:47,160
Jamie's one of them looking them over 
there smiling.

2645
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,040
He buys

2646
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,840
those Kanye West sneakers.
Really?

2647
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:53,170
Him,
he wants to try to find him,

2648
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:54,340
can't get 'em.
They're sold out.

2649
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:56,800
The question is like how get them any,
how bad do you want them?

2650
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:00,130
Is it like a,
I like to have them or like I will,

2651
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,440
I don't know anything.
My friend Brendan,

2652
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,303
he buys pairs and then he won't wear 
them until he knows he's got to do 

2653
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:06,694
something important.
And then you put on a special pair of 

2654
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:09,280
Jordans.
I'm like,

2655
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:12,910
you all have that though.
I used to collect old microprocessors.

2656
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:14,620
Really?
What'd you do?

2657
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:17,380
And you actually I have a sealed copy of
windows 1.0

2658
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:20,440
wow.
In the computer history museum.

2659
01:50:20,441 --> 01:50:23,020
Says my name underneath it in San 
Francisco outside of San Francisco.

2660
01:50:23,021 --> 01:50:25,390
Outside of mountain view.
Well that's actually pretty cool though.

2661
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,313
That's history.
That's like an ancient leather bound 

2662
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:32,200
book that Ben Franklin Rhoda and I 
thought it was kind of cool.

2663
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,400
It's pretty cool.
Yeah.

2664
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:36,400
I've got an old windows nt that's still 
in the box in my house.

2665
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:39,480
3.1141
probably.

2666
01:50:39,490 --> 01:50:41,050
I don't know what the a,
the number is,

2667
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:45,220
but it was around windows m e cause I 
remember uh,

2668
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:48,820
as making game computers and I didn't 
like windows emmy.

2669
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:49,793
Ah,
it's the worst.

2670
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:51,160
Yeah it was.
It was sucky.

2671
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:52,390
And so,
uh,

2672
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,253
I had some friends that went with nt but
the problem was you would have issues 

2673
01:50:57,461 --> 01:50:58,294
with certain drivers for video cards and
you have to be like really hip on the 

2674
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:06,811
forums and make sure you get on a irt 
and Erc and find out where the uh,

2675
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:12,400
the best drivers are and how to Super 
Geeky days.

2676
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,473
Yeah.
There was like certain resolutions you 

2677
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:14,974
couldn't run things out was everything 
that he had to file a format with the 

2678
01:51:17,231 --> 01:51:21,630
NTSF file system.
Remember that IRC was always weird to so

2679
01:51:21,631 --> 01:51:23,590
strange cause you could send files to 
each other.

2680
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:24,873
It's like IRC.
Such a strange message sort of 

2681
01:51:28,421 --> 01:51:31,780
distribution.
The original hashtags where an IRC,

2682
01:51:31,781 --> 01:51:34,290
do you remember that?
You could do like pound a channel?

2683
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:36,190
I can eat anything.
That's right.

2684
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,473
This is all from my quake playing days.
So that was how clans would communicate 

2685
01:51:40,571 --> 01:51:41,404
with each other.
Yeah.

2686
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,180
The quake teams would call each other 
clans.

2687
01:51:43,181 --> 01:51:44,014
First People look,
you were in the club now the clan like 

2688
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,430
tribe,
like you know,

2689
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:49,533
team that competes,
realize that they did call it cleanse 

2690
01:51:51,551 --> 01:51:52,151
back then.
Yeah.

2691
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:53,320
The comb quake clans.
Yeah.

2692
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:54,420
It's so crazy.
Yeah.

2693
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,950
You make that connection.
I was in a clan to yeah,

2694
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:57,930
well I was in a car.
Crazy.

2695
01:51:58,010 --> 01:51:58,950
They called it that.
Yeah.

2696
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:59,860
The,
you know,

2697
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,780
um,
and we would go to these,

2698
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,660
uh,
IRC channels and we'd have like a window

2699
01:52:04,661 --> 01:52:05,494
open,
like a lot of guys would run two 

2700
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:07,414
screens.

2701
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,313
So you'd run a one screen where your 
video games playing and then you'd have 

2702
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:14,830
another screen next to that separate,
which was your IRC channel.

2703
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:15,693
Right.
And so you'd be communicating with each 

2704
01:52:16,721 --> 01:52:19,750
other and you had Iq,
remember the instant messenger?

2705
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:21,050
Yeah.
Well Icq,

2706
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:22,900
I see the little flower.
The green flag.

2707
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,010
Yeah.
That was awesome.

2708
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,203
And so you could send each other a 
little icq messages while the mass was 

2709
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:29,860
going on.
Super Geeky.

2710
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:31,630
Dude.
This is Geeky as it gets.

2711
01:52:31,631 --> 01:52:33,850
I mean,
this was like nineties yeah.

2712
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:36,400
Right.
So like this is stay at this.

2713
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,533
This is how deep I was into it.
I lived in the mountains like kind of 

2714
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:40,653
high up in the hills of the Santa Monica
Mountains and I couldn't get good 

2715
01:52:43,571 --> 01:52:46,670
Internet access the best I could get 
with isd n right.

2716
01:52:46,671 --> 01:52:49,130
Couldn't get um,
cable.

2717
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,680
Couldn't get cable modem out there.
It's fucking terrible.

2718
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,250
The pings were awful to everywhere.
So I had a t one line installed.

2719
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:56,900
Oh,
you must've been rich.

2720
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,000
I was rich.
It does.

2721
01:52:58,001 --> 01:52:59,770
Very expensive with deep.
Yeah.

2722
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,060
But it was worth it to me.
It's a 1.44

2723
01:53:02,061 --> 01:53:03,780
megabit line.
Yeah.

2724
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:07,040
It was worth 10 grand a month.
It was worth it.

2725
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:12,420
That's,
did you really buy a t one line pass?

2726
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,600
I had installed in my house.
How did you get the,

2727
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:15,940
how could you he was on TV.
Oh,

2728
01:53:15,941 --> 01:53:17,510
you're doing TV stuff?
I was on TV.

2729
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:19,280
Wow.
So it was like,

2730
01:53:19,281 --> 01:53:20,114
look,
I could a TV money blows money on coke 

2731
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:26,360
and hookers or a t one line stall t one 
line in my house.

2732
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,700
The people at the whatever the fucking 
company I called this do it 18 to year,

2733
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:32,990
whoever did it,
they were like,

2734
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:36,920
what did they have to lay like fiber to 
get to your head to do it to this place,

2735
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,240
to this place.

2736
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,580
We had dog shit Internet.
When we first moved into this place,

2737
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:43,490
they had a chew up the fucking sidewalk 
out front because I was like,

2738
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:44,324
this is not going to happen.
It was way more expensive to put it in 

2739
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,420
here.
This was a drag.

2740
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:48,151
It's like,
what did it say?

2741
01:53:48,151 --> 01:53:52,020
Four months.
More than four months to get like real,

2742
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,440
but we have a hundred and a hundred 
down.

2743
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,730
Wow.
Dedicated on.

2744
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:56,660
It's fat.
It's a,

2745
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:59,630
it's an awesome pipe.
But when we first moved here,

2746
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:02,750
we had DSL.
It was dog shit and it's just,

2747
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:06,410
there's certain things that you just 
can't fuck around with.

2748
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:08,540
You know,
Internet is definitely one of them.

2749
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,433
And when you're addicted,
completely dictated eight to 10 hours a 

2750
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:13,580
day playing quake and you go,
oh,

2751
01:54:13,581 --> 01:54:15,770
there's a solution there.
What is the solution?

2752
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,450
It's a t one line.
Let's do that.

2753
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:18,643
You know,
a lot of people got Trent reznor was 

2754
01:54:19,911 --> 01:54:21,620
addicted to that for a long time.
Quick.

2755
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,573
Yeah.

2756
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:26,870
Well it's amazing.
It's,

2757
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:30,890
and I can't even fuck with it today.
I just don't have any time.

2758
01:54:30,891 --> 01:54:33,260
I have children.
I have too many different jobs.

2759
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:35,330
I just can't go near it.
I can't.

2760
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:39,650
Yeah.
But I'm sure that if I just fucking blew

2761
01:54:39,651 --> 01:54:44,270
a fuse one night and uh,
drank too many jolt cola us and sat down

2762
01:54:44,271 --> 01:54:47,630
in front of my computer and decided to 
go online and place of death matches,

2763
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,464
I would get right back in.
And just like a dude who has an rubber 

2764
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:55,970
band off his arm and shot that heroin is
for awhile I'd get right back into it.

2765
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:57,190
Man.
Don't do it.

2766
01:54:57,191 --> 01:54:58,340
It's slippery slope.
I won't,

2767
01:54:58,341 --> 01:54:59,270
I won't.
I refuse.

2768
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:03,110
But the new games,
the graphics are so fucking incredible.

2769
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:03,944
It's almost worth it.
What is this doing multiplayer trailer 

2770
01:55:05,751 --> 01:55:08,030
that just popped out?
Whoa.

2771
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:11,780
Oh my God.
Look at this fast running around.

2772
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,613
So people are complaining about how the 
play is company cause it's that old 

2773
01:55:14,691 --> 01:55:16,430
school the way doom used to.
Exactly.

2774
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:17,840
Well,
that's the way it's supposed to be.

2775
01:55:17,841 --> 01:55:19,310
Like what are they complaining about 
this?

2776
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,980
Because it will be fast and stuff like 
that.

2777
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:22,010
Oh,
cause they're pussies.

2778
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:23,780
They wanted,
yeah.

2779
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,870
They want the fucking people to move 
like real people.

2780
01:55:26,871 --> 01:55:29,480
That's retarded.
Oh yeah.

2781
01:55:29,481 --> 01:55:30,314
Look at this.
You turn into a monster and start 

2782
01:55:31,161 --> 01:55:34,610
fucking people up when you owe this,
you bite people's heads off.

2783
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,440
When does this come out?
It's awesome.

2784
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,940
All right.
I just changed my opinion.

2785
01:55:37,941 --> 01:55:39,110
I'm in.
I'm back in.

2786
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:41,360
I'm going to keep making you use the 
controllers though.

2787
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:43,020
Like I'm the expert.
I can't either.

2788
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:45,040
Useless.
I need a mouse and a keyboard.

2789
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:46,830
That's the only way to do it.
Look at this guy.

2790
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:50,310
He's fighting the devil.
He just punted punching the devil in his

2791
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:50,820
fucking face.

2792
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,880
Now he has the devil power.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2793
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:56,040
This is amazing.
You have a c?

2794
01:55:56,041 --> 01:55:58,560
I'm not interested in grabbing people 
and ripping them apart.

2795
01:55:58,561 --> 01:56:01,380
I want to shoot him.
It looks dope though.

2796
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:05,430
Death match like one on one death 
matches with that will be pretty fucking

2797
01:56:05,431 --> 01:56:07,410
incredible.
He had the perfect setup here for a land

2798
01:56:07,411 --> 01:56:08,640
party.
Don't say it.

2799
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:10,470
Stop.
I'm just saying stop.

2800
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:15,090
We still land parties.
Back in the 1990s we used to all meet in

2801
01:56:15,091 --> 01:56:17,400
Houston.
Those were a bunch of my friends.

2802
01:56:17,401 --> 01:56:18,234
Where are we going to be seeing over the
link them all together and have zero 

2803
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:23,130
ping.
That's just the greatest thing ever.

2804
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:24,023
The most.
The most brutal thing we would do 

2805
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:26,700
though.
My friend Chad,

2806
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,780
he was,
uh,

2807
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:31,470
he had some sort of a tech job,
I forget what it was,

2808
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,603
but he had access to his company's board
room and we'd set up everything up in 

2809
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:39,000
this board room and these giant tables 
and shit.

2810
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,230
And then we would start a server and 
then other people would join it,

2811
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:45,210
but they had lag and we didn't have any 
lag.

2812
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:47,910
Just waste them.
So sweet.

2813
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:50,220
So it's just like,
you know,

2814
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,220
shooting chickens and a barrel.
Yeah,

2815
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:53,580
fish in a barrel or whatever it is.

2816
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,500
It's probably also equally easy.
Yeah.

2817
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:00,300
Yeah.
I mean it just,

2818
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,193
after a while,
but then the worst thing is like you 

2819
01:57:02,821 --> 01:57:03,654
would find someone who would kick your 
ass even though you know they had 50 

2820
01:57:06,181 --> 01:57:07,590
paying and zero,
you're like,

2821
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,580
oh,
well great.

2822
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:11,400
Who is the best player ever.
What was the mortal?

2823
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,320
Yes.
I had him,

2824
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:14,154
he was on the screen savers on techtv 
back in the day when I was on there and 

2825
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:18,360
I played against him.
Yeah,

2826
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:19,990
it's thrash,
thrash.

2827
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,630
Next level with immortal was as well.
There's a bunch of different guys.

2828
01:57:23,631 --> 01:57:24,464
Who's thresh?
There was fatality totalities the one 

2829
01:57:26,171 --> 01:57:28,050
that died.
He was really good.

2830
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,160
Yeah.
Jonathan Window,

2831
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:31,200
I think his name is.
I met that dude in Vegas.

2832
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:32,700
He's a great guy.
Super Nice Guy.

2833
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:33,151
Yeah.
He,

2834
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:36,390
I think he plays regular games now too,
but there was a kid before him,

2835
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,820
um,
uh,

2836
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,863
name that his nickname was thresh and he
sort of got out of the competitive game 

2837
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,653
thing and got into online websites like 
reviewing games and game websites and 

2838
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:51,030
the business of it.

2839
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:53,370
He's just started to stop playing and 
competing.

2840
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:55,010
But there's a bunch of those guys.
Yeah,

2841
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,300
I played a few of them online.
Just got to fucking,

2842
01:57:57,301 --> 01:57:58,180
just decimate.
Yeah.

2843
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,033
Fatality had his own motherboard.
I had his mouse that was like the 

2844
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:02,484
equivalent of like being like a signed 
by like a skateboarder and something 

2845
01:58:04,821 --> 01:58:06,180
like that.
There it is.

2846
01:58:06,181 --> 01:58:07,410
Yes.
A totality.

2847
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,000
There he is up in the upper left hand 
side.

2848
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:12,180
That would have been my dream back in 
the day to have my face on a motherboard

2849
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:14,700
box.
So good.

2850
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:15,573
I wonder what he's doing these days.
I wonder what he must be involved in 

2851
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:20,760
something.
It's what it says is twitch.

2852
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:22,080
He's got a channel.
Is that what it is?

2853
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:23,911
Yeah.
These guys,

2854
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:27,900
they play games on twitch and they make 
money playing games.

2855
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:29,910
People watching them.
It's a good life.

2856
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:30,863
Well,
some people have these channels where 

2857
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:35,940
they play on twitch and they have 
hundreds of thousands of people that are

2858
01:58:35,941 --> 01:58:38,970
following them and watching them and 
they're playing 40,000

2859
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:41,560
people might be watching them play a 
fucking game at the same like,

2860
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,260
I mean you've seen the stadiums in 
Korea.

2861
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,610
Yes.
That's nuts.

2862
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,750
The starcraft,
right?

2863
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:47,770
Yeah.
Starcraft,

2864
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:49,720
I think it is.
Fuck man.

2865
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:53,050
See that's not interesting to me though.
Starcraft is boring to me.

2866
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,270
I understand it,
but it's like chess.

2867
01:58:55,490 --> 01:58:57,490
I'm,
I'm sure it's fascinating to Pli.

2868
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,810
I love those games.
It was,

2869
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:00,550
that was my bread and butter right 
there,

2870
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:02,530
like command and conquer.
And those those.

2871
01:59:02,650 --> 01:59:05,110
But yeah,
it is like chess and it's too much about

2872
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:05,944
build order now.
It's like you have to really get your 

2873
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:09,940
build order down and just go really fast
up front.

2874
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,200
What's the build order?
What does that mean?

2875
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:12,310
It just means that like,
you know,

2876
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:15,550
you put your power plant first before 
your weapons plant,

2877
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:16,384
before your turret.
It's like you have to know your order 

2878
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:18,484
and once you build things and then you 
adjust that based on what the they're 

2879
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:21,814
bringing against you.
So if they're trying to rush you right 

2880
01:59:22,721 --> 01:59:23,401
away,
you want to get tour,

2881
01:59:23,401 --> 01:59:25,590
it's a first look at that.
Oh,

2882
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,230
that's the same as this weekend at the 
MLG tournament.

2883
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:31,900
That's where this is.
Oh my God.

2884
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:33,730
Oh my God.
This is like 15,000

2885
01:59:33,731 --> 01:59:35,490
people in dollar tournament.
I think my,

2886
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,400
no,
that's insane.

2887
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:37,723
All those dorks.
How many of those guys have ever gotten 

2888
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:42,130
lane five?
Raise your hand.

2889
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:51,100
It'd be fun just to go to one of those 
to go to one of them as a reporter,

2890
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,320
I would like to interview those guys.
I saw that the uh,

2891
01:59:53,321 --> 01:59:58,321
the rock was back in the ww wwe,
he was just back in,

2892
01:59:58,841 --> 02:00:00,820
it will wrestlemania like a few days 
ago.

2893
02:00:00,821 --> 02:00:05,050
I wanted to go do that would be fun.
If you've ever been to a wrestlemania.

2894
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:08,140
Oh No.
It's like a male soap opera.

2895
02:00:08,230 --> 02:00:12,040
You just go there and you drink beer and
you yell and then you leave.

2896
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:15,940
I mean,
you know,

2897
02:00:15,941 --> 02:00:17,860
just to experience it one time,
I'm not into it.

2898
02:00:17,861 --> 02:00:19,840
I don't know the characters.
I don't watch it ever.

2899
02:00:19,841 --> 02:00:23,230
But just to go and experience that kind 
of environment,

2900
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,540
it's not interesting to me,
but I get it.

2901
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:29,110
I get how it would be interesting,
but you got to think that like,

2902
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:30,710
I'm already,
Whoa,

2903
02:00:30,711 --> 02:00:31,000
what's that?

2904
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,600
How many people are there?
Yes.

2905
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,410
It was the record.
What?

2906
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:39,760
The hundred thousand wrestling,
fake wrestling.

2907
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:41,140
Fake it.
Fake wrestling.

2908
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:42,160
Oh,
100,000

2909
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:43,900
people.
Oh my God.

2910
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:44,883
You know,
that's the arena that the UFC has been 

2911
02:00:46,091 --> 02:00:50,440
hoping forever to do an event in,
but we would have to have some crazy,

2912
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:55,550
unbelievable card to fill that place up.
Oh my God.

2913
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:56,393
Can you believe that many people go and 
the tickets were 500 to 3000 that's 

2914
02:01:00,851 --> 02:01:03,970
incredible.
It's like basically like the super bowl,

2915
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,060
the amount of money they must've made 
from that fucking thing's insane.

2916
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,240
And it's all fake.
Yup.

2917
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:10,840
I mean,
not that they're not athletes.

2918
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:12,700
So there's those things are serious 
athletes,

2919
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:13,930
athletes,
acrobats.

2920
02:01:13,931 --> 02:01:15,520
I mean Cirque de Solei.
It's fake too.

2921
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:19,570
Yeah.
And that way it's not an unimpressive,

2922
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,490
it's very impressive.
Yeah.

2923
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:23,110
I just,
you know,

2924
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:26,890
thought of the slaves fake,
but I,

2925
02:01:26,891 --> 02:01:29,320
you know,
I do commentary for mma.

2926
02:01:29,321 --> 02:01:30,154
So for me that the reality of MMA is so 
intense and so it's so powerful that 

2927
02:01:36,701 --> 02:01:37,980
like,
I can't,

2928
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:39,650
I just,
I've seen much.

2929
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,160
Yeah,

2930
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,340
that's fair.
It's like a phase one guy going down.

2931
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:44,900
I'm like,
I can't,

2932
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:46,340
like,
I'm more going for the,

2933
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:47,203
I'm not actually like into watching dad 
as much as it would be just the 

2934
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:51,650
environment in general.
I guess.

2935
02:01:51,651 --> 02:01:55,100
I go into a monster truck rally.
I'd love to do that as well.

2936
02:01:55,130 --> 02:02:00,100
I don't want to do that either.
Definitely not hanging after the show.

2937
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:02,343
People good to cry all together.
We can make you cry over that fist bump 

2938
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:07,500
and fucking go our separate ways.
Empty and talk shadow.

2939
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,353
In other words,
we're getting a separate cars and even 

2940
02:02:09,951 --> 02:02:13,050
like rustling,
he said fucking cry.

2941
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:14,840
Those fake.
Yeah.

2942
02:02:14,841 --> 02:02:15,800
I uh,
I mean,

2943
02:02:15,801 --> 02:02:17,210
I get it.
I understand it.

2944
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:18,660
I just,
it's not,

2945
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:20,810
there's not enough time in the day.
I know.

2946
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:21,411
I mean,
if you,

2947
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:21,960
if I,
I,

2948
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:24,980
that's why I don't follow baseball,
basketball,

2949
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:28,700
football or hockey as people try to talk
to shit a game and I go,

2950
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:29,091
no,
no,

2951
02:02:29,091 --> 02:02:30,830
look at me like I just sucked a hundred 
dicks.

2952
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:31,660
Like,
no,

2953
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:34,060
look man,
I don't have to walk like what you like.

2954
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,521
Right,
okay.

2955
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:36,410
Just because you guys were all in the 
football.

2956
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:38,360
You didn't watch the super bowl.
No,

2957
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:39,770
I didn't want you to superbowl.
Yeah.

2958
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,190
Was that okay?
I never watched the superbowl.

2959
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:42,920
It's probably a good time day to go out 
and get shit done.

2960
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:44,150
It's,
I was at Disneyland.

2961
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,510
We always get emt.
People caught on,

2962
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,153
used to be used to be back in the day is
to take the kids on Disneyland was a 

2963
02:02:51,801 --> 02:02:53,190
good one.
Um,

2964
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:54,890
some Jewish holidays.
We're good.

2965
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:55,983
Yeah,
he definitely wouldn't get like you'd 

2966
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,710
eliminate like 99% of the Jewish people.
So that would be a good,

2967
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:03,500
like 30% of the people at the park or 
whatever it fuck it would be.

2968
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:07,130
You can catch like days like that.
Like if you're,

2969
02:03:07,131 --> 02:03:10,520
if you want to go to Disneyland,
it's probably a good idea to plan.

2970
02:03:10,990 --> 02:03:13,720
You got to look really plot that thing 
out,

2971
02:03:13,721 --> 02:03:14,554
right.
Because if you try to go on like a 

2972
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:17,930
normal day in the summer or something 
like that,

2973
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:21,590
good fucking luck.
It hasn't been easy land forever.

2974
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:22,453
It's awesome.
Is it though they have this new star 

2975
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:26,870
distinguish rod.
How do you what?

2976
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,730
Either Quito,
Turkey legs.

2977
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:30,200
You do Turkey legs there.
Yeah.

2978
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,131
You're saying,
dude,

2979
02:03:31,131 --> 02:03:34,970
I'm disciplined.
I full Kido now I can,

2980
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:38,210
well I did a little cheat and when I was
in Mexico I had some uh,

2981
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:40,590
tortillas,
but that was still around.

2982
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,583
Yeah.
But I did it just because I was on 

2983
02:03:43,701 --> 02:03:44,780
vacation.
I was like,

2984
02:03:44,781 --> 02:03:47,090
I'm,
I'm going to enjoy myself for a few days

2985
02:03:47,091 --> 02:03:50,120
and then get right back onto it.
But I like the effect of it.

2986
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:51,623
It definitely a noticeable effect on the
way I look and noticeable effect in the 

2987
02:03:54,411 --> 02:03:55,244
way I feel.

2988
02:03:55,310 --> 02:03:56,143
And I think there's some undeniable 
cognitive benefits as far as like the 

2989
02:04:00,201 --> 02:04:03,380
clarity of your mind.
Like you don't feel foggy and tired.

2990
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:05,420
And I was like,
I'm just sticking with this.

2991
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:07,160
Yeah.
And plus I bring,

2992
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:08,660
I don't have any here.
Well this is the,

2993
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:12,560
this is just some cream.
This is Quito cream run to try to get me

2994
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:13,400
on this stuff,
man.

2995
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:16,160
That's stuff's not,
that's not,

2996
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,031
wait,
I had this one.

2997
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:18,470
It is sweet.
It's got the Stevia in it.

2998
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:19,880
That was,
is that the one?

2999
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:22,310
That's the one I gave it to her.
I gave that shit to her.

3000
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:25,280
Um,
I also gave her some Quito Ios,

3001
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:26,143
which is something you that he'd dumped 
in water it same company right now it's 

3002
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:31,220
a different company,
but it's a ketones.

3003
02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:34,550
Um,
but exogenous ketones are good.

3004
02:04:34,610 --> 02:04:35,560
Yeah.
It doesn't kill Canada.

3005
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,860
Quito can is great.

3006
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:39,360
I have that stuff that's good to like 
keep you going.

3007
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,500
And then there's,
um,

3008
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,663
dom d'agostino who's where,
one of the reasons why I was first 

3009
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:44,873
intrigued by the Ketogenic Diet.
I'm listening to him on a Tim Ferriss 

3010
02:04:47,521 --> 02:04:49,560
podcast.
So if you haven't heard it,

3011
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,600
dom's awesome,
amazing,

3012
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:52,434
super fucking smart guy and so dedicated
to the pros and the benefits of a 

3013
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:01,680
ketogenic diets and staying in Ketosis.
So I was like,

3014
02:05:01,681 --> 02:05:02,514
well,
this guy is obviously on the fucking 

3015
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:03,841
ball.
I've got,

3016
02:05:03,841 --> 02:05:05,230
I've got to really look,
look into this.

3017
02:05:05,231 --> 02:05:06,064
There's gotta be something to this.
And so for me there was a few like 

3018
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:12,810
undeniable benefits.
One of the big ones is the way I feel in

3019
02:05:12,811 --> 02:05:14,610
between meals.
Huge.

3020
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,750
Oh yeah.
There's not any type of crash.

3021
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:18,420
Have a constant energy.
Well,

3022
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:21,300
not only that,
the constant energy or the know crash is

3023
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:23,670
good,
but also my hunger is not the same.

3024
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:24,863
Like I would get fucking famished where 
I would eat something and then four 

3025
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:29,094
hours later,
five hours away when I was ready for my 

3026
02:05:30,151 --> 02:05:30,984
next meal,
I would be famished where my body was 

3027
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:34,590
crashing at all my God,
I have to fucking eat.

3028
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:37,380
I literally don't get like that anymore.
It doesn't happen.

3029
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:38,423
So I recognize that I'm hungry.
I realized that I should probably get 

3030
02:05:41,071 --> 02:05:42,600
some food in me,
but I'm not,

3031
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:45,480
I'm not compromised.
And in that state,

3032
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:47,310
I can still have a very good workout.
Right.

3033
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:51,390
Which when I was on a carbohydrate,
glucose based system,

3034
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,580
my body was just not operating like 
that.

3035
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:54,473
I would,
I would have a shit workout if I was 

3036
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:58,860
tired and I hadn't eaten anything.
I would have to have some fruit before I

3037
02:05:58,861 --> 02:05:59,694
worked at.
Right.

3038
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:04,920
And so those two benefits,
but the big one was,

3039
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:06,450
um,
the way my brain works,

3040
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:09,090
it just feels,
it feels less foggy.

3041
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:10,470
Yeah.
It's a cleaner state,

3042
02:06:10,471 --> 02:06:11,304
I think.
Yeah.

3043
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:12,870
Yeah.
Well,

3044
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:13,903
it's undeniable also that eating all 
those carbohydrates has an effect on 

3045
02:06:16,741 --> 02:06:19,010
your insulin sensitivity.
And you know,

3046
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:21,480
your body's just processing a fuckload 
sugar.

3047
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:24,060
You're all that bread and pasta and all 
that stuff.

3048
02:06:24,061 --> 02:06:27,780
It's a lot of sugar.
And if you are blowing it out all day,

3049
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:30,510
if you're some crazy fucking ultra 
marathon runner or some,

3050
02:06:30,511 --> 02:06:35,040
some dude who's doing crossfit four 
hours a day or something like that,

3051
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:36,600
you'd probably get away with it.
You know,

3052
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,770
again,
probably be fine,

3053
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:41,610
but I think there's some real benefits 
to staying in Ketosis.

3054
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:42,781
Yeah,
I,

3055
02:06:42,781 --> 02:06:43,614
I've,
I got really hooked on it so much so 

3056
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:48,800
that I was testing my blood probably 
three to four times a day,

3057
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:49,963
which you fine.
I was just testing after I would eat 

3058
02:06:52,131 --> 02:06:53,840
certain foods.
So you know,

3059
02:06:53,841 --> 02:06:55,670
I would,
I would go in and say okay,

3060
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,170
I am,
you know,

3061
02:06:57,260 --> 02:07:01,970
two and a half millimolar is right now 
keep telling wise if I have a big salad,

3062
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:07,010
but I put a ton of fat in there as well.
Will I stay in Ketosis?

3063
02:07:07,011 --> 02:07:09,410
Like pushing the edges to see what we 
kicked me out.

3064
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:10,880
Right.
So you know,

3065
02:07:10,881 --> 02:07:12,230
I,
one thing I did find is I,

3066
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:13,453
I like to have a glass of wine or two 
with dinner and so I really wanted to 

3067
02:07:17,571 --> 02:07:20,150
see what wine we do with ketosis knocks 
you right out of it.

3068
02:07:20,151 --> 02:07:21,200
Right.
You know what,

3069
02:07:21,201 --> 02:07:25,010
actually I'm a really dry champagne.
I could stay in,

3070
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:26,413
which is weird because you wouldn't 
think champagne would keep you and you 

3071
02:07:28,131 --> 02:07:30,800
think like something with a,
it has definitely.

3072
02:07:30,801 --> 02:07:32,940
It has to be on the drier side,
but I was thinking initially like a,

3073
02:07:32,941 --> 02:07:35,030
a red wine would keep me in more than 
say like a

3074
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,120
champagne.
I would,

3075
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,340
I would drop down,
but I'd still be,

3076
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:40,750
you know,
around 0.8

3077
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:42,490
to 1.2,
somewhere around there.

3078
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:43,383
Do you worry about that?
Do you check that on a regular basis or 

3079
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:49,870
do you just go on the way you feel?
Uh,

3080
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:50,733
primarily in the way I feel.
I could always tell when I got kicked 

3081
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:54,064
out,
I could tell when I ate something I 

3082
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:55,840
shouldn't,
you know,

3083
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:59,470
I'd be out and about and it would sneak 
up on me.

3084
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:00,304
You know,
you'd have like a salad with like some 

3085
02:08:01,031 --> 02:08:04,210
kind of dressing that I wasn't sure of,
but it doesn't taste too sweet.

3086
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,343
And then all of a sudden I would get 
this really bad crash if I got fully 

3087
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:09,490
kicked out of Ketosis.
Yeah.

3088
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:11,440
Wow.
You must be like super sensitive.

3089
02:08:11,441 --> 02:08:12,274
I was super since,
but I would also get pretty deep pretty 

3090
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:15,034
easily.
Like I could fast and get up into two 

3091
02:08:17,021 --> 02:08:20,800
and a half,
three millimeters within 24 hours.

3092
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:23,680
Um,
I had a real problem with those God damn

3093
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:25,000
blood meters.
Why?

3094
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:25,983
Because the things that they use to 
prick your skin don't get through my 

3095
02:08:28,961 --> 02:08:31,330
skin just said it's like a level eight 
or whatever.

3096
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:34,090
I had to take it out of the thing and 
stab myself.

3097
02:08:34,091 --> 02:08:34,930
Yeah,
that's weird.

3098
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:38,770
I lift so much kettlebells that my,
my skins are all,

3099
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:40,650
it's all calloused and thick.
Right.

3100
02:08:40,670 --> 02:08:44,350
So I'd like try to get in there and I 
was going to actually go with the top of

3101
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:45,670
my skin,
you know,

3102
02:08:45,671 --> 02:08:47,380
like maybe that's the better way to do 
it,

3103
02:08:47,381 --> 02:08:50,440
but it just seemed so fucking gross.
So I've tried it all over the place.

3104
02:08:50,441 --> 02:08:53,260
I've done it on the sides before.
What's the best way for you?

3105
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,011
Uh,
for me it's,

3106
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:55,750
it is the tips of the fingers,
but like,

3107
02:08:55,751 --> 02:08:56,584
you know,
it's kind of Russian roulette like one 

3108
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,900
and I've ever,
10 is going to hurt.

3109
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:01,300
So when you're doing it like five times 
a day,

3110
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:04,330
you would always kind of try and yeah,
different spots.

3111
02:09:04,331 --> 02:09:05,590
You know,
it got annoying.

3112
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:06,970
I was like,
this is annoying.

3113
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,510
Jab Myself.
Cause I had,

3114
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:12,440
I used to try the punch thing and it 
just wasn't doing anything right.

3115
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:13,413
I would go right to the tip chunk.
Did you squeak Bush even when you were 

3116
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:19,080
at that thing?
Huh?

3117
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:21,700
But is years of,
you know,

3118
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,833
lifting?
I like kettle bells or just so it's a 

3119
02:09:24,971 --> 02:09:25,804
fat piece of iron and your hands.
Are you just constantly getting roughed 

3120
02:09:28,811 --> 02:09:32,470
up and I'm using powder right on chalk.
So it's was all this grit.

3121
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:34,990
It's all very thick.
It's like the coding.

3122
02:09:34,991 --> 02:09:38,080
It's like the bottom of your feet stand 
on top doing the top stair.

3123
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:41,560
Is there a better way?
I mean there's the piece takes,

3124
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,510
but they don't really didn't work that 
well.

3125
02:09:43,850 --> 02:09:45,370
Um,
but you know,

3126
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:46,473
for someone like yourself that's falling
a pretty strict diet than just once a 

3127
02:09:48,641 --> 02:09:49,780
day is fine,
just check it,

3128
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:52,510
check it first thing in the morning and 
don't check it anymore.

3129
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:53,523
Yeah,
it doesn't matter if you know you're in 

3130
02:09:54,071 --> 02:09:55,240
your end,
you'll feel it.

3131
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:56,320
Well,
I always feel like,

3132
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:57,370
look,
what am I eating?

3133
02:09:57,371 --> 02:10:02,371
I mean eggs and Avocados and meet,
and I know what I'm eating and I'm not,

3134
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:06,490
I just want to feel like I'm feel right 
now,

3135
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:08,980
like if I could just keep this whatever 
this is.

3136
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:09,970
Yeah.
This is great.

3137
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:10,990
You know?
I mean,

3138
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:11,823
I don't want to,
I don't want anything that I would have 

3139
02:10:13,211 --> 02:10:14,150
to obsess on.
Right.

3140
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:16,390
Oh my God,
I'm in 2 million molar is I'd like to be

3141
02:10:16,391 --> 02:10:17,890
at three I,
how do I get to three?

3142
02:10:17,891 --> 02:10:18,724
Well,
I'll have to eat,

3143
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:21,160
drink fucking gallon mct.
Oh,

3144
02:10:21,161 --> 02:10:22,900
now I've got to shit my pants.
It's right.

3145
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,430
Yeah.
For me it was like,

3146
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:25,990
okay,
what is going to kick me out?

3147
02:10:25,991 --> 02:10:29,320
Just so I know the boundaries and once I
have the boundaries that I'm fine,

3148
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:30,970
I didn't need to do it anymore.
So like,

3149
02:10:30,971 --> 02:10:32,530
you know,
I know that I can have,

3150
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,130
you know,
a half a cup of brown

3151
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:38,480
rice along with some fatty foods and 
it's not going to really do anything.

3152
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,583
So it's like,
I just wanted to see it as a cup kicked 

3153
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:42,381
me out.
Oh yeah,

3154
02:10:42,381 --> 02:10:43,101
I kept does.
Okay,

3155
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:43,911
dial it back,
you know,

3156
02:10:43,911 --> 02:10:45,120
that kind of thing.
Right?

3157
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:47,210
And when you get kicked out,
how long does it take you to recover?

3158
02:10:47,290 --> 02:10:49,130
A half day.
Half Day.

3159
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,770
Half to three quarters of a day.
Intermittent fast at all.

3160
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,870
Oh yeah.
And how,

3161
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:54,920
how many hours do you do?
A 16 hours.

3162
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:56,690
16,
12.

3163
02:10:56,691 --> 02:11:00,380
And I guess it's not enough.
I'll do 24 a couple of times a month.

3164
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:01,101
Real?
Yeah.

3165
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:01,934
Two,
three times a month.

3166
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,400
And why do you do it?
Just because I keep,

3167
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:05,353
you know,
he listened to ron as podcast and she 

3168
02:11:06,351 --> 02:11:09,650
starts talking about like all the guests
that she has.

3169
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:11,000
I'm like doctor,
dom and others.

3170
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:12,201
Um,
you know,

3171
02:11:12,201 --> 02:11:15,890
when they talk about how if you're doing
a full 24 hour fast,

3172
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,330
like it can actually help clear out the 
non precancerous cause kind of cells.

3173
02:11:20,331 --> 02:11:23,430
They haven't fully gone cancer.
And then interesting.

3174
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:25,640
It's crazy,
but why not?

3175
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:27,140
You know,
it's like this is something fascinating.

3176
02:11:27,141 --> 02:11:29,870
Been around for a,
a obviously a very long time.

3177
02:11:29,871 --> 02:11:32,510
It also puts me in a nice kind of 
meditative state.

3178
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:34,190
Um,
you know,

3179
02:11:34,191 --> 02:11:36,230
it's,
I interviewed the trainer.

3180
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,093
I haven't released as podcasts yet,
but I enter interviewed the trainer for 

3181
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:42,720
Hugh Jackman that helped him get 
shredded revolver.

3182
02:11:42,721 --> 02:11:45,120
He did tell you about the steroids.
Uh,

3183
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:46,120
he did not tell me about this.

3184
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,620
Oh,
well he didn't tell you everything then.

3185
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:49,653
Yeah,
he definitely told me about the 

3186
02:11:50,361 --> 02:11:52,850
intermittent fast about the steroids.
Is this real?

3187
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:55,220
I'm a hundred percent confident that 
that guy did steroid.

3188
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,780
How do you know?
Look at his body.

3189
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:02,000
He's fucking jacked.
Hugh Jackman got fucking jacked and he's

3190
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:04,280
40 years old.
You don't think he got checked?

3191
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:05,810
Well,
I mean,

3192
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:07,220
well,
it depends on what kind of,

3193
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:09,890
I'm sure that he was on a wonderful 
diet.

3194
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:12,110
He was on a wonderful diet,
intermittent fasting.

3195
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:14,750
He was without a doubt,
manipulating these hormones.

3196
02:12:14,751 --> 02:12:15,584
What do you think he was using?
I know friends that have done movie 

3197
02:12:17,091 --> 02:12:17,990
rules.
Look at him.

3198
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:18,920
Come on,
son.

3199
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,140
Shit.
That's a lot of photoshop.

3200
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:23,330
Photoshop,
that's a skill that might be a still,

3201
02:12:23,331 --> 02:12:26,150
but the,
this is scene in the movie where he gets

3202
02:12:26,151 --> 02:12:30,500
up out of bed and he is fucking jacked.
I mean,

3203
02:12:30,501 --> 02:12:32,810
is it possible to get that big without 
steroids?

3204
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,170
If you're 20 yeah,
yeah.

3205
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,283
It war.
If you are a fucking maniac and your 30 

3206
02:12:40,070 --> 02:12:44,240
and you're in the gym all day long and 
you're completely and totally dedicated.

3207
02:12:44,241 --> 02:12:45,140
Yeah,
it's possible.

3208
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:48,840
But it's not likely.
But I have a friend who was a,

3209
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:49,813
he was doing,
he's a movie actor and he was doing a 

3210
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:54,980
role and in the role he had to be jacked
and they just,

3211
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:57,890
without any,
they just come in.

3212
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:58,940
Yeah.
We have a guy,

3213
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,110
we have a guy and this guy's gonna hook 
you up and if you follow his protocol,

3214
02:13:02,111 --> 02:13:03,650
she's just gonna it'll be healthy.
It's like,

3215
02:13:03,651 --> 02:13:04,520
well,
this what we're gonna do.

3216
02:13:04,521 --> 02:13:05,120
We're gonna,
you know,

3217
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:07,040
do this and do that and add this and 
that.

3218
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:07,874
And he was like,
whoa.

3219
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:09,140
And uh,
you know,

3220
02:13:09,141 --> 02:13:09,974
it's,
it's really kind of in some sort of a 

3221
02:13:11,661 --> 02:13:15,650
weird gray area.
You know,

3222
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:18,070
it's,
there's some stuff that you,

3223
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:19,003
first of all,
there's some stuff that you can get at 

3224
02:13:20,751 --> 02:13:24,710
like Gnc and some of those places where 
it is steroids.

3225
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:25,640
Really.
Yes.

3226
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,870
Like what stuff?
Well,

3227
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:31,290
fucking shitload of them.
We had Jeff Novitsky who was the guy who

3228
02:13:31,291 --> 02:13:33,630
busted Lance Armstrong and he works for 
the UFC now.

3229
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:34,464
He works for Usada and he um,
they have a website and then the youth 

3230
02:13:37,421 --> 02:13:38,254
side of website,
there's all these different supplements 

3231
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,333
that contain products that are illegal 
products that will get you kicked out 

3232
02:13:45,961 --> 02:13:49,290
because they are steroids in their 
performance enhancing drugs while you,

3233
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:53,640
the u s Ada website has like,
you know,

3234
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,533
alphabetically listed a through z and 
each letter has just fucking shit loads 

3235
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:01,674
of different supplements that you could 
buy at any store and he local vitamin 

3236
02:14:04,951 --> 02:14:08,580
Shoppe that is likely to be filled with 
steroids.

3237
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:11,640
That's crazy.
Well there's this stuff that I take,

3238
02:14:11,641 --> 02:14:15,270
I took it in like the early two 
thousands was called Mag 10.

3239
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:16,440
They,
they made it illegal.

3240
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:20,130
After awhile it was 100% steroids.

3241
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:23,370
I mean 100%.
This has to be really bad for your liver

3242
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:25,590
then since all most of them are not 
good.

3243
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,173
But you know,
when you see someone did gets that Jack 

3244
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:30,324
for a movie,
why would they be concerned with not 

3245
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:36,210
doing it the right way?
Like if the,

3246
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:37,680
what's the,
what's the goal here?

3247
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:40,290
The goal here is you have to look like a
goddamn superhero.

3248
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:41,160
Right?
Okay.

3249
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:41,993
So are you pr,
are you prepared to not totally looked 

3250
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:47,520
like a superhero and tell everybody,
but at least I did it naturally.

3251
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:48,750
Right?
Fuck that.

3252
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:49,584
No,
they're going to,

3253
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:50,573
they're going to do dead lifts on 
testosterone and take human growth 

3254
02:14:53,341 --> 02:14:55,500
hormone and the reward is pretty high 
too.

3255
02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:59,430
And that you get paid $15 million or 
whatever it is for any looked awesome.

3256
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:00,713
I mean I'm not hating it at all,
but anyone who thinks you're going to 

3257
02:15:03,751 --> 02:15:06,150
achieve that kind of results without 
some sorts,

3258
02:15:06,151 --> 02:15:07,560
especially like,
like I said,

3259
02:15:07,561 --> 02:15:11,730
like how old you Jackman isn't he like 
40 it's like 42 or something like that.

3260
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:14,880
I mean it's,
there are some outliers,

3261
02:15:14,881 --> 02:15:15,714
there are some people that mean,
but in the UFC when you find these guys 

3262
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:19,584
and they just look unbelievable,
they like unbelievably ripped and huge 

3263
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:23,243
and they get into their late thirties 
and then they get popped and then some 

3264
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:27,360
on the,
some of the,

3265
02:15:27,361 --> 02:15:29,270
they just randomly test them and then 
eat.

3266
02:15:29,271 --> 02:15:32,400
Cause w the way that UFC is set up now 
with Novitsky,

3267
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,290
they'll show up at your house at six 
o'clock in the morning,

3268
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,100
wake up,
dude,

3269
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:36,180
wake up dude.
Yeah,

3270
02:15:36,181 --> 02:15:39,720
we need some blood to p crazy.
And then they test them.

3271
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:40,471
And then,
you know,

3272
02:15:40,471 --> 02:15:42,410
there's a lot of these guys that are on 
something that hasn't,

3273
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,253
it's insanely short half life.
Like they'll have something that a is 

3274
02:15:46,261 --> 02:15:48,960
only a shows up in the system for like 
seven hours.

3275
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:50,033
So what they'll try to do is they'll try
to take it like right before they go to 

3276
02:15:51,781 --> 02:15:54,180
bed and then we'll get the benefits of 
it and then,

3277
02:15:54,181 --> 02:15:55,830
but they'll fucking wake you up,
man.

3278
02:15:56,010 --> 02:15:58,590
They'll wake you up.
That's insane.

3279
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:00,023
Well,
it's because they want to find out 

3280
02:16:00,451 --> 02:16:04,290
what's going on and we've exposed,
or I shouldn't say we have nothing to do

3281
02:16:04,291 --> 02:16:06,120
with it,
but they've exposed,

3282
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:06,973
uh,
tremendous underlying sort of just a 

3283
02:16:10,771 --> 02:16:14,100
standard operational procedure of 
testosterone,

3284
02:16:14,101 --> 02:16:15,380
steroids,
all,

3285
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:19,080
all sorts of different ways of 
manipulating the system.

3286
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:19,943
Epo,
that stuff that Armstrong got caught 

3287
02:16:21,451 --> 02:16:23,790
with or actually didn't,
he never got caught with anything.

3288
02:16:23,791 --> 02:16:24,910
Right.
He had to confess.

3289
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,230
That's right.
But a lot of those cyclists take epo,

3290
02:16:28,231 --> 02:16:30,790
which jacks up your red blood cell 
production.

3291
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:32,253
There's just so many different ways of 
enhancing the way the body functions 

3292
02:16:34,961 --> 02:16:36,370
both naturally,
you know,

3293
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:40,060
like with Ketosis and a lot of other 
methods and you know,

3294
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:43,870
and then with exogenous chemicals,
did you see the documentary on steroids?

3295
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:44,741
Which one?
Bigger.

3296
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:45,520
Stronger,
faster.

3297
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:48,130
I had those guys here.
It would you think that's great.

3298
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:49,630
It's interesting.
It is interesting.

3299
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:52,030
I've become friends with those guys.
Um,

3300
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:55,990
and um,
it's just when you find out what,

3301
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:58,023
you know,
how many different different types of 

3302
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:01,924
steroids there are and how many 
different people and totally different 

3303
02:17:04,151 --> 02:17:04,984
athletes are taking them and you like,
especially throughout bodybuilding and 

3304
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:09,460
things.
I mean if you can call that a sport,

3305
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:11,350
I guess you can.
It's kind of an activity more than it is

3306
02:17:11,351 --> 02:17:15,040
a sports kind of dying out though.
I feel like is it at least the,

3307
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:17,950
the crazy,
I had a buddy that they competed,

3308
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,320
um,
and he was definitely choosing,

3309
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:22,600
uh,
and he was,

3310
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:27,550
he said that the big bulky kind of crazy
over the top look and they're going more

3311
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:30,760
for a more natural appearance.
That's kind of the hot thing now.

3312
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:33,130
Like Frank Zane or something like that.
Yeah.

3313
02:17:33,131 --> 02:17:33,964
Frank Zane was famous in the arnold days
as being like the most symmetrical and 

3314
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:43,050
also like the more realistic,
like as close to like a Lee Haney who is

3315
02:17:43,051 --> 02:17:45,400
just just walking mass of muscle.

3316
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:47,350
Right.
Whereas Zane was more,

3317
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:50,140
it looked more sculpted.
It will look more like a,

3318
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:52,870
you have a photo of them there.
Oh,

3319
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:53,920
Jesus.
Who's that guy?

3320
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:57,340
Oh yeah,
he was on what touch point.

3321
02:17:57,341 --> 02:17:58,690
Oh,
oh yeah.

3322
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:02,740
Well this guy is a crazy guy.
He's sort of a bodybuilder,

3323
02:18:02,741 --> 02:18:03,574
but more of like a personality.
He has an eight hour arm workout where 

3324
02:18:06,941 --> 02:18:09,550
he works out nothing but his arms for 
eight hours.

3325
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:11,290
Wow.
His arms are massive.

3326
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:12,640
Yeah.
He's everything massive.

3327
02:18:12,641 --> 02:18:15,220
He's is a cartoon.
There's definitely some drugs there.

3328
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:16,420
No way,
dude.

3329
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:18,610
That's totally legit.
Yeah,

3330
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:19,031
no,
he's,

3331
02:18:19,031 --> 02:18:21,050
he's brought it to the tits.
Um,

3332
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:22,510
but lou,
Google,

3333
02:18:22,511 --> 02:18:23,344
Frank Zane,
and you'll get an idea of what a lot of 

3334
02:18:26,051 --> 02:18:29,320
people thought was like one of the 
perfect bodies.

3335
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,333
So like Frank Zane,
I firmly believe that that is a body 

3336
02:18:33,461 --> 02:18:34,294
that is possible.
You can attain that body without 

3337
02:18:35,951 --> 02:18:39,880
steroids with strong dedication and 
good,

3338
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:43,300
uh,
knowledge of nutrition and the right way

3339
02:18:43,301 --> 02:18:44,140
to lift weights.

3340
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,093
But Frank Zane never got ridiculously 
big like that is a regular size guy out 

3341
02:18:50,021 --> 02:18:52,210
a lot of gyms like right there,
right.

3342
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:53,103
That's a regular size guy.
And a lot of like high level gyms like 

3343
02:18:56,261 --> 02:18:58,120
that might not even be the biggest guy 
there.

3344
02:18:58,121 --> 02:18:59,560
It looks like there's drugs there 
though,

3345
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:00,423
right?
I mean,

3346
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:04,690
the shoulders are popped maybe most 
likely,

3347
02:19:04,691 --> 02:19:05,980
probably.
I Dunno.

3348
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:07,001
Um,
no,

3349
02:19:07,001 --> 02:19:08,200
that's attainable,
man.

3350
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:09,053
Yeah,
that's a terrible without drug little 

3351
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:10,774
lines.
But that just means he's a very lean it 

3352
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:14,590
those little lines.
Striations.

3353
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,870
That's totally attainable.
Without drugs.

3354
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:18,790
There's a level,
I mean,

3355
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:20,500
you'd have to be really dedicated to 
training,

3356
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:21,550
but he's,
he's not,

3357
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:25,840
he's not that big man in comparison to 
some of the people of today.

3358
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:27,950
Now look at him.
Okay.

3359
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:33,010
Now Google Dorian Yates,
Dorian Yates who was a fucking,

3360
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:33,943
and he's or Dorian is a really 
interesting guy because he's super 

3361
02:19:36,531 --> 02:19:38,600
honest about it.
Like that one right there,

3362
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:40,430
right?
No to the left of that right there.

3363
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:45,610
What in the fucking Christ look out.
That's insane.

3364
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:53,150
That's all drugs and dedication and 
focus and lifting a 100% I mean,

3365
02:19:53,151 --> 02:19:55,010
you don't have,
you just took Jay counselor.

3366
02:19:55,011 --> 02:19:56,450
You've seen Jay Cutler's legs,
right?

3367
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:57,713
Yeah.
Type in Jay Cutler that those guys are 

3368
02:19:59,091 --> 02:20:00,280
ridiculous.
Yeah.

3369
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:02,023
Or Tom Platz ever seen that guy's legs.
Tom Platz has the most ridiculous legs 

3370
02:20:07,161 --> 02:20:07,994
ever.

3371
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:11,790
Jesus Christ.
I can't.

3372
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:13,310
I just got some.
Yeah,

3373
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,900
that's all like horses.
I mean,

3374
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:19,310
you have to be a maniac in the gym on 
top of the log of that fucking picture.

3375
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:21,050
That's insane.
Yeah.

3376
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:22,850
I mean,
I think this is also,

3377
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:24,283
this is also like a mass movement of 
body dysmorphia because it's not just 

3378
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:33,320
that these guys are trying to get as big
as they can.

3379
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:38,090
I don't think they see themselves the 
way other people see them either.

3380
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:38,924
Cause like sometimes they freak out when
they're not in perfect shape and they 

3381
02:20:42,111 --> 02:20:42,944
want to cover their bodies up with 
sweaters and stuff and they don't want 

3382
02:20:45,681 --> 02:20:49,340
anybody looking at them.
It's like an anorexia thing in a way,

3383
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:52,970
but it's still like better than 99.9%
of humans on earth,

3384
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,190
even when they're not in peak shape.
Oh yeah.

3385
02:20:55,370 --> 02:20:56,060
Yeah.
I mean,

3386
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:57,200
but to them,
you know,

3387
02:20:57,201 --> 02:20:58,920
they're,
they're used to judging each other.

3388
02:20:58,920 --> 02:20:59,970
So harsh,
laid,

3389
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:01,790
they have a little bit of extra body 
fat.

3390
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:04,490
They start to freak crazy.
Yeah.

3391
02:21:04,491 --> 02:21:07,310
I mean back to Hugh Jackman and this,
uh,

3392
02:21:07,311 --> 02:21:08,300
this training thing.
Yeah.

3393
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:09,173
I mean I think that's,
it's a fantastic way to get your body 

3394
02:21:11,871 --> 02:21:12,704
really lean.
And that's one of the things he was in 

3395
02:21:13,731 --> 02:21:15,320
that movie was super lean.
Yeah.

3396
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,710
So he was on a ketogenic diet.
He was doing the intermittent fasting.

3397
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:21,860
And so he was doing 16 hours a day,
every day,

3398
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:22,723
every day.
Hmm.

3399
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:23,683
Interesting.
And then on a ketogenic diet as well as 

3400
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:26,120
I know about that.
No,

3401
02:21:26,121 --> 02:21:27,520
I don't think he was saying Kenogenic.
Hmm.

3402
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:28,423
And what was the benefit of doing that 
16 hour fasting without a key leading 

3403
02:21:30,891 --> 02:21:32,150
up.
Just leaning up.

3404
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:33,553
Hmm.
I would wonder if that would affect 

3405
02:21:34,731 --> 02:21:37,850
without getting your body into a state 
of ketosis.

3406
02:21:37,851 --> 02:21:41,090
I wonder if that would affect the way 
your body put on muscle mass.

3407
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:42,590
Yeah,
I'm not sure.

3408
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,020
I don't know enough about this.
You know,

3409
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:45,873
there's also a problem that for the 
longest time doctors were calling 

3410
02:21:49,341 --> 02:21:53,120
bullshit on fasting and they just didn't
have a lot of information.

3411
02:21:53,121 --> 02:21:56,540
But they were like so quick to poo poo 
it and like,

3412
02:21:56,541 --> 02:21:58,490
you know,
like fasting has no med.

3413
02:21:58,491 --> 02:22:01,220
I remember this guy telling me this,
he was a doctor goes,

3414
02:22:01,221 --> 02:22:02,054
fasting has no medical benefits.
Your body exists on nutrients and when 

3415
02:22:05,841 --> 02:22:06,674
you deny your body nutrients and you 
think you're somehow under their 

3416
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:10,910
cleansing,
your system is just a bunch of bunk.

3417
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,260
Meanwhile,
he was wrong.

3418
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,970
Right?
And he's a fucking doctor.

3419
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,450
That means almost all doctors are five,
10 years behind the science though,

3420
02:22:17,451 --> 02:22:18,590
right?
Um,

3421
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:19,650
a lot of them,
well the,

3422
02:22:19,651 --> 02:22:23,570
the thing is how much education did they
actually have on nutrition,

3423
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:26,720
right.
And two hours that it's really small.

3424
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:28,890
It is like that it's like,
you know,

3425
02:22:28,891 --> 02:22:30,560
a quarter of a semester or something 
like that.

3426
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:31,403
Something really,
so when you're talking to an oncologist 

3427
02:22:33,030 --> 02:22:33,863
and the oncologist starts poopooing the 
value of phytonutrients and certain 

3428
02:22:38,281 --> 02:22:42,870
vitamins to combat cancer and he doesn't
stay on top of the cutting edge of it.

3429
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:44,303
I mean,
people are so weird with what they know 

3430
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:48,990
that they believe that what they know is
all there is out there.

3431
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:50,273
Right.
Like I had a discussion with this woman 

3432
02:22:52,111 --> 02:22:54,150
and she just did,
she was,

3433
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:56,640
um,
we were talking about um,

3434
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:00,750
uh,
this animal that they found the Congo,

3435
02:23:00,751 --> 02:23:01,584
it's called the Bondo ape.
It's like this enormous chimpanzee 

3436
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:07,290
documented like hundred percent.
They have DNA photos,

3437
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:09,330
camera trap pictures of it.
They have,

3438
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:12,510
they've got the skull of it,
they know it's real animal.

3439
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,920
And this woman was like,
try it.

3440
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,050
She was mocking it.

3441
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:17,400
She was mocking it.
Like,

3442
02:23:17,401 --> 02:23:20,770
what could kind of fringe things.
I went to school for anthropology.

3443
02:23:20,771 --> 02:23:21,604
Like I go,
oh well you're obviously not on the 

3444
02:23:22,681 --> 02:23:23,514
ball.
Like maybe you went to school 20 years 

3445
02:23:25,381 --> 02:23:26,940
ago.
And then I told her,

3446
02:23:26,941 --> 02:23:27,900
go,
go google it.

3447
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:29,280
Go Google,
check it these websites.

3448
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:30,750
And she was like,
I'm not going to,

3449
02:23:30,751 --> 02:23:31,730
I go,
you're not going to,

3450
02:23:31,740 --> 02:23:32,573
I'll,
but I'll do it in front of you and then 

3451
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:34,194
will you shut the fuck up and I show you
photos cause this is giant chimpanzee 

3452
02:23:38,131 --> 02:23:38,964
that they found this one rare area of 
the Congo that's of really old photo 

3453
02:23:43,021 --> 02:23:43,531
though,
man.

3454
02:23:43,531 --> 02:23:44,364
That's one of the phones.
That's a better photo look at the size 

3455
02:23:46,471 --> 02:23:51,060
of that fucking chimp.
I mean that thing is goddamn huge.

3456
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:52,223
They have a,
there's a guy named Carl Amon who's a 

3457
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:55,163
Swiss wildlife photographer who set up 
some camera traps and he got a picture 

3458
02:23:58,261 --> 02:24:01,020
of one of them walking,
standing on the side,

3459
02:24:01,021 --> 02:24:02,970
the balls on that huge nuts.

3460
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:05,400
Huge.
And that's not even a good picture.

3461
02:24:05,401 --> 02:24:07,950
That's a kind of a blurry picture.
There's some better ones have it.

3462
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:09,083
But,
um,

3463
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:13,200
it's an enormous chimp,
it's a like a subspecies that,

3464
02:24:13,201 --> 02:24:14,550
uh,
turns out to be,

3465
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:17,070
uh,
enjoys walking upright as well.

3466
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:20,040
They see the far right far right upper 
upper deck.

3467
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,990
Yeah,
that's the camera trap photo.

3468
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:24,510
That's one of them walk,
go full screen on that,

3469
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:26,653
uh,
does work.

3470
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:27,623
That's one of 'em walking upright and 
they said that fucking thing was six 

3471
02:24:31,591 --> 02:24:35,610
feet tall.
Like that is an enormous chimpanzee.

3472
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,473
But the point is this woman who said she
went to school for anthropology was 

3473
02:24:39,511 --> 02:24:41,820
mocking this when we were talking about 
it and I was like,

3474
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:42,680
look,
I'm telling you,

3475
02:24:42,681 --> 02:24:44,160
I mean,
it's not something I'm making up.

3476
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:47,040
I'm not going to fucking 
cryptozoology.com

3477
02:24:47,041 --> 02:24:49,080
like this is national geographic.
This was,

3478
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:50,183
you know,
like there's a bunch of different 

3479
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:52,853
scientists that are studying this thing 
and trying to find out how many of them 

3480
02:24:55,051 --> 02:24:57,660
there are and they don't have any of 
them in captivity.

3481
02:24:57,661 --> 02:24:58,494
They don't know how many there are.
And it's a really dangerous part of the 

3482
02:25:00,841 --> 02:25:04,380
Congo where it's warlords and fucking,
you know,

3483
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:05,243
shootings and killings and rapings.
It's like he's a very dangerous spot to 

3484
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:09,594
get to and they're really,
but the point being when someone gets a 

3485
02:25:12,961 --> 02:25:13,794
certain amount of information on a 
subject and then they don't stay up on 

3486
02:25:16,651 --> 02:25:19,290
it and they still want to cling to that 
old information,

3487
02:25:19,291 --> 02:25:22,830
like this is all there is like you do a 
real disservice to the other people that

3488
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:24,100
you

3489
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,050
to be the one who's the voice of 
information.

3490
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:28,120
Absolutely.
Yeah.

3491
02:25:28,121 --> 02:25:28,954
The fascinating thing is a,
I think it's starting to come around 

3492
02:25:30,851 --> 02:25:32,380
though.
I have a buddy that just,

3493
02:25:32,381 --> 02:25:37,300
I'm just beat cancer.
He was a stage three lymphoma.

3494
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:38,283
Whoa.
And he went in for his first chemo 

3495
02:25:41,170 --> 02:25:42,003
treatments and you know,
you just get totally sick when you're 

3496
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:45,784
doing chemo.
And there was some research that come 

3497
02:25:47,861 --> 02:25:50,920
out and talk about fasting prior to 
chemo and how it helps with the,

3498
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:51,783
with the therapy.
So he started fasting two days prior to 

3499
02:25:54,191 --> 02:25:55,024
doing chemo.
So you do 48 hours and then go into 

3500
02:25:56,411 --> 02:26:01,120
chemo and world of difference.
And so it was this doctor,

3501
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:02,303
um,
put out a bunch of papers and you can 

3502
02:26:03,581 --> 02:26:04,414
even watch the videos on youtube of 
these rats fasting prior to chemo and 

3503
02:26:07,601 --> 02:26:08,434
that the difference between the fast and
group in the non fasting group is like 

3504
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:12,050
night and day.
The group that fast,

3505
02:26:12,051 --> 02:26:13,870
it is like running around,
eating,

3506
02:26:13,871 --> 02:26:16,990
drinking afterwards,
like after they had the chemo treatment,

3507
02:26:16,991 --> 02:26:19,870
the other group is just on its side like
deathly ill.

3508
02:26:19,990 --> 02:26:22,030
Wow.
That's really crazy.

3509
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:25,330
That's amazing.
There's benefits going into chemo too,

3510
02:26:25,331 --> 02:26:27,340
which is,
Rhonda was talking about that.

3511
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:28,293
She was talking about Doctor Rhonda.
Patrick was talking about that there's 

3512
02:26:32,410 --> 02:26:33,243
some pretty significant benefits,
not just for combating cancer but also 

3513
02:26:35,741 --> 02:26:40,240
for dealing with chemo.
It's just amazing how many tinkers there

3514
02:26:40,241 --> 02:26:43,840
are out there.
Like Dr Dom D'agostino guys who are just

3515
02:26:43,841 --> 02:26:46,660
super fucking smart but also tweaking 
their own body.

3516
02:26:46,661 --> 02:26:47,220
Like

3517
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,230
if you had Peter Attia on the show yet.
No,

3518
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:50,430
he's,
he's another one that,

3519
02:26:50,431 --> 02:26:51,510
uh,
what's his law?

3520
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:53,850
Dr Peter Attia.
How do you spell it?

3521
02:26:53,910 --> 02:26:55,320
Uh,
I'd have to look it up.

3522
02:26:55,410 --> 02:26:57,520
Att I,
Yay.

3523
02:26:57,550 --> 02:27:00,300
Yay.
So that he's been on a Tim ferriss show.

3524
02:27:00,301 --> 02:27:03,810
He's another body hacker slash kido 
person.

3525
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:05,160
Really,
really smart guy.

3526
02:27:05,161 --> 02:27:07,020
He was just on,
Rhonda is a podcast as well.

3527
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:07,530
Oh,
okay.

3528
02:27:07,530 --> 02:27:08,363
I'll find them.
There's so many of those people out 

3529
02:27:09,391 --> 02:27:13,720
there and I know these doctors that are 
also into physical fitness and you know,

3530
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:14,693
exercise is like,
one of the things about a Tim Ferriss 

3531
02:27:16,441 --> 02:27:19,700
podcasts was dom d'agostino talking 
about fasting for five days.

3532
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:21,780
Then doing like 500 pounds of dead 
lifts.

3533
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,790
Just insane.
It's like what?

3534
02:27:23,791 --> 02:27:26,370
So crazy he would think of someone who 
hadn't eaten in five days.

3535
02:27:26,371 --> 02:27:30,210
It just being a barely alive thing 
clinging to life,

3536
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,350
you know?
Yeah.

3537
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:33,223
It's um,
it's really fascinating how we're 

3538
02:27:35,131 --> 02:27:35,964
learning also that the body has a bunch 
of different ways that it can acquire 

3539
02:27:39,061 --> 02:27:39,894
food,
that it can acquire food through 

3540
02:27:40,531 --> 02:27:44,220
carbohydrates or fuel rather through 
carbohydrates or through fat,

3541
02:27:44,730 --> 02:27:45,211
you know,
or,

3542
02:27:45,211 --> 02:27:46,044
and it can go back and forth in between 
those things and just the reaction that 

3543
02:27:49,051 --> 02:27:49,884
your body has that we think is normal to
common everyday foods that are just 

3544
02:27:53,671 --> 02:27:55,350
really fucking terrible for you.

3545
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:57,090
But we all eat them,
you know?

3546
02:27:57,990 --> 02:28:00,360
And you know,
he could deal occasionally every now and

3547
02:28:00,361 --> 02:28:02,040
then.
But I didn't when I,

3548
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,950
um,
when I really committed to it was when I

3549
02:28:04,951 --> 02:28:05,784
met Mark Sisson and I did the podcast 
with him and I really started talking 

3550
02:28:08,341 --> 02:28:11,220
about the,
when he really started talking about the

3551
02:28:11,221 --> 02:28:13,860
benefits of it and I just decided,
well,

3552
02:28:13,861 --> 02:28:15,570
it's worth a shot.
Let me just give it a shot.

3553
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:16,583
And within five or six days,
I knew that this was going to be 

3554
02:28:18,601 --> 02:28:20,430
probably the way I eat for the rest of 
my life.

3555
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,100
And

3556
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:22,933
one of the things that really hit me was
how bad I felt when I wasn't taking in 

3557
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:28,610
sugar for a few days.
And I was like,

3558
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,080
God,
have I got a headache?

3559
02:28:30,081 --> 02:28:31,760
I feel like shit.
And I realized,

3560
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,710
Oh,
my body is addicted to this crap.

3561
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:36,080
Absolutely.
Sugar is the devil.

3562
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,210
It's so bad for us.
I mean,

3563
02:28:38,211 --> 02:28:38,830
just,
I,

3564
02:28:38,830 --> 02:28:40,580
I'm sure you keep up with the data as 
well,

3565
02:28:40,581 --> 02:28:41,414
but just like every,
it feels like every few months was 

3566
02:28:42,831 --> 02:28:45,770
another report that comes out and talks 
about how toxic and evil it is.

3567
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:47,570
But it's so yummy.
It is.

3568
02:28:47,571 --> 02:28:48,404
Yummy.
What have a fucking weird biological 

3569
02:28:49,461 --> 02:28:50,271
trick.
Yeah,

3570
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:53,600
but we never used to eat it like that.
We didn't refine it to the level that we

3571
02:28:53,601 --> 02:28:55,910
do now.
Well,

3572
02:28:55,911 --> 02:28:56,900
it's still,
I mean,

3573
02:28:57,170 --> 02:28:58,003
you know what's interesting too,
is it sugar is yummy and ice cream is 

3574
02:29:01,071 --> 02:29:02,990
delicious,
but fruit,

3575
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:08,990
fruit is like one of the best tasting 
things you can get your hands on.

3576
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,943
Like if you have a nice ripe peach is 
one of the most fantastic things in so 

3577
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:17,420
underappreciated,
so underrated,

3578
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:18,853
you know,
like that is the way you're supposed to 

3579
02:29:20,601 --> 02:29:22,670
get your sugar.
It's really the only way.

3580
02:29:22,671 --> 02:29:23,504
Like if you really want sugar,
you're really supposed to eat like a 

3581
02:29:25,881 --> 02:29:27,080
fresh orange.
Right.

3582
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,183
And they taste amazing.
Like that should be our dessert every 

3583
02:29:30,861 --> 02:29:31,640
night.
You know?

3584
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:34,130
It's like,
it's just as good as chocolate cake.

3585
02:29:34,131 --> 02:29:36,710
It really is.
It's just you have it in your head.

3586
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:40,660
The chocolate cake is that dessert.
You know that frosting and look at it,

3587
02:29:40,661 --> 02:29:44,360
it's moist.
I love chocolate and I've started to eat

3588
02:29:44,361 --> 02:29:47,810
100% chocolate,
so no sugar added.

3589
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:48,973
But here's the funny thing,
the 100% chocolate that you've ever 

3590
02:29:51,171 --> 02:29:54,830
tasted or anyone else out there has ever
tasted is the baker's chocolate.

3591
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:58,340
It's the stuff that you get at the store
and it's made exclusively for baking.

3592
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:02,180
It's super bitter and harsh and nasty 
and burnt.

3593
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:05,630
And the reason I was talking to a 
chocolate maker,

3594
02:30:05,631 --> 02:30:08,360
this guy that owns a fruition chocolate 
out in New York,

3595
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:10,610
and he said,
well,

3596
02:30:10,611 --> 02:30:12,890
they just beat the hell out of it.
Like they overwrote it.

3597
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:15,200
They don't,
it's not for consumption like that.

3598
02:30:15,201 --> 02:30:19,340
So they don't care.
He makes a hundred percent chocolate bar

3599
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:21,350
that is actually palatable.
Like it's,

3600
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:22,550
it's,
it's a ship.

3601
02:30:22,810 --> 02:30:23,650
What's it do?
They ship,

3602
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,860
ship,
ship,

3603
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:26,450
what's the name of the company?
Fruition.

3604
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:29,990
Fruition.
And they make 100%,

3605
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:31,970
uh,
no sugar added chocolate bar.

3606
02:30:31,971 --> 02:30:33,230
And I do,
you know,

3607
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:35,180
like a little quarter piece of that.
And it's just,

3608
02:30:35,181 --> 02:30:36,950
you feel amazing.
Chocolate is a great,

3609
02:30:36,951 --> 02:30:38,900
it's a great little pick-me-up.
Has a little bit of caffeine in there as

3610
02:30:38,901 --> 02:30:39,471
well.
Well,

3611
02:30:39,471 --> 02:30:41,390
that's why it's bad for dogs.
Yes,

3612
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:42,010
yes,
it,

3613
02:30:42,010 --> 02:30:43,970
it,
I had to have my dog's stomach pumped.

3614
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:46,630
I'm dead serious.
It's horrible.

3615
02:30:46,631 --> 02:30:48,230
My,
my poor little labradoodle.

3616
02:30:48,231 --> 02:30:50,870
Let's gone through raccoon attack and 
everything else.

3617
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:53,000
We live of those.
Sweet,

3618
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:54,710
sweet.
Oh my God,

3619
02:30:54,711 --> 02:30:56,360
he's so friendly.
We left a,

3620
02:30:56,361 --> 02:30:59,030
I'm one of those uh,
chocolate bars,

3621
02:30:59,031 --> 02:31:03,020
the whole foods like dark chocolate,
like 80% and he just,

3622
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:05,600
we came home in the rappers like all 
over the floor and I'm like,

3623
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:07,580
oh my God.
It's like I called,

3624
02:31:07,581 --> 02:31:08,420
I called the vet,
they're like,

3625
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:09,254
bring him in right away.
Brought him down there two days in the 

3626
02:31:12,651 --> 02:31:14,800
hospital on Ivy.
Whoa.

3627
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:17,300
Like six times the lethal dose or 
something like that.

3628
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,770
I mean,
he's a small little labradoodle.

3629
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:21,263
And did they put charcoal in the stomach
and we had to give him charcoal 

3630
02:31:24,001 --> 02:31:26,700
afterwards.
Towels really brutal.

3631
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:29,100
Well apparently just jacks your little 
hearts.

3632
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:32,420
Like that's what kills him.
The little harder.

3633
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:34,140
Do seizures and they have all that.

3634
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:36,930
So it's really bad.
And chocolate chocolate.

3635
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:40,470
That's like the only saving grace of 
like a Hershey's or something.

3636
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:43,320
They're not really chocolate anymore.
They're like 2% or whatever.

3637
02:31:43,321 --> 02:31:47,250
You know when dogs,
when when I called they're like,

3638
02:31:47,251 --> 02:31:49,360
well what type of chocolate?
You know like,

3639
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:52,120
cause if it's like a Hershey's bar,
they didn't want me.

3640
02:31:52,150 --> 02:31:54,100
They're like,
oh he might throw up but be,

3641
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,190
well I don't know if it's Hershey's 
bars,

3642
02:31:56,191 --> 02:31:57,024
but you know what I mean.
Like the lesser like almost all sugar 

3643
02:31:58,831 --> 02:32:01,850
bars with milk don't have a ton of 
chocolate.

3644
02:32:01,870 --> 02:32:05,280
Not like an 80% dark,
organic,

3645
02:32:05,281 --> 02:32:08,040
free trade artists,
anal bar from whole foods.

3646
02:32:09,650 --> 02:32:11,790
It's a whole nother level that's,
that's a real chocolate.

3647
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:13,260
Yeah.
Yeah,

3648
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:14,340
that's,
that's,

3649
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:16,520
that's a good chocolate though.
I love those things.

3650
02:32:16,521 --> 02:32:18,050
A little cocoa nibs,
you know,

3651
02:32:18,051 --> 02:32:20,820
the little nibs.
Tasty.

3652
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,650
Yummy.
Yeah.

3653
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:25,110
I tried to,
I'm just trying to avoid everything.

3654
02:32:25,111 --> 02:32:26,190
Sweet.
Other than fruit.

3655
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:27,343
Yeah.
My,

3656
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:31,350
so you do fruit in Ketosis?
Well it will not be sharing out.

3657
02:32:31,710 --> 02:32:36,270
I'll do blueberries.
Mangos occasionally they knock you out,

3658
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:37,523
it'll definitely knock you out.
But it's not as bad as refined sugar 

3659
02:32:39,871 --> 02:32:40,430
though.
It's fruit,

3660
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:41,690
fruit toast versus secrets.
Right,

3661
02:32:41,691 --> 02:32:42,511
right.
But see,

3662
02:32:42,511 --> 02:32:46,500
I'm not necessarily a hundred percent 
concerned with getting knocked out.

3663
02:32:46,530 --> 02:32:47,363
My concern was like what is the,
what is the Diet that my body functions 

3664
02:32:51,301 --> 02:32:54,330
the best on?
How do I feel when I work out?

3665
02:32:54,510 --> 02:32:57,570
How do I feel?
Like just throughout the day and for me,

3666
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:59,460
no sugar.
That's the big one.

3667
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:01,050
Avoid all that.
No Pasta,

3668
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:04,120
no bread,
cut all that stuff out and uh,

3669
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:04,973
no rice.

3670
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:06,270
When I do this,
do that.

3671
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,450
I,
it doesn't seem to fuck with me too much

3672
02:33:09,451 --> 02:33:13,020
if I have like a pear or a little bit of
this,

3673
02:33:13,021 --> 02:33:14,580
a little bit in yogurt,
you know,

3674
02:33:14,581 --> 02:33:17,190
if you have like a large bowl of yogurt 
and blueberries,

3675
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,350
realistically you're getting too much 
sugar,

3676
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:21,360
you know,
but too much sugar for what it's not.

3677
02:33:21,361 --> 02:33:23,280
It doesn't fuck my body up.
Right.

3678
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:24,143
But it's gonna knock me out of Ketosis,
but then I take exogenous ketones and I 

3679
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:30,240
should do,
because I want to get knocked out.

3680
02:33:30,241 --> 02:33:33,390
I'm in a slump.
He just take exogenous ketones.

3681
02:33:34,190 --> 02:33:37,500
Casino has his own brand now,
if the kid can have staff and now he has

3682
02:33:37,501 --> 02:33:38,460
his own brand.
Oh,

3683
02:33:38,461 --> 02:33:39,271
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

3684
02:33:39,271 --> 02:33:41,160
Yeah.
Key Key technics.

3685
02:33:41,170 --> 02:33:42,870
It can,
I just bought it.

3686
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:44,700
I just had it delivered.
I haven't tried it yet,

3687
02:33:44,701 --> 02:33:47,610
but I've been doing Kido s which is 
another company,

3688
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:49,560
they need to come up with a seminar for 
these products.

3689
02:33:49,561 --> 02:33:51,750
Like everyone's like,
what's the key to Cana?

3690
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:52,770
I Dunno,
who cares?

3691
02:33:53,010 --> 02:33:55,110
I don't give a fuck with it.
Call it is poured in the water.

3692
02:33:55,111 --> 02:33:56,970
It's great,
but they taste good.

3693
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,270
Yeah,
we can't count as good.

3694
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:00,660
But I heard some of them are really jet 
fuel.

3695
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:01,494
He Nasty.

3696
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:04,730
Quito s is fine.
I mean it's not the best taste and stuff

3697
02:34:04,731 --> 02:34:06,900
in the world like Gatorade,
but it's not awful.

3698
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:07,763
Right.
It's fun.

3699
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:09,023
It's just like I said,
my main concern is predominantly making 

3700
02:34:12,511 --> 02:34:14,670
sure I'm eating healthy stuff.
Just making sure that I,

3701
02:34:15,090 --> 02:34:18,850
and then I also have to really vet out 
some of the information when it comes to

3702
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:21,480
increasing the Mitochondria in your 
body.

3703
02:34:21,481 --> 02:34:23,260
Like is that all real?
I don't know.

3704
02:34:23,261 --> 02:34:24,094
And I need to find the pros and cons are
the detractors of these ideas because 

3705
02:34:28,291 --> 02:34:29,790
there some of the things that system was
saying.

3706
02:34:29,791 --> 02:34:30,371
There was like,
Ooh,

3707
02:34:30,371 --> 02:34:32,080
I gotta,
I gotta look that up.

3708
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:33,850
And Kyle Kingsbury,
who,

3709
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:36,550
a friend of mine who's a former UFC 
fighter is a very,

3710
02:34:36,551 --> 02:34:40,660
very smart guy who was also been Quito 
for a couple of years now.

3711
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:43,210
I have a few friends that are athletes,
like real high level athletes.

3712
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:46,330
My friend Danny proper coast,
he's a former,

3713
02:34:46,331 --> 02:34:49,870
a Jujitsu world champion.
He's been ketogenic for the past year.

3714
02:34:49,871 --> 02:34:53,110
He's really dedicated and he takes that 
a Kito Kana stuff,

3715
02:34:53,950 --> 02:34:56,860
but he's just a hundred percent 
convinced that's the way it's the way to

3716
02:34:56,861 --> 02:34:58,420
go.
It's funny man.

3717
02:34:58,421 --> 02:35:01,780
How many people like fight like cats and
dogs about this online?

3718
02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:05,070
It's almost like a Mac versus pc thing,
you know,

3719
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:06,970
I think it comes down to like,
just how you,

3720
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,890
like you said,
how you personally feel on it.

3721
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:11,230
Like for me,
I was always having that,

3722
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,730
okay,
you know,

3723
02:35:12,731 --> 02:35:14,740
it's afternoon,
I'm in a slump.

3724
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:17,620
I'm mentally a little foggy.
Like,

3725
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:20,140
you know,
I attribute a lot of that too.

3726
02:35:20,170 --> 02:35:23,380
A lot of the refined carbs.
I was eating 100% and sugar.

3727
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:25,680
You get rid of that stuff,
uh,

3728
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:27,670
and you just,
you're just sharper,

3729
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:28,570
sharp.
It's like,

3730
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:29,403
you know,
like I said about the cold therapy and 

3731
02:35:30,251 --> 02:35:31,550
the mood,
the 20% boosts,

3732
02:35:31,551 --> 02:35:34,330
it's like a 20% boost in just mental 
clarity and sharpness.

3733
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,430
Yeah.
For my own personal experience,

3734
02:35:36,431 --> 02:35:39,190
my own experimentation,
that has been the biggest factor.

3735
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:40,840
The biggest factor has been cutting out 
sugar,

3736
02:35:41,050 --> 02:35:43,270
cutting out sugar,
cutting out refined carbs,

3737
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:47,320
all that had a massive positive benefit.
So then you know,

3738
02:35:47,321 --> 02:35:49,060
a little fruit in a lot of the,
I just don't,

3739
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:51,490
I think fruit is your advice though?
My Vice.

3740
02:35:51,491 --> 02:35:52,600
You have anything?
Like,

3741
02:35:52,601 --> 02:35:55,030
do you ever do pizza every once in a 
while?

3742
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:56,500
No.
I mean,

3743
02:35:56,501 --> 02:35:57,190
like I said,
oh,

3744
02:35:57,190 --> 02:36:02,190
I went a good solid 55 days strict until
I went to Mexico.

3745
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:05,440
And then when I went to Mexico I just 
had some tortillas.

3746
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:06,350
That was it.
Yeah.

3747
02:36:06,520 --> 02:36:09,250
But even then I chip seal bet.
But I tell you what,

3748
02:36:09,251 --> 02:36:10,480
man,
after I ate the Tortillas,

3749
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:12,070
I had some dessert there when I was 
there too.

3750
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:13,990
I felt like shit.
Yeah.

3751
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:16,630
Boy,
when you don't have it for,

3752
02:36:16,650 --> 02:36:17,483
you know,
almost two months and then you do have 

3753
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:18,910
it.

3754
02:36:18,910 --> 02:36:20,800
Like all my God,
it's like I ate a brick.

3755
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:21,693
Did you skyrocket out with like some kid
can I like to have when he was down 

3756
02:36:24,641 --> 02:36:27,700
there and bring any with me now I just 
roughed it.

3757
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:28,683
I just decided to look,
I'm going to be down here on vacation 

3758
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:33,250
with my family.
I'm just going to drink Margarita is and

3759
02:36:33,251 --> 02:36:35,130
go fishing and have a great time.
I'm like,

3760
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:35,973
I'm not giving a fuck about anything.
I and I needed like a mental break 

3761
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:41,410
because I do,
I have like three,

3762
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:46,440
essentially three occupations and um,
I managed them consecutively and it's,

3763
02:36:47,381 --> 02:36:50,050
they're all fun.
I enjoy them,

3764
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:55,320
but I think that just the sheer rpms 
that I'm operating at all the time needs

3765
02:36:56,290 --> 02:36:57,123
brakes on.
I'm learning as I get older to get 

3766
02:36:59,291 --> 02:37:02,110
better at just shutting all that shit 
down.

3767
02:37:02,111 --> 02:37:03,580
So I'm like,
I'm shutting everything down.

3768
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:06,220
Are you good at saying no,
I'm great at setting.

3769
02:37:06,221 --> 02:37:07,054
No,
that's good.

3770
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:07,893
I'm good at,
that's an piece of it is just saying no 

3771
02:37:09,101 --> 02:37:11,950
to a lot of things.
After the last like four years,

3772
02:37:11,951 --> 02:37:14,410
I've gotten better and better at it.
I'm really good at that.

3773
02:37:14,470 --> 02:37:16,760
I see,
I say no one to like really good stuff.

3774
02:37:17,450 --> 02:37:19,370
He knows it.
So why do you ever look on your calendar

3775
02:37:19,371 --> 02:37:20,270
and think like,
Oh God,

3776
02:37:20,271 --> 02:37:22,240
I committed to that thing and I'm not 
anymore.

3777
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:23,690
I did.
I used to.

3778
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:24,583
Yeah.
That was my entire career on fear 

3779
02:37:26,151 --> 02:37:27,410
factor.
It's like,

3780
02:37:27,411 --> 02:37:29,660
fuck,
how is this thing still on the air?

3781
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:31,130
Shit.
You know,

3782
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:32,930
how many years was that on the air for 
six years?

3783
02:37:32,931 --> 02:37:35,750
It's crazy.
148 episodes.

3784
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:38,940
And then we came back and did it again 
for six more episodes.

3785
02:37:39,690 --> 02:37:41,580
Um,
but yeah,

3786
02:37:41,581 --> 02:37:44,160
now I don't,
I do it less and less now.

3787
02:37:44,161 --> 02:37:45,480
Almost everything I do,
I really,

3788
02:37:45,481 --> 02:37:47,820
really enjoyed doing and that,
that helps.

3789
02:37:47,890 --> 02:37:50,730
That helps a lot if you can,
but it's hard.

3790
02:37:50,731 --> 02:37:51,770
It's hard,
you know,

3791
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:54,270
for a lot of folks,
that's not where their money is.

3792
02:37:54,271 --> 02:37:56,340
Their money comes from things that make 
them uncomfortable.

3793
02:37:56,370 --> 02:37:56,940
Yeah.
You know,

3794
02:37:56,940 --> 02:37:58,650
their money comes from things that they 
don't enjoy,

3795
02:37:58,660 --> 02:38:01,320
but they just happened to be good at it 
or understand really well.

3796
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:02,663
It's,
it's such a treat in such a huge 

3797
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:08,520
blessing in life,
although I hate that word blessing.

3798
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:09,683
But it's such a huge positive.
If you can find something you actually 

3799
02:38:13,801 --> 02:38:17,700
enjoy and that is actually how you make 
your living God so lucky.

3800
02:38:17,730 --> 02:38:22,730
So lucky to be able to do that because 
so few people have that where they can,

3801
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:26,130
the one thing that like they don't,
like today,

3802
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:29,190
like today,
my day was I worked out and I said,

3803
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:30,053
oh,
I'm going to go talk to Kevin Rose 

3804
02:38:30,571 --> 02:38:31,920
today.
This is going to be fucking awesome.

3805
02:38:31,950 --> 02:38:34,200
I'm psyched.
So that's my day,

3806
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:35,480
you know,
I mean,

3807
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,680
there's no negative to that,
you know,

3808
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:39,300
and then,
um,

3809
02:38:39,330 --> 02:38:40,163
you know,
go have dinner and it's like all normal 

3810
02:38:41,431 --> 02:38:42,890
stuff.
It's like it to,

3811
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:44,500
to have that as a job.
It's like,

3812
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:45,320
it's beautiful.

3813
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:46,400
Yeah,
I see that a lot.

3814
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:47,840
You know,
I spent the last,

3815
02:38:47,841 --> 02:38:48,621
uh,
gosh,

3816
02:38:48,621 --> 02:38:50,990
probably eight years doing technology 
investing,

3817
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:52,071
um,
you know,

3818
02:38:52,071 --> 02:38:54,920
at Google ventures and a in on my own.
And,

3819
02:38:54,950 --> 02:38:56,320
uh,
the people,

3820
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:57,163
the entrepreneurs that go after things 
that they're really personally 

3821
02:39:00,261 --> 02:39:01,094
passionate about,
they're the ones that actually win in 

3822
02:39:02,931 --> 02:39:06,530
the end because they just,
when they have those shitty days,

3823
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:08,120
it's not like,
ah,

3824
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:09,530
man,
I got to give up.

3825
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,393
It's,
it's their,

3826
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,160
it's their baby,
it's their life's work and they can push

3827
02:39:13,161 --> 02:39:14,510
through that.
And that's,

3828
02:39:14,511 --> 02:39:14,991
that's,
I,

3829
02:39:14,991 --> 02:39:16,070
I find that,
uh,

3830
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:16,730
that's,
that's,

3831
02:39:16,730 --> 02:39:17,563
those are the hard moments and only the 
moments that you can get through if 

3832
02:39:19,731 --> 02:39:22,580
you're truly passionate and into what 
you're,

3833
02:39:22,581 --> 02:39:23,500
what you're doing.
Well,

3834
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:24,800
I have a lot of varied interests,

3835
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:27,210
but I also have a lot of,
uh,

3836
02:39:27,250 --> 02:39:28,083
interest in other people's interests 
even if I'm not interested in their 

3837
02:39:30,911 --> 02:39:31,744
interests.
What I mean is like if I'm listening to 

3838
02:39:33,701 --> 02:39:35,470
a guy talk,
like say if he's like a,

3839
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:36,333
he makes custom kitchen knives like,
and he's just really into it and he 

3840
02:39:40,841 --> 02:39:41,700
talks to you about this

3841
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:42,853
of steel,
it he uses and how he prepares the same 

3842
02:39:44,481 --> 02:39:45,141
way.
I'm man,

3843
02:39:45,141 --> 02:39:45,974
man,
I'm in.

3844
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:46,813
My last podcast was interviewing the guy
to talk about the absolute best paper 

3845
02:39:50,301 --> 02:39:55,301
notebooks and we geeked out for like 45 
minutes on like stationary.

3846
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:58,030
What's the best?
The best is a couple.

3847
02:39:58,050 --> 02:39:58,883
Well,
domestically and fans most get it are 

3848
02:40:00,471 --> 02:40:02,210
the worst.
They're the worst.

3849
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:05,000
What's wrong with them?
You got to listen to my podcasts.

3850
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:06,133
I can't do this anymore.
Multiple world's filled with lies to 

3851
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:10,730
mole skin.
They source their paper from China.

3852
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:12,650
J A bad paper,
which I was bad.

3853
02:40:13,390 --> 02:40:15,390
The paper you write on it,
you could see what you wrote.

3854
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:18,060
Now he goes a lot deeper than that.
Anyway.

3855
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:19,210
Needless to say,
uh,

3856
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:21,760
two brands out of Japan are the best.
Okay.

3857
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,930
What are they a I'll forward you my,
my last,

3858
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:25,410

3859
02:40:25,470 --> 02:40:28,320
they're like mural stuff like that.

3860
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:30,890
Is there any one that I can bother me?

3863
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:37,860
let's see.
It was a,

3864
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:39,990

3865
02:40:40,010 --> 02:40:41,510

3870
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:53,250

It's all marketing.

3871
02:40:55,090 --> 02:40:57,390
It's paper.
It's paper and you're right on.

Rhodia is the one that one his best,
not domestic pick or not domestic,

3913
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:26,213

3914
02:42:28,471 --> 02:42:29,304
stationery shops.
You know what I like to those ones with 

3915
02:42:31,891 --> 02:42:35,700
the black and white speckled covers that
you buy at the supermarket?

3916
02:42:36,390 --> 02:42:36,961

3919
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:46,563
edge.

3920
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:49,680
What the fuck is those are those called 
composition books?

3921
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:51,250

3923
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:53,790
Those are okay.
I will.

3924
02:42:53,791 --> 02:42:56,190
It depends on whether you want,
the thing is at the end of the day,

3925
02:42:56,191 --> 02:42:57,070
none of it matters.

we're running on staples right now.

3927
02:42:58,621 --> 02:43:02,130
Who cares if you want them to stand the 
test of time,

3928
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:03,053
if you want them to be archival quality,
if you want them to work with fountain 

3929
02:43:05,461 --> 02:43:07,500
pens,
it's Super Geeky.

3930
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:10,110
I wasn't really into this town in Penn.
Lose my number.

3931
02:43:10,470 --> 02:43:11,303
I do not have fountain pen.

3932
02:43:13,781 --> 02:43:16,930

your desk,

3936
02:43:19,421 --> 02:43:22,990
I do not have a fountain path to go.
I'm taking a calligraphy class at five.

3937
02:43:25,330 --> 02:43:27,670
Yeah.
There's something about really nice pens

3938
02:43:27,671 --> 02:43:30,550
that is attractive.
You like to geek out and stuff.

3939
02:43:30,551 --> 02:43:32,050
You were saying that,
that's why I brought it.

3940
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:34,510
I'm only giving you a hard time.
I'm going to get 100% of the way.

3941
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:36,910
I mean,
I could totally geek out about paper.

3942
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:40,030
I Geek out about paper,

02:43:43,570 --> 02:43:44,390
My home.

3946
02:43:44,390 --> 02:43:45,223
Pour-Over ports or pour over like where 
you grind your own beans and you pour 

3947
02:43:48,221 --> 02:43:50,150
water on top of it.
It's always okay.

3948
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:51,273
Yeah.
I don't know which means you have like 

3949
02:43:52,001 --> 02:43:55,720

like a Chemex or no,

3950
02:43:55,870 --> 02:43:58,000
I use a French press.
Okay.

3951
02:43:58,001 --> 02:43:59,560
Let's find too,
it's okay.

3952
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:00,910
I mean it's,

3953
02:44:00,911 --> 02:44:02,470

It works great.

3954
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:04,930
I'm just kidding.

02:44:39,451 --> 02:44:42,010
it to New Mexico process it,
very small company.

3970
02:44:42,011 --> 02:44:42,844
All these are made in Colombia.
All this stuff here is probably made in 

3971
02:44:45,001 --> 02:44:46,920
New Mexico.
It's beautiful stuff.

3972
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:47,800
It's awesome.
Well,

3973
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:51,230
caveman coffees.
It's a buddy of mine's company and it's,

3974
02:44:51,630 --> 02:44:54,920
it's his passion.
My friend Tate and um,

3975
02:44:55,410 --> 02:44:57,590
uh,
Keith Jardeen and Lacey Mackey,

3976
02:44:57,640 --> 02:45:00,210
the other two people that are involved 
in the company and they just,

3977
02:45:00,570 --> 02:45:02,970
it's a single origin,
single family,

3978
02:45:02,971 --> 02:45:03,804
single source company where they know 
the people that are grown in this 

3979
02:45:06,811 --> 02:45:08,790
coffee.
They go to visits also in Columbia.

3980
02:45:08,791 --> 02:45:11,740
It's like you're getting it from the 
source and when you open up the

3981
02:45:11,740 --> 02:45:12,573
bag heaven,
the aroma of freshly roasted coffee and 

3982
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:20,860
it's got a roasted date on it,
you know,

3983
02:45:20,861 --> 02:45:23,410
they'll let you know when it was,
when it was picked,

3984
02:45:23,411 --> 02:45:25,900
when it was roasted.
Fantastic stuff.

3985
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:30,930
There's a great coffee shop that I've 
been to in Tokyo and it is this guy,

3986
02:45:32,110 --> 02:45:32,930
he's,
he's like a,

3987
02:45:32,930 --> 02:45:35,830
I call him like the Gyro of Coffee 
Nocero this Sushi guy.

3988
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:39,370
So he does something,
he ferments his coffee beans.

3989
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:43,600
So he ferments them for I think three or
four months.

3990
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:46,720
So they're not fresh and they're really 
pungent and oily.

3991
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:52,170
And then he does a 20 minute like water 
pour over in front of you 20 minutes.

3992
02:45:53,501 --> 02:45:54,334
So they don't speak English.
You walk in there and all you can say 

3993
02:45:56,681 --> 02:45:58,510
the hill,
understand his old beans.

3994
02:45:58,900 --> 02:45:59,733
And then he literally sits there for 20 
minutes and does the slowest drip 

3995
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:04,990
pour-over you've ever seen in your 
entire life.

3996
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:08,020
And then it's done and he serves it to 
you with like two hands.

3997
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:10,070
Super a baby.
Like

3998
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:11,900
it's a baby.
Wow.

3999
02:46:11,901 --> 02:46:13,580
He presented with the baby.
And how was it?

4000
02:46:13,581 --> 02:46:15,440
Phenomenal.
It's really good.

4001
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:17,890
Did you pour sugar and cream courses?
Slaughter.

4002
02:46:17,940 --> 02:46:22,940
Did I put my ketones in there?
Well this is ketones.

4003
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,131
No,
I know.

4004
02:46:25,131 --> 02:46:28,330
I just,
kido cream stuff is so sugar email.

4005
02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:30,740
Well it just,
it's got Stevia.

4006
02:46:30,741 --> 02:46:32,600
They wasn't be on the show.
I know,

4007
02:46:32,601 --> 02:46:37,601
but only has four grams of sugar per 
share was like for me it was so sweet.

4008
02:46:37,611 --> 02:46:39,920
When you don't have sugar for or sweets 
for a long time,

4009
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:41,113
it just like really hits Ya.
Well I bought this stuff and I've never 

4010
02:46:43,341 --> 02:46:44,570
used it.
It's one I was saying.

4011
02:46:44,571 --> 02:46:46,910
So I would say Jamie,
one day I'm going to use that and then I

4012
02:46:46,911 --> 02:46:49,400
don't fucking,
I just keep drinking this butter coffee.

4013
02:46:49,890 --> 02:46:51,770
Um,
have you ever had copied the walk?

4014
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:53,200
No.
You don't know what that is?

4015
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:54,770
Oh wait.
Yeah.

4016
02:46:54,771 --> 02:46:59,771
That's the stuff that shit's gay.
I've had actually like really?

4017
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:01,130
Yeah,
that was really good.

4018
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:03,740
I heard you're begin to bulletproof 
coffee.

4019
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:05,270
Well that's what this is.
No,

4020
02:47:05,271 --> 02:47:06,530
but the,
the brand bulletproof.

4021
02:47:06,531 --> 02:47:07,041
No,
no,

4022
02:47:07,041 --> 02:47:11,360
I'm just kidding.
Well that turned out to be kind of,

4023
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:14,450
unfortunately,
that's name is a great name.

4024
02:47:14,890 --> 02:47:18,680
And Yell or Mark Formula,
which was created by Robb Wolf.

4025
02:47:18,681 --> 02:47:19,514
Really,
by the way,

4026
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:21,013
I didn't know that.
Rob Wolfe wrote about putting grass fed 

4027
02:47:23,961 --> 02:47:28,700
butter and mct oil and coffee in like 
2004 or something like that.

4028
02:47:28,710 --> 02:47:31,460
Easy.
He wrote about and published it and well

4029
02:47:31,461 --> 02:47:32,294
that's that guy's ideas.
They're not all bad and some of them 

4030
02:47:35,931 --> 02:47:37,700
aren't bad at all,
but the pride,

4031
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:39,710
one of the things that Rhonda Patrick 
had a correct does.

4032
02:47:39,711 --> 02:47:40,544
He gets things wrong about the science 
behind things because he's sort of 

4033
02:47:42,351 --> 02:47:43,184
reciting other people's work.
It's not actually doing work and he's 

4034
02:47:45,861 --> 02:47:48,530
not really a scientist when it comes to 
that stuff.

4035
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:53,090
He's just a collector of ideas and then 
redistributes them and puts that word on

4036
02:47:53,091 --> 02:47:53,924
them,
which is fine as long as you actually 

4037
02:47:55,491 --> 02:47:56,324
hire a scientist like you know,
double and triple check everything 

4038
02:47:58,701 --> 02:48:02,000
you're doing well.
The motors is a brilliant marketer.

4039
02:48:02,230 --> 02:48:03,063
Yeah.
The motivation was very deceptive 

4040
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:07,033
because is motivated.
He was trying to sell everybody on this 

4041
02:48:08,391 --> 02:48:09,224
idea of mycotoxins and coffee's coming 
here to band is completely abandoned 

4042
02:48:12,741 --> 02:48:13,430
that.
Okay.

4043
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:16,130
That was the one reason why you're 
supposed to buy his coffee as opposed to

4044
02:48:16,131 --> 02:48:18,680
anybody else's.
Completely unsubstantiated.

4045
02:48:18,681 --> 02:48:19,514
And then we spend a shit load of money 
trying to find out whether or not that 

4046
02:48:22,401 --> 02:48:25,400
was true cause it's expensive to test 
coffee for mycotoxins.

4047
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:27,810
We tested all this different coffee,
random coffee,

4048
02:48:27,811 --> 02:48:28,700
you whole foods,
coffee,

4049
02:48:28,701 --> 02:48:29,511
starbucks,
coffee,

4050
02:48:29,511 --> 02:48:30,021
coffee,
bean,

4051
02:48:30,021 --> 02:48:31,760
coffee,
nothing,

4052
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:33,013
nothing.
And then the more I talked to actual 

4053
02:48:34,041 --> 02:48:35,990
coffee experts,
the more they're like no,

4054
02:48:35,991 --> 02:48:36,824
they figured out how to stop that in the
80s it's the difference between the 

4055
02:48:39,381 --> 02:48:42,230
climate in Ethiopia,
which is an incredibly dry climate,

4056
02:48:42,231 --> 02:48:43,820
which is where all coffee comes from.

4057
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:45,710
And this is another thing that we found 
out from Peter Juliano.

4058
02:48:46,310 --> 02:48:48,890
All coffee came from Ethiopia,
all of it.

4059
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:49,873
And then they started growing it.
And these other climates we can South 

4060
02:48:51,411 --> 02:48:52,244
America.
When you think of Colombia and Juan 

4061
02:48:54,380 --> 02:48:56,330
Valdez and the coffee,
well that coffee,

4062
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:59,150
the problem with that is that that's a 
moist environment.

4063
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:01,380
It's a moist green,
lush environment,

4064
02:49:01,381 --> 02:49:02,214
not dry like Ethiopia.
So they would try to use this same 

4065
02:49:04,490 --> 02:49:08,670
drawing methods and it didn't work cause
he's beans would get moldy and then they

4066
02:49:08,671 --> 02:49:10,890
would develop these molds,
toxins.

4067
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:11,783
And so that became an issue.
But then they figured out a way to wet 

4068
02:49:14,431 --> 02:49:15,264
process.
So the wet processing became the 

4069
02:49:17,161 --> 02:49:19,640
solution for dealing with,
um,

4070
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:20,670
the,
the mold issue.

4071
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:22,013
They solve that a long fucking time ago.
So some of the single origins that you 

4072
02:49:25,201 --> 02:49:27,630
can buy it,
some of the fancier places,

4073
02:49:27,710 --> 02:49:29,520
uh,
are still dry process.

4074
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:32,190
I wonder if those with eop coffees.
Yeah.

4075
02:49:32,191 --> 02:49:34,740
Ethan Coke,
Ethiopian coffees are still very,

4076
02:49:34,741 --> 02:49:37,020
very popular and really delicious.
It's one of,

4077
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:40,620
I think Juliano brought us in was your 
guest chef.

4078
02:49:40,650 --> 02:49:41,483
How do you say it?
What does this stuff either Ethiopian 

4079
02:49:44,461 --> 02:49:45,210
coffee,
your,

4080
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:46,043
your chest.

4081
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:48,150
Okay.

4082
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:50,070
We're not gonna get it right.
I know which of the two of us,

4083
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:54,240
but it was like a,
almost a sweet,

4084
02:49:54,820 --> 02:49:56,430
not sweet,
but a lemony.

4085
02:49:56,490 --> 02:49:57,320
Yeah,
I've had a,

4086
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:58,230
Oh,
it's amazing.

4087
02:49:58,260 --> 02:49:59,520
Amazing.
Really,

4088
02:49:59,521 --> 02:50:01,200
really interesting stuff.
Do you have,

4089
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:02,530
we have some.
We might.

4090
02:50:03,150 --> 02:50:04,710
Um,
but the,

4091
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:07,890
the variables and the variations and 
flavors,

4092
02:50:07,891 --> 02:50:08,724
I think it's really interesting how some
flavors it just have like who is like 

4093
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:14,120
bold,
almost like,

4094
02:50:14,490 --> 02:50:15,323
like dark taste to them and other ones 
like almost like you're drinking 

4095
02:50:17,761 --> 02:50:20,430
flowers.
What are you drinking these days to you?

4096
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:24,570
Do you go and buy a certain brand or a 
caveman signs is different stuff all the

4097
02:50:24,571 --> 02:50:25,870
time.
But uh,

4098
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:27,660
cause it's my friend's company and I,
and,

4099
02:50:27,661 --> 02:50:32,430
and I know,
I know how ethical they are and how they

4100
02:50:32,431 --> 02:50:33,264
source it and how they have this great 
relationship with this farm in Columbia 

4101
02:50:36,991 --> 02:50:38,640
and it's all like direct relationship.

4102
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:39,473
It's like it's,
to me it's the easiest way to deal with 

4103
02:50:41,281 --> 02:50:42,011
it.
You know,

4104
02:50:42,011 --> 02:50:42,900
like,
and they have,

4105
02:50:42,901 --> 02:50:45,090
if you go to their website,
they explain how they do everything.

4106
02:50:45,290 --> 02:50:46,320
It's,
it's just awesome.

4107
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:48,390
It's just the cleanest way to go about 
it.

4108
02:50:48,570 --> 02:50:51,780
And they also have this nitro,
this nitrogenated coffee.

4109
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:54,240
You ever heard of that at stumptown has 
a cold night.

4110
02:50:54,241 --> 02:50:55,440
Tro.
Do you want to freak out?

4111
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:56,730
I want to figure out right now.
You want to get,

4112
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:58,340
feel like you want to run through a 
fucking wall.

4113
02:50:58,350 --> 02:51:00,380
Give you one,
270 milligrams.

4114
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:01,290
Caffeine.
Yeah.

4115
02:51:01,410 --> 02:51:03,420
Do we have any handy to have like a,
just a little taste or dot.

4116
02:51:03,480 --> 02:51:04,313
Drink.
A whole gallon.

4117
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:05,040
Yeah,
man.

4118
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:05,873
Bring you can do,
you can waste some of it if somebody's 

4119
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:08,333
been coughing a lot more.
You're already getting out a couple of 

4120
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:14,070
the groups I've been drinking this the 
entire show.

4121
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:14,993
Yeah.
We try to come up with a new name for 

4122
02:51:15,721 --> 02:51:15,961
it.
Oh,

4123
02:51:15,961 --> 02:51:19,770
sorry.
His name then what do you call it?

4124
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:22,230
It's called butter coffee,
but it's what it is.

4125
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:25,170
It's coffee with butter in it.
Caveman nitro.

4126
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:28,650
It's just too bad that the guy's a dork.
No offense.

4127
02:51:28,710 --> 02:51:31,470
I should've done that in front of the 
mic or you could hear it.

4128
02:51:36,470 --> 02:51:38,680
But a lot of his products,
a lot of those bulletproof products,

4129
02:51:38,681 --> 02:51:39,830
it's still,
it's really mild.

4130
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:41,970
They're still very good products like,
uh,

4131
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:42,720
his,
uh,

4132
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:44,750
grass fed whey and a lot of his other 
stuff.

4133
02:51:44,870 --> 02:51:47,750
Nothing wrong with it.
That's great coffee.

4134
02:51:48,050 --> 02:51:48,620
That's great.
Right?

4135
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:49,453
Yeah.
270 milligrams of caffeine in this 

4136
02:51:51,261 --> 02:51:52,670
little tiny flank.
Ooh,

4137
02:51:52,730 --> 02:51:54,200
good Lord.
That's a lot.

4138
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:56,290
A lot.
Normal Cup is like what?

4139
02:51:56,300 --> 02:51:58,070
One 30?
Um,

4140
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:58,881
something like that.
Yeah.

4141
02:51:58,881 --> 02:52:01,970
I think a Venti starbucks is 200.
I think that's what we established.

4142
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:04,390
This is,
I feel

4143
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,740
so we're winding this bitch up.
It's about to end.

4144
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:11,050
All right.
Anything to say before we go?

4145
02:52:11,051 --> 02:52:11,884
This is a lot of fun.
Yeah.

4146
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:12,880
Thanks for having me.
Enjoy it.

4147
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:14,380
Yeah.
If you're ever in town,

4148
02:52:14,381 --> 02:52:15,330
man,
open invitation.

4149
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:16,380
Appreciate it again.
I,

4150
02:52:16,381 --> 02:52:16,931
it's,
I'm a,

4151
02:52:16,931 --> 02:52:18,950
I'm a fan watching your show.
Thank you.

4152
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:19,923
And uh,
it's cool to actually be here cause he 

4153
02:52:21,401 --> 02:52:23,810
normally see this stuff on video.
It's a weird,

4154
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:25,800
since the space,
you guys have a physically here.

4155
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:26,501
No,
I like it.

4156
02:52:26,501 --> 02:52:27,610
It's,
it's got a good vibe to it.

4157
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:32,110
We've been here for a few years now.
I got to eventually buy a place and move

4158
02:52:32,111 --> 02:52:34,810
into it and try to recreate this or new,
something new,

4159
02:52:34,811 --> 02:52:35,644
I think.
Maybe,

4160
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:37,053
but this is,
this has got little Buddhas over the 

4161
02:52:39,821 --> 02:52:41,350
place.
Too many Tupac.

4162
02:52:41,351 --> 02:52:43,110
It's great.
CONOR MCGREGOR,

4163
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:45,490
awesome.
Many conor mcgregor.

4164
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:46,900
Many Tupac.
Yeah,

4165
02:52:47,470 --> 02:52:48,303
it's a good spot.

4166
02:52:48,730 --> 02:52:50,650
I'm enjoying it here.
Um,

4167
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:52,570
you're not going to do your podcast 
anymore.

4168
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:53,630
You ever going to bring that back?
No.

4169
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:55,960
Dig Nation is going to,
you know,

4170
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:59,830
the fans want us to bring it back.
We had a lot of fun doing it the day.

4171
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:01,203
Uh,
but I think that we'll get together at 

4172
02:53:02,441 --> 02:53:04,930
some point and do it.
I see Alex lives here in La.

4173
02:53:04,931 --> 02:53:05,764
I see him every few months and it's just
a matter of trying to find a venue and 

4174
02:53:09,671 --> 02:53:11,230
we want to do a live show if we're going
to do it.

4175
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:12,730
Oh,
in front of an audience.

4176
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:16,960
We see really crazy like 4,000
person live shows kind of nuts.

4177
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:18,700
Why would you want to stop that?
Uh,

4178
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:19,623
you know we did for so many years in our
show involves a lot of drinking and so 

4179
02:53:22,601 --> 02:53:25,210
we were just like,
I killed my liver.

4180
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:27,490
It was just like,
do you have to do drinking?

4181
02:53:28,270 --> 02:53:30,040
Why?
Cause that's kind of the show.

4182
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:30,903
The show is two guys sitting on the 
couch getting hammered talking about 

4183
02:53:33,071 --> 02:53:35,530
dumb tech stories.
And it was just like,

4184
02:53:35,531 --> 02:53:38,430
it was our thing for so many years.
Um,

4185
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:41,020
replace it with pot.
Uh,

4186
02:53:41,021 --> 02:53:43,810
I don't know.
I think we'd just be too dumb.

4187
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:44,873
I just,
I don't love that you think would get 

4188
02:53:45,461 --> 02:53:46,480
done.
You know what,

4189
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:47,373
bring this note,
the Nitro does kate upper take Prasad 

4190
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:56,110
Totem Alpha brain neuro ones than that 
from you before I let you get some.

4191
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:57,640
Awesome.
Do we have any here?

4192
02:53:57,870 --> 02:53:58,990
Well,
I'll get you some either way.

4193
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:00,160
Um,
figure out a way.

4194
02:54:00,340 --> 02:54:01,810
But yeah,
I'm doing the journal,

4195
02:54:01,900 --> 02:54:04,120
a newsletter,
a the journal.email

4196
02:54:04,121 --> 02:54:04,954
if you want to send up there.
And there's a podcast that goes along 

4197
02:54:06,011 --> 02:54:07,390
with that.
Um,

4198
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:09,860
and it's the most random weird guests on
it.

4199
02:54:09,861 --> 02:54:12,130
It's not,
there's no theme every month.

4200
02:54:12,130 --> 02:54:12,963
It's just something different.
Like who did notebooks and then Rhonda 

4201
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:17,380
Patrick that month before nine.
So it's like,

4202
02:54:17,381 --> 02:54:19,270
um,
I'll probably have tim on at some point.

4203
02:54:19,271 --> 02:54:23,150
If you're ever in New York,
I'll have you on something fun to do.

4204
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:24,070
Okay,
awesome.

4205
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:25,360
Cool.
Well thanks Kevin.

4206
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:26,470
Appreciate it man.
It's a lot of fun.

4207
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:27,610
Good to be on the show.
Thank you.

4208
02:54:27,670 --> 02:54:28,360
All right,
folks.

4209
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:32,410
We'll be back on Thursday with Rick 
Doblin,

4210
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:34,660
uh,
the director of maps,

4211
02:54:34,661 --> 02:54:38,260
multidisciplinary,
something,

4212
02:54:38,290 --> 02:54:42,040
psychedelic studies.
He's a drunk guy,

4213
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:44,353
an awesome drug guy,
a guy who's trying to promote the 

4214
02:54:46,631 --> 02:54:49,750
legalizing,
very beneficial psychedelic compounds.

4215
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:51,020
All right.
We'll be back soon.

4216
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:51,790
See you much.
Love.

4217
02:54:51,790 --> 02:54:52,623
Bye.
Bye.

4218
02:54:56,570 --> 02:54:57,403
Yeah,
thank you.

4219
02:55:08,170 --> 02:55:09,003
Yeah.
