1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,460
I've been watching some pro wrestling.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,260
Totally predicted what was going to
happen with this John [inaudible] Brock

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,510
Lesnar.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:11,940
Oh yeah.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,700
You knew the thing out about it.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,630
Bronc Lesnar,

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,520
you played it out long
in advance perfectly.

9
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:20,130
You knew exactly how it
was going to go down.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,310
And you're saying that it sets
up something in the future?

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,851
Oh yeah,

12
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,241
absolutely.

13
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,040
They offered me a full time writing job.

14
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,990
I can talk about it now
cause I'm not getting it.

15
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:28,741
I'm not doing it.

16
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:33,180
But a couple months ago they offered
me a full time job to move to Stamford,

17
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:33,810
Connecticut.

18
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,021
Yeah.

19
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,040
After one meeting,

20
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,240
a meeting like this,

21
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,100
that was about an hour and
a half at the end they go,

22
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,990
how would you feel about
moving to Stamford,

23
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,991
Connecticut for one year job with the
WWE writing hung the creative side.

24
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:45,900
And I go,

25
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,250
I'm going to have to think about that.

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,473
And uh,

27
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,050
it didn't pan out because I
didn't want to move to Stanford,

28
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,060
Connecticut and working nine to five,

29
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,820
even though it's really
good money and everything.

30
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,770
But you would have to go to,

31
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,670
you drive to a la or drive to
New York rather still do spots,

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,460
which turns out it's
just a 45 minute drive.

33
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,294
But,

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,610
but the job is very grueling.

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
The WWE thing,

36
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,430
it's not a,

37
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,080
it's not like TV comedy writing job.

38
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:13,890
It's like a,

39
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,670
I'd have to answer to
Vince Mcmahon like Tony,

40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,590
would you do get stoned
before writing this ideal?

41
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,661
Do you think that's what it was?

42
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,010
Or probably what would you say to him?

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,191
Well,

44
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,024
if you want to say,

45
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,490
I say yeah and I was still,

46
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,680
when I wrote all the great
ideas that you like sir.

47
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,110
Well you have a point.

48
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,921
I think Vince,

49
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,030
we tried to get you on steroids.

50
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,770
Um,

51
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,781
he'd probably get,

52
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:35,860
yeah,

53
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,880
we tried to get me to eat.

54
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:39,700
Be every chance he gets.

55
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,920
He brought it from my ranch.

56
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,590
Shot this myself this morning.

57
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,710
Yeah.

58
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,820
Well was it good money?

59
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,750
Like serious money.

60
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,190
Super serious money.

61
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:50,880
Wow.

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,410
Sanely serious money.

63
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,253
You came close.

64
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,900
I was happy to get the offer.

65
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,390
I took it as a victory
and I love what I do.

66
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,680
I love what I'm doing.

67
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,670
And it might be crazy.

68
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,780
I'll never regret it.

69
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,590
You know what I mean?

70
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,820
I think you regret it right now.

71
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:03,631
I'm looking into your eyes.

72
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:04,170
So yeah.

73
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,590
No,

74
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,060
it's kind of a dream job for you.

75
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,511
Yeah,

76
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,321
sort of.

77
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,071
But then again,

78
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,470
what I do is sort of a dream job too,

79
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:13,620
and giving up this dream job for
that dream job would be crazy.

80
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,060
You wouldn't have to
give up this dream job.

81
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
I'm telling you,

82
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,820
it's a grueling,

83
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:18,780
creepy job,

84
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:19,531
unfortunately.

85
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,041
Trust me,

86
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,671
if it was,

87
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:20,771
if,

88
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:23,610
if the word on the streets
was man writing for the WWE,

89
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,271
it's the coolest.

90
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:24,960
You can do anything.

91
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,450
I would have taken it and I would have
lived in New York and it would have been

92
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:27,871
amazing.

93
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,280
I would have traveled to Stanford 45
minutes every morning on a subway and

94
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,840
steadily Dunnigan Stanford.

95
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,201
Yeah.

96
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,190
It would have been amazing.

97
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,300
And I would have had any,

98
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,110
I could have.

99
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,070
It was stupid.

100
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:38,720
The amount of money.

101
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,170
You don't want to live in Stanford.

102
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,730
You know what the problem
with Connecticut is?

103
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,070
It's not really a state is a state.

104
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,210
But let's be honest,

105
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,044
ladies and gentlemen,

106
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,350
you,

107
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,600
you live in a highway
between Boston and New York.

108
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,050
Yeah,

109
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,010
absolutely.

110
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,160
It's like they put some houses on the
side of the highway and they call it a

111
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,850
town,

112
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,010
but that's what's really going on.

113
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,601
There's nothing,

114
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,510
nothing's being done there
and nuns be made there.

115
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,141
What do you got?

116
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,980
You've got the Glenn Beck and the WWE.

117
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,470
That's your entire state economy.

118
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,080
Yeah,

119
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,411
of course.

120
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,940
There's some other things
I'm just fucking around.

121
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,803
Don't get,

122
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,710
don't get all fucking,

123
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,320
I'll stanfordy on me.

124
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,770
Don't get all attached
and proud of Connecticut,

125
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,700
Connecticut pride.

126
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,620
We got a fucking email.

127
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,270
Joe Connecticut Pride.

128
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Connecticut sucks.

129
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,011
You know,

130
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,270
it sucks and I know it sucks.

131
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,790
There's some great houses there.

132
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,850
Some nice neighborhoods,

133
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,810
crazy neighbor.

134
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,100
I have my friend Tommy Junior,

135
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,630
one of my best friends
lives in Connecticut.

136
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,590
He tells me it sucks.

137
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,424
I trust him.

138
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,283
It's not a good spot.

139
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,110
When I used to drive there
from Boston to New York,

140
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,580
I would always think like,

141
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,020
why is,

142
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,110
why aren't people stop in here?

143
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,353
Yeah,

144
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
WWE.

145
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,171
But a lot of people,

146
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:43,171
like David Letterman lived in Connecticut
and drove into the city to do a show.

147
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,643
That's how he did it.

148
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,131
Yeah.

149
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,450
But he's like reclusive,

150
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:47,110
you know?

151
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,943
Hmm.

152
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,790
He likes being,

153
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,710
he needs to be away from everybody.

154
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,780
He's weird like that.

155
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,673
And you're not.

156
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,820
You missed her outgoing and that
city partying it up at night,

157
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,620
doing a little blow in the morning,

158
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,170
pep you up right before class.

159
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,211
Uh,

160
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,841
for sure.

161
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,490
You know me show up on the campus.

162
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,730
Give Vince the paperwork that
you wrote on the plane over there

163
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,450
toady.

164
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,790
This storyline makes zero sense.

165
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,630
What kind of story
lines where you plan it?

166
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:13,930
Did you,

167
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,710
I know you did.

168
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,610
I know you thought about it.

169
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,450
Absolutely.

170
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,480
Absolutely.

171
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,050
I wrote a,

172
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,570
I wrote a great storyline where,

173
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,841
you know,

174
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,730
Brock Lesnar and a,

175
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,020
in this past Wrestlemania,

176
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,940
he'd beat the undertaker.

177
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,940
The undertaker's had a
streak at Wrestlemania.

178
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,070
He never loses at Wrestlemania.

179
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:35,000
He was 21 and zero all time
at Wrestlemania 21 years.

180
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,820
He had never lost in this
match against Brock Lesnar.

181
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,841
It's sort of,

182
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:42,860
it was sort of set up so everybody just
assumed the undertaker would win and

183
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,450
then in a stunning move,

184
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,591
Brock,

185
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:49,170
towards the end of it ends up beating
the undertaker for the three counts.

186
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,330
You want to see something funny?

187
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:50,901
Look that up.

188
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:52,820
Reaction shots of the audience.

189
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:53,570
Don't do that.

190
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay,

191
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,540
but this audience was stunned to people.

192
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,051
Just so I know.

193
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,490
What else jogs drawn that audience.

194
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,260
A fucking simple card trick.

195
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:00,831
Oh,

196
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:01,401
come on.

197
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,420
What are you talking about?

198
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,350
Listen to code road.

199
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,620
Silly Shit.

200
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,731
Okay.

201
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,870
It's all planned out.

202
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,800
It's obvious.

203
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,090
It's not obvious.

204
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,501
It's definitely not.

205
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:13,370
If it's planned out,

206
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,230
why would it be obvious going to happen?

207
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,010
I know what's going to happen.

208
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,630
That's,

209
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,140
you know,

210
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,973
that's not the,

211
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,020
that's not the arena's.

212
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,300
Not everybody in the arena
was offered a full time,

213
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,950
one year writing job with the,

214
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,270
they don't know what's going to happen.

215
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,600
You're an expert in pro
wrestling essentially.

216
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,391
I've watched my whole,

217
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,360
it was sorta like my replacement for
not having a dad when I was a kid.

218
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:32,511
Like,

219
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,130
I would just sit there and watch these,

220
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,390
these storylines and these
guys do all this crazy stuff.

221
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,293
Well,

222
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,690
it was my dad replaced

223
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,660
superfly snuck.

224
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,400
Was Your Dad pretty much?

225
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,260
Super Fly was one of the biggest things.

226
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:48,501
I mean,

227
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:52,010
that's what I was doing off of couches
and my tidy whities when I was a tiny

228
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:52,700
little boy,

229
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,540
Bob Backlund.

230
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,970
I remember Bob Backlund,

231
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,900
the creator of the
cross face chicken wing,

232
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,360
which is a great move,

233
00:05:59,361 --> 00:05:59,631
man.

234
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,650
Much fucking time.

235
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,461
You invest in this.

236
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,660
You should get paid by this.

237
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,590
Seriously considered seriously
consider taking that job.

238
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,701
Uh,

239
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,210
no.

240
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,220
I would say no to anybody else,

241
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,353
but you,

242
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,830
you like that shit so much.

243
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,660
You've always got those fucking books.

244
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,950
He read books on the
business of pro wrestling.

245
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,770
We're on a fucking plane and I look over,

246
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,710
there's people reading
his self help books.

247
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,630
Some folks are reading novels.

248
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,930
Tony H is going to fucking book the
sex and politics lies in headlocks the

249
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,140
unauthorized bio of Vince Mcmahon.

250
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,360
What the fuck are you doing?

251
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,420
Reading awesomeness about a guy who
took a joke of a show and turn it into a

252
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,040
billion dollar enterprise and wrote
it all himself and is the main,

253
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,660
you should read her book on pro wrestling.

254
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,350
Dude,

255
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,183
you should write a book,

256
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,180
a love affair,

257
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,383
pro wrestling.

258
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,390
I love affair from Tony Hinchcliffe.

259
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,890
I was listening to,

260
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,724
um,

261
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,130
to watch the opening Anthony Show,

262
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,780
which is no longer the opn Anthony show.

263
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,540
Now it's a ob with Jimmy Norton.

264
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,050
I Dunno,

265
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,850
why don't they just call
it the opion Jimmy show,

266
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,684
but whatever.

267
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,793
Um,

268
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,200
they had this guy on and uh,

269
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,100
he's an author.

270
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,730
He's,

271
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,180
he wrote that card
movie with Kevin Spacey.

272
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,800
He's written a bunch of 'em,

273
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,120
a bunch of different,

274
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:20,954
uh,

275
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:21,770
uh,

276
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,131
books.

277
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,400
His name is Ben Massell,

278
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,850
rich man's rich.

279
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,260
And he was talking about Russian
oligarchy and about what happened,

280
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:35,261
what went down and Russia during like the
fall of the Soviet Union were seven to

281
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,510
nine people,

282
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,790
but soaked up 50% of
the economy of Russia.

283
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,043
Yeah.

284
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,940
Seven,

285
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,690
seven or nine,

286
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,770
somewhere in that number.

287
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:48,980
Like,

288
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,420
no more than 10 people literally
had 50% of the Russian economy.

289
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,770
And they were just killing each other.

290
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,950
They would like kill each other
and take over their businesses.

291
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,090
Like if you had a competitor,

292
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,020
if like you were coke,

293
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,530
you would send your army over to kill
Pepsi and then you would just own Pepsi to

294
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,020
wow.

295
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,450
It's,

296
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,580
it was the total complete wild,

297
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,121
wild west.

298
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,540
And I don't know if he's written a book
on this or he's gonna write a book on

299
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
this,

300
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,750
but fucking a man listen to that shit.

301
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,080
Whiskey.

302
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,380
I bet he has written a book on it.

303
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:21,381
I should find out what the book is been
as rich Ben Mezrich I wonder what the

304
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:27,551
direction of the economy and the
trends and everything were before that

305
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,230
exclusive group of people took that over.

306
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,220
Cause it's,

307
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,461
you know,

308
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,830
it seems like we're sort of in a way,

309
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:36,320
heading that direction with our stuff.

310
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,320
The top whatever percent has such a crazy
amount of money compared to the rest

311
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,430
of everybody.

312
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,920
Yeah.

313
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,260
Well it's close.

314
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,591
You know,

315
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:45,801
were,

316
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:46,700
were pretty bad.

317
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,170
But uh,

318
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,250
apparently it's nothing like Russia,

319
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,120
like the,

320
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,950
these Russian oligarchs,

321
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,620
they just dominated.

322
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,390
They just figured out a way to completely
dominate the entire economy of a giant

323
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
country.

324
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,661
I mean it's,

325
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:03,420
it's listening to him talk about,

326
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,380
it was fascinating.

327
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,870
That shows different now
that Anthony's not there,

328
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,210
but Jimmy Norton is so
fucking interesting.

329
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,021
Hysterical.

330
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:10,471
And you know,

331
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,300
an obese doing a great job with it too.

332
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,590
It's still a great show.

333
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,620
This Guy Ben Mezrich was fascinating.

334
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,590
Fuck Russia man.

335
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,424
It's crazy.

336
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,720
They were talking about Putin,

337
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,680
but what a gangster Putin had to be to,

338
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,880
to come back and lead the
country after he left.

339
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,590
Like he led the country,

340
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,040
took off like the,

341
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,680
the impose some sort of a term limit
came back like no term limit in buck.

342
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,490
Oh,

343
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,360
he's back again.

344
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,050
Like he's,

345
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,030
this is a second time running the country.

346
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Like he installed some sort of a puppet
dictator or a puppet leader when he was

347
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,350
gone and then came back and
he's a former KGB agent.

348
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,270
Like what the fuck man.

349
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,121
You know,

350
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,750
there's a guy that a,

351
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:54,970
a professional wrestler named Marie Seth
that actually puts the Cutin on the,

352
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
on the mega tron and the,

353
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,283
and Tron.

354
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,521
Uh,

355
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,550
every time he comes out and
really gets the crowd riled up.

356
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,230
Oh mother Russia,

357
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,840
I promise I will defeat my victim for you.

358
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,250
And it gets the whole crowd to hate him.

359
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,010
And then I,

360
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,070
and then a guy comes out and uh,

361
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,840
he Rousseff usually wins.

362
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:14,470
They let the Russian guy when cause it
drives the crowd crazy and then you think

363
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:15,910
anything can happen after that.

364
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,373
Fuck.

365
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,640
My favorite thing is to
watch you respond to me.

366
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,474
Talk about rats.

367
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,410
What's wrong with you?

368
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,960
You would love it around with you.

369
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,270
I wouldn't love it.

370
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,173
You'd be amazed.

371
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,013
I'll bet you though.

372
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,080
I bet you if I showed you a
statistic of UFC fans being WWE fans,

373
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:40,140
I bet you'd be shocked because before the
UFC was all over everything and one of

374
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,550
the only outlets that end,

375
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,090
by the way,

376
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,100
I've been with the UFC
since the beginning,

377
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,851
you know what I mean?

378
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,120
Like I mean like watching it,

379
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,930
it's since the hoists days since
voice and shamrock and all that.

380
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,960
And that's because it's it.

381
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,790
Even though it's two
totally different things.

382
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,980
UFC is obviously an extremely,

383
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,023
you know,

384
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,520
crazy sport and WWE is
completely entertainment with,

385
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,790
you know,

386
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,350
some injuries from time to time.

387
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,813
Uh,

388
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,750
you know,

389
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,360
the,

390
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
it was an outlet for anybody
that wanted some crazy stuff.

391
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,590
Wwe and UFC fans.

392
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,760
I bet there's a lot.

393
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,170
I would bet you that you're done talking.

394
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,023
This is it.

395
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,531
This is my,

396
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,060
this is my closing statement.

397
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:21,750
Here it is.

398
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,750
I'll bet you that at least 70% of UFC
fans have been or are a WWE fan at some

399
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,700
point 70%.

400
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,810
I love when people throw a statistic
around where they have done zero research,

401
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,160
just a random number.

402
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,270
I believe 70.

403
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:35,931
I do it all the time,

404
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:36,580
by the way.

405
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:36,840
Uh,

406
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,150
I'm 70 and I bet 90% of no I did.

407
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,253
They look,

408
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,880
it's not the God damn same.

409
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,620
One of them is real.

410
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,570
One of them people that are battling
for their life and the most difficult

411
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,040
contest and all of sports.

412
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Another one is weird fucking jerk off
thing that strange guys do when they sit

413
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,460
in front of the TV and pretend
they don't know it's fake.

414
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,370
Right.

415
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,203
10 payment.

416
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,471
No,

417
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,221
I know it's fake.

418
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,330
Everybody knows it's fake.

419
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,141
You don't want to know.

420
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,880
You shut that part of your
brain off when you watch it.

421
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,140
You like like a lizard.

422
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,960
They told me to take a
full time writers job.

423
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:11,900
I know it's fake.

424
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,600
Even even if you wrote it,

425
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,180
you would still be
there while it happened.

426
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,040
I can't believe

427
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,480
he wrote his safety order taker.

428
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,110
You would hope you would have your
fucking script in your hand and you'd be

429
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,220
jumping up and down,

430
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:29,360
spinning around in circles.

431
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,560
I can't believe prompt the undertaker.

432
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,171
Oh yeah.

433
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:39,171
I'm real and Grabow worlds Calamari.

434
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,881
Oh yeah.

435
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:41,720
He never got to finish.

436
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,420
So I wrote a thing to where Cain,

437
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,690
the undertakers brother wrestled Brock
Lesnar at this wrestlemania coming up in

438
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,190
seven months or so and uh,

439
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,400
loses but undertaker comes back.

440
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,100
Tombstone pal drives Brock Lesnar
and they walk off together.

441
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,660
Amazing Swan Song.

442
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:00,310
They wake up.

443
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,143
Right.

444
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,100
Well,

445
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,860
when you come up with a
move for a guy to win with,

446
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,190
yeah.

447
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,270
Do you take into consideration at all
the health of the person tried to attempt

448
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:11,690
that move?

449
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,380
It's tough.

450
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,980
You're right.

451
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,251
Yeah.

452
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,610
It's tough because when Brock Lesnar
did that shooting star press flipped

453
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:17,840
through the air and landed on his head.

454
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,680
I've seen that.

455
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,070
Yeah,

456
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,551
I've seen that.

457
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:23,900
Everybody see anybody like who knew about
Brock Lesnar who was researching him.

458
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,040
Very likely if you were going through
like internet videos and stuff like that,

459
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,220
you would run into that video of him
flipping off the top rope and landing on

460
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:36,221
his head off 300 pounds of them landed
on his head bang and kept going.

461
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,180
Yeah.

462
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,013
Crazy.

463
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,280
I don't know how the fuck he lived.

464
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,630
I know if you watched that,

465
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,860
it looks like he's a dead man.

466
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,783
Yeah,

467
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,100
Wayne's on his fucking head.

468
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:45,850
Yeah.

469
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,710
There's some stuff that just can't even,

470
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,910
they just probably an
inch either way and he's,

471
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,040
he can't move his legs and stuff,

472
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,030
but he survived it.

473
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,280
Walk in music is so powerful because
you could psych out an opponent with

474
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,590
walking music if it's done properly.

475
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,330
If it's some,

476
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,490
if it's some subtle crazy stuff,

477
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,240
you know?

478
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,451
No,

479
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,284
you can't.

480
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,343
Little bit.

481
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,480
He can wrestling.

482
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,800
You look around what is trembling?

483
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,653
He's playing that.

484
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,111
Who's that?

485
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:15,831
Phil Collins.

486
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,030
I can feel it in here.

487
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,601
You think?

488
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,220
I believe this is my song.

489
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,210
I think if you're on,

490
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,850
if you're fighting in the
UFC and you come out first,

491
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,870
you add your song.

492
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:33,871
Let's say your songs like a seven on a
one to 10 and then lights go out and Phil

493
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,970
Collins in the air tonight does come in.

494
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,990
You're not a little bit like,

495
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,561
fuck,

496
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,300
I wish I would've picked this guy.

497
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:40,750
He's already got,

498
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,190
he's already got one on me.

499
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
It's already willing to one below,

500
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,350
and that's the intro

501
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,873
you

502
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,880
need to call McMahon right now.

503
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,240
You think like a fucking
pro wrestling fan.

504
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,220
And I say that with all due respect,

505
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,151
I'm not,

506
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,050
I'm not hating on it.

507
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,430
But you think like you,

508
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:03,710
you take the joy moment in that stupidity.

509
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,350
It's entertaining as hell.

510
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,130
Vince,

511
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,600
why are you slipping?

512
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,920
This is the management.

513
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:14,360
Turn your organization around your them
and they should call you the mastermind

514
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,730
and they should make
you a character as well.

515
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,670
I agree with you.

516
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,820
Where those gold wrestling shoes,

517
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,870
that's your whole outfit.

518
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,930
It's shiny gold and the mastermind.

519
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,390
Good to be here in Vancouver.

520
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,191
Oh,

521
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:28,881
what's wrong?

522
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,370
You don't like my plans for the future?

523
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,250
I can feed it.

524
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,440
What is it about all that stuff?

525
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,800
Even though you know it's
total 100% horseshit.

526
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,850
What is it about that stuff
that's appealing to you?

527
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
The Entertainment Gel.

528
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,150
If you watched one of these things,

529
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,870
you would,

530
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,480
you would see what you liked about it and
you would have a few favorites and no,

531
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,090
no,

532
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,320
I'll go fucking crazy.

533
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,650
And I'd watched lions killing gazelles
on television because that's real.

534
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,401
That's what I'd do.

535
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,780
I'd grab my laptop and I'd be like,

536
00:15:59,781 --> 00:15:59,901
yeah,

537
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,280
you watch this fake shit all day.

538
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,173
I need real.

539
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,050
I need real.

540
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,060
I can't get entertained by frank.

541
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,370
But that's what TV shows
and movies are there.

542
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:08,204
Fake.

543
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,230
No,

544
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,471
no,

545
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,861
they're not.

546
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,840
Fake sports are real.

547
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,340
And that I understand,

548
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,080
and this is sports entertainment.

549
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:15,914
It's not,

550
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,490
it's not.

551
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:16,880
We're not.

552
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,660
Nobody's saying it's really when you
watch game of Thrones and you watch a guy

553
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,710
gets his head cut off,

554
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,940
you know what it looks like.

555
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,720
Yeah.

556
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,940
It looks like a guy actually
getting his head cut off.

557
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:26,810
It looks real.

558
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,470
When I watch wrestling and
I see a guy get hit and go

559
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,320
turn to the crowd.

560
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,080
I know that's bullshit.

561
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,480
It's offensive to me.

562
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,190
It's offensive.

563
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,053
Yeah.

564
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,120
And the idea is other moves
that happen that are amazing.

565
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:44,420
Nope.

566
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,690
Nope,

567
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,470
nope.

568
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,310
They're all offensive.

569
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,370
Oh No.

570
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,730
I know they take athleticism to pull off,

571
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,340
but they're offensive
because I'm so aware.

572
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,710
It's so in my face and this
is not really happening.

573
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,770
I can't be the guy in the gold
suit holding onto the script,

574
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,810
jumping around and place going or lost.

575
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,610
The streak has been broken.

576
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,901
That's what you would do.

577
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,340
You would freak the fuck out.

578
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,330
I would run around.

579
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,343
I wouldn't do that.

580
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,280
You would if you were hired.

581
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:11,960
If I had a gold suit I would do that,

582
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,250
but I don't have a cold.

583
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,600
I can see you doing it.

584
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,770
Vince is fucking up.

585
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,450
Really needs to make you a part of it.

586
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,770
I told him Tony when
immediately you should do it
and I can't believe you didn't

587
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:22,311
take it Tony,

588
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,144
cause that is the way,

589
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,170
one of the biggest things for you,

590
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,420
for you because you are
that is trying to negotiate.

591
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,920
Doing it part time from La.

592
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,000
That would be awesome.

593
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,020
That way that would be best for both
sides because I wouldn't get burned out on

594
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,810
it and they would have awesome,

595
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:43,040
great ideas that are hip and cool and I
would have been able to do what I wanted

596
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:43,370
it to happen.

597
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:43,850
Cool.

598
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,280
Whenever guys says my
ideas are hip and cool,

599
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,140
I'll go.

600
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,010
Are you sure?

601
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:48,441
The pins,

602
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,200
what ideas?

603
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
Talking about as a scarf

604
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,173
scarf.

605
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,250
It's a scarf with little
skulls all over it.

606
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:58,950
Like he's a pirate and he's
drinking a Frappaccino.

607
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,540
Aren't you ever saw this one coming?

608
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,350
Yes.

609
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,160
Undertaker has gone.

610
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:08,994
Metro,

611
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,980
Metro sexual undertaker.

612
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,030
Maybe if you changed,

613
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,320
all of a sudden Tony starts working for
them and every character becomes a gay

614
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,190
as,

615
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,650
and it turns out that there's,

616
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,130
there's someone who's
sprinkling gay dust overall.

617
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,700
The other competitors where there's
a locker room and he's turning.

618
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:30,061
That's the,

619
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:33,720
that's a plot that Tony comes up
when he turns the entire roster gay.

620
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,190
It turns out there's an openly gay
wrestler and he has gay fairy dust.

621
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,521
Okay,

622
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:38,851
well he was,

623
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,750
he didn't like a leprechauns ball sack.

624
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,270
You read,

625
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,210
killed the Leprechaun and turned
his ball sack until like this.

626
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,240
Are you ready for this?

627
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,040
What if I were to tell you that there is
an openly gay wrestler that blows dust

628
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,150
in people's space?

629
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,110
Fuck out.

630
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,730
His name is gold dust.

631
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,170
No fucking way.

632
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,250
Area is right there.

633
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,393
This is real.

634
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,090
Yeah Dude,

635
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,400
this is in the WWE.

636
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,221
Dustin Rhodes,

637
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,520
a third generation rest.

638
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,770
What's what's going on with his Dick?

639
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
That's gold dust.

640
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,800
You've heard of horsepower that's
like related to the dusty roads.

641
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,370
Yeah.

642
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:14,540
Yeah.

643
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:14,730
Hey,

644
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,720
how'd you know about that city road used
to be eight when this shit made sense.

645
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,713
Thank you Joe.

646
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,080
This guy's real.

647
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:25,710
Please.

648
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,640
I need to see more.

649
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,770
I can't believe I invented
a guy that already exist.

650
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,880
Yeah you can.

651
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,530
You should be writing this.

652
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,430
That's him and his,

653
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:32,760
uh,

654
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,800
insurance cell phone when he
takes off the wagon robe and he

655
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,970
flirts with them in the ring and Shit
blows and kisses and they get all of

656
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,110
roundup and then he can beat
him with shit cause they,

657
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,910
they're like all day.

658
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,250
Get away from me and he's like,

659
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,730
oh yeah,

660
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,120
come here.

661
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,940
Beautiful.

662
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,530
And they're

663
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,590
did the WWE should hire Michael Sam
as soon as he's done with the Dallas

664
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,424
cowboys.

665
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,700
The openly gay NFL player.

666
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,270
Yeah.

667
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,820
I don't,

668
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,410
I don't know.

669
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,810
He's not good enough to make the team
and just bringing them for the practice

670
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:01,530
squad.

671
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,910
They need to bring that dude into
WWE and actually fuck a guy on TV.

672
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,890
Well him and gold dust.

673
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,191
Yeah,

674
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,240
but gold does is fake it.

675
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:09,720
I could tell.

676
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,051
Look it up.

677
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:10,620
My Guy Straight.

678
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:10,831
Yeah,

679
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,910
he's super straight.

680
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,480
It's super straight.

681
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,551
I,

682
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,160
you know,

683
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,851
part of me says,

684
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:15,990
yeah,

685
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,580
zoo animal cruelty of the,

686
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,450
the biggest part,

687
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,400
like in my gut reaction,

688
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,181
I look at that.

689
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,020
Should that be illegal?

690
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,831
Wow.

691
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,091
It wasn't,

692
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:23,191
oh,

693
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,660
that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.

694
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,210
It's kind of a fucked up thing to put
razor blades in the end of a chicken's

695
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:27,560
foot.

696
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,920
Stick them in a cage and then the chicken,

697
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,754
they fuck each other.

698
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
Just do fake chicken fighting.

699
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,910
See I'm a gay chicken come
out when the blonde wig and,

700
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,130
all right guys,

701
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,120
I lost Sean that

702
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,330
it's gotta be real chicken.

703
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,700
Can't believe it's gold guys real.

704
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,500
I came up with a guy who blows dust.

705
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,201
No,

706
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:46,771
his dad,

707
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:48,100
you named it dusty

708
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,910
roads and it's going to know that he
exists and he's got a brother named Cody

709
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,790
Rhodes who just made the
jump to being star dust,

710
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,650
which is the,

711
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,190
uh,

712
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,023
he's like the,

713
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,010
he's like another version of gold dust
except up now they roll together so he's

714
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,844
gay too.

715
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,070
Now star dust is more like,

716
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,050
just like about the cosmos and like,

717
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,500
ah,

718
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,620
I just can't believe
all the magical things.

719
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,673
Oh

720
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,381
yeah,

721
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:13,951
he's high.

722
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:14,550
Yeah.

723
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,170
So he's

724
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,760
stone the stone to the gills.

725
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:16,941
Oh,

726
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:17,750
that's so funny.

727
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,583
Except he's just,

728
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,360
ah,

729
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,090
you never know.

730
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,170
Do you think that it's possible to,

731
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:22,640
Tony could gave me to like pro wrestling.

732
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:23,240
Yes.

733
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,361
Oh,

734
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:24,290
I know for a fact,

735
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:24,501
dude.

736
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:24,890
I would know.

737
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,060
I knew the exact match.

738
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:26,930
Is the videos,

739
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:27,591
the moves,

740
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:28,760
the everything that would,

741
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,370
that would interest you
or is he too much real?

742
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,470
There's some crazy
submission moves that a no,

743
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:34,650
no,

744
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:34,861
no,

745
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:35,060
no,

746
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,220
no.

747
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,740
Dot.

748
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,573
Last.

749
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,670
That's the last thing you want to show me.

750
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,680
Don't that'll get me angry.

751
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,161
I'd be like,

752
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,270
that wouldn't work,

753
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,740
right.

754
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,650
No defense here.

755
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:46,760
You said hip escape.

756
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,870
He can get out of there.

757
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,890
Nothing drives me crazier than like
a fake submission move in a movie.

758
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,630
That shit drives me nuts.

759
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:53,901
You know,

760
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:58,040
I stopped watching Dexter because fucking,

761
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,450
what's his name from third rock?

762
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,470
John Lithgow.

763
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,550
John Lithgo have this chicken
of her naked choke in a bathtub.

764
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,091
And He,

765
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,210
and he killed her that way.

766
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,900
And I was like,

767
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,501
oh my God,

768
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,230
that's the worst fucking room
naked choke I've ever seen.

769
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,670
That's so fake.

770
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,810
She's not even red.

771
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm done.

772
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,790
And I shut it off.

773
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,670
I walked out of the room and discussed
and I never watched another episode of

774
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,540
Dexter again.

775
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,463
Wow.

776
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,071
Yeah.

777
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,320
You can't show me a fake rear naked choke.

778
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,780
You fucks that.

779
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,990
That makes me angry.

780
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,590
That's like if you were watching
a Jimi Hendrix bio pick,

781
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:28,840
uh,

782
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,241
you know,

783
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,290
a non bio pic,

784
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:30,621
but like,

785
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:31,360
uh,

786
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,840
you one of those movies where it's a fake,

787
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,490
like an actor plays Jimmy Hendrix.

788
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:35,480
I guess that's a biopic,

789
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,720
right?

790
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,170
Yeah.

791
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,330
And some do didn't know how
to play guitar and he's like,

792
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,150
can around here own right.

793
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,121
And he'd be like,

794
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:41,511
no,

795
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,620
y'all got killing it.

796
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,700
You're not doing it at all.

797
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:44,870
You're not playing guitar.

798
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,640
That's what John Lithgow,

799
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,680
it's Shitty fucking Renee
get choked did for me.

800
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,300
The only reason I think that you would
maybe like it in the future is that you

801
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,020
like,

802
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,591
you know,

803
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:59,300
UFC so much in MMA and Jujitsu so much
and Tony gets it together with a bunch of

804
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:00,350
people and watches it.

805
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,660
A lot of them watch it as a joke where
Tony I think takes it a little bit too

806
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:04,440
serious.

807
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,151
Oh No,

808
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,560
we all watched it as a joke.

809
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,394
I can,

810
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm not buying a joke.

811
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,870
I just see and recognize
what's entertaining about it.

812
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:16,700
And I do like the ideology of
stunning in arena of people.

813
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,420
Sometimes that happens.

814
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,363
It can happen.

815
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,700
You have to look at the reaction to that
is the three hour like job interview

816
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,983
for you.

817
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,550
This is like your audition tape.

818
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,440
They should fucking hire you.

819
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,660
They should figure out how they can,

820
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,520
I need you to pull this up.

821
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,040
Where are you binge listen,

822
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,620
take the needle out of
your ass and hire this guy.

823
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,100
You're crazy not to.

824
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,560
You should have seen the looks on these
people's faces when Brock beat the

825
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,100
undertaker.

826
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,441
Nobody.

827
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:46,570
Yeah.

828
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,740
Thought it was going to happen.

829
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,701
Oh my God.

830
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:49,331
What did they do,

831
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:50,080
Tony?

832
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Imagine if on Saturday the fuck is wrong
with you and that nobody thought it was

833
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:55,930
going to happen.

834
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,040
It was amazing.

835
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,660
It was fake as fuck dude.

836
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,690
But nobody thought it was going to happen.

837
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,330
A lot of things are fake that
nobody thought was going to happen.

838
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,343
Tony,

839
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,120
Tony,

840
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,411
Tony,

841
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:06,940
I'm sorry.

842
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,070
Imagine if that guy

843
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,670
who filled in for that Shit's getting
around on Saturday and he took on

844
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:17,671
Dillashaw imagine if in the miracle
he was able to somehow land a punch on

845
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:18,850
Dillashaw beat him.

846
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:19,990
The place would have been.

847
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,291
I mean,

848
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,320
well it's sort of weird cause that's
Sacramento and that's Dillashaw his

849
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:23,830
hometown.

850
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,080
But I'm just saying
like in a neutral field,

851
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:28,720
that would have been stunning and
everybody would have known that they just

852
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:29,650
witnessed history

853
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,850
20 that would have been real.

854
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,510
Right.

855
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,960
No one can really tell the really,

856
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,790
really knocked out a professional athlete
to guys who've trained to fight their

857
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:39,724
entire lives.

858
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,773
It's real.

859
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,613
Right,

860
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:42,881
right.

861
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,960
I understand you're,

862
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,280
you,

863
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,590
you,

864
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,410
you're so crazy.

865
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,821
By the way,

866
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,890
this stuff is trying
to sell insurance here.

867
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,620
No,

868
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,300
I know.

869
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,760
I understand where your concerns are,

870
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,010
but let me just show you
the details of our policy.

871
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,290
You're a crazy person.

872
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,333
No,

873
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,590
I'm telling you why there's millions
and millions of WWF and I'm telling you

874
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:03,130
why.

875
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,850
Maybe hunters Thompson was just a couple
of decades off when he was predicting

876
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:07,684
the end of the world.

877
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,590
Those guys,

878
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,960
they mean it's not easy.

879
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,201
If,

880
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:11,861
for example,

881
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:16,630
Brock was furious when Vince told him
that he wanted him to beat the undertaker

882
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:17,021
that day.

883
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,000
Like in real life.

884
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:18,330
Like okay,

885
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,021
Betty was,

886
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,250
and you were there to see it.

887
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:20,821
No,

888
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,320
but I talked to somebody who was,

889
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,591
oh,

890
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:24,030
I bet he was honest with you.

891
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,800
It's not like they lie all day.

892
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:26,634
Every day.

893
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,100
Tony,

894
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,380
Tony's going to talk to some people.

895
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:29,080
Let me tell you a little,

896
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,320
tell you what Brock was actually mad.

897
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,030
He was really mad.

898
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,580
He read the script and
you just start doses.

899
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,483
Bullshit.

900
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,770
I'm not picking a fucking
hundred taker of the,

901
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,140
some of the guys that work,

902
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,660
unlike the technical side
for the UFC work for the WWE,

903
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,430
art,

904
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,263
Brock was crying.

905
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,080
That's what I heard was Brock went
into the hospital with the undertaker,

906
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,021
cried so hard.

907
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,050
He dehydrated himself.

908
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,020
After that match.

909
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,770
They had to give them an IV to replenish.

910
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:57,860
His team thought he killed the undertaker.

911
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,461
From that.

912
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,980
Concussion is bad.

913
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:02,810
Bad.

914
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,441
It was real.

915
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,670
The concussions are real.

916
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,620
You can't buy that.

917
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,521
I don't even buy.

918
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,354
It was a real concussion.

919
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,770
I probably faked a concussion

920
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,520
then got JT on.

921
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:14,060
Don't take her to the hospital.

922
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,310
He's got up Bobo and even on the,

923
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,960
they don't feel real booboo folks.

924
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:18,621
If you don't take,

925
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:19,231
it's a real boob.

926
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:19,420
La,

927
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,020
show you the fucking band aid on it.

928
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,980
Are you doing it on my four year old boy?

929
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,760
It's like you're pitching
something and four year olds.

930
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,160
So booboo,

931
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,013
booboo,

932
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,621
honey,

933
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,021
there's no,

934
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,180
because he's not even bleeding.

935
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,080
You don't need a bandaid.

936
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,211
Oh,

937
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:43,560
I want a bandaid.

938
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,250
Okay,

939
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:44,691
well Ben,

940
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:45,720
they make you feel better.

941
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,920
We'll get you a bandaid.

942
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,060
Did took the undertaker
and put a bandaid on them.

943
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,553
Hey

944
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,330
Tony Hinchcliffe in a gold
suit holding the script.

945
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,450
I can't believe it's our real poopooed
jumping up and down circles and Vince

946
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,840
Mcmahon stand there shaking
his head color of purple.

947
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,720
All fucking pent up with rage.

948
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,790
That's how I wrote it

949
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,310
down.

950
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,143
It's a booboo.

951
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,030
Look at the bandaid.

952
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,770
It's real.

953
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,710
It's a real bandaid.

954
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

955
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,410
if you doubt it.

956
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,331
What else do you like?

957
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,080
That sucks.

958
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,990
Um,

959
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,760
let's see.

960
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,600
What else do I like?

961
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,434
It sucks.

962
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,610
Uh,

963
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,153
um,

964
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,520
I guess I play fantasy football.

965
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,780
I don't talk about that a lot.

966
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,441
Well,

967
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:40,980
fantasy football is at least
based on fucking football,

968
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:41,490
right?

969
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,660
Which is a real game.

970
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,900
People are really trying
and shit really happens,

971
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,150
but nobody knows what's going
to happen in real sports.

972
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
Isn't that part of what makes it exciting?

973
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,900
You fucking Weirdo.

974
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,820
IBW eight Oh shit.

975
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,350
What's going to happen?

976
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,840
You don't know what's going to happen.

977
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,640
You predicted a writer.

978
00:27:59,670 --> 00:27:59,880
No.

979
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,590
The writer knows what's going to happen.

980
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:01,781
Oh,

981
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,290
the writer knows it's not real.

982
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,460
It's like a play plays.

983
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,093
Musicals.

984
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,920
Now I've been the one that
he's gay or than musicals.

985
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:11,754
How about that?

986
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,590
That doesn't make sense.

987
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,850
Sure it does.

988
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,980
It's dude's are hugging.

989
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,950
They get all sweaty.

990
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,150
They're laying on each other.

991
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,920
They're an and it's not real.

992
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,043
Okay.

993
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,131
I mean,

994
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:27,080
after musicals guys are banging.

995
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,750
I don't know if they're banging.

996
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,010
I don't go to those things.

997
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm not in that world.

998
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,520
You've seen a musical,

999
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:34,880
right?

1000
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,061
Yeah.

1001
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,110
She had a bunch of musicals.

1002
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,910
Not there's anything wrong with being gay,

1003
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:38,570
by the way,

1004
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,860
but musicals are gay.

1005
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,990
They just are.

1006
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,830
It really is.

1007
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,790
It really is.

1008
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,380
Unless it's a humorous musical.

1009
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,250
Yeah.

1010
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,830
Even then it's even then someone

1011
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,501
kisses ass.

1012
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,334
Right.

1013
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,490
That's someone else.

1014
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,350
That's a Photoshop,

1015
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:52,811
but isn't it?

1016
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah.

1017
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,270
That's not the real who is that guy
is kissing me that that's a fake guy.

1018
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,740
Probably one of you out there.

1019
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,790
Just go look for it.

1020
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,470
That's the thing about the Internet,

1021
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:04,040
man.

1022
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,750
Here's a photo of you out there somewhere.

1023
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,130
Someone's Photoshop to Dick in your
mouth or you kissing ass or you doing

1024
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,150
something ridiculous and over our Mustang.

1025
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,630
Why did he do that as a challenger?

1026
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,190
Why did he do that while he pulled his
pants down and made someone kisses ass on

1027
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:19,910
TV?

1028
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,720
Probably.

1029
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,980
That sounds like something he would do,

1030
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,670
but he did.

1031
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,330
You know it.

1032
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,950
Why are you pretending
you didn't watch that one?

1033
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,480
It spits back think it.

1034
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,480
They think that was over
like 1213 years ago.

1035
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:30,260
Something like that.

1036
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,071
You weren't there yet,

1037
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:31,640
Huh?

1038
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:31,840
No,

1039
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:31,970
I,

1040
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,570
I,

1041
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,590
I can't remember.

1042
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,873
I can't remember.

1043
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,691
I don't believe it.

1044
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,680
I think you're being mocked.

1045
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:41,120
That may have been during that period
where once you guys kissed his ass,

1046
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,790
fuck your brother.

1047
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,570
Back yard wrestling kind of gauge how
many people in the audience though.

1048
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,590
That's insane.

1049
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,190
Plus it's been winning the Monday
night cable wars for over 20 years.

1050
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,750
Think about that for a second.

1051
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,210
Every Monday night at wins,

1052
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,940
every single month they pulled TNA though.

1053
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,540
They pulled TNA from a,

1054
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,031
from a spike.

1055
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:04,870
TV expenses.

1056
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,883
Competition.

1057
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
What's the problem with TNA?

1058
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,340
Everything's terrible.

1059
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,960
They're just completely,

1060
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,340
it's not even in the same,

1061
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,440
that's what it should be.

1062
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:14,860
Bribed,

1063
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,580
but it's not.

1064
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,590
It's not even in the same ballpark.

1065
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,400
What is it?

1066
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,551
Well,

1067
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:21,040
they used to have like a
lot of MMA guys would do it.

1068
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,100
Like King Mo was in TNA
and rampages and TNA.

1069
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,880
There's not good.

1070
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,450
No,

1071
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:25,840
no.

1072
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,560
That's wrong with it.

1073
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,371
Bad writing,

1074
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:28,204
bad everything.

1075
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,081
Could you go over there?

1076
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:29,650
Maybe ma'am,

1077
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,060
I shouldn't.

1078
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,310
No,

1079
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,143
I don't want it.

1080
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,360
You don't turn down the WWE TNA.

1081
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,691
Listen,

1082
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:35,800
you could be the fucking mogul.

1083
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,360
What did they give you
a piece of the action.

1084
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,620
What is the DNA said?

1085
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,040
Listen,

1086
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,630
we heard you on the Joe Rogan podcast.

1087
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,160
We'd like the way you
think about wrestling.

1088
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,910
I think this organization has still
has some life and we're willing to,

1089
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,390
uh,

1090
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,710
willing to cut you in on this.

1091
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,360
Give you 10% of the action.

1092
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,920
I own 10% of TNA.

1093
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,820
I'm pretty sure 10% of the TNA wouldn't
even get me what I would have made with

1094
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:55,631
the WWE.

1095
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:56,830
You son of a bitch.

1096
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,221
Yeah.

1097
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,900
They just lost their TV deal.

1098
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,520
They don't have a TV deal.

1099
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,511
Yeah,

1100
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,344
they're done.

1101
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,690
Then it's maybe it'll get
picked up by like lifetime.

1102
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,880
Vince Mcmahon beat Ted Turner.

1103
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,920
What does Ted Turner and CNN,

1104
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,791
CNN,

1105
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:10,331
TNT,

1106
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:14,420
TBS heat through Ted Turner
at open checks that he would,

1107
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,720
he would just sign any
wrestler back and uh,

1108
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,600
they were having wars on Monday nights.

1109
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,620
They'd go against each other.

1110
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:25,621
Vince WWE on the USA network and t
and t had nitro and Ted Turner said,

1111
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,810
whatever we need to do
to beat Vince Mcmahon,

1112
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,910
I will write the check to whoever.

1113
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:31,600
So they offered,

1114
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,190
they bought hall Kogan
they bought all these,

1115
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:33,461
this,

1116
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:34,900
he believes I was there.

1117
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,823
I was in that room.

1118
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,981
No,

1119
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:39,970
I didn't say I was there and he was
just willing to spend whatever it takes.

1120
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,530
That sounds like a plot,

1121
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,780
like a plot in lack of
ways or two different,

1122
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,141
no,

1123
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:44,530
I'm taught,

1124
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,490
this is where it's real.

1125
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,530
Just parts real.

1126
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,251
That's the problem.

1127
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,290
You've cried wolf through
this whole podcast.

1128
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,130
I never said it was real nice about
Santa Claus repeating that it's not real.

1129
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,690
I'm agreeing with you and now you're
trying to tell us that the boogie man is

1130
00:31:58,691 --> 00:31:58,961
real.

1131
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,794
That's what you're doing

1132
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,680
for wrestling.

1133
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:03,131
So real.

1134
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,964
I said,

1135
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,530
it's going to write it.

1136
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,940
How much did Ted Turner spend
millions and millions to buy?

1137
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Good.

1138
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,000
The guys that were already
developed from the WWF,

1139
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:15,960
he bought all their
biggest guys haul Cogan,

1140
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,350
a macho man.

1141
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,184
Randy Savage,

1142
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,391
you know,

1143
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,170
much a man,

1144
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,160
dusty Rhodes,

1145
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,410
I'm a slim Jim Fan.

1146
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,273
Right?

1147
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,823
Snapping list.

1148
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,420
Dusty Rhodes.

1149
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,171
He bought them all.

1150
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:34,171
And how did it do they ended up winning
the wars for a bunch of weeks in a row.

1151
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,620
They did.

1152
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:35,891
Yeah.

1153
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:37,930
I turned it for like a year in a row.

1154
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,633
And uh,

1155
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,330
but then Vince,

1156
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:41,810
uh,

1157
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,800
bought Mike Tyson and made him refer a
match at Wrestlemania with Steve Austin

1158
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,410
and Sean Michelson than it dominated.

1159
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,290
The rest is history.

1160
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,861
That's it.

1161
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,550
One move.

1162
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,383
Yup.

1163
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,490
Okay.
