00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,680
Hey everybody,
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:11,681
podcast is brought to you by legal zoom.
Legal Zoom is an awesome way to take 

3
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:15,971
care of things online that you would 
ordinarily have to go to a lawyers 

4
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:16,670
office for.
You'd have to make an appointment,

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,130
he'd have to get weirded out by going 
there and just thinking about how much 

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,470
money it's going to cost you,
and you can save a substantial amount of

7
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:29,471
money by using legal zoom.
You can incorporate or form an llc at 

8
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:33,230
legal zoom for just 99 bucks.
You can make trademarks,

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,640
copyrights,
patents.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,700
You can make your own will legally 
protected will for just $69.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,470
I mean,
that's amazing living trusts,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
powers of attorney and more in the past 
12 years,

13
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,020
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,450
They've saved a ton of money.
We have personal experience on it.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,630
Um,
Arbor used legal zoom to incorporate on 

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:55,630
it.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,260
And Brian used legal zoom to for a desk 
squad.

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,870
So it has been used by people that we 
know.

19
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,400
It's excellent.
It works well.

20
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,960
And if you panic and you're like,
man,

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,410
I don't think this is right,
you can get connected to an independent 

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,251
attorney.
So if you get to a point where you're 

23
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,841
like,
this is not legal and you're freaking 

24
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:13,841
out,
just don't worry about it.

25
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,560
They can.
They can connect you to someone who can 

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,961
clean up your mess as well.
And it's easy to use though it's not 

27
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:20,150
difficult.
It's very clear.

28
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:25,151
Step by step,
they're online process couldn't be much 

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,241
easier and they'll take care of you from

We're also brought to you by,

36
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,890
what was the Ting Ting.
Oh,

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,930
she's Louisa's Ting is a mobile service 
that has been a sponsor of this podcast 

38
00:01:55,311 --> 00:02:00,311
for quite a long time and I've never 
heard one person say anything bad about 

39
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,070
it.
We've had a few sponsors like that where

40
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:06,071
there's been zero controversy and Tang 
is one where if you have a cell phone 

41
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:10,370
provider that you use on a regular basis
and you switched over to Tang,

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,790
I guarantee you you're going to save 
some money.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,300
It's 98 percent of people would save 
money with Ting.

44
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,810
I mean that's,
that's their statement and their 

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,371
websites and number one thing they say 
and they show you the numbers for why 

46
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:27,821
people would save.
What they do is they use the sprint 

47
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:27,890
network so they rent time on a sprint 
network,

48
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,940
but they have their own rules.

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,290
Like you can cancel anytime you want.
If you don't use a certain amount of,

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,830
uh,
of service.

51
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,831
Say if you,
you have your phone set up for x amount 

52
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:39,831
of minutes,
but use less than that.

53
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,930
They knock you down to the next level 
and credit your,

54
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,600
the distance on your next bill.
It's beautiful.

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,650
Other people charge you.
If you go over your allocated minutes 

56
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,440
for text or data.
If you have a heavier month with Ting,

57
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,650
you just pay for what you used.
You don't get like weird fines or 

58
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,200
anything creepy.
Anything that makes you go,

59
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,220
oh,
come on man.

60
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,330
That's what Tim's trying to eliminate 
the are come on man thing.

61
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,910
When you look at the bill and go,
what the fuck dude,

62
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,830
come on.
Kind of bullshit.

63
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:10,831
Is that also tim will you can no early 
termination fees and there's an etf 

64
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:17,911
relief program in ETF is an early 
termination fee and if you're paying an 

65
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:21,100
early termination fee,
come to ting and they'll give you credit

66
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:25,450
for 25 percent of that early termination
fee up to $75 per device.

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,660
So it's a.
it's an excellent deal all around.

68
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,810
If you go to [inaudible] dot ting.com,
you will save $25 on your first ting 

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,200

So that's Rogan.ting.com.

70
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
They also have ting also has the ability
to transfer over your mobile devices 

71
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,310
too.
If you have a mobile device,

72
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm from sprint,
like an iphone four s or an iphone four.

73
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,610
You can start using those at sprint as 
well.

74
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,990
So sprint is a really a beautiful cell 
phone service.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,980
It's a the way people should do things.
If the world was better,

76
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,981
that'd be more corporations like this 
and we wouldn't have as many arguments 

77
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:07,981
about shit,
ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,300
so he can also bring over the nexus 
five,

79
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:15,301

and it makers of Alpha brain and shroom 

84
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,561
tech and all that good stuff.
And a large selection of strength and 

85
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,320
conditioning equipment now including the
Zombie Kettlebells,

86
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,460
the primal bells which are apes and 
chimpanzees,

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,820
orangutans and monkeys.
Just trying to give you something 

88
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,611
interesting to work out with.
And also all stuff that I think is the 

89
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,810
best as far as strength and conditioning
equipment is concerned.

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,780
All the things that I think,
you know,

91
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,770
benefit you the most as far as actual 
real body strength for athletics and for

92
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,890
just keeping your body healthy and 
strong.

93
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
Um,
my philosophy and the philosophy of a 

94
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,831
lot of them,
this is where I got it from a lot of a 

95
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:07,500
fitness trainers and especially strength
and conditioning guys in mixed martial 

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,860
arts is treating your whole body.
Don't,

97
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,890
don't do like individual exercises like 
preacher bench curls or anything that's 

98
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,300
real isolation exercises.

99
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
A lot of those are kind of ridiculous 
and what you really should do for 

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,050
functional strength is do things where 
you use your whole body as one unit,

101
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,320
like battle ropes or like kettle bells 
or like we have club bells and there's 

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,491
medicine ball drills,
and even bodyweight exercises like Chin 

103
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:32,600
ups and pushups.
You want to use something,

104
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,110
do something that makes your body move 
in an athletic way.

105
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,950
We also sell the best supplements we can
get our hands on,

106
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,340
the best stuff that we can buy as far as
like hemp protein or nootropics or any 

107
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,990
different supplements that are enhancing
the that'll enhance your mood or enhance

108
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:54,991
your body's ability to perform.
We just try to sell you the best shit 

109
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,170

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,300
you can save 10 off any and all 
supplements.

111
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,120
All right.
Lorenzo from psychedelic salon is here,

112
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,150
is the joining of the podcast minds.
So let's just get this thing on real 

113
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,240
good experience.

114
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Joe Rogan podcast.
One of the cool things about the 

115
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:19,910
Internet,

116
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,100
um,
it's been getting to,

117
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:28,101
uh,
find out all these other people that 

118
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,691
share these interests in and really kind
of what some people would think would be

119
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:35,761
obscure things.
And one of them is talks about 

120
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,820
psychedelics.
You know,

121
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,690
the Terence Mckenna talks,
the Timothy leary talks.

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,200
It's so rare to find a place where you 
can find a lot of those.

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,570
And in the case of your podcast to 
psychedelic salon,

124
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,810
it's the best one I've ever found.
And when I found it,

125
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,370
I was so happy.
I was like,

126
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:58,390
this guy's got everything you have like 
every mckenna recording,

127
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:01,630
like ever you,
all these Timothy leary,

128
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,210
recordings and Alan Watts.
I mean,

129
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:04,620
who,
I mean,

130
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,710
who don't you have anybody essentially 
who's ever said anything weird about 

131
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:09,710
drugs?

132
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,280
Well,
I don't have Joe Rogan yet,

133
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,580
so

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,120
podcasts I don't really.
I could go on and we can talk about 

135
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,120
them.

136
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,350
Let's see.
You started the podcast intentionally 

137
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,350
and mine was just accidental.

138
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,350
No,
that was it.

139
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,500
That's the misconception.
We didn't start intentionally at all.

140
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,400
Oh,
I didn't know that.

141
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,920
Now we just turned on a Webcam once 
we're doing it,

142
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:33,010
like at ustream broadcast.
Just screwing around just for a oof.

143
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,570
Well,
we started the same way then.

144
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
How did you get yours on?
I,

145
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm kind of a Geeky guy and I was 
looking at tech and we're actually up at

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
a mind states conference and I had 
already produced this blanket and rj 

147
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,391
talks at burning man and had them up on 
the web and little 10 minute increments 

148
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:55,150
to keep the file size down and we're up 
at this mind states conference and a guy

149
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,170
comes up to me and says,
Hey,

150
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm going to start a podcast.
Can I use all that stuff you have?

151
00:07:58,721 --> 00:07:59,530
And I said,
sure,

152
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,220
go ahead.
I said,

153
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,580
I thought about it too,
but I don't have an ipod so I didn't 

154
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:05,580
think so.
And he said,

155
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:05,980
you don't need one,
you can do it in your computer.

156
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,130
So I waited a couple months and he never
started his podcast.

157
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:09,900
And so I got ahold of him.

158
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,140
I said,
are you still going to do that?

159
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:11,680
And he said,
no.

160
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,130
And I said,
well,

161
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,300
if you don't mind,
I'm going to use them.

162
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:13,660
He said,
well,

163
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,940
they're yours.
So I made a pie.

164
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,170
I did a podcast of a talk I gave first.
And then I did one that a friend of mine

165
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:22,270
made of terrence.
The last one actually,

166
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,910
he gave him plenty or next to last.
And then,

167
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:25,800
uh,
uh,

168
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,450
I did those two and I was trying to 
figure out how the tech worked.

169
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,390
And so then I put up my stuff from 
blanket and rj and uh,

170
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,730
you know,
I was still just playing around with it 

171
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,351
and I kind of looked in,
there's 10 people and maybe 20 and 30 

172
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:40,351
years,
you know,

173
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:44,490
downloading it,
probably my friends and all of a sudden 

174
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,560
I get contacted by this Guy Kmo and I'd 
been up to maybe 100 downloads.

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,700
And he said,
Hey,

176
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,320
I love your podcast.
And you,

177
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,450
these guys over in England doing the 
dope fiend is doing something and he 

178
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:55,450
likes it.
And uh,

179
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,630
so I started kind of hookup doing the 
dope fiend.

180
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh,
you don't know about the dope fiend?

181
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,330
No.
What is that?

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,800
It's a great podcast to.
It's on the cannabis podcast network and

183
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,040
hilarious.
You can find it.

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,080
A dope fiend,
that code at UK and they're a great 

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,761
podcast.
He's got a whole series of podcasts 

186
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,550
there to the cannabis network.
But uh,

187
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,140
yeah,
he,

188
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,300
he has some good music shows.
In fact,

189
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,210
uh,
uh,

190
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,340
I,
uh,

191
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,110
I first found you,
uh,

192
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,030
during my,
uh,

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,080
stoner a bachelor days on news radio for
so and uh,

194
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,380
then I was lifting to lefties lounge 
who's one of the podcasts on the dope 

195
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,091
fiend network and he plays music and 
comedy and all of a sudden there's some 

196
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:41,490
cuts from you.
And,

197
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,930
and,
uh,

198
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,450
he says,
yeah,

199
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:47,451
Joe's got this podcast now.
And so that's how I found your podcast 

200
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:47,451
was through theirs.

201
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:47,480
Oh,
that's so cool.

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't,
I'm not even sure how I found out about 

203
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,600
yours.
It was,

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,560
it was probably twitter,
someone suggesting it online or maybe my

205
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,850
message board.
It could have been,

206
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't really remember who turned me 
onto it,

207
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:04,121
but it was more than one person and I 
think it was probably because like I 

208
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,680
would occasionally post like a clip that
someone,

209
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,550
uh,
you know,

210
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,000
like on Youtube for like Mckenna lecture
or something like that,

211
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,370
or one of those really cool videos and 
some people have done.

212
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,670
That's one of them are amazing things 
about the internet is all these user 

213
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,001
created videos.
Like I just posted one today that 

214
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:22,001
someone made.
I have no idea who did it.

215
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:24,470
And they did it with things that I said 
on a podcast.

216
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,880
And it's,
it's fantastic.

217
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,610
They did a fantastic job.
It's um,

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,380
it's a weird thing where you can,
you know,

219
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,390
you can a thing that you put out,
all the sudden it gets caught on by 

220
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,171
these other people.
And then they add all these things to 

221
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:41,171
it.
Music and visuals.

222
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:44,150
And it becomes even bigger.
Like some of these Mckenna ones were a,

223
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:49,151
him giving a lecture,
but they've put them to visuals and 

224
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:53,110
sounds and they're just amazing and 
they're super inspirational.

225
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,290
Oh yeah.
Every week I get links to some graphic 

226
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,321
artists.
Is that Sunday I used the clip for your 

227
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,211
podcast and,
and it's just wonderful to see it 

228
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,521
because I think the visuals really 
enhanced what terrance has to say or 

229
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:05,521
anybody say,
you know,

230
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:10,260
and you know,
I know you had a lot of people spin off 

231
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,871
podcast podcast after listening to you 
and a few have done that with me and 

232
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:16,440
some of them hadn't stuck around,
but like these two guys started a 

233
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,120
podcast called black light in the attic.
It was really cool out of Chicago.

234
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,110
What they did is they did a 12 part,
a youtube video series in how to use 

235
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,070
audacity and it's still the best thing 
out there.

236
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:29,740
So what's audacity?
Audacity is a free open source,

237
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,930
a sound sa hardware software.
It's an audio multitrack.

238
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Uh,
you can do lots and lots of stuff with 

239
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:39,940
them,
but it's free open source.

240
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,110
It's probably a more used in podcasts 
than anything.

241
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,070
Wow.
And,

242
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,170
but they did a 12 part youtube thing,
you know,

243
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,180
it's in every once in a while.
I want to learn something new in 

244
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,180
audacity.
I go to one of those kids podcasts.

245
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,180
That's

246
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,550
so cool.
So you must do everything yourself.

247
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:54,760
Then you must edit.
You put all the clips together.

248
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,290
Yeah.
The,

249
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,570
the procedure is I,
I,

250
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,160
uh,
I listened to a talk first and a lot of,

251
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,520
um,
you know,

252
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:05,521
there's a question she can't hear so you
have to cut those out and you've got to 

253
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,390
boost and adjust the sound.
So I get the sound as best I can and I'm

254
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,820
taking notes at the same time because I 
put program notes,

255
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,821
noodles,
short quotes and all because Google and 

256
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,750
Duckduckgo and those other search 
engines don't search the audio.

257
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,880
And so I've made a,
you know,

258
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,881
I've tried to get like 15,
20 quotes of terrance and each one of 

259
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,020
his lectures so that they're searchable.
But then once I have that done,

260
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:31,021
then I write a script where I introduce 
it and then I close out and I write the 

261
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:34,720
script out and rehearse it.
And then I read it so.

262
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,920
And then,
then of course,

263
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,921
you know,
you've got to cut the pieces together 

264
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:40,921
and add the music and then,
uh,

265
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:43,990
turn into MP three file and put it on 
the rss feed and put it out there.

266
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,040
So yeah,
I do the whole thing.

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,330
I respect that so much because I,
this podcast is so easy.

268
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,400
We don't ever edit it.
We go live.

269
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:55,330
We just let it roll SCO once it's gone,
it's gone.

270
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,110
I know.
Fuck up.

271
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,040
We fuck up.
You know,

272
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,490
it's,
it's,

273
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,990
it's got every bump possible.
It's all happening like that.

274
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,690
That's the magic of your podcast because
I have,

275
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,580
I've listened to quite a few of your 
podcasts.

276
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,420
I listened to the comedians in my wife 
listens to your serious interviews,

277
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,450
but uh,
you're every one of your podcasts.

278
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:17,451
I've wanted to jump in and talk and I've
talked to a lot of my friends that 

279
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:17,451
listen to it too.
And they said,

280
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:17,810
yeah man,
he,

281
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,100
he's just like one of us and I want to 
talk with them.

282
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,010
And I think that's the real genius of 
this podcast.

283
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,890
It's just two guys or three or four or 
whatever sitting around talking.

284
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Isn't that hilarious?
But what kind of society who we become 

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,250
were just a regular conversation is 
novel,

286
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,030
regular conversations.
Like what the fuck are they doing?

287
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,590
What are they just talking?

288
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,130
Well,
you know,

289
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:43,090
years ago when I was living in Tampa,
will you on a Saturday night there's guy

290
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,560
named,
Carroll subtler who did a,

291
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,660
a chatterbox cafe and we go down from,
from 10 till two.

292
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,000
And uh,
what the,

293
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,250
the thing was it was about 12 of us sit 
around a table like this and we all 

294
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,980
drink and just talk and they could have 
collins to and so people could 

295
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,680
essentially go to a bar without leaving 
their house and you wouldn't have to 

296
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:04,680
drive drunk.
And so the sound effects were like a bar

297
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:07,660
and all and we'd all assume characters 
and sit around and talk.

298
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,430
And it was a hugely popular show.

299
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,330
Wow.
That's interesting.

300
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,270
It's interesting,
the idea of audio theater,

301
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,300
which is basically what podcasts are,
is a completely new thing to me at 

302
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,610
least.
I mean,

303
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:24,611
it kind of existed before because when I
was a child I listened to audio 

304
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,890
recordings on a record on the large 
vinyl,

305
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,290
you know,
like of course I would listen to standup

306
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:35,291
comedians and cheech and Chong and 
things along those lines and you just 

307
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,100
sit around and listen.
But the beautiful thing about podcast is

308
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,590
most of the time when people are tuning 
into this,

309
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,660
enjoying this,
they're doing something else,

310
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,300
like you're at the gym or you're driving
your car and commuting to work or school

311
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,300
or what have you,
like you're doing something else.

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,270
Exactly.
And,

313
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,890
and it's like the old radio see grew up 
in radio.

314
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,010
We

315
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,440
didn't have a TV until I was in like 
sixth or seventh grade.

316
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,160
And so when I'd come home from school in
the afternoon,

317
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,870
my brother and I looked through the 
radio listing just like TV guide and you

318
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,970
know,
was fibber mcgee and molly and the 

319
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,790
shadow and,
and my dad and I on Sunday afternoon 

320
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,680
down the basement would listen to all 
these great shows.

321
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,740
We had an episode of a news radio where 
Andy Dick became obsessed with fibber 

322
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,110
mcgee.
And Molly,

323
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,280
I remember that listening to all the 
recordings and laughing and like walking

324
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:24,281
into walls and stuff because he was 
laughing so hard and that was the first 

325
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,040
time I'd ever heard of them.
I can tell you where they lived.

326
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,650
Seventy nine wistful vista drive.
Wow.

327
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,720
I listened to all the February Mcgee and
molly,

328
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,590
that's silly,
you know,

329
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,180
it's such an interesting time in our,
in our society when the families used to

330
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:39,710
sit around the radio and listen to like 
orson wells and those kinds of things.

331
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,790
You,
that's all we had,

332
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,600
you know,
that uh,

333
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:46,601
you know,
I'm 71 now so I can go back a little 

334
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:46,601
ways.
But uh,

335
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:50,220
uh,
I don't feel like things have changed 

336
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,451
that much because podcasts have sort of 
turned into the old radio and people 

337
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:52,670
walk around.
Like you said,

338
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,290
it's a little different.
You're not sitting at home,

339
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
you know,
looking at radio.

340
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,920
Well,
in my case it's far less professional,

341
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,400
you know,
I'm not very unprofessional podcasts,

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,570
you know,
I don't listen to any podcasts.

343
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't know if there is such a thing as
there.

344
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,670
I guess.
Yeah,

345
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,940
there are actually.
Yeah,

346
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,470
I used to listen to a scientific 
American and they had a good 20 minute 

347
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,410
one that was a good,
but I kind of fell away from that.

348
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,060
A nurse at this hospital that I was 
going to get this procedure done,

349
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,090
recommended radio lab and the first one 
that I tuned into was this one about 

350
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:31,271
these Kenyan runners from this very 
specific village and she was just going 

351
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:34,550
on in depth about it and then like to 
hear her describe this intense thing and

352
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,810
then to actually listen to the show.

353
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,370
Like radial labs.
Really good.

354
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,640
They have like sound effects that they 
play while they're giving their talk on 

355
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,661
things.
They bring in people to have interviews 

356
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,210
and they sort of interject in the 
interview,

357
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:52,211
like build.
The guy will be talking and they'll 

358
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,580
explain like why this is so significant 
and like they'll.

359
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:57,581
And then let the guy talk more.
It's really interesting like the guy 

360
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:01,001
talks,
but instead of interrupting him as he's 

361
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:01,490
talking and he's just sort of edit 
things in after the fact.

362
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:06,491
So they're having an interview with a 
guy and they not just interview him but 

363
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,580
also interject in the middle of what 
he's doing,

364
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,820
various facts and information that 
actually enhance the story and make it 

365
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,010
richer,
really well done,

366
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,340
and it was all about this one tribe of 
runners is just like unbelievably 

367
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,481
awesome and it comes to this rite of 
passage ritual that they do with 

368
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,550
circumcision and I heard you talking 
about that with grant at the same track,

369
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,710
so awful terrible stuff,
but they became like super immune to the

370
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:35,711
response of pain or or to responding to 
pain or super determined or super 

371
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:41,861
whatever it is.
Their level of either their level of 

372
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,360
pain tolerance or their ability to 
suppress it,

373
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,060
whatever the hell it is,
but they must be converting that pain to

374
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:50,190
new kinds of energy of some kind for 
their long distance running.

375
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,630
Yeah.
I think that,

376
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:56,631
and I think it's also super critical in 
their society that you get through this 

377
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:58,260
ritual and if you don't get through this
ritual,

378
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,750
you're not thought of as a man.
Yeah.

379
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,950
We all have our rituals and there are a 
lot less painful than most places.

380
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,450
That one sounds.
So what's really insane was that this 

381
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,331
guy was talking about his sons and that 
he didn't want his sons to go through 

382
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,700
what he had to go through and he thought
personally as a person who did it,

383
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:23,050
that there was other ways to build 
character and I thought that was really 

384
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,050
interesting.

385
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,050
Yeah,
it is.

386
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,540
It's a,
it's a step in what we would call a more

387
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,980
civilized behavior,
but you know,

388
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,080
we'll have to take generations to see 
what.

389
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,310
So also love,
you know,

390
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,970
when there's like,
if you love your children,

391
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,550
you don't want them to go to the same 
kind of shit that you went through,

392
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,640
you know,
if you wanted to make an interesting 

393
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:41,640
person,
what do you do?

394
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:41,770
You give them bad parenting and drop 
them off in a shitty neighborhood.

395
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,520
That's what I want for my kids.
No,

396
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,930
I don't want.
My kid didn't want to grow up like I did

397
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:48,890
and I had a wonderful childhood,
but you know,

398
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,910
it wasn't perfect.
I think what we're working on now as a 

399
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,760
society,
whether it's on purpose or not,

400
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
by by you putting out those kinds of 
podcasts by me trying to have as many 

401
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,570
podcasts as I can,
what we're all working on,

402
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:06,571
I think is a.
we're all looking at this world that 

403
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,260
we're living in and going,
do we have to do things this way?

404
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,160
Is this,
this?

405
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,310
Is this really necessary?
And the more that word gets out,

406
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,680
it's not a violent word.
It's not.

407
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,140
It's just a realistic word.
It's,

408
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,980
it's,
we're,

409
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,240
we're all just going.
Come on.

410
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,150
Like,
what do you,

411
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
you know,
when we're not trying to run the world,

412
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:25,780
I don't want to hog up all the oil.
I want to steal anybody's natural gas,

413
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,640
but I also don't want to watch you do it
right.

414
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't want to watch this crazy world 
we're living in where it's really 

415
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,810
obvious that what things are being done 
are not fair.

416
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:39,811
It's really,
I don't think that you can have a 

417
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,961
society the way our society is where 
it's so big and so disconnected and not 

418
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:46,570
have people that are acting in their own
self interest,

419
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,020
but I don't think that that's the only 
way it can be done.

420
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,630
I think once we become more and more 
connected,

421
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,700
and I think podcasts are a big part of 
that,

422
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,120
psychedelics are a big part of that.
The Internet itself,

423
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,370
which is kind of Psychedelic,
is a big part of that.

424
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,370
As those things bring people closer and 
closer together,

425
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:06,220
I just think less of that kind of 
behaviors necessary.

426
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,030
Less of it is justified.
Let's have it is unexplained.

427
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:11,890
It's Kinda,
it's Kinda all out there now.

428
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,380
We understand people way better than we 
ever did.

429
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,190
Well,
we're realizing that we're all alike.

430
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,910
When you get down to the operator,
you know,

431
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,330
below the operating system to machine 
code.

432
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:26,331
Good.
One of my very closest friends in the 

433
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:26,331
world is Vietnamese.
He was a eight year old orphan time.

434
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,170
I was over there.
I didn't know him then,

435
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:30,390
but we've become really close over the 
years.

436
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,720
And uh,
once we got through all the culture and 

437
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,500
the politics and the religion,
just talking about people's stuff,

438
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,530
you know,
and his problems with his wife were the 

439
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:42,530
same as I was having with my girlfriend 
at the time.

440
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,220
And,
and on a human level,

441
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,820
we realize how just identical we are,
no matter where you go in the world,

442
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,720
you know,
people are,

443
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,780
are the same except they get the 
overlays of culture and religion and 

444
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,771
family and all that stuff.
But if you can break through those 

445
00:20:58,771 --> 00:20:59,650
barriers and that's where psychedelics I
think are very helpful.

446
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,330
You'll find out that we're all alike and
we can figure out how to get along

447
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,920
both different and alike.
But our differences are external.

448
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,700
The,
the,

449
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,610
the,
the actual human being like what does,

450
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,180
what does the person want out of this 
life?

451
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,010
Right?
What is,

452
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
we want happiness,

453
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,750
right?
I,

454
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,670
I wouldn't want to get rid of any 
culture.

455
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:21,671
I think they're there.
What added all the spice and the flavor 

456
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:21,671
to the world.
We want to see the cultures,

457
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,650
but I think we need to quit fighting.
You know,

458
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,070
we never quit fighting.

459
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,090
Well,
there's also an issue that a lot of 

460
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,090
cultures evolve around these ideas that 
are outdated,

461
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,970
antiquated,
crazy.

462
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,370
In fact,
there's a lot of religious cultures that

463
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,770
are there.
He has a beautiful culture.

464
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,930
It's really interesting.
Their artworks fantastic.

465
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,000
They're the way they dress is really 
fascinating,

466
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:45,001
but Jesus Christ,
look how progressive they are to each 

467
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:45,001
other.
Look how they treat women.

468
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:49,051
Look at Saudi Arabia in 2013 women have 
to protest for their right to drive a 

469
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:54,241
car like Holy Shit,
and look on the way they have to dress 

470
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:54,730
in that heat and they get the black 
clothes,

471
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,670
not the white ones.
It's completely insane.

472
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,710
It's,
it's old as fuck.

473
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,740
It's ridiculous.
It was from a time when people didn't 

474
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:04,740
know any better,
right?

475
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,300
The idea that your God wants you to do 
that is beyond ridiculous.

476
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,210
You know,
religion is basically superstition when 

477
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,210
you come down to it.

478
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,360
A huge part of it,
and I get the idea that I get that 

479
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,640
people need a higher power or believe in
a higher power,

480
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:23,641
100 percent,
but if you can't see that there's the 

481
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,951
hand of man and something that tells you
that you should stone homosexuals to 

482
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:27,280
death.
You can't see the hand of man in that.

483
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,440
You really think that that's the way God
would handle it.

484
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,970
Why would it God invent homosexuals in 
the first place if you don't think that 

485
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,080
they're doing that because they're born 
that way?

486
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,220
Look there I'm sure have been men who 
are heterosexual who are like,

487
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,370
let's see what the fuss is all about and
went over and did some gay shit.

488
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,710
Why not?
I'm sure it happened.

489
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,940
Nothing.
Nothing wrong with that,

490
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,350
but the reality of being gay,
if you've ever met anybody who's gay,

491
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:54,910
is that most people who are gay always 
knew it from the time they were born.

492
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,920
Now,
why would God create that?

493
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,190
What would you got to create someone who
was born in a way that makes them just 

494
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,180
by nature of existing,
you're allowed to stone them to death.

495
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,590
You should stone them to death.

496
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,130
Well,
you know,

497
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:09,520
my youngest son is gay and when he 
finally came out I said,

498
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:09,850
well,
you know,

499
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:12,850
I've been talking to your sister about 
this for 10 years.

500
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,320
And he said,
he said,

501
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,540
well,
I knew I was gay that long too.

502
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
He said,
I just had to get the courage to come 

503
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,161
out and just last January he got married
in Washington DC and it was a,

504
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,530
he was a kind of a big deal at the 
Kennedy Center.

505
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:31,531
And so it was a big society wedding and 
it was amazing social event with 

506
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:34,540
hundreds of people there and people from
the State Department and everywhere.

507
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,910
And Wow.
And uh,

508
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,220
you could,
you could tell the tables that were the 

509
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,090
old established straight people who came
just to be polite at first,

510
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,390
but it turned into such a wonderful 
party and they had the wedding and then 

511
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,940
a dinner and then the reception all in 
the same place.

512
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,940
And everybody stayed until the thing 
closed down.

513
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,400
They were having their.
Mainly the old people are watching.

514
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,080
The young people danced because,
uh,

515
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,100
well my,
my,

516
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:03,101
uh,
my son's husband is a principal dancer 

517
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:03,101
at the Susan Farrell Valet.

518
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:04,180
Wait a minute.
Gay Ballet Dancer.

519
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,190
This story just doesn't make any sense.
You don't think there'd be whether 

520
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,040
there's one or two.
Is it a funding that there's certain,

521
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:16,041
like,
like if you hear guys an interior 

522
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,041
decorator,
Bam.

523
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,750
I mean,
how many straight dudes.

524
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,050
I'm sure there are some or they get mad 
at me saying this right now,

525
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:25,051
but I don't know why it is,
but there's something about certain 

526
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:25,051
professions

527
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,500
and uh,
you know what you were really,

528
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,570
you know,
they don't look gay or not gay.

529
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,280
But boy is he a hell of a dancer?

530
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,780
Well,
you know,

531
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,760
that's always been the rumor about John 
Travolta.

532
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,790
He's probably not even gay.
People are excited about Saturday night 

533
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,660
fever was still good.
It was too good.

534
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,870
It was just changed the way people 
decided to mate.

535
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,320
But you know,
if mating dance,

536
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,770
if you want to

537
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,790
go to a fun wedding,
just go to a same sex marriage because 

538
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:52,830
it's new for them.
It's something.

539
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,310
They're really celebrating something for
the first time.

540
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,110
It's a very joyous occasion.

541
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,830
They don't feel pressured into it.
Not like you guys have been together for

542
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:03,690
five years and he hasn't gotten your 
ring.

543
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:04,700
This is bullshit,
right?

544
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,690
You need to let him know that this is 
unacceptable.

545
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,550
All Gay guys don't have a girlfriend 
like that.

546
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,330
They're doing it out of love there and 
they're a wonderful couple.

547
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,170
Where's the.
Where is it legal now?

548
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:19,620
How many states is gay marriage?
About 15 or something like that.

549
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,070
It's happening right?
Slowly but surely.

550
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,210
Yeah.
See he had just moved to Florida taking 

551
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,210
a new job and they'd already had all 
these plans,

552
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,410
but he couldn't get married in Florida,
so they left everything in DC.

553
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,600
15 states.
We're seeing a legal same sex marriage 

554
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,670
and then there's also more states were 
34 that ban same sex marriage.

555
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:47,551
There's more than ban it,
but recently there's been a federal 

556
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,390
decision.
The tax department is going to recognize

557
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,000
it no matter what state they live in.
This is fascinating though.

558
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:56,150
There's states where it's banned.
It's like they have banned same sex 

559
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,500
marriages,
34 of them.

560
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,860
That's amazing.
I really had to go out of the way there.

561
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,190
What?
It's so stupid.

562
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,660
It's so stupid.
It's hard to believe.

563
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,690
It's so stupid that people in this day 
and age decide what two people can't do 

564
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,700
because of their sex.
Like if she.

565
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,440
If marriage is legal,
okay,

566
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,260
and I'm not sure it should be,
but if marriage is legal,

567
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,180
why shouldn't it be legal for gay 
people?

568
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,360
It's just so sensible.
It's so dumb.

569
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,030
It's such a weird thing to get behind.

570
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,070
It's like,
what's your end game here?

571
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:31,310
I don't understand how you're getting 
behind anybody who would be getting 

572
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,920
behind this outside of some crazy 
religious belief.

573
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,560
You've lost me.
What do you care?

574
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,230
What do you care?
And the idea that somehow know that it's

575
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:42,231
going to eventually cost us money or 
there's tracks was it was some stupid 

576
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:46,341
arguments that you see the convoluted 
about why people being gang getting 

577
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:50,151
married would make any difference or 
cost any more or less than them not 

578
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,020
getting married or them or straight 
people getting.

579
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,240
This is w.
What studies are you talking about?

580
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,330
What do you know who studies on this and
these homophobes that are just insane 

581
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,780
for what they're saying,
you know,

582
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:05,781
that that gave Mary or same sex marriage
now is going to cause everybody to go 

583
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:06,510
out and rape children.
I mean,

584
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:09,480
they're making this stuff up that's just
unbelievable.

585
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,130
If that's maybe like,
just information,

586
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,820
maybe like the,
maybe the,

587
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:15,720
the gay marriage people who are pro gay 
marriage are saying shit like that.

588
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,770
Just to make it such a retarded 
argument.

589
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,560
Clever move.
You know?

590
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,390
It is,
it is.

591
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,320
Um,
yeah.

592
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:24,100
It's,
it's one of those weird things where I,

593
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,420
I can't believe it's still around.
It's like I remember when I was a kid,

594
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,570
I've told this story,
but in the interest of this particular 

595
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,711
discussion when I was like,
I guess I was 11 years old and I had 

596
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:39,951
moved from San Francisco to Florida and 
there's a lot of things that I didn't 

597
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:39,951
know.
San Francisco.

598
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:44,610
He was incredibly open minded and I 
really remember being very aware of the 

599
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:50,091
difference immediately upon moving to 
Florida because I had a friend from Mark

600
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,950
Cuban Friends Name Candy and his Dad,
ca candy.

601
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,480
Escondido or something like that is 
crazy.

602
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,590
Last name,
I forget his last name,

603
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,890
but his dad was screaming and yelling,
slamming the newspaper on the table.

604
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:05,880
I can't believe this shit.
And I was like trying to figure out what

605
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:06,980
was going on,
you know,

606
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,270
and I was like,
what's Your Dad Mad?

607
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,030
And He goes,
like,

608
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,840
Dad,
what are you mad at?

609
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,360
Darlington?
Fag,

610
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,590
Mary,
you believe this shit,

611
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,720
they're going to let those homos marry 
each other.

612
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,970
He was mad.
He was throwing the newspaper down.

613
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,620
I was 11.
And I was like,

614
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:22,980
what a silly man you are.
You're a grown man and this is something

615
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:27,981
that bothers you and concerns you.
I remember thinking that an 11 year old 

616
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:27,981
boy,
like,

617
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:32,241
wow,
there's a lot of weak ass bitches out 

618
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:32,241
there posing as men.
Like you dummy.

619
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,240
Yeah.
Like what do you care like you were,

620
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,600
you were at tough guy because you care.

621
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
The two guys want to kiss each other.
Like,

622
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,760
what the fuck is wrong with you?
It's just a stupid.

623
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,150
It's such a dumb thing to get behind.
You know,

624
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,990
our little granddaughters,
uh,

625
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,010
last January they were like four and a 
half and uh,

626
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,070
just turned eight and I came back from 
the wedding and they were still saying 

627
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,880
no two boys got married.
Did they kiss?

628
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:54,300
And I said,
yeah,

629
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,110
let we show the pictures of them.
And so now they're really cool with it.

630
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:03,111
And uh,
one of them the other day told her 

631
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:03,111
teacher about a,
yeah,

632
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,260
bob was a little boy,
is married to a boy,

633
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,920
so it's going to be normal for these 
people.

634
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,070
It should have been normal.
Long time ago when I was a kid,

635
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:13,290
I lived in San Francisco next to this 
gay couple.

636
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,960
It was a black guy and his boyfriend is 
white dude.

637
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,230
And my aunt used to go down there and 
they would smoke pot and play bongos 

638
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,870
naked.
They would all get together.

639
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,250
I was like,
fucking seven.

640
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,330
They would all go next door to the gay 
couples house.

641
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:30,000
It was totally,
completely normal.

642
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,980
It was like,
there's a black guy,

643
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,050
there's an Asian guy,
there was a gay guy.

644
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,520
It's like good another guy.
It's like,

645
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:40,521
it's no big deal.
I didn't even know what the word nigger 

646
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,070
meant when I moved to Florida.
I asked mother and she

647
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,310
got mad at me because she thought I was 
playing games and I said,

648
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,900
I don't know what it means.
What does it mean?

649
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,740
Because someone said it at school and 
she just.

650
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,950
She said it's a derogatory term for 
black people.

651
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,690
I was like,
wow.

652
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,970
Really?
And you were,

653
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
what?
Seven years old?

654
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,030
I was 11.
Eleven is when I first moved to Florida.

655
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,270
I was,
because I couldn't believe it.

656
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,990
I hadn't experienced hardly any racism.
And in San Francisco,

657
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,250
San Francisco in the seventies,
it was just the,

658
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,900
the,
the,

659
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,460
the age of Utopia had expired.
Right.

660
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:13,000
Which is like the 19 sixties,
the late 19 sixties in San Francisco.

661
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,270
But there was still an echo of like 
understanding and progressive thinking 

662
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,450
in San Francisco,
like no other place.

663
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,470
Right.
So it was a big difference to go from 

664
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,400
San Francisco in the seventies to 
fucking Gainesville,

665
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,850
Florida.
Right.

666
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Which is just back ass retarded.
They were feeding the alligators 

667
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,250
marshmallows and this fucking lake near 
my house.

668
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,590
I mean,
it was ridiculous.

669
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:39,160
The difference,

670
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,240
I moved from California,
from Florida and that's where all my 

671
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,550
kids live,
but it's not fit for human habitation.

672
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,760
I wouldn't not go back.

673
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,850
It's a crazy fucking state.

674
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,730
And you know,
I lived in San Francisco in the late 66,

675
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:55,731
early [inaudible] 67 and I had just 
gotten married my now ex wife,

676
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:59,670
but she was a Texan,
born and raised in Houston.

677
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:00,930
And,
and uh,

678
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,180
she had a three year old son who's my 
son.

679
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:05,400
He's my oldest son and uh,
you know,

680
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,120
adopted him and he was in the navy,
but uh,

681
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,700
we're in San Francisco,
is our first a month living together and

682
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,860
she grew up in the south and called 
black people narrows.

683
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,270
And I said,
you know,

684
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,480
we're going to have more kids.
We just can't have that.

685
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:19,080
And she said,
well,

686
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,240
that's just what we do.
And,

687
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,180
and I said,
well,

688
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,470
let's make a deal.
Not Do that.

689
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:23,340
And she said,
well,

690
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,980
you're smoking.
I don't want them smoking.

691
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,520
And that's the day I quit smoking.
And she never said nigger again.

692
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,890
Quit smoking cigarettes.
But our kids are pretty well balanced.

693
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,330
Wow.
That's a great story.

694
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,510
That's a,
you know,

695
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,380
sometimes it just takes one thing to get
you to quit something as stupid as small

696
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:44,100
group.
One realization I had,

697
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I have a really important reason and I 
didn't want my kids growing up like 

698
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,120
that.
It's

699
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,120
beautiful.
Well,

700
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,181
you shouldn't want them growing up 
around someone who smoked cigarettes 

701
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:53,181
too,
right?

702
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:53,181
Well,
that's true.

703
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:55,710
It's a weird thing that they did where 
they got that through.

704
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I mean,
if you want to really look at problems 

705
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,500
that we have right now in our culture,
there's a big one and there's a big one 

706
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,020
that all these people who run for office
who get into office,

707
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,420
they're all concerned with the loss of 
lives.

708
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,180
They're all concerned with health and 
safety.

709
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,690
They're all concerned with environmental
pollution.

710
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:20,691
They're concerned with economic growth,
are concerned with all these different 

711
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,980
things to benefit human beings,
but yet they never mentioned cigarettes.

712
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,250
I mean,
you want to talk about one of the 

713
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,890
biggest and most obvious pieces of 
evidence for conspiracy,

714
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,370
a conspiracy where half a fucking 
billion people die every year.

715
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,850
I mean,
how many fucking people die every year 

716
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:40,850
from cigarettes?
It's like 4,000

717
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,540
in America,
just in this country.

718
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,250
We would.
I don't know what it is worldwide,

719
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:45,470
but it's got to be something crazy.
Now we find out what the number is.

720
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,070
Nobody's ever died from cannabis and Odi
of cannabis.

721
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,220
It just imagine that there was an issue 
where 400,000

722
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,280
people died in your,
in your country a year,

723
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,220
$400,000,
and yet no one brings it up ever.

724
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:03,430
That's insanity.
That's so hard to believe that you're 

725
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,310
not talking about 400,000
lifetime,

726
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:09,430
which is an insane body account.
That's an insane body count for more 

727
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,120
than all the wars civil thing about like
19.

728
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,930
You know,
whenever the.

729
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,460
They found out that cigarettes are bad 
for you.

730
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:16,460
It was the 19 fifties or sixties or 
whatever it was where they first started

731
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:16,910
going,
hey,

732
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,060
I think there's a connection between 
these people dying of fucking cancer and

733
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,640
smoking on these burning chemical soaked
rags.

734
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,180
You know,
there might be a connection there that 

735
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,220
think about how many people have died 
since then.

736
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,480
Millions,
many,

737
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,650
many things.
And then each,

738
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,390
you're an estimated 443,000
people and other pushing them on,

739
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:35,990
uh,
on the Asian kids,

740
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:36,410
you know,
that's,

741
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,900
they're really pushing cigarettes over 
there because it's not growing here.

742
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,000
Put that backups here.
It says each year an estimated 443,000

743
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,360
die prematurely from smoking or exposure
to secondhand smoke,

744
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:52,361
which is even darker.
And another eight point 6 million live 

745
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:52,550
with a serious illness caused by 
smoking.

746
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Wow.
Approximately 46 point 6 million US 

747
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,760
adults smoked cigarettes.
Wow,

748
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:06,761
that's scary.
But both my father and my brother died 

749
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,330
from smoking cigarettes.
That's an insane number.

750
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,900
I didn't know it was that high.
Wow.

751
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:15,080
That's like under 4 million a decade.
Just.

752
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:20,110
It's also like knowing that you've been,
like your society has been infiltrated 

753
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,480
by like aliens that are designed to kill
people.

754
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,060
If it was aliens that were killing 
people and not cigarettes,

755
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,030
we would be terrified.
We'd feel like we're under attack.

756
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,540
It will be a war and cigarettes.
Yeah.

757
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:33,710
There's these aliens are killing 400,000
people every year.

758
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:37,550
What do we do that making 800 million 
people sick as well?

759
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:38,810
Like fuck,
what do we do?

760
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,580
And you know,
people that say,

761
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,980
well,
I'm going to smoke until I'm 45 or 50 or

762
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:47,981
whatever.
My father and my brother both spoke 

763
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,740
until they were about 50 and they each 
only lived about 10 years after they 

764
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,190
quit smoking.
They both died at 63.

765
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,810
So,
uh,

766
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,440
you know,
it's all smoking.

767
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,230
I did it,
you know,

768
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,540
it's,
it's horrible.

769
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,060
It's amazing how many people go for 
that.

770
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,340
It's so hard to quit.
You know,

771
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,070
you have to have some kind of really big
motivation because it's.

772
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,260
Nicotine is more addicting than heroin.

773
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,720
I've heard that before.
Um,

774
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:11,380
it sounds like it makes sense,
but you know,

775
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,820
the heroin addiction is and what 
everybody thinks is not 100 percent.

776
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,030
This is closer to only about 30 percent 
really good.

777
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,380
Physically addicted.
Really?

778
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,820
Yeah.
It's low nicotine's,

779
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:22,820
but 75 percent and heroines about 30 
percent.

780
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,090
We need to find out who those lucky 
bitches are that are like 25 percent non

781
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,060
addicted to cigarettes,
30 percent non addicted to heroin.

782
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,790
Figuring out who those guys are.
Check their jeans.

783
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,950
Yeah.
What an awesome fucking trait to have.

784
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,410
Not get addicted,
you know,

785
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,740
it's,
it's really sad.

786
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,770
It's really sad because it's just 
evidence that as long as money is 

787
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:48,051
around,
you're not looking at people's health 

788
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:48,051
and welfare

789
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:51,910
and,
and most of us are addicted to caffeine 

790
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,660
like it or not know when you do a diet 
for Iowasca,

791
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:57,661
you have to go off caffeine for at least
a week ahead of time as well in our 

792
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,580
tradition that I'm involved in or was 
involved in that caffeine was one of the

793
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:02,860
things you gave up for at least a week 
ahead of time.

794
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:06,160
And I had to start weaning myself a 
month ahead of time.

795
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:11,161
Just cutting it down and less and less 
because when I go cold Turkey on 

796
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:11,800
caffeine,
within three days,

797
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:14,410
I'm up standing up all night with cramps
in my legs.

798
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Not just the headaches.
Really at caffeine that takes go cold 

799
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,400
Turkey on caffeine for just even if you 
only drink two or three cups a day.

800
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,160
Well I used to,
um,

801
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,180
when I would stay up late writing,
I would drink a shitload of coffee and 

802
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,300
all I was concerned with was getting the
writing done.

803
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,570
And then I realized one day I woke up 
and the next morning got out fucking 

804
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,000
pounding headache and I was like,
oh my head,

805
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,010
or then I realized they're just hadn't 
had a cup of coffee yet and I went no 

806
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,040
way.
Like I allowed myself to get this hooked

807
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,570
on this shit.
So I quit.

808
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,930
And then I took like several months off.
Then I started drinking coffee 

809
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,861
conservatively since then.
But I went without it for quite a while 

810
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:53,861
because it was just like,
that's.

811
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:58,661
I don't like that.
Like I had a headache from not having 

812
00:36:58,661 --> 00:36:58,790
something that didn't make any sense.
That's stupid.

813
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Well,
after I had been off,

814
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,750
you know,
we do a week before and the week after 

815
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:04,750
and after I'd been off it for two weeks,
a half a cup of coffee,

816
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,010
lammy buzzing all day.
I mean,

817
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:11,011
it's a real drug.
It's a great drug if you only use it 

818
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:11,011
once in a while,

819
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:11,490
it's legit.
You know,

820
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:14,120
it's another thing about coffee is it's 
everywhere.

821
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,650
I mean,
you want to talk about a drug that you 

822
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,251
can just tap into every five steps.
It's the only drug that labor contracts 

823
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,040
require.
You have to have a coffee break.

824
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,450
Yeah.
That's interesting,

825
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,190
isn't it?
Yeah.

826
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,940
When,
you know,

827
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,970
back in the old days,
they used to smoke cigarettes in the 

828
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:30,970
office.
Oh,

829
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:30,970
the old days.
Uh,

830
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,590
let's see.
Well,

831
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:36,591
I guess it was a while ago,
but about 18 years ago is when they 

832
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:36,770
finally got rid of it where I was,
where.

833
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,260
Oh Wow.
And rise in 18 years.

834
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,330
It wasn't verizon,
those Gtd then.

835
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,450
But uh,
yeah.

836
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,500
And you know,
cubicle hell and there was one corner.

837
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:51,501
They put all the.
See all the people in the one corner 

838
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:51,501
there were smokers,
you know.

839
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:51,501
And of course it filled the whole room 
any hours.

840
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:54,690
So you could see this little cloud over 
this one area.

841
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,720
What year was it where they did it with 
airplanes because I remember the 

842
00:37:59,720 --> 00:37:59,990
airplane thing.
I remember if I,

843
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,340
I remember a lot of airplane rides and 
smoking though.

844
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,460
It's so weird.
The airplane thing was so weird because 

845
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,221
I had to sit and smoke and a couple of 
times with the only seats that were 

846
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:10,350
available.
What was the difference between smoking?

847
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,510
It didn't matter,
but you know when you're trying to get a

848
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:13,920
seat and that's all they have.
The sorry.

849
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,900
Oh,
you a know,

850
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,940
but I mean the.
The smoke was the same no matter where 

851
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,940
you were in the plane,
you know,

852
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,210
what I felt like and how much filtration
are they even doing?

853
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,130
I mean,
how much can they do?

854
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:28,131
Where are they getting there for them?
I know there's been some lawsuits by 

855
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:28,131
flight attendants who got cancer from 
secondhand smoke.

856
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:33,080
Oh,
I would imagine that the flight 

857
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,671
attendants are smoking in this picture.
What happened to our world where people 

858
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:36,250
just smoked up a fucking storm like 
this?

859
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,800
Well also there's some improvement.
Yeah,

860
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,630
but what a weird,
weird,

861
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:45,631
weird habit.
Their habit that kills half a fucking 

862
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:46,390
million people every year,
just in one country,

863
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,220
country world.
What is the worldwide?

864
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:50,560
Did we find out what the worldwide 
cigarette deaths are?

865
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,160
Let me find out right here because I 
need to know this.

866
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:54,640
This just doesn't even make sense.

867
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,440
No,
and I don't think we're still 

868
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,440
subsidizing tobacco farmers,
but we may be.

869
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,650
We had been up until very recently.
I know.

870
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,730
It's hilarious.
Isn't it?

871
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,380
Well,
we subsidized oil companies.

872
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:08,020
I didn't know about that until Ana 
Kasparian told me about it.

873
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,040
I.
I heard her talking about that and I'll 

874
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,040
tell you what,
the oil depletion allowance is.

875
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,031
Part of the reason Kennedy was murdered,
the oil depletion allowance in Texas is 

876
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:18,370
huge.

877
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,740
Tobacco use Kilz.
Five point 4 million a year.

878
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,380
Oh my God.
What does that one say?

879
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:28,710
Eight dollars million.
$5 million deaths by 20.

880
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:33,711
30.
The one I'm looking at is I'm a World 

881
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:34,320
Health Organization.
I'm on the CDC.

882
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,100
Don't know which one's more legit.
Which ones more legit?

883
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,420
It was $5 million.
$5.

884
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,260
Million deaths per year.
That is so many God damn people.

885
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,260
Can you work for that company?
How do you be that company?

886
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,840
You know,
but.

887
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,470
But you know what?
Here's the other problem.

888
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm pro you doing whatever you want to 
do.

889
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,750
I don't have a problem with as long as

890
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,710
it doesn't.
Yeah.

891
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,040
In harm.
Somebody else.

892
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:56,670
Well,
you know,

893
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,370
when my dad died that harmed my mother.
Yes.

894
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,560
Smoking is harming people no matter what
you're doing and that secondhand smoke.

895
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:06,920
A lot of people get cancer because they 
live with a small group.

896
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,750
There are some studies to say it's even 
worse than smoking itself,

897
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,850
so that's ridiculous.
And you know,

898
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:14,100
I grew up in a house with a secondhand 
smoke.

899
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:19,101
My Dad was a smoker and uh,
my mom was a smoker when I was really 

900
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:19,290
young.
She gave it up,

901
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:24,291
I think by the time I was seven.
We had a basement workbench and back 

902
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,200
then and all the beer was in tall 
bottles and uh,

903
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,410
my dad would be down there working in 
the basement and my little brother who 

904
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:30,410
was four and a half years younger than 
me,

905
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,850
he had a habit of going around draining 
the bottles.

906
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:33,660
And my dad had,
well when he,

907
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,720
he left a little bit of beer and the 
bottom one for his cigarette thing and 

908
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:38,720
he'd dropped about three or four bullets
in it.

909
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,120
My brother,
he can still see him spewing his puke as

910
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:45,780
he ran up the stairs.

911
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,590
Yeah,
I'd imagine what that must have tasted 

912
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,571
like.
I don't think he drank beer as a 

913
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:53,571
teenager.
He had a bad tasting.

914
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,060
That's hilarious.
That doesn't even seem real does doesn't

915
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,120
mean that seems like something.
If you had to explain to someone who 

916
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,120
didn't understand human beings,
you know,

917
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,680
the expression always used.
If an alien came here and was viewing 

918
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,130
our culture and they saw this aspect of 
it,

919
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,980
they'd be like,
what the fuck are you people doing?

920
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,420
Well,
I,

921
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,840
I started smoking in freshman year in 
high school.

922
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,310
You know,
that's the thing everybody had to do.

923
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,830
My sister did as well.
I tried it.

924
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,630
I was a year older than her.
I tried a cigarette.

925
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm was marco.
This is stupid.

926
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,830
Oh,
I hated it.

927
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:24,660
It took me a long time.
I feel like it,

928
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:26,180
but I wanted to be in the crowd,
you know,

929
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,620
peer pressure.
Well,

930
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:30,880
I know a lot of people.
Brian Read Ben who is on this show,

931
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,980
he,
um,

932
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,850
he's quit a couple of times and he just 
can't do it.

933
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,650
He quits.
Then he gets right back to it.

934
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890
He got sick recently.
We took off like nine days and going 

935
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:41,890
right back to it,
he just,

936
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,790
he just gets pulled right back into it.
Even those e-cigarettes,

937
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,790
like he doesn't even use those,
you know,

938
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,460
I don't,
I just,

939
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,540
I don't understand how people can,
can see all these numbers and not,

940
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,550
not think it applies to them.
That's,

941
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,570
that's an addiction that's I know,
but it's a weird one.

942
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,920
Like why would you kill yourself like 
that?

943
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,310
That's the weirdest one ever because 
it's so slow.

944
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,960
God,
but it's gotta be.

945
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,040
It's gotta be pretty fast though.
It's inevitable.

946
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,050
You say slow,
but those people,

947
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,120
they feel like shit when they walk 
upstairs and stuff like that's not slow 

948
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,571
man,
because that's like diminishing your 

949
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:16,571
life right now.

950
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:17,630
What it means to me,
if you can't go up the stairs fast,

951
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,240
if you're a normal person and you,
you're not old,

952
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:23,120
you're not a,
you're not injured and you can't walk up

953
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:25,160
a flight of stairs without being out of 
breath.

954
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,680
Right?
Like your life is on like real,

955
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:32,681
like low water.
You've got something wrong and you're 

956
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:32,681
not.
You know,

957
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:33,320
if you don't,
that's all the energy you have.

958
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,470
You're missing energy.
Like something has robbed you of energy.

959
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,680
I don't know if you realize it because 
this new life that you have,

960
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,710
this is just your reality.
It's like having water in your ears and 

961
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:44,710
then you cleaned the water out and 
you're like,

962
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,040
oh,
now I can hear like your.

963
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,720
When you pop your ears and coming home 
from an airplane ride and you're,

964
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:54,721
you know,
you feel stopped up and you pinch your 

965
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:54,721
nose and then blow on it so the air 
can't get out.

966
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:55,310
Your ears pop and you go,
oh,

967
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,630
this is what it sounds like.

968
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,370
Well,
you know,

969
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:58,490
my,
my aunt and uncle,

970
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:03,491
she lived into her nineties but my poor 
uncle died a lot younger and they were 

971
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:08,941
both smokers.
He finally quit because he had 

972
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:10,950
emphysema.
He'd be sitting there with the oxygen 

973
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,430
and she'd be smoking right next to him,
outlived him by 20 years.

974
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,990
Of course she did poisoned them.
It's just what a weird thing.

975
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,550
Yeah.
People poison each other,

976
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,990
you know,
it's poison wives.

977
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
There's a Bob newhart stand up or it's 
one of his old things where he'd sit on 

978
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,250
the stage and put is that Jamie's?
That their lungs,

979
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,630
black lung,
Lachlan's,

980
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,940
black lungs are smokers and the other 
ones are,

981
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,000
what is it?
Why is it,

982
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,730
why is it hooked up to a machine?
Is making them inflate,

983
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,260
inflate,
and here's.

984
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,640
Oh,
so it's showing you what a,

985
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:39,230
an actual black cigarette smoking

986
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,960
[inaudible] lung is like,
wow,

987
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,590
this is a wild long,
a healthy lung.

988
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,120
Oh my God.
What a difference.

989
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:47,460
A difference.
That's insane.

990
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,790
You need to put your wallpaper on your 
computer if you're a smoker.

991
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,000
Just the color.
So horrifying.

992
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,650
So you know,
they're not working very well.

993
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,540
Oh my God.
That aren't working well.

994
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,610
Yeah,
I know.

995
00:43:59,611 --> 00:44:00,060
Smart

996
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,340
people that love cigarettes.
It's so weird.

997
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,680
You know,
this is gold Bob newhart routine.

998
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:06,390
You'd sit in a chair and put a shooter 
here.

999
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,160
And he was Sir Walter Raleigh,
uh,

1000
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,430
or he was a guy in England and Sir 
Walter Raleigh was calling him,

1001
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,370
telling him about the stuff you sent him
back and he says it's called tobacco and

1002
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:19,470
and it's a leaf and you light it on fire
and what do you do with it?

1003
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,640
It's really a classic non smoking a bit.
That's funny.

1004
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,450
And that was probably from 1960 or 
something.

1005
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,150
Probably the fifties maybe.
Maybe.

1006
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,400
I don't know when he started his.
One of his early things.

1007
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:29,760
This,
it.

1008
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,810
There it is.
There it is.

1009
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:31,170
Yeah.

1010
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,010
You pick up your extension.
What?

1011
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:35,220
What'd you.
It's not in wall again.

1012
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,510
I love baby gets good air.
And Your Hawaii,

1013
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,580
they're fine.
Heroin while they got a.

1014
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,220
bought all the turkeys over here last 
November.

1015
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,710
There are still A.
Yeah,

1016
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,880
they're walking all over London.
See that in my holiday over here while 

1017
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:02,500
in America you've got another winter for
us.

1018
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:07,501
So while told faculty what's tobacco?
While a late.

1019
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,080
You've got tons of it.
You probably 80 tons of leads while 

1020
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,190
you're building for awhile.
But I don't know if you noticed last 

1021
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:33,541
time.
We have plenty of leads over here in 

1022
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:33,541
England.

1023
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:37,860
We're up to.
It's a special kind of leave it some 

1024
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:41,920
kind of folded as it was.
Not Exactly.

1025
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,230
Uh,
what,

1026
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:47,140
what do you do with Elise Wall?
Lots of different things.

1027
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,080
I do things now.
And once you take a pinch of tobacco,

1028
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,980
I imagine it was.
Yeah.

1029
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,910
Baghdad.
Golden rods seems to do it over here.

1030
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:21,930
While tobacco has to use it,
if you can feel it mentally,

1031
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,200
but other than that little piece of 
paper,

1032
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,360
roll it up.
You don't have to tell me why you stick 

1033
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,360
it in your ear.
Right.

1034
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,470
Okay.
Well,

1035
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,760
and I want to get people in it.
Oh,

1036
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,300
you want to get on the inner go the 
boys.

1037
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,070
I was just so funny.
Build your coffee.

1038
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,710
What coffee was at the drink you make 
out of beans and then you know,

1039
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,010
you drink it in the morning.
Why do you.

1040
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah.

1041
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,740
One time I was on the ball.
If you can help them with branding lead,

1042
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,370
I'm sure they'll go for the beat.

1043
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:50,940
You

1044
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,280
don't call me anymore.

1045
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,870
Oh,
that's great.

1046
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,880
From

1047
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,900
I saw it actually on the Ed Sullivan 
show.

1048
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:07,850
We used to watch that every Sunday 
night.

1049
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,700
Jackie gleason the Saturday Ed Sullivan 
on Sunday.

1050
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,670
Wow,
that's fascinating.

1051
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,520
That's a.
the,

1052
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,330
the,
the just the way he broke,

1053
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,540
broke it down was really interesting 
without even bringing up the deaths.

1054
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:21,870
It's still hilarious.
Yeah.

1055
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:23,180
It's like,
why would you do that?

1056
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,340
He didn't have,
he didn't state any of the health 

1057
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:28,340
concerns and this was before they were 
really known too.

1058
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:28,730
Isn't that funny?

1059
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,740
You know,
his early sixties,

1060
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,150
late fifties,
something like,

1061
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,760
did you ever see the lean narrow 
Leonardo dicaprio movie about,

1062
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,150
um,
J Edgar Hoover?

1063
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,330
No,
I haven't seen that.

1064
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,360
When j Edgar Hoover was a young,
he was kind of sickly and so his doctor 

1065
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,591
prescribed cigarettes.
That's what made him somewhere and 

1066
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:51,860
wanted him to smoke cigarettes.
We knew as a young man,

1067
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:56,861
like his mother in the movie is like 
saying to him and I listened to the 

1068
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:59,370
doctorate and smoke those cigarettes.
Wow.

1069
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,730
Yeah,
it's weird

1070
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:02,520
that,
you know,

1071
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:07,521
that was a peer pressure cultural thing 
you started at when you're really young 

1072
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:07,521
because other guys were doing or the 
movies,

1073
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:09,150
you know,
the movies really pushed cigarettes.

1074
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:10,980
You can't see any of his old black and 
white movies.

1075
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:11,480
I'm smoking.

1076
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,630
That's true.
Right.

1077
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,030
And TV shows everybody always smoke 
cigarettes.

1078
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,500
It was like a part of being cool.
So newscasters use to smoke,

1079
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:19,770
you know,
that's so weird.

1080
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,430
News casters,
they are,

1081
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,610
that's the one of the weirdest rungs of 
show business is the newscaster.

1082
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,530
To me,
when I look at news casting,

1083
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,440
I feel like it's like I'm watching a 
silent movie,

1084
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,770
you know,
this is like some antiquated form of 

1085
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,080
entertainment that we don't need 
anymore.

1086
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:42,350
Like the way if you watch an old like 
animated or an old.

1087
00:49:42,361 --> 00:49:46,770
I'm a black and white film where,
where it has subtitles and like,

1088
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,800
like Nosferatu.
It's kind of fascinating because it's a 

1089
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:51,800
time capsule,
you know,

1090
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,050
you're looking into this time where this
was the relevant form of medium.

1091
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:56,590
This is,
this is how the,

1092
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,910
they got their film out.
It had to be like this,

1093
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,110
there was no sound.

1094
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,650
So they would play some music and then 
there will be a,

1095
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,540
like a script and the script would be 
red and you know,

1096
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,790
break in between scenes and the screen 
would go and be alive.

1097
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,480
Piano playing and yeah.
Yeah.

1098
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,620
But if someone tried to do that today,
you'd be like,

1099
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:16,020
what the fuck are you doing?
Like this is so stupid.

1100
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,540
Why don't you just make a movie?
Like why are you doing this?

1101
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:22,230
Like let them talk like why you just,
why is it only written?

1102
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:27,290
That's so dumb.
And that's sort of what it's like when 

1103
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,880
you watch a newscast.
It's like why are doing it like this?

1104
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:28,040
They

1105
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,780
read the news,
you read the news,

1106
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:31,790
but you,
you barely cover anything.

1107
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,820
You cover these little tiny three minute
chunks on super complex issues where a 

1108
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:39,170
minute of that is telling you what 
they're gonna do next.

1109
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,670
Oh yeah,
let's.

1110
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,260
And then there's just also a lot of 
nonsense and things that they know that 

1111
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,660
people want to listen to and tune in.
Like whether it's like,

1112
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,680
you know,
Alex Baldwin grabbed a Paparazzi by the 

1113
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:52,680
neck or something like that.
It's like infotainment now.

1114
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,690
Not In.
It's weird.

1115
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,240
It's weird.
It's weird that they're still doing it.

1116
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,420
It seems like something that they should
have stopped doing a long time ago.

1117
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,720
We're come up with a new way to do it 
where I don't feel like you're 

1118
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,841
bullshitting me.
I don't know anybody who talks like 

1119
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:10,001
that.
There's only one new show I watched and 

1120
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:10,001
that's a John Stewart daily show.

1121
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:10,570
Yes.
That's a great new share.

1122
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,060
The only mean I liked him because he 
calls out both people.

1123
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,980
He's very consistent on his pretty equal
opportunity.

1124
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,510
I mean if the Obama administration does 
some silly,

1125
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,580
if the Bush administration did something
silly,

1126
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,360
he,
he's,

1127
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,580
he's really.
He'll go after he.

1128
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,930
He definitely leans left.
Oh sure.

1129
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:31,931
But he,
he'll go after Obama just as quickly as 

1130
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:31,931
anybody else,
but they can't rely on that for news.

1131
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:36,200
It's more closest I get to watch a new 
show me.

1132
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,320
It's the Internet by far the Internet in
a big leap,

1133
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,560
but it then becomes a matter of like if 
you ever seen people getting into 

1134
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,071
discussion on the Internet and someone 
will put up an article from the Daily 

1135
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:52,300
Mail and then they'll go and the other 
person arguing with them be like the 

1136
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,300
Daily Mail.
Really,

1137
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,910
you believe in fucking link from the 
Daily Mail.

1138
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,440
And then it becomes,
all right,

1139
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:55,160
well what,
what,

1140
00:51:55,161 --> 00:52:00,161
what,
where can I get my God damn information 

1141
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:00,161
from like.

1142
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:00,161
And it becomes an issue of what's the 
source?

1143
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,570
And you know,
who's,

1144
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:02,300
uh,
who's,

1145
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,270
where's the money behind this,
this organization?

1146
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:08,690
Because these organizations are going to
be eventually chest,

1147
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:13,691
like CBS or NBC or Fox News.
It's gonna be there's gonna to be 

1148
00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:14,990
influences buying them so that they're 
not going to be like,

1149
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,130
this is the raw data that we're 
collecting from all around the world.

1150
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:24,131
Here it is,
but also some commercials during the 

1151
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:28,930
peak of the occupied movement.
I spent hundreds of hours watching a 

1152
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,190
ustream tv because you were watching the
Ra thing taking place.

1153
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:36,191
Yeah,
you were really interested in your 

1154
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:36,191
podcast was really interesting.
During that time you did a lot of social

1155
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:41,171
commentary where you might not 
ordinarily do that and you were talking 

1156
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:42,500
about how important that the occupy 
movement was.

1157
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,310
I feel like that's the.
The discussion about the occupy movement

1158
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:48,530
has dwindled dramatically.

1159
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:53,590
It has,
but I'll tell you the way I look at the 

1160
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,721
occupy movement of what we've seen,
if they had announced in the beginning 

1161
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:55,730
saying,
okay,

1162
00:52:55,731 --> 00:53:00,731
we're going to do phase one and what 
we're going to do is raise awareness 

1163
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:04,250
around the world that there's a big 
income distribution problem that we have

1164
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,280
one percent 99 percent and we're going 
to show that this is true everywhere in 

1165
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,241
the world and that we're living in a 
police state because the police are 

1166
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:13,330
going to shut us down.
If that's.

1167
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,520
That's our only objective.
That's phase one.

1168
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,980
If that was put out that way,
I think they'd say,

1169
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:20,180
oh,
it was a big success.

1170
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,740
Now,
just the other day,

1171
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:25,260
there's a thing in the news that the 
occupy New York people had $400,000

1172
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:26,130
left in their account

1173
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,370
donations and they took that 400,000
and they bought $15,000,000

1174
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:36,381
with a credit card debt that people 
would run up on medical bills and for 

1175
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,681
gave it all and now they're using that 
knowledge that they've learned to do 

1176
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:41,820
videos and stuff to teach people how 
they can do that for themselves.

1177
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:46,821
To buy their credit card debt for 
pennies on the dollar instead of what 

1178
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:46,821
they're going after him for.
So the,

1179
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,120
and you know,
I've got friends in,

1180
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:53,121
in uh,
Australia and the UK and a couple of 

1181
00:53:53,121 --> 00:53:53,190
places here in the states,
friends I say Internet friends.

1182
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:57,330
I've never met him in person that are 
still very interested or involved,

1183
00:53:57,331 --> 00:54:02,331
I should say in occupy type activities.
But what we know now is that we're not 

1184
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,730
alone,
that they're all around the world.

1185
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,350
There's people that are thinking like 
this.

1186
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:10,770
So it's more about consciousness 
awakening than a movement,

1187
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:13,770
but I think it's still a simmering under
the surface.

1188
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:14,750
And uh,
you know,

1189
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,240
I've got a lot of bad press obviously,
but like I was starting to say,

1190
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:23,241
I,
I spent hundreds of hours watching and 

1191
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:23,580
interacting and chat rooms with these 
people and all.

1192
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,110
So I felt like,
you know,

1193
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:28,230
I knew a little bit better what was 
going on then what was coming out in the

1194
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,570
press and stuff like that because that 
was all slanted.

1195
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:35,930
And uh,
these people are really on top of 

1196
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,000
things.
And we do now.

1197
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,820
No one percent 99 percent.
So nothing else,

1198
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:40,590
it was pretty successful as movement 
that way.

1199
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,210
Well,
yeah.

1200
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,870
I'm pretty successful as a,
as a like a talking point.

1201
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:50,010
And it became the talking point because 
he used to be talked about like the top 

1202
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,010
percent,
right?

1203
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,200
Several percent,
five percent,

1204
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:56,201
whatever it is.
But then when it became the one 

1205
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:56,201
percenters,
the 99 percent,

1206
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:57,860
then it became a real thing.
Everybody was like,

1207
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:58,550
oh,
okay.

1208
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:03,610
Yeah,
that's David Graver I think is the one 

1209
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:03,610
that got credit for coming out with 
that.

1210
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,040
Yeah.
That becomes a viral idea and people 

1211
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,021
start discussing it.
Do you know that 99 percent of the 

1212
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:11,301
people in this country don't.
Only one percent owns 50 percent of the 

1213
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:11,301
wealth or whatever the fuck it is.
And you're like,

1214
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:11,301
what?

1215
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:13,780
Well,
it's actually 300 people own 45.

1216
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,940
Well that's amazing.
Yeah,

1217
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,460
those guys are ballers.
Yeah,

1218
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,500
they.
When I think that.

1219
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:25,501
What's interesting about all this,
I have a very optimistic view of the 

1220
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:26,400
human race,
I think.

1221
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,870
I think ultimately people want to live a
life that's harmonious and happy.

1222
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:37,110
I think if that's true with you,
and that's true with me and that's true 

1223
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:37,870
with pretty much everybody that I know,
it's got to be true with all people,

1224
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:43,050
so it's a matter of spreading that idea 
through the population as quickly as 

1225
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,011
possible to as many people as possible 
and let them understand that the way 

1226
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,161
that we've been living our lives for 
decades and generation after generation 

1227
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:51,670
is just the momentum of an ignorant 
past.

1228
00:55:51,671 --> 00:55:56,671
It doesn't have to be that way anymore 
and it doesn't mean that you can have 

1229
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,881
government and it doesn't mean you can't
have corporations and it doesn't mean 

1230
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:01,120
that you can't have people who have more
wealth and other people.

1231
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,120
It just means everything should be done 
fairly and if you guys are putting laws 

1232
00:56:06,851 --> 00:56:09,010
into place that allow you to fuck people
over,

1233
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,160
allow you to move your factories to 
Mexico and have people work for pennies 

1234
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,160
on the dollar,
allow.

1235
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,270
There's a lot of shit that you're being 
allowed to do.

1236
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:17,980
As far as like polluting the 
environment.

1237
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:22,981
That shouldn't be kosher and there.
There should be a way to resolve that 

1238
00:56:22,981 --> 00:56:25,900
and the to resolve that is not you spend
money to change the law,

1239
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:28,150
to make it legal for you to do something
that's horrible.

1240
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,380
The would should be is figure out what 
the fuck you can do to make sure that 

1241
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,101
you don't pollute the environment.
Structure your loss so that you don't 

1242
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:41,491
rip people off.
Figure out a way to make it so that 

1243
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:43,860
you're not in control of a giant chunk 
of of,

1244
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,910
of this river,
that your factories by the pollution 

1245
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:48,910
that leaks into it.

1246
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:53,400
Figure out how to make it so that you're
not poisoning the wells of of people in 

1247
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,781
town because you're fracking and you're 
pulling a natural gas out of the ground 

1248
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:02,011
and destroy these people's wells.
Figure out how to do it without doing 

1249
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:02,011
that,
and if you can't do it,

1250
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:06,181
don't do it.
Just don't do anything when you put 

1251
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:08,821
money in front of humanity.
It seems to me like we can still have 

1252
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:12,631
competition.
Seems to me we can still have 

1253
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:14,851
capitalism.
It just needs to be a moral capitalism 

1254
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:17,931
and ethical capitalism where humanity 
and people and just caring about people 

1255
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:19,990
and realizing we're not going to be in 
here forever.

1256
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:25,140
It's a fairly short ride to be fucking 
nice to people and all the money that 

1257
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:30,091
you make.
Being an asshole and putting people out 

1258
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:30,091
of work.
You're not gonna.

1259
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:30,700
Appreciate that money.
Most likely,

1260
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:35,701
if you're in a position to put a bunch 
of people out of work and make a fuck 

1261
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:38,721
load of money and fuck someone over,
you probably already have a lot of 

1262
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:38,721
money.

1263
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,330
You're already in a sweet spot,
in some weird position of influence,

1264
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,910
but enjoy what you got.
You fucking stranger.

1265
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,550
He a weird person trying to pollute the 
river.

1266
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,480
You weird asshole who doesn't care about
polluting someone's wells.

1267
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:51,730
You should be devastated if that 
happens.

1268
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,890
You should stop operations,
but no,

1269
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:59,100
because they know they can pull billions
of dollars worth of natural resources 

1270
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,770
out of the ground by still continuing 
these practices.

1271
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,720
They're like,
they don't even consider not doing it.

1272
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,780
They just do it.
They just keep doing it and they find 

1273
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,130
ways to do it where it harms last or it 
has less of an environmental impact,

1274
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:10,240
allegedly,
you know,

1275
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:11,680
I mean,
I don't even know what the numbers are,

1276
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:16,681
but the raw data shows that they fucked 
up a lot of areas doing this stuff,

1277
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,940
but no one's talking about stopping 
doing it.

1278
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,270
They're just going for it.

1279
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,870
See,
you're,

1280
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,940
you've hit the nail on the head is that 
it's not about regulating things from 

1281
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,571
the top down and trying to get people to
change your ways is getting people to 

1282
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:29,780
change themselves.
And one,

1283
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,860
a good examples of a corporation is a 
Dr.

1284
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,520
Bronner's soap company.
Dr Bonner as the hemp soap.

1285
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,240
Yes.
Yeah.

1286
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:37,590
They might be hippies.
What do you think?

1287
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,890
Well,
he has went with the guy,

1288
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:45,020
I think he's like 25 years old when his 
dad died and he had to take over the 

1289
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:45,020
company and didn't really want to.
But he,

1290
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,300
uh,
for one of the first things he did,

1291
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:51,301
it says nobody in the company can make 
more than five times the lowest paid 

1292
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:51,680
person in the company.
And he's,

1293
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,330
he's got a really.
You know,

1294
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:57,050
very conscientious conscious company and
I've read,

1295
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,120
you know,
there's a lot of others like that and 

1296
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,951
it's got to be from the bottom up where 
they just start doing it and they're 

1297
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:03,951
successful.
He's competing in the soap business.

1298
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,270
And uh,
in fact if you go to burning man,

1299
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:08,970
it's the only soap that'll get all that 
dust off your hands.

1300
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,420
If you go to burning man,
you've got other problems.

1301
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,130
Somebody,
somebody on twitter,

1302
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,540
me,
I should get you to go to burning.

1303
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:20,710
Yeah.
People keep asking me to go to burning 

1304
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,710
man.
Look,

1305
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,710
I meet plenty of dirty hippies in my 
everyday life.

1306
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,770
There's too many of them there.

1307
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:22,320
Well,
you know,

1308
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,550
I don't like camping.
I don't enjoy the desert.

1309
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:25,780
Had to,
can't stand the heat.

1310
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:28,660
And I couldn't wait to get back,
but I stopped going.

1311
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:30,970
I haven't gone since 2007 now.
Good move.

1312
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,560
Let's become commercialized.
Oh yeah.

1313
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:35,200
And this is so expensive and in,
in,

1314
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,230
in your offline for like two months 
afterwards trying to recover.

1315
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:40,740
But it,
it was,

1316
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:45,741
uh,
the times I went where some of the most 

1317
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:45,741
spectacular time.

1318
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:45,741
I'm obviously talking shit because I've 
never been,

1319
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,440
I don't want all the people that 
actually go and enjoy it.

1320
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:52,441
Don't think I'm being serious.
I go have a good time and I know that 

1321
00:59:52,441 --> 00:59:55,291
most of you are probably cool as fuck.
The problem is there's that small 

1322
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,520
percentage that's going to be so 
annoying that I can't go

1323
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:03,180
know a percentage.
That's one of the things that was kind 

1324
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,810
of unique about burning man I thought is
that uh,

1325
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,080
in fact it was the first year we went a 
camp across from us was starting in the 

1326
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,241
afternoon,
some loud music and all and we had a 

1327
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:13,241
bunch of people just sitting around 
talking.

1328
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:16,841
And so one of the ladies in our camp 
took up a tray full of cold beers and 

1329
01:00:16,841 --> 01:00:20,861
popsicles over to him and said,
can we bribe you to turn the music off 

1330
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:20,861
for a couple of hours?
And Oh sure.

1331
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:25,391
And they turned it off and you know,
it's a functioning anarchy is what it 

1332
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:25,391
is.
Well,

1333
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:25,710
that's very nice.
That's a great.

1334
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,410
And you're right,
it's gotten a,

1335
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,720
I wouldn't say commercial,
but it's gotten really big.

1336
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:35,170
But one of the,
one of the people who I know a was at 

1337
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,411
this year's camp and she's been there I 
think 19 years in a row and said this 

1338
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:39,720
was the best year she'd ever been.
Now when I started going,

1339
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:44,721
it was like 25,000
people and it was much more manageable 

1340
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:44,721
than 60 some now.

1341
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:48,940
Well for the most part,
I mean this is pretty much almost 

1342
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,550
anywhere I go when I run into people 
that want to talk about things,

1343
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,320
it's a cool conversation for the most 
part,

1344
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:53,780
99 percent of the time.
But there's always that one percent,

1345
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:56,240
maybe one out of 100,
it's my might be even less than that.

1346
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Or someone just gives you a brutal ear 
beating on the power of crystals and 

1347
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,030
you're like,
oh Jesus,

1348
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:05,330
we stop.
Or someone who they know who's a healer,

1349
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,980
you're like,
oh Christ.

1350
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,280
Someone who they know that's that 
channels.

1351
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:15,281
I tell this guy fucking talking to me 
about a channel or the other day I was 

1352
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:15,410
like,
please stop by.

1353
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:18,510
They used to call them schizophrenia,
but whatever it is,

1354
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:19,640
it's like,
you know,

1355
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:21,830
come on man.
If you're not channeling,

1356
01:01:21,831 --> 01:01:23,990
shut the fuck up.
If you are channeling,

1357
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:25,610
let me see it because if you're not 
channeling,

1358
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:28,640
if you'd never channeled,
how do you know what's going on there?

1359
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,520
You don't know what's going on.
There is.

1360
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:35,521
It could be a lot of factors.
You know that that guy might be losing 

1361
01:01:35,521 --> 01:01:38,951
his marbles right there.
You might be watching an act to be 

1362
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:38,951
watching a crazy person who needs a lot 
of attention.

1363
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,330
I guess.
I miss those people at burning man.

1364
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:43,630
I was into drugs and booze.

1365
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,380
Well,
this wasn't even at burning man.

1366
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:47,180
This is just a conversation with someone
was.

1367
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:52,181
One of the weird things about the 
podcast is so many people have to talk 

1368
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:55,421
to me about something.
They have this idea that they have to 

1369
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:55,421
tell me and you know,
many times it's very interesting,

1370
01:01:55,421 --> 01:02:00,370
but many times it's not.
And many times it's just brutal 

1371
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:00,370
nonsense.
Feel like,

1372
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:04,661
okay,
I have this friend of mine who believes 

1373
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:05,050
in psychics and he's going on and on 
about the psychic who,

1374
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:10,051
uh,
who told him everything about his life 

1375
01:02:10,051 --> 01:02:10,051
and I go everything about your life.
And he goes,

1376
01:02:10,051 --> 01:02:10,490
yeah,
I go,

1377
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,940
did he tell you any shit you don't know?
He goes,

1378
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:14,840
no,
and I go,

1379
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:15,920
well,
don't you think that's weird?

1380
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,020
He goes to and he knew about my 
grandmother.

1381
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:19,500
I go,
don't you know about your grandmother?

1382
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,650
Why do you want someone to tell you shit
you already know?

1383
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,370
Did you ever think that maybe you've 
been manipulated and maybe he structured

1384
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,210
questions in a way that got you to 
reveal certain information or think that

1385
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:33,420
you were.
We're not answering it for him,

1386
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,340
but he was leading you in a certain 
direction.

1387
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,020
Did you ever think that that might be 
possible?

1388
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,900
And he likes pause and like,
no,

1389
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,340
because I never even thought about it.
I go,

1390
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,600
well,
you should probably think about that.

1391
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:47,870
Yeah.
A lot of people get sucked into these 

1392
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:47,870
things without giving it thought.
And then some of them,

1393
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,460
the psychedelic grommets,
it's,

1394
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,360
it's even goofy or people come up to 
you.

1395
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:56,361
But at one time at a conference,
a friend of mine had just given his 

1396
01:02:56,361 --> 01:03:00,591
presentation and I went up to say 
something to him and he was surrounded 

1397
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:03,711
by a bunch of people and there's this 
one girl who was obviously just really 

1398
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:07,190
whacked out on something.
She had spiked purple hair and she's 

1399
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:10,400
piercings everywhere and she couldn't 
stand still and she's bouncing around 

1400
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:10,400
and she says,
well,

1401
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,780
how come people don't approve of 
psychedelics?

1402
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,250
And he said,
well,

1403
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,930
they're afraid they're going to turn out
like you.

1404
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,280
That is an issue.
Yeah.

1405
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,260
It's an issue of potheads too.
Oh yeah.

1406
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,930
A lot of them are lazy,
sloppy potheads that just,

1407
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:24,070
you know,
they're there.

1408
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:29,071
So loathsome to be around that they make
you connect that behavior to marijuana.

1409
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:34,850
When I was a kid,
I thought that marijuana made you lazy 

1410
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,171
and I had all these negative things 
attached to it until I met my friend 

1411
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,590
Eddie Bravo,
who was a smart guy.

1412
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:41,710
He was very articulate and he liked to 
smoke pot and talk about all these crazy

1413
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:45,280
things and and like to make his music.
When he was high,

1414
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:46,480
I was like,
you make music with you.

1415
01:03:46,481 --> 01:03:48,980
I thought it was something that turned 
you into a moron.

1416
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,120
He's like,
drew,

1417
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,850
like,
I didn't want to get like that.

1418
01:03:51,851 --> 01:03:52,480
And he was like,
no,

1419
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:52,780
no,
no,

1420
01:03:52,781 --> 01:03:54,640
no.
It enhances your creativity.

1421
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:59,641
And,
and once I immediately started smoking 

1422
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,340
pot or once I started smoking pot,
I immediately started presenting all the

1423
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:02,920
dopey stereotypical pot ads.
I was like,

1424
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:04,600
God damn,
you guys ruined something.

1425
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:06,970
That's amazing.
Fuck you.

1426
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:11,260
You ruined the image of something that's
amazing by being a knucklehead.

1427
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:16,650
You know,
I had experienced when I was working 

1428
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:17,680
back in the phone company and one of the
guys I worked for was a vice president.

1429
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:22,740
He was pretty far up there and we worked
really closely together for almost a 

1430
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,920
year and a,
I won't go into the whole story,

1431
01:04:23,921 --> 01:04:28,060
but after about a year,
we're at dinner one night and he says he

1432
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,970
was making a confession for a reason and
he said,

1433
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,170
well,
I smoked pot.

1434
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,210
And I said,
really?

1435
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,020
Let's go to my house right now.
Now we'd worked together for a year in a

1436
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:43,021
really high powered environment and I 
found out later that he's going up to 

1437
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:44,740
the car two or three times during the 
day to have few Tokes,

1438
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,280
so you can function pretty highly if you
know what you're doing.

1439
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:53,330
Oh,
you can definitely function pretty 

1440
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:53,330
highly,
especially if you get used to it.

1441
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,480
The way,
the way I describe it as it's like 

1442
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,191
surfing.
You watch a guy who's a really good 

1443
01:04:58,191 --> 01:04:58,191
surfer or girls are really good surfer,
madigan bride,

1444
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:00,420
some crazy ways,
but if you put me on a surfboard,

1445
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:04,290
fallen flat on my fucking stupid face.
I can't serve at all.

1446
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,970
I've never done it.
So if I tried it,

1447
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:07,500
I'm sure I would suck at it.

1448
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,420
I tried it once and I sucked at it.

1449
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:15,180
Marijuana smoking is like riding a 
psychedelic wave and there's A.

1450
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,230
There's a wave of the substance,

1451
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:23,230
the thc that hits your body and you can 
either ride that wave or you can trip 

1452
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:29,851
out on the fact that you're on this wave
and freak out and started getting 

1453
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:33,220
paranoid or going down dark places in 
your mind or you know,

1454
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,830
just spiral.
That's possible too,

1455
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,110
but once you get good at it,
you don't.

1456
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:43,140
That doesn't happen very often.
It's like you're standing there smoking 

1457
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:43,540
pot longer than I have.
That's impossible.

1458
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:46,890
I had my first token 1985.
No,

1459
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,720
I started smoking pot in 2001.
Oh,

1460
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:50,440
okay.
Well,

1461
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,820
yeah.
You're another late bloomer.

1462
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,500
I thought it was.
Yeah,

1463
01:05:52,501 --> 01:05:55,540
I thought it was stupid until I was 30 
or something like that.

1464
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,340
I thought it was so dumb.
I was like,

1465
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,220
this is the stupidest thing ever.
These people are wasting their lives.

1466
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,680
Smoking Pot.
I didn't know how at first.

1467
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,700
Yeah,
I'd been a smoker and you know,

1468
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,970
I,
I got this pot and I,

1469
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,440
I wasn't inhaling proper really.

1470
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:13,580
And,
and I spoke last on my third joint and 

1471
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:17,401
it was like over a period of three or 
four weeks and finally I got really all 

1472
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:18,850
of a sudden I figured it out.
You're going to inhale.

1473
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,860
And the women that have given me the 
cigarettes,

1474
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:23,260
I called her at work or at work,
I was off and I called her at work.

1475
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,720
I said it works.
I got stone and she says,

1476
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:27,560
don't shout,
that's Funky,

1477
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:32,561
but down the laws.
But it took me a while to even learn 

1478
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:32,561
how.
And uh,

1479
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:33,370
yeah,
there's a lot of people that are worried

1480
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:36,280
about people finding out they smoke pot.
Oh yeah.

1481
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,510
I think that's,
you know,

1482
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,700
not out here anymore,
but not as much,

1483
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:43,510
but still in a lot of ways,
like I've had conversations with people.

1484
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:44,080
They go,
you know,

1485
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:49,081
hey,
you ever face any repercussions because 

1486
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:49,081
you talk about pot.

1487
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:51,870
And I'm like,
realistically anybody that would be 

1488
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:52,600
upset with me because they found out 
that I smoke pot,

1489
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,670
I really don't want to talk to them 
anyway.

1490
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,930
Right.
Like if they don't like me,

1491
01:06:55,931 --> 01:07:00,931
I probably wouldn't like them anyway.
Like that's such a stupid stance to 

1492
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:04,291
take.
I just listen to what I have to say 

1493
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:04,291
about it and if it doesn't make sense to
you,

1494
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:08,760
that's one thing.
But if you're upset at me because he 

1495
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:08,760
found out that I smoke pot.
Okay,

1496
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,650
take care.
I worried about that at one time.

1497
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:12,400
But finally,
you know,

1498
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:16,120
I've done the podcast now and I'm pretty
much out of the closet,

1499
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:21,121
but I still get a little resistance from
people in the family that are unhappy 

1500
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:21,400
with it.
Well,

1501
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:26,401
I've had friends that have had some 
serious drug issues and I've also had 

1502
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:30,541
people that I've talked to that were 
like real straight edge and one of the 

1503
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,451
reason why they were straight edge,
like maybe they lost a family member to 

1504
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:36,331
addiction and I've had conversations 
with them about it before where I 

1505
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:40,471
totally understand that and I totally 
get that mindset and I probably would 

1506
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:44,221
have been in that mindset and myself if 
it not for several people that I've met 

1507
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:45,930
in my life because I,
I'd,

1508
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:51,230
I'd lost a friend to heroin and I lost a
friend in high school to here to people 

1509
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:52,060
to heroin.

1510
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:57,060
Actually that I know more than that,
I think I lost at least one other ones 

1511
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,021
to take pills to like opiate pills.
So I guess he's a that that would be 

1512
01:08:01,021 --> 01:08:05,371
considered along the same lines.
And I could get the idea where people 

1513
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:09,841
would be upset at people that smoke pot 
or what anything because he would think 

1514
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:09,841
that would connect it to,
you know,

1515
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:11,140
losing their family members.
But man,

1516
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,380
it's unfortunate that the word drug is 
such a broad term.

1517
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,040
Let's see.

1518
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,040
That's one of the reasons I'm doing what
I'm doing is because we it with proper 

1519
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,320
drug education,
those guys might still be alive,

1520
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,880
you know,
that we don't educate.

1521
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,430
We just say no instead of k,
n,

1522
01:08:24,431 --> 01:08:25,880
O,
w and uh,

1523
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,020
so,
you know,

1524
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:32,021
I think that if we can just get a couple
more generations behind us where people 

1525
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:33,470
are,
are not so oppressed by,

1526
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:33,800
uh,
my,

1527
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:39,100
one of my favorite stories I got from a,
a kid and listen to the podcast when he 

1528
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,080
was like,
he just got out of high school.

1529
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:47,110
He's 18.
His father caught him growing mushrooms 

1530
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,540
in his closet and turned them into the 
police.

1531
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:52,541
And the kid wound up doing a hard time 
of felony and so he came back out of 

1532
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:56,381
jail and he just went,
started going to church with them three 

1533
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:59,391
or four times a week and became a 
fundamentalist Christian again and just 

1534
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:02,411
went through the exercises.
Then he found the salon and realize 

1535
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:02,411
that,
hey,

1536
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:04,160
he wasn't crazy.
There's other people that do this tune.

1537
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,280
He got himself a fast food job,
saved up his money.

1538
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:10,040
He's out in the west coast working as an
artist right now.

1539
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,980
And so he got out of that oppressive 
atmosphere.

1540
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:17,981
So that's fascinating.
Gate kids tell me they've come out of 

1541
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:19,100
the closet being gay,
but they're afraid to tell their parents

1542
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:20,630
that their psychedelic or they smoke 
pot.

1543
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,580
Wow.
Think about that.

1544
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,990
That's fascinating.

1545
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,630
Did you to have a great smoke pot or 
smoke pulled joke there,

1546
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:29,730
but don't do it.
It's not worth it.

1547
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,690
Don't go for it.
Yeah,

1548
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:32,190
I did it.
I did a podcast,

1549
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,630
Daniel for a young man up in San 
Francisco,

1550
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,120
Cisco that started the psychedelic 
society up there.

1551
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,030
He started just two years ago and he's 
got 4,000

1552
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:45,031
members already and stuff and he's a 
young guy,

1553
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,240
mid twenties and he said he went to 
college and never smoked pot until he 

1554
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,391
got to college and got into pot and 
mushrooms and now he started the 

1555
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:55,750
Psychedelic Society of San Francisco and
has 4,000

1556
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:59,220
members and he's a drug,
a advocate and activist and,

1557
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,980
but anyhow,
he has a.

1558
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:05,360
He did a talk that I podcast called 
coming out of the psychedelic closet and

1559
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:07,870
I got a letter in the mail the other day
from a kid that,

1560
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,770
uh,
he,

1561
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,150
uh,
he sent a little drawing.

1562
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:12,250
He did it in the closet with his name on
it and he says,

1563
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:15,040
I just can't come out of it yet.
Wow.

1564
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,900
But if I was still in the workaday world
working in the belly of the beast,

1565
01:10:19,901 --> 01:10:20,320
I,
I,

1566
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,100
I,
uh,

1567
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,000
now in California or someplace with 
medical marijuana,

1568
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:29,001
I'd probably be honest about that,
but I would never talk about 

1569
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:29,001
psychedelics in the corporate world.
I mean,

1570
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:29,500
that's a quick way to get fired.

1571
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:34,640
Yeah.
It's fascinating that you can't talk 

1572
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:34,640
about an experience that you've had 10 
years ago.

1573
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,390
Right.
They'll label you as some crazy hippie 

1574
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,390
that's trying to clean his act up.
You know,

1575
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,990
you're trying to pretend you're one of 
us.

1576
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,380
Normally you just fucking dirty,
hippie doing acid and your lunch break,

1577
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:43,740
right?

1578
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:44,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1579
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,460
I missed the hippie thing.
I was in the navy then,

1580
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:48,500
so I'm doing mine at this stage of my 
life.

1581
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:50,510
And today you were in the navy and the 
sixties?

1582
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,610
Yeah,
66 to 70.

1583
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:57,170
I was in Vietnam and off the coast with 
the navy and actually my wife was a navy

1584
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,150
nurse too.
So we're both in the navy then.

1585
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,300
That's amazing,
man.

1586
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:02,130
What,
what did you do back then?

1587
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:04,270
Was there any uh,
substances?

1588
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:04,330
Okay.

1589
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,460
Alcohol and alcohol.
Lots.

1590
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,290
Lots and lots of alcohol.
In fact,

1591
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:13,291
uh,
I can tell you where I was and the day 

1592
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:13,380
you were born,
you were born in [inaudible].

1593
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:14,630
Sixty seven?
Yes.

1594
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:19,770
I was in the officer's club,
had Subic Bay in the Philippines.

1595
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,800
We're on a break from the gumline.
And the reason I remember it because I 

1596
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,660
was drinking my first flaming flagging,
celebrating my 25th birthday.

1597
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,270
Wow.
You're born on the same day.

1598
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,720
That's amazing.
And the reason that the flaming flag and

1599
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:38,721
was one of the traditions in our 
boardroom and it was a brandy snifter 

1600
01:11:38,721 --> 01:11:41,940
and you'd light the brandy on fire and 
then yet sip it down with a brand new on

1601
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:42,510
fire.
Well,

1602
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:48,110
it was in the afternoon.
We didn't realize that brandy had been 

1603
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,961
burning a while.
And by the time I didn't have any 

1604
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:52,100
problem getting liquid down by burnt my 
lip on the damn glass it was.

1605
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,140
But anyhow,
I'm on my 25th birthday.

1606
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,690
Was your born day so.
Wow.

1607
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:01,180
And you're out getting fucked up when 
celebration in the world.

1608
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,870
Hey world.
Joe Rogan has arrived.

1609
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:08,100
The whole wardroom went out and 
celebrated their lips and only me.

1610
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,930
They didn't.
They weren't dumb enough to do that.

1611
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:15,350
But no,
I didn't have anything until I was 42 

1612
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,350
years old.
Was it around you at all?

1613
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,960
Did you see it anywhere?
You know,

1614
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:19,380
I went through college without even 
hearing the word marijuana.

1615
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,390
What would you a school.
The Moon?

1616
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:26,490
I graduated in [inaudible] 64.
I went to a small boys' college in the 

1617
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:30,141
Midwest called Notre Dame.
You went to Notre Dame and you never 

1618
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:30,141
heard about weed?
Not In.

1619
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:32,910
Not In 60 to 64.
That's insane.

1620
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:35,160
How is that possible?
It wasn't there.

1621
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,060
Oh my God.
That's amazing.

1622
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,000
It wasn't there.
And what was that like?

1623
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,290
Oh,
well,

1624
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,700
he was very repressive.

1625
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,260
Would imagine it'd be very,
very.

1626
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,450
There were no girls there.
And uh,

1627
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,140
we had to get up at least three days a 
week.

1628
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:52,680
You had to sign in outside the chapel 
between seven and 7:30,

1629
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:55,720
fully dressed a lights out.
We're at 10:30

1630
01:12:55,721 --> 01:13:00,721
and lights out was pretty serious.
You couldn't have an electric clock or 

1631
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,260
an electric blanket because they cut off
the electricity to your room.

1632
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,130
And I had a classmate kicked out of 
school for studying by candle light.

1633
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,260
I mean,
that's how repressive it was.

1634
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:12,261
It was,
it was really a backward place studying 

1635
01:13:12,261 --> 01:13:16,281
by candlelight.
Got You kicked out of school probably 

1636
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:16,281
because he stole the candles from the 
grotto or something.

1637
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:17,040
Oh,
no,

1638
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:17,600
no,
no.

1639
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,030
It was for studying by candlelight,
so I got kicked out of school.

1640
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,720
That's so dumb.
Oh,

1641
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,990
it was a crazy place.
So insanely dumb.

1642
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,270
We were the only class up until 
recently,

1643
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:32,271
I think that a never once saw a winning 
football team for years of losses.

1644
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:37,490
Wow.
And so I parlayed that by selling my 

1645
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,850
four year books on Ebay and I marketed 
it that way and somebody bought them for

1646
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:41,850
156 bucks.
That's funny.

1647
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:44,250
That's interesting.
What a weird time.

1648
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:49,430
But I was,
I was living in Dallas in and I was 42 

1649
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,520
years old when ecstasy hit the streets,
mgma.

1650
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,540
And uh,
I,

1651
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,140
I'd never taken any drugs.
I didn't even smoke pot.

1652
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:57,750
Came out of the navy and everything in 
that store and attorney,

1653
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,360
right?
Yeah.

1654
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:03,370
In,
in Houston I was an attorney then in 

1655
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,331
Dallas I started a computer company.
I had a personal computer company that 

1656
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:06,270
was in 1981.
We outgrows Microsoft,

1657
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:11,271
you know,
I had four color picture in Forbes 

1658
01:14:11,271 --> 01:14:13,671
magazine,
made the front page of the Wall Street 

1659
01:14:13,671 --> 01:14:13,671
Journal.
Really?

1660
01:14:13,671 --> 01:14:14,350
Then ibm came in and crushed us like a 
bug.

1661
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,280
Wow.
What was the name of your computer 

1662
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:20,280
company ready for?

1663
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,040
This is in Dallas,
Texas named it Dynasty Dynasty Computer 

1664
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,400
Corporation,
but Seattle area,

1665
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,800
it was a,
we were the amway of computers.

1666
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,320
I had like 3000 distributors around the 
country.

1667
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:30,460
And uh,
it was,

1668
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,630
it was crazy.
And we sold.

1669
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,580
We sold this machine.
You want to hear this?

1670
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:34,480
I don't know.
Yeah,

1671
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:39,540
it was an eight k machine,
the 16 K of Ram and it was a 12 inch 

1672
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:44,491
black and white monitor and a cassette 
tape deck is what we use for input and 

1673
01:14:44,491 --> 01:14:45,640
output.
And you'd have to load your,

1674
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,360
your,
uh,

1675
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,360
your boot program and then you'd get a 
crc error.

1676
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:52,170
So you're just the tone and rewind it 
and then loaded again.

1677
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:57,171
And,
and we sold hundreds of these for 3000 

1678
01:14:57,171 --> 01:14:59,680
bucks each y and,
and parents would say,

1679
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:01,480
you know,
why do I need this?

1680
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:03,300
You know,
you've got recipe program and,

1681
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,170
and Pong and a couple games.

1682
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,060
And I said,
I don't know why you need it,

1683
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:09,640
but if your kids don't have this,
they're going to be left behind.

1684
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:10,990
Why?
When they're 30 years old.

1685
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,820
And,
uh,

1686
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,560
later,
uh,

1687
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:18,570
I was talking at one of the Java 
conventions in San Francisco and a guy 

1688
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:22,261
came up to me and gave me his card and 
he's CEO of a company like 100 

1689
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:22,261
programmers and all.
And he said,

1690
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:22,960
you don't remember me,
do you?

1691
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:23,560
And I said,
no.

1692
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:28,590
He says,
my dad bought a computer from you and 

1693
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:28,590
you told him that it would help me.
Wow.

1694
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,700
So I don't know if anybody else got 
help,

1695
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:31,630
but at least one customer turned out 
with.

1696
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,880
What year was this?
Uh,

1697
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,130
let's see.
We went out of business.

1698
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:41,280
I started in [inaudible] 79,
79 and we made it to lady for while.

1699
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,410
And it was,
it was great.

1700
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:45,170
It was,
you know,

1701
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,510
you heard of the DOTCOM bubble.

1702
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,890
Well this was the PC bubble.
It was before ibm got in and you know,

1703
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,930
we'd run short on memory chips and I'd 
call up my friend at Osborne and he'd 

1704
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:58,141
shoot me some.
And then when I got some back I shipped 

1705
01:15:58,141 --> 01:15:59,140
him and it was a closed network is 
pretty good old boy thing,

1706
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:00,220
you know,
fascinated.

1707
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,050
And there's a lot of fun.
It was great fun,

1708
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:02,430
but,
uh,

1709
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,830
we didn't know what we're doing.
We're geeks and,

1710
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,840
and uh,
I didn't know anything about cash flow 

1711
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:09,850
or business unit had been an electrical 
engineer and a lawyer,

1712
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:11,140
but I didn't know anything about 
business.

1713
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:16,141
And so we,
we just sort of sold ourselves out of 

1714
01:16:16,141 --> 01:16:19,471
business.
And by the time we were done the last 

1715
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:19,471
six or eight,
nine months,

1716
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:21,610
I was a financing the thing by selling 
ecstasy,

1717
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,960
ecstasy come into play.
I was a,

1718
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,380
I was doing this computer thing and a 
close friend of mine,

1719
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:32,470
a lawyer in Biloxi,
he called me one day and he says,

1720
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,760
what do you know about ecstasy?

1721
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,750
And I said,
what do you mean?

1722
01:16:34,751 --> 01:16:35,080
He said,
well,

1723
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:36,080
it's a drug.
And I said,

1724
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:36,950
well,
I don't do drugs.

1725
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:38,450
And he says it's legal,
you know,

1726
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:43,710
now this isn't Texas and at that time 
you're getting 30 years to life for a 

1727
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:47,161
single joint.
And so there's no way I touched 

1728
01:16:47,161 --> 01:16:47,161
something like that,
you know,

1729
01:16:47,161 --> 01:16:50,670
and I get to join for one joint.
And so,

1730
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,000
uh,
he says,

1731
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:52,870
no,
this is legal.

1732
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:54,880
And I had a friend,
a friend of my wife's,

1733
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,350
actually,
she was a model in town,

1734
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:59,170
ran with the fast crowd and I met with 
her and she fixed me up.

1735
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:01,480
And uh,
so I got involved in and uh,

1736
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:06,481
then my friend wanted some.
I sent him 50 and I started telling 

1737
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:07,860
friends about it and I became really 
evangelical about it.

1738
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,460
And uh,
pretty soon I'm buying hundreds and 500,

1739
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:12,980
600 and,
and uh,

1740
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,260
I didn't realize it at the time.

1741
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,320
The Guy I was buying from was actually 
the main man.

1742
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,810
And uh,
the big guy that started see ecstasy hit

1743
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:25,811
the street in Dallas,
had been out here in west coast for 

1744
01:17:25,811 --> 01:17:28,571
several years with the therapist and all
but Dallas and the stork club was the 

1745
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:29,750
ground zero.
And uh,

1746
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,960
the stork club was just,
the stark club was so big.

1747
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:35,510
Madonna moved to Dallas to be close to 
that club.

1748
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,320
There's a documentary going to be coming
out soon,

1749
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,330
called the stark project.
And,

1750
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:41,900
uh,
it,

1751
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,190
it was an insane place.
It's really the,

1752
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:49,210
the genesis of house music before,
or even Chicago is called Stark club 

1753
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,450
music.
And then it,

1754
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,700
and,
and there were bowls of ecstasy on the 

1755
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:55,700
bar where you can go by,
you know,

1756
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,600
giving 20 bucks and get a,
get a hit because it was all legal and 

1757
01:17:59,600 --> 01:17:59,600
uh,
you know,

1758
01:17:59,600 --> 01:17:59,600
they had chill space.

1759
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,650
It was a crazy place that you would,
it was like burning man in a building.

1760
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,200
In fact,
Larry Hagman was a regular there.

1761
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:06,740
And,
and,

1762
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:07,100
uh,
in the,

1763
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:12,101
in this movie that's coming out,
he's quoted as saying he lights up and 

1764
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:12,101
he says,
oh,

1765
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:13,250
it was the greatest party on earth.
He says,

1766
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:16,100
the only better parties burning man.
But that's like putting the star club in

1767
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:19,670
the middle of a desert.
But some people would get all dressed up

1768
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,850
burning man type.
And we're talking name brand people,

1769
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:24,960
you know,
the talking heads and people like that.

1770
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:29,330
And Madonna even was showed up.
George W dot been there and uh,

1771
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:34,430
it was just wild and crazy and they 
played this house music and they had a 

1772
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,740
chill space and coed bathrooms.
It's just a wild place.

1773
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,090
And uh,
that's,

1774
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,370
that's really where ecstasy starts 
spreading.

1775
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:42,700
Now I was selling to all of my friends 
and,

1776
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:48,130
and a lot of coworkers and everybody and
we were really serious about it that I 

1777
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,200
would make people read all whatever 
literature there was,

1778
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:52,490
you know,
there wasn't very much.

1779
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:57,490
So there's a speech.
Sasha gave a talk that Rick Doblin had 

1780
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,160
given up the international health 
organization,

1781
01:18:58,161 --> 01:19:03,161
but not much,
but we were really serious and I was 

1782
01:19:03,161 --> 01:19:05,681
sort of not in the club scene.
I was getting people together in small 

1783
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:09,041
groups and doing it,
but I still have a lot of ex and I was 

1784
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,861
getting deep discounts and so I was 
using that money to cash flow of my 

1785
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:11,861
business.
When you say Sasha,

1786
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:15,490
do you mean Sasha shoulder that a lot of
folks don't know that he talked about?

1787
01:19:15,491 --> 01:19:16,240
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1788
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:21,250
Sasha.
Sasha Shogun is the guy that he didn't 

1789
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,220
invent Mbma but he a resurrected it.
It is patented in the early 19 hundreds.

1790
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,330
And He,
uh,

1791
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,580
resynthesize didn't wrote a paper about 
it that,

1792
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,720
uh,
hit the underground,

1793
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:32,640
but most of what I call the ABC 
chemicals are,

1794
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:36,680
came from Sasha Shogun,
noon to cb to see all of those things.

1795
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:41,820
Do you ever see the vice documentary 
where Hamilton Morris Interviews Sasha 

1796
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:41,820
Shogun?

1797
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,030
I don't think I saw that one.
No,

1798
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:48,430
by the way,
I think that's the only time I've ever 

1799
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:48,430
said that word in my life.
Shogun shogun.

1800
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:52,481
Sasha Shogun.
I've never said he's one of those names 

1801
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:52,481
that I've read his name 100 times,
but I never said it.

1802
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:53,100
Um,
yeah,

1803
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:58,110
the really interesting vice documentary 
where Hamilton Morris went and met with 

1804
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:03,131
them and had a long day with them and he
went over different compounds with them 

1805
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,880
and talked about discoveries and know 
what he found.

1806
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:05,240
And you know,

1807
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:08,940
Sasha was a regular at the [inaudible] 
seminars and we'd sit down and,

1808
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:09,790
and,
and uh,

1809
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,190
we have a whole bunch of us.
I,

1810
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,900
I,
uh,

1811
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,090
I've had a few one on one conversations 
with them,

1812
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:16,800
but we always talked about things like 
the navy.

1813
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:22,220
He was in the navy in World War Two,
but the chemists would come on and they 

1814
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,060
would start talking ABC Xyz and what are
his acronym books.

1815
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:29,061
He has these books up p and t calls.
Then fla means I have known and loved 

1816
01:20:29,061 --> 01:20:32,400
and tryptamines I have known and loved 
for the two acronyms.

1817
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:37,620
And the first parts of the book are like
a novel and with the use fictional names

1818
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,390
was about an and Sasha and their 
friends.

1819
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:44,690
And then the last half of the book is as
a recipe section and there are literally

1820
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,970
probably over well over a thousand 
chemicals there.

1821
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:53,150
And if you look in the index,
the ones in bold are the ones that are 

1822
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:53,150
psychoactive.

1823
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:53,150
And so,
uh,

1824
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:57,920
actually before nine slash 11 happened,
I was a part of a study group where 

1825
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,461
we're kind of working our way through it
and every two weeks we get this little 

1826
01:21:01,461 --> 01:21:02,430
powder in the mail and experiment with 
it and try it.

1827
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:03,520
And then,
uh,

1828
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:08,650
you know,
nine slash 11 came and they started 

1829
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:08,650
sending a smallpox or whatever it was 
through the mail.

1830
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:09,210
The anthrax.
Anthrax.

1831
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:09,780
Yeah.
And so,

1832
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,840
you know,
this chemist was out of the country and 

1833
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,311
he says,
I'm not sending any more powder through 

1834
01:21:16,311 --> 01:21:16,440
the US mail.
So that ended that experiment.

1835
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:21,441
But a lot of things you're hearing about
now are things that are coming off his 

1836
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:21,441
books.
He,

1837
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:22,350
he,
he is,

1838
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,360
he's,
he's really declining now.

1839
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:25,620
But uh,
he's,

1840
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,200
he's,
he should have gotten a Nobel prize now.

1841
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:31,580
The way he would do this as he'd,
he'd get an idea for a chemical.

1842
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,130
They say,
well,

1843
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,860
what if I moved this Adam over to this 
part of the ring?

1844
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,280
And then he'd synthesize that and then 
he'd start out with what he would think 

1845
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:40,280
to be a sub,
you know,

1846
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:44,250
standard dose or real low dose.
And he'd work his way up over the period

1847
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:49,251
of a month or so.
And he did this with like a thousand 

1848
01:21:49,251 --> 01:21:51,060
chemicals himself until he finally found
out what the active dose was.

1849
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:52,920
And then he,
he had a group of people,

1850
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:58,790
which I've met several of them.
There's only one or two of them still 

1851
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,431
alive actually,
but they're all in their sixties and 

1852
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:01,431
seventies.
And they're.

1853
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:05,951
And they're,
they're the ones that are talked about 

1854
01:22:05,951 --> 01:22:07,611
in the front part of the book and then 
in the back part where he synthesizes 

1855
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:10,671
it,
there's all these comments of what 

1856
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:14,160
people,
it took them and I've seen the original 

1857
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,160
documents for these comments for each 
paragraph.

1858
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,810
There's like 16 pages,
single spaced,

1859
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:20,830
typed A.
I mean this was in depth research that 

1860
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,500
they did for a number of years over 
hundreds of compounds

1861
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:27,570
she imagined being friends with that guy
while this was all going on every day.

1862
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:32,611
What are you doing today?
We're going to the center of the 

1863
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:32,611
university.
What a godly man.

1864
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:33,850
I did that yesterday,
don't you guys take a day off

1865
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,160
and,
and I'll tell you what,

1866
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:37,590
if you sat down and talked with them 
when you know he's,

1867
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:39,690
he's declining mentally a little bit and
he's blind now.

1868
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:43,680
But if you sat down and talked with him,
you would think that he'd been your next

1869
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:44,780
door neighbor growing up.
You know,

1870
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,820
he could talk to you about anything.
And he's.

1871
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,380
He was one of the hat is one of the 
happiest people I know.

1872
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,490
I'm sure he's probably never been filled
it up now,

1873
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:54,270
but he's.
He's a serious scientists,

1874
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:57,350
a very serious,
just nothing wrong with that as well,

1875
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,540
you know,
in the idea of being a serious scientist

1876
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,760
and not experimenting with your 
consciousness being mutually.

1877
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,680
You might be able to find a picture of 
Sasha and lab.

1878
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,010
His lab was an old,
a potting shed out behind his house is 

1879
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,300
still there and again,
they've now bottled up everything.

1880
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:15,100
Anyone get to the Smithsonian or 
something,

1881
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:17,320
but it's.
If you look at it and you say,

1882
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,120
God,
this,

1883
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:20,500
you know,
this is a mad scientist place.

1884
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,540
You know,
it's it.

1885
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:25,270
All this stuff came out of just such a 
small little shed.

1886
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,560
Yeah.
Hamilton Morris actually went in the 

1887
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:30,560
shed viewing.
Yeah,

1888
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:30,720
that's it right there.
Yeah,

1889
01:23:30,721 --> 01:23:35,340
there it is.
I mean this is a leaky old potting shed.

1890
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,310
That's what your shed looks like.
If you'd done drugs a million times,

1891
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:44,020
just starts looking like that.
I mean that guy has done every drug 

1892
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,020
there is a million times over.

1893
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,300
Yeah,
but you know,

1894
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:49,330
he,
he doesn't like pot that I put out a 

1895
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,421
podcast once worked area.
He and his wife were talking and he's 

1896
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,450
talking about this one experience that 
they had and he says,

1897
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,350
oh,
it was awesome.

1898
01:23:54,351 --> 01:23:59,351
You know,
we stopped time and we actually stopped 

1899
01:23:59,351 --> 01:23:59,351
it.
He says,

1900
01:23:59,351 --> 01:23:59,600
I don't know why we started that clock 
again.

1901
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:00,200
And she said,
well,

1902
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,430
you chickened out.
And he said,

1903
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,200
what were we on that time?
She said,

1904
01:24:03,201 --> 01:24:05,840
brownies,
but normally,

1905
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:06,320
uh,
he,

1906
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:07,430
he doesn't like pot.
It doesn't,

1907
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:12,480
you know,
I know probably about 25 percent of the 

1908
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:12,480
psychedelic people just don't get along 
with pot.

1909
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,910
That's interesting.
What's the number one concern?

1910
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:15,500
Or if they don't like it,
they just,

1911
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:20,501
they don't like it.
Just I wonder if it's the self examined 

1912
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:20,501
atory aspects of it.
Well,

1913
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:23,190
some of these chemicals get pretty self 
explanatory inventory.

1914
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,470
It's true.
Acid.

1915
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,000
Sure.

1916
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,930
Mushrooms for sure.
Yeah.

1917
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:27,650
I don't know.
There's a,

1918
01:24:27,651 --> 01:24:30,050
there's a real abrasive quality to 
eating pot.

1919
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,400
It was an abrasive self examined Tory 
thing that a lot of people find very 

1920
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,131
uncomfortable and you've got to really 
practice with each dose until you get 

1921
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:39,260
the right amount to.
Yes,

1922
01:24:39,261 --> 01:24:44,261
you do and you don't really don't know,
like you're getting a cookie from 

1923
01:24:44,261 --> 01:24:46,100
somebody unless you've been.
Even if you made them yourself,

1924
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:48,650
you know,
you have to like test out east batch and

1925
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:53,651
go,
well this is a strong batch or this is 

1926
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:53,651
not a strong writer.
This one,

1927
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:53,651
you know.

1928
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:56,360
Well we had a friend who had a going 
away party last night.

1929
01:24:56,361 --> 01:24:57,770
We're in blinking.
Uh,

1930
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:03,070
we had this little party and somebody 
made some brownies and they said don't 

1931
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:06,110
eat more than a quarter of one.
And she got there late famous last words

1932
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:11,170
and she ate two brownies.
That was on a Saturday night and the 

1933
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,730
following Tuesday she was still too soon
to go to work.

1934
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,800
Oh my God,
that's an excuse.

1935
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,740
So Lazy Bitch didn't want to go to work.
I got,

1936
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:21,950
I got stone one time that it lasted over
24 hours.

1937
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:27,970
They were,
we had a friend that was just making 

1938
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:27,970
this delta nine.
It was just pure.

1939
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:31,430
They take over a pound of Hash and it go
down to like one gram,

1940
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,520
oh my God.
And it was in these little bottles and 

1941
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,730
you'd have to take it out with a pinhead
and titrate it with you.

1942
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:42,730
Could,
you could smoke it or you could titrate 

1943
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:42,730
it into alcohol?
Well,

1944
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:42,730
I,
you know,

1945
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:45,110
it's all stuck in the bottom of the 
bottle and it wasn't coming out.

1946
01:25:45,111 --> 01:25:47,300
So I thought,
well microwave it just a little bit.

1947
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,700
And I was doing five seconds,
five seconds,

1948
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:54,701
nothing.
So I went to 11 seconds and it shot out 

1949
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:55,550
like a volcano and I had it on a piece 
of paper,

1950
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,290
paper towel.
I was living in Florida then.

1951
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:58,930
And,
and uh,

1952
01:25:58,931 --> 01:26:00,920
the woman who's now my wife was in 
California.

1953
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:04,010
And anyhow I took the towel in.
I didn't want to waste it.

1954
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:05,570
So I ate it.
I swallowed it.

1955
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,310
You ate the whole towel?
Well,

1956
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:09,920
it was just a little part of the tile 
that had the pot on.

1957
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,670
And then I called her and I told her 
what I did and she said,

1958
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:15,680
oh,
that tall has chlorine.

1959
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,980
And she wasn't worried about the pot and
she's a nurse with a master's in health,

1960
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:20,750
you know.
So I took her advice seriously.

1961
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:23,660
She said all that chlorine and stuff,
that's the towel.

1962
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:28,661
You shouldn't have eaten the towel.
And of course by then I'm starting to 

1963
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:28,990
get kind of panicky.
So I took some pepto Basey,

1964
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:32,120
which kind of activated the whole thing 
and I was stoned for good.

1965
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:34,310
Forty eight hours.
Forty eight hours.

1966
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:39,550
I was functional after 24,
but I couldn't tell.

1967
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:40,970
Oh,
I could tell I was still high.

1968
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,730
It's very uncomfortable.
This is not fun.

1969
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:46,290
So this person,
your friend was,

1970
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,970
was high,
she said until Tuesday.

1971
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,370
What Day did she started on?
Saturday night.

1972
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:53,290
Late.
So Sunday,

1973
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,120
Monday.
And then Tuesday she,

1974
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:59,670
she went to work Tuesday,
but she said she was not feeling too 

1975
01:26:59,670 --> 01:26:59,670
good.
Oh my goodness.

1976
01:26:59,670 --> 01:26:59,670
No,
you don't want to do that.

1977
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,900
It seems so crazy.
Oh it is.

1978
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:04,630
And that's.
Both of those were accidents,

1979
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:06,910
you know,
that's only when you eat it,

1980
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,070
but it didn't kill us.
Yeah,

1981
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:09,940
of course.
No,

1982
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:14,941
it doesn't kill anybody unless you do 
something really stupid while you're in 

1983
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:17,641
that state.
It won't be the drug that kills you 

1984
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:17,641
though.
Well,

1985
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:17,641
it could be.
It could be.

1986
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:17,990
If you're really stupid,
right?

1987
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,090
I mean,
you wouldn't overdose,

1988
01:27:19,091 --> 01:27:21,190
you can't overdose on can overdose for 
sure.

1989
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:21,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1990
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:26,941
It's,
it's one of those things where should 

1991
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:26,941
you be able to go to the hardware store 
and buy a saw?

1992
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:26,980
I say you sure,
sure.

1993
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,620
But if enough people cut their hands off
with saws.

1994
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:31,360
Well we have like protests,
you know,

1995
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:33,370
make it so that it's very difficult to 
get a solid.

1996
01:27:33,371 --> 01:27:37,210
You have to get a license to get a saw.
He should wear a sign saying I'm stupid.

1997
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:40,270
I used to solve when I'm stoned.
All the same argument really can be used

1998
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:41,730
about firearms,
etc.

1999
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,080
The fact that people use them against 
other people,

2000
01:27:44,081 --> 01:27:46,630
but the idea that if you have a firearm 
that it's dangerous.

2001
01:27:46,631 --> 01:27:51,631
Like is iT,
is it really dangerous if you know what 

2002
01:27:51,631 --> 01:27:54,121
you're doing,
it seems like you can control a lot of 

2003
01:27:54,121 --> 01:27:54,820
what's dangerous and not dangerous about
a firearm and then because,

2004
01:27:54,821 --> 01:27:59,821
well,
bad people can have guns and bad things 

2005
01:27:59,821 --> 01:27:59,821
can happen.
that is true,

2006
01:27:59,821 --> 01:27:59,920
but does that mean that good people 
can't have them?

2007
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:02,260
Like that seems to be a weird sort of an
argument.

2008
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:02,870
No,
I,

2009
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:04,130
I was trained with guns,
you know,

2010
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:09,220
I went hunting with my dad and in high 
school the marine corps had a gun club 

2011
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:14,081
that we joined in and we'd go out and 
shoot a 30 caliber machine guns and 

2012
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:15,560
browning automatics and stuff like that.
But we learned gun safety.

2013
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:16,850
We,
we learned a lot about it.

2014
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:17,770
Yeah,
I.

2015
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,880
people are just,
we have a very detached society and I 

2016
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,741
have a friend.
No names will be named who gets mad at 

2017
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:28,490
ugg boots because they're made out of 
sheep skin.

2018
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,610
He thinks that's fucked up.
Did they take these sheets and they skin

2019
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:32,870
them and they make boots out.
I'm like,

2020
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:35,540
why the fuck would you wear that?
But meanwhile he eats meat.

2021
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:39,620
Here's his fucking car.
Has leather seats.

2022
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,040
Like,
I mean it,

2023
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,710
it's,
it's so bizarre.

2024
01:28:42,711 --> 01:28:47,711
It's not even vegetarian like,
but this is the draw the line at the 

2025
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:50,340
sheepskin boots like this is fucked up 
to using the sheepskin like,

2026
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,220
okay,
but you're

2027
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:54,210
getting in hunting now and you know,
you're,

2028
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:58,290
you're talk about deer hunting.
I mean it's calling a herd if somebody's

2029
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,730
going to die in the forest.
anyhow.

2030
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:02,120
And why not you them rather than the 
wolf eat

2031
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:02,800
him or something?
Yeah,

2032
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:04,500
you're gonna.
You're not mean dear.

2033
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,880
Don't live forever.
They die.

2034
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,880
They don't last very long.
Either freeze to death.

2035
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,190
That happens a lot to the place where I 
went,

2036
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:16,191
Montana,
they freeze a lot or they get killed by 

2037
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:16,191
predators,
but they never reach old.

2038
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:18,120
Age just doesn't happen.
There's no oLd age for a deer,

2039
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,170
and if you live in some place that that 
deer,

2040
01:29:20,171 --> 01:29:22,170
is there a problem or deer are a 
problem,

2041
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:28,130
you want to shoot him if he,
even if you're not against hunting 

2042
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,400
because they couldn't be a real problem,
we don't think of them as rats.

2043
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,800
Erad is just an animal and an animal 
that has infiltrated entire cities and 

2044
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:38,010
entire population areas where they know 
people are.

2045
01:29:38,011 --> 01:29:43,011
They know there's a food source and 
they've infiltrated the deer the exact 

2046
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:43,011
same way.
And the idea that,

2047
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:43,440
well,
you know,

2048
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:44,160
it's all our fault.

2049
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,290
We came to where the deer are.
Actually,

2050
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:51,380
there's more deer today than there was 
in 1492 when columbus didn't land here.

2051
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:57,210
There's,
there's more deer today than they've 

2052
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,871
been ever ever in the recorded history 
of this country and that's just because 

2053
01:29:59,871 --> 01:30:04,611
of land management and because also 
there's very few predators and so the 

2054
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:08,601
only way they get killed as by people 
killing them and there's a lot of areas 

2055
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:11,661
where there's just too much space.
You can't kill them all like go through 

2056
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:12,090
like rural Pennsylvania.
My god,

2057
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,740
they're everywhere.
Upstate New York.

2058
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,860
Insane.
How many?

2059
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,860
We lived out in long island for a while 
doing a house,

2060
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:18,850
sitting job and they were all over the 
place,

2061
01:30:18,851 --> 01:30:20,010
all over the place.
There.

2062
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,310
They literally,
Oregon has a serious problem.

2063
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:25,080
You know when people don't understand 
well,

2064
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:26,580
what would be the problem?
The problem is,

2065
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:31,581
first of all,
car accidents have a huge amount of 

2066
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:34,311
people get in car accidents with deer 
and deer can go through your windshield 

2067
01:30:34,311 --> 01:30:34,311
and kill you.

2068
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,730
The whole.
The antlers can.

2069
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,800
They've killed people before,
not just once.

2070
01:30:37,801 --> 01:30:42,801
It's happened many times and god forbid 
you live in an area that has fucking 

2071
01:30:42,801 --> 01:30:45,260
moose because that will kill.
That will land on you.

2072
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,860
A lot of pressure.
That would just gear though.

2073
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,120
Yes they did.
Did you ever hear that funny?

2074
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,420
Nine slash 11 call with the guy that hit
a deer,

2075
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:53,250
put it in his back seat and then the 
deer bit him,

2076
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:59,040
he,
he escaped who's in a phone booth and 

2077
01:30:59,040 --> 01:30:59,580
the dog had smelled blood and he was 
kept him in the phone booth.

2078
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,030
Oh,
it's a whole areas phone call.

2079
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:02,850
Yeah.
No,

2080
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:07,851
I never heard that one.
But I did hear the one where the cops 

2081
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:11,120
took someone's pot and made pot brownies
and then they called the cops on 

2082
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:17,091
themselves.
They were saying they're dying and he 

2083
01:31:17,091 --> 01:31:17,091
was like,
can you please hurry up?

2084
01:31:17,091 --> 01:31:20,690
Time's going really,
really slow as someone who's been there 

2085
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:23,280
before and has it been like,
you know,

2086
01:31:23,281 --> 01:31:25,260
like way too high on a cookie going,
shit,

2087
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:28,260
I fucked up man.
I know what it must have been like.

2088
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:29,940
And there is proof.
It makes you stupid.

2089
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,430
can twists your reality.
Yeah,

2090
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,370
that's.
They knew.

2091
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,680
I don't think they knew what they were 
getting into.

2092
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:43,010
People that don't understand it.
It's actually kind of ironic because if 

2093
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,560
you look at the,
uh,

2094
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:45,660
the idea behind it is,
I mean,

2095
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:52,650
I just don't think they understand that 
when you keep something illegal,

2096
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,020
you restrict the information that gets 
out when he's tricked,

2097
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,910
the information that gets out a lot of 
misinformation,

2098
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:00,550
gets out a lot of confusion and it 
actually is worse for people.

2099
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:04,480
That's where this eating pot comes into 
place because they don't understand that

2100
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:09,481
when you eat pot it gets processed by 
your liver and it produces something 

2101
01:32:09,481 --> 01:32:14,131
called 11 hydroxy metabolite,
which is four to five times more 

2102
01:32:14,131 --> 01:32:14,131
psychoactive than thc.

2103
01:32:14,131 --> 01:32:18,600
It's a completely different psychedelic 
experience and so they eat it and they 

2104
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,081
think someone poisoned them or they 
think that someone laced in laced it as 

2105
01:32:22,081 --> 01:32:23,710
I've heard laced a bunch of times like 
this is just laced man,

2106
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:25,550
so lays this because they're freaking 
out.

2107
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:25,920
Like,
oh,

2108
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,940
we're going to die.
They haven't been done before.

2109
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:30,820
I've never been that stone before.
I think I'm having an overdose.

2110
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:31,480
And so it,
my wife,

2111
01:32:31,481 --> 01:32:33,460
he says,
pot.

2112
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,740
You'd be the first ever buddy.
Well,

2113
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:40,741
you know,
the other thing about eating it is we 

2114
01:32:40,741 --> 01:32:40,741
all have such a different metabolism.
You know,

2115
01:32:40,741 --> 01:32:41,860
some people start coming out in an hour 
and a half,

2116
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:46,861
two hours.
For me it takes almost three and a half 

2117
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:49,291
hours to come on,
so you have to be careful in that time 

2118
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:52,231
and not lose your patients and say,
well it didn't have enough and then you 

2119
01:32:52,231 --> 01:32:54,310
eat another part and then yeah,
much and it doesn't really.

2120
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,960
It depends on many,
many,

2121
01:32:55,961 --> 01:33:00,961
many factors and that's another issue 
with the illegality of it is you're not 

2122
01:33:00,961 --> 01:33:02,290
getting the same sort of standardized 
doses you get.

2123
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:07,440
If you ordered tylenol or you were to 
vitamin c capsule or something like 

2124
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:07,440
that,
you're getting this,

2125
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:12,150
you're getting weirdness and unless you 
know the guy who makes the product that 

2126
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:13,090
you use,
you're just guessing it's not worth it.

2127
01:33:13,091 --> 01:33:18,091
Stay sober.
Don't show your pants where there's a 

2128
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:20,461
lot of really in depth research going on
with cannabis oils and things like that 

2129
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:24,931
that we know one scientist that's doing 
some amazing things with it and working 

2130
01:33:24,931 --> 01:33:25,330
with cancer patients and all that.
You know,

2131
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:30,331
there's.
There's so much information about being 

2132
01:33:30,331 --> 01:33:31,570
an anti aging and anticancer and I mean 
we're talking about intensive studies,

2133
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,630
thousands of them that show all the 
benefits of it and that's not even 

2134
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,800
mentioning the hemp benefit,
which is even more important really when

2135
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:40,930
you think about the forest and what the 
hemp could do.

2136
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,250
Yeah.
It's,

2137
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:46,120
um,
it's a weird time where we have all this

2138
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:50,530
information about what could be 
beneficial for our society,

2139
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:54,220
how much money could be generated by 
having legal cannabis,

2140
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:59,550
how much tax dollars will be generated 
just in sales tax alone was pretty 

2141
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,540
substantial and that these transactions 
are still going on today.

2142
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:02,190
They're going,
I mean,

2143
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:05,610
there might be an increase in pot use.
If pot were made illegal,

2144
01:34:05,611 --> 01:34:10,611
they probably would be an increase,
but the reality is if you just got what 

2145
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:13,390
we have today,
what people are doing,

2146
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:16,140
where people are doing it illegally and 
made it legal,

2147
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:21,170
you would.
The states and the cities would get a 

2148
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:21,170
tremendous amount of money.
But see,

2149
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:22,480
they're getting money through the war 
and drugs.

2150
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:27,481
I'd only found out recently three 
quarters of all the arrests are pot 

2151
01:34:27,481 --> 01:34:31,260
possession.
Primarily three quarters and so three 

2152
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,721
quarters of all the money that's gone 
into the war on drugs and think of all 

2153
01:34:33,721 --> 01:34:33,730
the drug testing goes on.
They're not testing for lsd.

2154
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,000
They're testing for pot and it's a big 
industry.

2155
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:38,770
The prison industry,
such a big industry.

2156
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:41,090
That's why they're fighting it because 
in guard union.

2157
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:41,770
Yeah,
yeah,

2158
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,980
yeah.
When I heard prison guard unions lobby 

2159
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:46,980
against making drugs,
illegal drugs,

2160
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:51,961
legal rather partnership for drug free 
America and I think that's a seagram's 

2161
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:55,591
and a few other liquor companies are the
ones who fund that used to be 

2162
01:34:55,591 --> 01:34:57,130
pharmaceutical company probably there.
They had a big part of it as well.

2163
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,130
I was actually,
I think

2164
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,720
pharmaceuticals,
alcohol,

2165
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,900
tobacco and pharmaceutical companies 
where the.

2166
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:06,950
The primary drug pushers or again,
the way I described it was the them 

2167
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:12,101
doing commercials against paul was like 
hookers doing commercials against 

2168
01:35:12,101 --> 01:35:12,101
strippers.
It's like,

2169
01:35:12,101 --> 01:35:13,620
that's a good analogy.
That one.

2170
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,110
Yeah,
so stupid.

2171
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:20,140
It just doesn't make any sense.
Like how can you have a partnership for 

2172
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,160
a drug free America that's sponsored by 
drugs like drugs?

2173
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:24,200
Give them millions dot not just a couple
of bucks,

2174
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,520
not just drugs.
A look,

2175
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:29,060
I like what you're doing about pot.
We disagree about alcohol and tobacco.

2176
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:30,950
I think they're awesome products and 
great from humanity,

2177
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:34,020
so I'm going to send you some money.
Alcohol and tobacco are given drugs,

2178
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:35,960
a bad name.
That's just so ridiculous.

2179
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:37,700
We're just a weird time.
We're in a really,

2180
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:40,460
really weird time in human history where
again,

2181
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:45,461
we have so much information and yet 
there's so much contradictory behavior 

2182
01:35:45,461 --> 01:35:45,590
going on.

2183
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:47,660
Contradictory to the evidence that's in 
place.

2184
01:35:47,661 --> 01:35:52,661
Contradictory to logic or contradictory 
to reason like why are you arresting 

2185
01:35:52,661 --> 01:35:55,670
somebody for a plant ever?
What does anybody get hurt by this?

2186
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,440
Didn't stop.
STop.

2187
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,600
What do you do when you were a cop?
For who?

2188
01:35:59,601 --> 01:36:04,601
For the corporations.
You're supposed to be a cop to protect 

2189
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:07,061
the people,
enforced the law and protect the people 

2190
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:07,061
and the law should protect the people.
So the idea is what?

2191
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:07,700
Cops are only supposed to enforce the 
law.

2192
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:12,701
They're not here to protect people.
Will the laws that don't protect people 

2193
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:16,001
are fucking stupid and you don't protect
people by locking them in jail because 

2194
01:36:16,001 --> 01:36:16,001
they have plants on them.
That's just dumb.

2195
01:36:16,001 --> 01:36:17,760
Exactly.
So we've got other shit to do,

2196
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:18,550
you know,
this is a good,

2197
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:22,290
good place to put up the item about jury
nullification.

2198
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:22,970
You know,
uh,

2199
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:28,550
people don't realize this,
but it used to be part of the judge's 

2200
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:31,950
instruction to the jury that if you 
don't find this law appropriate,

2201
01:36:31,951 --> 01:36:35,250
you can find the person not guilty and 
they don't know.

2202
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:40,330
They keep that.
Now if you hand out a literature or a 

2203
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:40,330
piece of literature about that at a 
courthouse,

2204
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,070
you'll get arrested.
They won't let you say it,

2205
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,590
but it's still the law jury 
nullification.

2206
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:46,080
And,
and I've actually been in one case where

2207
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:51,081
I did this as a juror that in fact if 
I'm ever on any kind of a pot case,

2208
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:52,770
unless there was violence,
you know,

2209
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:57,771
that'll look different.
But if it's just a simple possession 

2210
01:36:57,771 --> 01:36:57,990
case,
I don't care what the facts are and what

2211
01:36:57,991 --> 01:37:02,991
the judge says,
you can still say not guilty and there 

2212
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:02,991
is nothing that can be done about it.
Wow.

2213
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:06,000
And people need to know that.
I mean there's a big jury nullification,

2214
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,210
a movement on the web you can find out 
about.

2215
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:11,130
But it's hard to get your head around 
because you know,

2216
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,190
people hear the judge's instruction and 
they say,

2217
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:14,280
well,
I had to find them guilty.

2218
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:14,910
Oh you don't?

2219
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:18,300
Yeah.
It should all be legal.

2220
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,810
It's really simple.
We should hire people to study it.

2221
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:26,250
Use the government funds that you would 
normally spend on law enforcement.

2222
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:31,460
Use those in a better way to hire people
to study what are the actual effects of 

2223
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:36,411
this stuff and inform people not by 
basis of your prejudice in one way or 

2224
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:39,900
another or what your biased opinion 
would be one way,

2225
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,030
but the actual facts like here's the 
facts.

2226
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:47,210
It might fuck up your memory.
It seems like when you get high messes 

2227
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:48,270
with your short term memory,
you might get tongue tied,

2228
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,300
might get locked up.
If you know how to do here,

2229
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,770
here's the negative.
Here's the current smoking.

2230
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:57,771
Something in general,
probably not the best thing for eating 

2231
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:57,771
it.
You might freak the fuck out.

2232
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:59,520
Jump off a building.
I mean eating is a little scary.

2233
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:01,080
You could have some nightmares.

2234
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:02,790
You have to know what you're doing.
Show people what it is.

2235
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:03,660
Well,
vaporizer,

2236
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,660
probably a really good move as far as 
health wise,

2237
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,800
probably the safest bet.
Here's what happens,

2238
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:12,890
here's what a good dose is.
Here's what happens when you have half 

2239
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:12,890
that dose,
here's what happens.

2240
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:13,860
If you have a quarter of that dose,
knock yourself out,

2241
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,080
do what you want to do,
but no one's going to die and that would

2242
01:38:16,081 --> 01:38:20,610
be that simple and then start taxing the
shit out of it and my goodness,

2243
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:23,220
would we have money?
We wouLd have money for everything if we

2244
01:38:23,221 --> 01:38:26,280
started making marijuana legal and have 
a high tax shit.

2245
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:31,281
Let's make the tax 10 percent,
25 percent in Colorado in denver or 

2246
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:31,290
something like that.
I love Colorado.

2247
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:34,600
Colorado is always on the ball.
We're always ahead of everybody there.

2248
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:39,680
They're animals.
they're living up there with bears and 

2249
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:39,680
shit at that altitude.

2250
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,680
They don't have the oppression of which 
is awesome.

2251
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:44,070
That's just an awesome state.
Says all around awesome.

2252
01:38:44,071 --> 01:38:46,140
Colorado's one of my all time favorite 
states.

2253
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:51,230
You lived there for awhile.
That 25 percent a smart move because I 

2254
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:54,681
don't mind paying if I have to pay four 
bucks for a joint or whatever it is and 

2255
01:38:54,681 --> 01:38:57,861
I'm paying a dollar know I don't mind 
that it's probably gonna be less 

2256
01:38:57,861 --> 01:39:00,930
expensive than the black market and 
it'll be fine.

2257
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,090
Like look,
marijuana's not that expensive.

2258
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:06,090
When you think about what alcohol costs,
if you go to a bar and try to have a few

2259
01:39:06,091 --> 01:39:08,960
drinks,
look if you grow your own cheapest,

2260
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:10,710
fuck,
but if you buy it,

2261
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,560
it's really not that expensive for how 
much you use.

2262
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:18,830
You use a vaporizer,
you can get about three or four to one 

2263
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:18,830
on thing,
you know?

2264
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:22,270
Yeah.
ANd look in comparison to so many other 

2265
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:23,590
things that are really expensive.
It's kind of silly to talk about it.

2266
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:24,800
Yeah,
and that's now,

2267
01:39:24,801 --> 01:39:26,750
whIle it's fairly illegal,

2268
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,040
no pot,
I can see that the war on drugs is 

2269
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,040
making money off of it.
Psychedelics?

2270
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,610
I think it's because they're afraid.
You might start your thinking,

2271
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:34,920
you know,
that you know,

2272
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:36,490
for.
I used mgma,

2273
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:41,820
I was an irish catholic republican 
lawyer and afterwards I was still irish

2274
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:46,130
and everything else went away.
Wow.

2275
01:39:46,131 --> 01:39:48,830
That's what a weird.
How long did that transition take?

2276
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:51,560
Was it from the first hit you took?
You knew something was up.

2277
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:56,680
I think it took from the night that I 
ingested it until the next morning 

2278
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,900
sometime and you know,
all of a sudden I realized a whole.

2279
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:03,380
I just had a real awakening and I felt 
like I did when I was a young boy,

2280
01:40:03,381 --> 01:40:04,970
you know,
that I've had,

2281
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:10,270
I've helped a lot of people on their 
first trips and almost invariably they 

2282
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:10,270
say the same thing.
well,

2283
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:14,741
I felt like this before.
I mean you don't go crazy or anything 

2284
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:16,570
and it's really not a psychedelic and,
and so you,

2285
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:19,340
it's a gentle way to get in and it's so 
good for therapy.

2286
01:40:19,341 --> 01:40:20,660
You know,
michael and annie,

2287
01:40:20,661 --> 01:40:21,860
mid offer in the,
uh,

2288
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,920
in South Carolina are now,
I think entering the second phase of an 

2289
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:26,920
mdm,
a test,

2290
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,110
but he was.
So the first phase one was uh,

2291
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:30,000
treating,
uh,

2292
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:33,180
rape victims with serious ptsd and they 
had a,

2293
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:36,250
an,
an amazing amount of recovery.

2294
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:41,250
I'm actual recovery.
One woman hadn't left the house in 15 

2295
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,200
years and now she's got a job and I 
think something like that.

2296
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,560
But the pentagon has now approved this 
study for post dramatic stress disorder 

2297
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,140
and they're looking at,
uh,

2298
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:52,010
some other studies with the pentagon 
because ptsd is such a huge problem.

2299
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:55,930
And mtma see,
here's why the drug coMpanies don't want

2300
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,000
it.
What michael and annie do,

2301
01:40:58,001 --> 01:41:03,001
I think they only do maybe two sessions 
with mtma is psychol,

2302
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:08,110
psychiatrist assisted and guided and all
psyChoanalysts or um,

2303
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,690
I dunno,
maybe not that high a level,

2304
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:13,450
but uh,
there's a lot of counseling goes on with

2305
01:41:13,451 --> 01:41:18,451
it and see when you take him,
dmh lowers so many barriers that you and

2306
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:22,550
your therapist can really talk honestly.
and they have had like spec.

2307
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:25,150
The phase one study is just to prove it 
won't kill somebody.

2308
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,850
And still they had some amazing 
recoveries.

2309
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:32,850
And now phase two,
they want to do the extended therapy 

2310
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:32,850
with the thing.
But see,

2311
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:36,250
the drug companies don't like it because
you only need one or two pills ever.

2312
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,500
Then you're done.
You don't keep taking it.

2313
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,660
They want things that they can keep you 
taking.

2314
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:46,200
It's interesting because it seems like 
there would be able to make some money 

2315
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:46,560
using that stuff if you get an.
But you know,

2316
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:47,980
they're going to be abuse with that.
There's,

2317
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,910
there's abuse with mdm may for sure.
Ravers,

2318
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,960
you know,
people are dying because they get 

2319
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:55,960
dehydrated in dance.
And most of us,

2320
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,160
because it's adulterated,
you know,

2321
01:41:57,161 --> 01:42:00,220
it's not pure mma.
And what do they cut it with?

2322
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:01,970
I don't know.
Uh,

2323
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:06,370
I think all kinds of things and it could
just be impurities in their processes.

2324
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,460
But uh,
probably some sort of,

2325
01:42:08,461 --> 01:42:08,750
you know,
it's,

2326
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,800
it is an infection and so they probably 
cut it with a little speed so you can 

2327
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:13,800
feel something.

2328
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,200
But uh,
you know,

2329
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:16,970
originally back in the early days when 
we were getting it,

2330
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,570
it was either in cap form and a lot of 
it was in powder,

2331
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,270
but it was pure mtma.
And of course we,

2332
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,060
we knew the source and stuff like that.
But today,

2333
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:30,061
you know,
they used to be a group called dance 

2334
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:30,061
safe and I don't think they're active 
anymore because they were the government

2335
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,890
shutting them down,
but they were doing free drug testing at

2336
01:42:32,891 --> 01:42:34,020
raves,
uh,

2337
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:36,610
to tell you if you have pure mdm,
shut that down,

2338
01:42:36,611 --> 01:42:41,611
that's so rude and short sighted.
They thought it was encouraging drug 

2339
01:42:41,611 --> 01:42:42,520
use,
but instead it was saving lives,

2340
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:43,770
saving lives.
how could you,

2341
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:48,820
that's such an illogical stance to take 
how you should never put something in 

2342
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:49,930
your mouth that you got from somebody 
you don't know.

2343
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,490
That's a good,
good thing to say,

2344
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:53,890
except if you want to put your penis in 
someone's mouth,

2345
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,480
well,
and you barely know them.

2346
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,870
You know,
I've never had anybody any stranger than

2347
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:03,780
that.
I've always gotten to know him at least 

2348
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:06,661
for a half hour.
I'm not saying that it's going to 

2349
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:06,661
happen.
It always leaves that day.

2350
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:06,661
I,
yeah,

2351
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:08,800
I'll go along with it.
Especially if you're on ecstasy.

2352
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,670
Think about it.
What you know in dallas,

2353
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:14,320
we,
some of our customers,

2354
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:19,321
there were some swinger clubs in dallas 
and so we would sell it to these cluBs 

2355
01:43:19,321 --> 01:43:23,880
because you can,
you can have an erection for hours on 

2356
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,471
it,
but you can't come and so the swinger's 

2357
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:26,471
clubs loved it,
but people,

2358
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:28,900
I come out here to the west coast and 
the word is,

2359
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:33,930
oh,
you're going to have a third day let 

2360
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:35,560
down hangover and,
and you can't have sex on it.

2361
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:38,860
And I thought wow,
that's a completely different story.

2362
01:43:38,861 --> 01:43:42,070
and everybody bought into it out here.
But in dallas it was a totally different

2363
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:44,170
story.
Nobody was having that third second,

2364
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:49,171
third day blahs or anything.
So in dallas you were getting pure mtma 

2365
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:49,660
right.
And here they're getting this.

2366
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:51,980
I don't know if places getting it

2367
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,890
pure unless you really doing it,
you know,

2368
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,410
know the chemist.
But it was a veteran.

2369
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,470
Yeah,
it was,

2370
01:43:56,471 --> 01:43:59,480
it was definitely pure and you know,
that was legal at that time.

2371
01:43:59,481 --> 01:44:01,070
There's no reason to cut it and you 
know,

2372
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:06,071
it was a.
Do you remember when five meo dmt was 

2373
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:09,041
legal and you could buy it?
I'll buy like a coffee cup filled with 

2374
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:12,860
online and get the whole.
It was like $30.

2375
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:15,200
I know some people that have.
That's what I heard.

2376
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:16,010
I heard,
you know,

2377
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,980
I heard you know things.
It's weird.

2378
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:23,981
What was still legal.
Like salvia is legal in a lot of places 

2379
01:44:23,981 --> 01:44:23,981
still.
Yeah.

2380
01:44:23,981 --> 01:44:26,090
And then they have this Bath salts issue
which is really nutty.

2381
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,730
They'd take a compound like crystal man 
fade.

2382
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:31,910
They alter it so it becomes a different 
new compound.

2383
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:36,911
It's not categorized.
Then they say not for human consumption 

2384
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:40,871
so that it's bath salts,
but everybody knows you're supposed to 

2385
01:44:40,871 --> 01:44:43,631
smoke it because it's like crack or meth
or whatever the hell it is and they 

2386
01:44:43,631 --> 01:44:43,631
can't do anything about it.

2387
01:44:43,631 --> 01:44:46,160
It's amazing that there's been something
like a.

2388
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:48,650
I don't want to use the number because I
don't have it in front of me,

2389
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:53,651
but close to maybe 70 new compounds that
have been introduced in england this 

2390
01:44:53,651 --> 01:44:54,440
year.
Whoa.

2391
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:57,960
england knows how to party well.
Worldwide is probably higher.

2392
01:44:57,961 --> 01:45:00,730
It might only be 20,
it might have been 70 last year in 2010,

2393
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,130
but there are there.
There's just no way to stop these things

2394
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:04,640
coming.
Now.

2395
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:05,880
What are you doing in england?
Why?

2396
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:07,690
While you going crazy when they look.
Look,

2397
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,960
look,
if you had to live there,

2398
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:12,270
you'd have to do something new.
It's raining right now.

2399
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:13,980
It's snowing right now.
Yeah,

2400
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,110
it gets.
By the way,

2401
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:17,900
there's a bunch of people in england 
watching us right now live,

2402
01:45:17,901 --> 01:45:18,650
but yeah,
for sure.

2403
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:23,730
I love england.
I was just a manchester just to two 

2404
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:23,730
shows.
Manchester.

2405
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:24,380
Yeah,
dance house theater was awesome.

2406
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,390
It's just fun.
I love england.

2407
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:29,540
I liked the people there as audience 
members.

2408
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:34,541
They're amazing.
Are some of the best audience members 

2409
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:34,541
you ever get?
They're polite.

2410
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:34,580
TheY listened.
They get things.

2411
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:35,900
They understand where you're going and 
stuff.

2412
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:36,870
Yeah.
You know they,

2413
01:45:36,871 --> 01:45:37,640
they,
they're sharp.

2414
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,990
They know what's goIng on.
Well,

2415
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:41,000
I think,
I don't know what it is.

2416
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:41,630
I mean,
is it.

2417
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:44,240
Are they more educated in the school 
systems?

2418
01:45:44,241 --> 01:45:48,140
Definitely better that.
Even not the Private schools,

2419
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:51,980
but public schools or even better than.
The one thing that irks me,

2420
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:56,981
the most advanced society is that 
there's such a minimal amount of 

2421
01:45:57,501 --> 01:46:00,300
finances that are dedicated towards 
school systems.

2422
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,860
The minimum,
they're always trying to cut the school 

2423
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:05,860
budget.
There was cutting things.

2424
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:08,780
They should be pouring money into the 
public education system,

2425
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:13,840
pouring money into community centers,
pouring money into anything that 

2426
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,771
benefits young people in there cutting 
and things like music and art and the 

2427
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,580
grand sports cutting wrestling and a lot
of places,

2428
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,550
you know,
it's.

2429
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:25,570
It makes me sick because people need 
these things and it's greedy old people 

2430
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:27,520
that had these things in there,
a younger.

2431
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:30,500
They're designed deciding that these are
the things that should be cut.

2432
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:34,190
Those things should be uncut.
A bowl that should be like,

2433
01:46:34,191 --> 01:46:35,570
look,
here's your budget.

2434
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,930
You need to spend a $100,
million dollars on the school systems.

2435
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,060
After that.
You can do whatever the fuck you want as

2436
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,880
far as cleaning the streets up and doing
all that,

2437
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:48,100
but number one,
you need to do this because this is 

2438
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,100
what's going to take care of everything.
I'll go along with that.

2439
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,040
This is what's going to make the people 
that

2440
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,940
are babies become cool adults have you 
don't get that right.

2441
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,610
The whole society scrapped the whole 
generation,

2442
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:59,970
gone a whole generation that has to 
figure it out for themselves and there's

2443
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:04,971
that,
that attitude of pull yourself up by 

2444
01:47:04,971 --> 01:47:04,971
your own bootstraps and you know,
I figured it out.

2445
01:47:04,971 --> 01:47:06,570
You should figure it out too.
Like man,

2446
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:11,571
if you did figure it out,
then you should know how god damn hard 

2447
01:47:11,571 --> 01:47:13,080
it is to figure out and you should also 
know this is not the only way to do it.

2448
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:18,350
This is a silly way to do it.
To have unmotivated teachers that get 

2449
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:18,510
paid $25,000
a year.

2450
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:20,040
I mean,
how can you feed yourself?

2451
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:25,041
How can you,
how can you expect these people who 

2452
01:47:25,041 --> 01:47:27,321
you're entrusting to educate your 
children to be motivated when they can 

2453
01:47:27,321 --> 01:47:27,321
barely eat?

2454
01:47:27,321 --> 01:47:27,680
Right?
And,

2455
01:47:27,681 --> 01:47:32,681
and you know,
some of our best teachers are just so 

2456
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:33,090
amazing because they're working in the 
inner city voluntarily.

2457
01:47:33,091 --> 01:47:35,240
They could go other places,
some of them junior college and all,

2458
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:40,241
but they're there.
I have one friend who worked in the 

2459
01:47:40,241 --> 01:47:40,380
inner city in san francisco for a while,
another one here in la,

2460
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:43,010
and they were amazing men and they just,
you know,

2461
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:44,820
they did it because they wanted to help 
these kids.

2462
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:49,980
Well,
that's a beautiful notion and it's 

2463
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,811
beautiful when you meet people like that
and it's beautiful that they still 

2464
01:47:51,811 --> 01:47:54,271
exist.
It's just sad that corporations have 

2465
01:47:54,271 --> 01:47:58,231
controlled the political process to the 
point where when a person gets into 

2466
01:47:58,231 --> 01:47:59,050
power,
when a person becomes president,

2467
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,070
they they need never have a chance to do
a real overhaul.

2468
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,070
you never really are like the one person
who's in control.

2469
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:09,700
You have a million people that you owe 
that got you into that position that you

2470
01:48:09,701 --> 01:48:14,701
have to pay back or do their bidding or 
meet their interests before you do 

2471
01:48:15,341 --> 01:48:16,080
anything.
Right,

2472
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:17,930
and so that's.
That's what you know.

2473
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:19,930
That's where all these different laws 
come from.

2474
01:48:19,931 --> 01:48:22,270
They're so confusing and don't make any 
sense to people.

2475
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:26,470
We've got to figure out a way to govern 
people by actually governing people.

2476
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,770
It's like we accept that there's going 
to be so much,

2477
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:35,730
so much bullshit and so much corruption 
and so much thievery and so many slanted

2478
01:48:36,431 --> 01:48:37,120
Ideas.

2479
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:42,120
We just accept that there's going to be 
a certain amount of that because it's 

2480
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,880
always been that way and if you looked 
at that,

2481
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:44,860
you know,
it looked at a lot of the decisions that

2482
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:47,590
get made at the highest levels of 
government and like who they benefit.

2483
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:50,110
You would say,
this could never happen.

2484
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:53,470
This could never happen if we all had 
the right attitude.

2485
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:55,840
This caN only happen when money gets 
involved.

2486
01:48:55,841 --> 01:49:00,841
This can only happen when someone puts 
money ahead of humanity and that's like 

2487
01:49:00,841 --> 01:49:05,430
the real core part of our society that's
fucked up his education.

2488
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:11,250
I mean education,
not just in the small sense of teaching 

2489
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:11,250
people that don't know how to read,
how to read,

2490
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,990
but teaching people who are brilliant,
how to think about life.

2491
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:16,750
Exactly.
Not just how to count and how to,

2492
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,800
you know,
calculate the dates of fossils that you 

2493
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,991
find,
but how to think about humans and how 

2494
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,081
they engage with each other.
How to look at this temporary existence 

2495
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:28,690
in a correct way.

2496
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,200
Well,
you know,

2497
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:33,370
corporations set a lot of the agenda for
schools as far as the curriculum,

2498
01:49:33,371 --> 01:49:37,870
things like that because they're looking
to to get passive little cubicle workers

2499
01:49:37,871 --> 01:49:41,370
and see that was one of the lessons that
the power elite learned to the sixties.

2500
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:46,380
So it was all these young kids got 
educated because your parents got 

2501
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:47,490
educated from the gi bill and,
and uh,

2502
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,030
now

2503
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
we're educating these kids and they're 
getting too smart for Us and I think 

2504
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,230
they intentionally been dumbing down the
school system.

2505
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,500
How do they do that though?
Just by underfunding.

2506
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:57,280
Well,
look at Texas a,

2507
01:49:57,290 --> 01:50:02,290
the school books in Texas are teaching 
creationism and they're trying to get 

2508
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:02,290
evolution out of the textbooks 
completely.

2509
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:07,170
Right.
But you don't think that that's because 

2510
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:07,170
they're dumb,
right?

2511
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:07,170
They're just there.
Their religion.

2512
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:07,260
I mean,
not,

2513
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:10,480
not that they're dumb dumbs down the 
people though,

2514
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:11,980
but I'm sorry,
let me rephrase that.

2515
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:16,981
You don't think that they're doing that 
because they're trying to make people 

2516
01:50:16,981 --> 01:50:19,561
dumb there are.
There are people using those people to 

2517
01:50:19,561 --> 01:50:19,561
do that?
I think.

2518
01:50:19,561 --> 01:50:23,340
I think the corporations want people who
aren't really thinking out of the box 

2519
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:26,791
too much,
they can get those from the elite 

2520
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:28,711
private schools,
but isn't there like always going to be 

2521
01:50:28,711 --> 01:50:31,621
like a large base of fundamental people 
in places like Texas that they could 

2522
01:50:31,621 --> 01:50:32,750
just,
they could capitalize on by,

2523
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:37,940
by leaning in as far as like their 
decision making towards them because 

2524
01:50:38,651 --> 01:50:40,840
they know that that's going to aid them 
to get into office.

2525
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:41,950
Well,
yeaH,

2526
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:44,260
and of course I'm pretty cynical about 
that.

2527
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:47,470
I think the voting is pretty rigged 
anyhow with electronic voting,

2528
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:51,250
but a while there certainly has been 
shown in textually sexist.

2529
01:50:51,251 --> 01:50:52,540
You know,
I practice law in Texas,

2530
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:56,480
lived there for awhile and it's a pretty
a bible time kind.

2531
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,020
A very fundamentalist.
Oh yeah,

2532
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:04,100
yeah.
I was doing some jokes last time I was 

2533
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:04,100
in houston,
my friends.

2534
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:04,810
So this girl walked to the bathroom and 
said,

2535
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:07,340
if he talks about jesus one more time,
we are out of here,

2536
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:14,310
barely talked about jesus.
Then that be throw out a title of a 

2537
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,510
book,
caesar's messiah,

2538
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,580
a book that's out that talks about the 
jesus jesus actually being fictional.

2539
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,080
It's pretty interesting book.
Yeah.

2540
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:22,900
I read a thing about that.
You just like something to drink.

2541
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:23,620
Yeah,
I got it here.

2542
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:28,800
You got some.
You want some coffee to keep me awake 

2543
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:28,800
all day?

2544
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:28,800
Oh,
how dare you.

2545
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,440
That's right.
You tolD me already.

2546
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,040
Sorry.
Um,

2547
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:31,610
I,
yeah.

2548
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:36,620
I read a summary of that online or they 
were talking about this new study that 

2549
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:40,741
said that jesus may have been created 
and they found new documents that 

2550
01:51:40,741 --> 01:51:43,540
suggest he was either way.
It doesn't matter.

2551
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:46,690
I don't know if jesus was real or if 
jesus was artificial.

2552
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:52,020
My point is it doesn't make sense that 
he died and came back to life three days

2553
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:55,270
later and as long as you believe that we
have a problem,

2554
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:58,450
we've got a problem.
We have a disconnect in communication.

2555
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:01,750
We have a why would that be real?
We have that.

2556
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:03,100
We have.
Why?

2557
01:52:03,101 --> 01:52:05,080
What happened there?
He turned water into wine.

2558
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:08,110
Were you there when this happened?
Do you know how dumb people are?

2559
01:52:08,111 --> 01:52:13,111
Do you know how much people lie you do?
Did you imagine what that must've been 

2560
01:52:13,111 --> 01:52:16,381
like back when people couldn't even 
write shit down and it was 50 years 

2561
01:52:16,381 --> 01:52:18,130
after the so called event that somebody 
wrote it down for the first time?

2562
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:20,170
Of course,
and the way later than that,

2563
01:52:20,171 --> 01:52:25,171
that constantine and a bunch of bishops 
decided what goes in the book and what 

2564
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:25,171
doesn't.
Right?

2565
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:26,830
You know when they wrote the new 
testament,

2566
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:28,190
I'm like,
holy jesus.

2567
01:52:28,191 --> 01:52:33,191
Like they left stuff out.
They added stuff that there's so many 

2568
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:34,660
different people's fingerprints on that.
It's just nonsense,

2569
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,060
but it's about control.
They can't control the people,

2570
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:42,240
but the idea also that this is 
absolutely not saying that there's no 

2571
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,261
god if you've done psychedelics,
I think you've realized after a certain 

2572
01:52:46,261 --> 01:52:46,280
amount of those

2573
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:51,460
quote unquote breakthrough experiences,
I think you realize that you have no 

2574
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:52,910
idea what's going on in this other 
realm.

2575
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:57,110
Whatever these other realms are,
whether they're individually different,

2576
01:52:57,111 --> 01:53:02,111
whether they're all connected,
whether they're just frequencies on a 

2577
01:53:02,111 --> 01:53:02,111
dial,
whether it's five meo,

2578
01:53:02,111 --> 01:53:04,060
whether it's dmt,
whether it's psilocybin,

2579
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:09,130
whatever these realms are that you enter
into there is so fantastic and special 

2580
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:14,741
and strange and beyond description that 
the idea of god does not seem nearly as 

2581
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:18,380
ridiculous once you've had them.

2582
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,520
I there's a video of me out there and 
interview they did where I told the 

2583
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,070
stories about x hitting the street in 
dallas and I mentioned about the fact 

2584
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:29,240
that when I got to two,
at one point in my life in Florida,

2585
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:32,510
I decided I was going to be an atheist.
I really wanted to get rid of everything

2586
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:35,180
and so I was trying really hard to be an
atheist,

2587
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:38,750
but I had this friend lived on the edge 
of town with a farm and he get mushrooms

2588
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:42,350
from the cow patties in his colleague 
halyard and bring them into me.

2589
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:47,351
So I'd be an atheist during the week and
then I'd eat these mushrooms and 

2590
01:53:47,351 --> 01:53:51,101
saturday you can't be an atheist with 
five grams of dried mushrooms in your 

2591
01:53:51,101 --> 01:53:51,101
stomach.

2592
01:53:51,101 --> 01:53:51,400
Well,
you can't be sure.

2593
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:57,270
No,
that's the real problem is that you 

2594
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:58,711
can't be sure.
And my problem with religion is that 

2595
01:53:58,711 --> 01:53:59,710
when people are sure about something 
that they've never seen,

2596
01:53:59,711 --> 01:54:01,990
never experienced,
you're sure because you read it.

2597
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:04,360
Are you sure?
Because someone told it to you?

2598
01:54:04,361 --> 01:54:05,800
Sure.
Because it's your tradition,

2599
01:54:06,190 --> 01:54:08,260
like you gotta.
Tell me why.

2600
01:54:08,261 --> 01:54:13,261
You're sure if you're sure.
Because it's some demonstratable 

2601
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:13,261
science.
Okay,

2602
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:17,040
I got it.
But if you're sure just because you're 

2603
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,171
sure that god wants you to throw rocks 
at homosexuals because you saw that 

2604
01:54:19,171 --> 01:54:19,171
written down somewhere like,
wow,

2605
01:54:19,171 --> 01:54:21,790
that doesn't make sense.
Why would he tell us now why?

2606
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:23,980
Why?
How come god only tells one person like,

2607
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:29,060
doesn't god know that game?
The game of telephone doesn't know that 

2608
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:29,200
game.
He must know that that games,

2609
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:31,150
he made everything.
He's got to know that game sucks.

2610
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:34,200
So why would you tell one person like a 
few thousand years right now?

2611
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,530
Why wouldn't you tell us all the time

2612
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:37,760
when someBody asked me if I believe in 
god,

2613
01:54:37,761 --> 01:54:38,690
I just say,
okay,

2614
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:43,691
define what you mean by the word god,
and we really never get much past that 

2615
01:54:43,691 --> 01:54:45,410
because people,
a few people say,

2616
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:48,170
old man with a long white beard sitting 
on a throne.

2617
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:48,590
I said,
well,

2618
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:49,400
no,
I don't believe in that.

2619
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,060
see,
that's where I differ from you.

2620
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,350
Really?
Yeah.

2621
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:57,351
Because of the shit I've seen on 
mushrooms or way weirder than a guy 

2622
01:54:57,351 --> 01:54:57,570
living in the clouds.
You know,

2623
01:54:57,571 --> 01:55:01,320
I've seen tHings on dmt that made a guy 
in the clouds with a harp and a bunch of

2624
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,660
people around him with a,
with bird wings.

2625
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,520
That wasn't even.

2626
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,200
No,
I,

2627
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:08,210
I agree with that.
I'm saying I'm just,

2628
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,140
you know,
the old,

2629
01:55:09,141 --> 01:55:12,100
the catholic image of the guy in the 
throne with the white beard.

2630
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:17,360
It could be.
This is why because life is so stupid 

2631
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:21,201
and contradictory and weird and humans 
are so bizarre and so hypocritical and 

2632
01:55:21,841 --> 01:55:26,841
so strange and self destructive in our 
ax collectively make no sense to the 

2633
01:55:26,841 --> 01:55:31,431
individual,
and yet we all feel helpless in the 

2634
01:55:31,431 --> 01:55:33,420
momentum of the united species and its 
movement,

2635
01:55:33,421 --> 01:55:38,421
whether it's the polluting the ocean of 
the fucking up of the ozone layer and 

2636
01:55:38,421 --> 01:55:42,320
shit flying around in space,
slamming into each other because we've 

2637
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:42,320
got so many things floating around above
our earth.

2638
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:44,040
WHatever is that.
It's.

2639
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:48,510
It's so bizarre and contradictory and 
crazy that it aLmost seems like the work

2640
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:51,720
of a madman.
It almost seems like the work of a god,

2641
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:56,250
like just one crazy motherfucker that's 
designed to control this planet.

2642
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,830
Maybe acid trip.
He's just crazy asshoLe.

2643
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:01,200
He's like anybody else that gets into a 
position of power.

2644
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:03,290
He gets his fucking head,
gets bIg.

2645
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:05,310
It gets crazy.
He starts ordering people around,

2646
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,710
started doing nutty shit.
Like if you eat that apple,

2647
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:09,000
everyone's fucked.
That's it.

2648
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:10,050
I said it.
You did it.

2649
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:15,080
So over done.
But all of humanity forever has to 

2650
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:15,080
suffer.
Yes.

2651
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:15,770
Sorry,
[inaudible].

2652
01:56:15,771 --> 01:56:16,840
I said so.
Yeah,

2653
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:21,150
and the only way to fix that is you 
gotta get a guy who his son to sacrifice

2654
01:56:21,151 --> 01:56:23,040
his life,
like what?

2655
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,480
Come on.
You know,

2656
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:28,210
we get all wrapped up in the affairs of 
the world,

2657
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:33,230
but you've had an intense dreams.
You wake up and the only last for a few 

2658
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:34,990
moments you can't hold on to some of 
these dreams.

2659
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,990
I have a feeling that when we die,
it could be just like that.

2660
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:38,830
You say,
god,

2661
01:56:38,831 --> 01:56:39,360
I,
I,

2662
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:43,780
I felt like I was on a planet earth or 
something I can't remember.

2663
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:46,630
And you don't remember a damn thing 
about all this stuff we went through.

2664
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,150
It's certainly possible.
Sure.

2665
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,750
There's,
there's thoughts we don't know.

2666
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:54,810
Yeah,
you live an infinite life that's 

2667
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:56,791
interconnected one life to another and 
that's one of the reasons why you meet 

2668
01:56:56,791 --> 01:57:00,271
someone and they're an old soul or you 
meet someone and they're particularly 

2669
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:00,271
fortunate,
like,

2670
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:00,840
why is this guy particularly fortunate?
Why?

2671
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:05,930
Why is it,
why are people drawn to them initially 

2672
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:07,921
from the get go,
maybe this is things that they figured 

2673
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:08,770
out in past existences that we're not 
calculating in this existence.

2674
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:12,190
Maybe you have a certain amount of work 
that you can do in this existence,

2675
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:17,191
but you're basically still riding on the
momentum of fucking and ian have 

2676
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,180
different lives that you've lived over 
and over and over again.

2677
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:24,970
One of the things we can do in this life
that I don't know or they're not,

2678
01:57:24,971 --> 01:57:27,850
we can do it in another life,
but as with a human body,

2679
01:57:28,210 --> 01:57:32,590
there's a lot of physical pleasure that 
you can experience and I think that part

2680
01:57:32,591 --> 01:57:37,591
of what we should be doing here is 
having some physical pleasure and not 

2681
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:38,550
just getting into the spiritual world.
Sounds like someone's starting a cult.

2682
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:40,720
No,
I know how you do it.

2683
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:46,500
I know I used psychedelic people think 
or a commune or maybe like a new,

2684
01:57:47,741 --> 01:57:49,900
a new situation.
Now actually,

2685
01:57:49,901 --> 01:57:52,140
I'm assuming it.
I seldom leave my k.

2686
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,210
You seem like a very personable guy.
Well,

2687
01:57:55,211 --> 01:58:00,211
I can be,
but I save it all up for a rare 

2688
01:58:00,211 --> 01:58:00,211
occasion.

2689
01:58:00,211 --> 01:58:02,750
That's funny.
You're personable in small doses that,

2690
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:04,300
that's actually,
there's a,

2691
01:58:04,301 --> 01:58:06,220
there's a reality to that,
that you,

2692
01:58:06,221 --> 01:58:08,980
uh,
the overwhelming amounts of people.

2693
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:10,630
If you're around overwhelming amounts of
people,

2694
01:58:10,631 --> 01:58:12,350
you can be like overstimulated,
right?

2695
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:17,351
Some people believe that the result of 
living in cities and living in high 

2696
01:58:17,351 --> 01:58:19,450
population areas is like this,
this same thing that you're experiencing

2697
01:58:19,451 --> 01:58:21,070
when you see people getting into road 
rage,

2698
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:26,090
the same thing that you're experiencing 
when people see people fly off the 

2699
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:27,160
handle at counter help or what have you,
it's just like they're just overwhelmed.

2700
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:31,030
There's just too much stimulation and 
just need to sit by yourself,

2701
01:58:31,031 --> 01:58:32,470
watch a little tv,
read a book,

2702
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:34,690
relax.
You need to be out in nature,

2703
01:58:34,691 --> 01:58:37,160
going for a walk.
We don't feel anything or hear anything.

2704
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:39,460
Just see squirrels and a couple of 
little kids,

2705
01:58:39,461 --> 01:58:40,830
you know,
that's.

2706
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:42,070
We just don't

2707
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:47,070
feel like we need that because we're so 
trapped in this momentum of 

2708
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:47,830
accomplishment is constantly pushing 
forward,

2709
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:51,460
but not realizing that we don't.
We don't stay here forever.

2710
01:58:51,461 --> 01:58:56,461
You only get a certaIn amount of times.
I've quit doing conferences and 

2711
01:58:56,461 --> 01:58:58,330
workshops because afterwards people come
up and they asked me all these questions

2712
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:03,331
that are so deep.
I don't really quite understand the 

2713
01:59:03,331 --> 01:59:03,331
questions.
You know,

2714
01:59:03,331 --> 01:59:04,000
and I'm not.
I'm a carnival barker,

2715
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:09,060
that's my role,
all the actions in the tent and you're 

2716
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:09,760
in the center,
ring yourself in the main tent,

2717
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,670
but I just,
I like to point to a lot of things and I

2718
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:17,671
go broad,
but I don't go very deep and so I can't 

2719
01:59:17,671 --> 01:59:18,460
answer questions and these people want 
me to solve their life problems.

2720
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:20,050
I don't even understand what they're 
asking me,

2721
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:22,260
so I've just quit making appearances.
Well,

2722
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:24,790
there's always gonna be people that want
you to figure it out for them.

2723
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,000
There's always going to be people that 
don't just want to discuss things that 

2724
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:30,000
people have said,
which is absolutely fascinating,

2725
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,501
but they want you to help them.
It's a very selfish point of view and 

2726
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:36,310
it's very common and I'm just not up to 
it.

2727
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:38,860
That's not what I do.
I don't think anybody has quite honestly

2728
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:43,861
and,
and especially if you go up to them and 

2729
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:43,861
ask them for advice,
hey,

2730
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:43,861
I need your advice like,
man,

2731
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:46,990
listen,
would you need to do is you need to look

2732
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:50,650
at your own life and figure out what 
you're doing and why.

2733
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:53,740
If you want to talk about like specific 
things like in order for someone to give

2734
01:59:53,741 --> 01:59:55,330
you advice,
like should I marry this girl?

2735
01:59:55,331 --> 01:59:56,380
Like,
oh my god,

2736
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,300
where do we begin?
You know,

2737
01:59:58,301 --> 02:00:00,910
I'm going to have to like if you wanted 
me to give an honest answer,

2738
02:00:00,911 --> 02:00:05,911
if she should get married to someone,
I would have to see you guys interact 

2739
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:05,911
for like weeks,
right?

2740
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:07,120
Have to like get to know you 
individually.

2741
02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:12,121
I would have to really say that yes,
you should sign a legal contract where 

2742
02:00:12,121 --> 02:00:12,121
you give up 50 percent of all your 
earnings.

2743
02:00:12,121 --> 02:00:13,480
One person just go do it,
do it,

2744
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,460
and then if it doesn't work out,
you're gonna get mad at me.

2745
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:18,200
Like I've people like I'm thinking about
taking extra.

2746
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,840
What do you think?
I don't know.

2747
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:21,040
I don't know.
You man.

2748
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:23,310
Have you started in the library?
That's where you go first.

2749
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:28,710
Go to arrowhead.
The idea that you would be able to tell 

2750
02:00:28,710 --> 02:00:31,381
someone what to do or not to do or what 
did like you're asking too many weird 

2751
02:00:31,381 --> 02:00:35,431
questions which we should.
You should be doing is figuring it out 

2752
02:00:35,431 --> 02:00:38,791
for yourself.
That's a big part of life and then 

2753
02:00:38,791 --> 02:00:38,791
surrounding yourself with people that 
you meet,

2754
02:00:38,791 --> 02:00:40,570
that you become friends with and you can
share.

2755
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,970
I have some history.
Yeah.

2756
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:45,700
You can't just run up to lorenzo and ask
them to solve your problems.

2757
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
You shit in order.
I've got a friend up crew in houston 

2758
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,361
who's a lawyer friend of mine and 
actually we were in the navy together 

2759
02:00:54,361 --> 02:00:54,910
too and he has a big brass plaque on the
front of his desk that says,

2760
02:00:55,150 --> 02:01:00,150
frankly,
I'd rather not get involved so you know 

2761
02:01:00,150 --> 02:01:01,570
you're going to pay top dollar with him.
Well,

2762
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:06,571
there's people that just want to drag 
you into their world and you don't want 

2763
02:01:06,571 --> 02:01:07,240
to be in their world.
And it's like,

2764
02:01:07,241 --> 02:01:09,320
listen,
you heard your own bridge.

2765
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,130
New people helped you like,
are you sure about that?

2766
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Because there's definitely wasn't this.
It wasn't running up to people and 

2767
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:17,730
telling them the fixed my life,
you know,

2768
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:22,210
but there's a lot of that going on out 
there and unfortunately it all goes down

2769
02:01:22,211 --> 02:01:27,211
to the same issue.
People that haven't been explained how 

2770
02:01:27,211 --> 02:01:30,961
to think too,
they haven't been instructed on what's 

2771
02:01:30,961 --> 02:01:31,560
the most productive way to think.
What's the best way to men?

2772
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,020
I don't mean by things like form your 
own opinions or creatively or anything.

2773
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:37,800
I mean manage your consciousness.
What's the debate?

2774
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:40,130
What best way to how you look

2775
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:45,130
at yourself in relation to the people 
around you and if you're being too 

2776
02:01:45,130 --> 02:01:46,350
goddamn needy,
you're ruining it for everybody.

2777
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:47,950
If it's always about you,
you,

2778
02:01:47,951 --> 02:01:48,290
you,
you,

2779
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:48,830
you,
mimi,

2780
02:01:48,831 --> 02:01:49,460
mimi,
mimi,

2781
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:49,970
mimi,
me.

2782
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:55,060
That might be while you're in that 
situation in the first place because 

2783
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,551
nobody wants to fucking help you and no 
one's helped you up to now because 

2784
02:01:57,551 --> 02:01:57,551
you're exhausting

2785
02:01:57,551 --> 02:01:58,950
that you know,
I used to be on the motivational speaker

2786
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:02,190
circuit for awhile and we had all these 
pat things.

2787
02:02:02,191 --> 02:02:07,191
When you're pointing at somebody,
you've got three fingers pointing back 

2788
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:09,800
at yourself.
The other one is you can walk through a 

2789
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:13,071
room full of people laying on the floor 
and give your hand each one and help 

2790
02:02:13,071 --> 02:02:16,611
them to their feet,
but you let one of them climb on your 

2791
02:02:16,611 --> 02:02:16,611
back and you're going to be down on the 
floor with them,

2792
02:02:16,611 --> 02:02:17,370
and so that's.
That's what you're saying.

2793
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:22,371
Don't get involved in helping people.
You just tell them what you can help 

2794
02:02:22,371 --> 02:02:25,731
them with.
Some ideas that they got to work on 

2795
02:02:25,731 --> 02:02:25,731
themselves,
but you can't solve them.

2796
02:02:25,731 --> 02:02:30,080
Yeah.
It's not that I don't get involved with 

2797
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,080
helping people.
It's a.

2798
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,660
People have to realize that taking their
version on,

2799
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:35,670
yeah,
you as an individual have your own 

2800
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:36,490
unique burden.
If you want to learn things,

2801
02:02:36,491 --> 02:02:38,920
if you want to fail,
then you've got to start doing research.

2802
02:02:38,921 --> 02:02:40,710
You got to start reading books.
You've got to start communicating,

2803
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:42,640
but going up to someone like you and 
saying,

2804
02:02:42,641 --> 02:02:44,050
hey,
I need you to fix my life.

2805
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:44,860
You know,
what do I do?

2806
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,520
Like I don't know what the fuck you do,
except I barely know what the fuck I do.

2807
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:50,140
Like,
come on man,

2808
02:02:50,141 --> 02:02:55,141
you gotta find somebody,
and the other problem is that what I've 

2809
02:02:55,141 --> 02:02:56,050
found is that people who are needy,
they never recover.

2810
02:02:56,290 --> 02:02:57,850
If you keep them in your life,
god dammit,

2811
02:02:57,851 --> 02:02:59,020
they're needy.
Ten years later,

2812
02:02:59,470 --> 02:02:59,980
like,
hey man,

2813
02:02:59,981 --> 02:03:02,260
we've gotten 10 years and you're still 
at god damn wreck.

2814
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,850
Like why?
Why,

2815
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:05,890
why?
Why have you not figured this out yet?

2816
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,680
You asked me for advice 10 goddamn years
ago,

2817
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,950
we spent a lot of time talking about 
shit and now 10 years later you're doing

2818
02:03:11,951 --> 02:03:12,700
the same.
Same thing.

2819
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:16,030
You're sucking me into a world of a 
bullshit.

2820
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:18,250
You're just trapping me like a little 
vortex

2821
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:23,830
and being honest,
like that's probably the best thing you 

2822
02:03:23,830 --> 02:03:23,830
can do for now

2823
02:03:23,830 --> 02:03:23,890
than they hate you and talk shit about 
you online under fake names.

2824
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:25,740
That's what they do.
They are,

2825
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,880
they get fake accounts and It just turn 
it off.

2826
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:30,090
Well,
it's just,

2827
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:35,130
you know,
life is beautiful when everybody's 

2828
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:35,160
trying to do their part,
but life becomes a real pain in the ass,

2829
02:03:35,161 --> 02:03:36,920
but no one wants to do the dishes.
You know,

2830
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:42,330
like that.
If you live in a house with a bunch of 

2831
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:42,330
people and no one does the dishes,
it becomes that,

2832
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:42,330
hey,
what the fuck are we doing?

2833
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,170
Everybody get together here.
Let's come on.

2834
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:46,930
I did the dishes last night.
There's 10 of them in here today.

2835
02:03:46,931 --> 02:03:48,280
Well,
it wasn't more food.

2836
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:51,040
I didn't need to.
You get into that kind of nonsense,

2837
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:53,560
but then you get a shitty communication 
system.

2838
02:03:53,561 --> 02:03:55,820
You got a shitty commune,
you got a shitty culture.

2839
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:56,890
Just goes downhill from there.

2840
02:03:57,070 --> 02:04:02,070
I mean that's a real issue is a real 
issue is that there's too many people 

2841
02:04:02,231 --> 02:04:07,231
out there that do that.
Not just want attention but demanded for

2842
02:04:07,301 --> 02:04:08,110
nothing.
Right.

2843
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,390
You know,
it's not that that's who they become.

2844
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,700
People like,
hey man,

2845
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:17,730
I've got to get you to listen to my cd.
Do you know what that would be like if 

2846
02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:17,730
the whole world,
you know,

2847
02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:20,440
had someone,
it was like 5 billion people that wanted

2848
02:04:20,441 --> 02:04:25,441
you to listen to their cd.
Would you ever have time for anything 

2849
02:04:25,441 --> 02:04:25,441
else?
It's like email right now.

2850
02:04:25,441 --> 02:04:26,320
We don't even know each other.
Why am I listening to your cd?

2851
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:27,970
I think it would just.
You think you could help me.

2852
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,250
Do you think it really.
I can help you by listening to your cd.

2853
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:32,890
I'm not a music producer.
Like what the fuck are you doing man,

2854
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:33,840
this,
this.

2855
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:36,820
There's not that much time in the world.
I cAn't help everybody.

2856
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,070
You know,
if you have

2857
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,570
something that's interesting,
send a link.

2858
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:42,750
You know,
if someone wants to help you that it'll,

2859
02:04:42,751 --> 02:04:45,690
it'll spread virally.
Put something online to people,

2860
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:47,580
find it,
they'll send it to four And then it gets

2861
02:04:47,581 --> 02:04:52,581
going from there.
I mean this the only way today and 

2862
02:04:52,581 --> 02:04:55,191
there's ways they can do it.
They've got youtube and places they can 

2863
02:04:55,191 --> 02:04:55,191
put their music.
You know,

2864
02:04:55,191 --> 02:04:59,140
and that's the only issue that I ever 
have in communicating with people is 

2865
02:04:59,140 --> 02:04:59,350
sometimes people get exhausting.
I want you to read this script.

2866
02:04:59,351 --> 02:05:01,500
Do you know how long that takes?
I don't even know you,

2867
02:05:01,501 --> 02:05:03,270
man.
I'm going to read your script.

2868
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:08,271
People want me to read their books all 
the time and I've got books I need to 

2869
02:05:08,271 --> 02:05:08,271
read.
It's flattering,

2870
02:05:08,271 --> 02:05:08,271
right?
It's.

2871
02:05:08,330 --> 02:05:10,320
Yeah,
but I would never do that.

2872
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:12,360
I would never send someone a book and 
say,

2873
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:14,100
I want you to read this and then 
critique it for me.

2874
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:16,020
I'm not that needy.
I think that's a needy thing.

2875
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:19,470
The other reason I don't do it besides 
the time is first of all,

2876
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:20,840
I'm not sure I know what they're talking
about.

2877
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,700
I'm not sure I know the subject,
but then what if I don't like it?

2878
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,830
You know?
I don't want to just say,

2879
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:26,940
hey,
this really sucks.

2880
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Yeah,
I've heard that happen before people 

2881
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,441
have sent me stand up before,
review this and then get back to me 

2882
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:33,441
like,
oh,

2883
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:33,870
christ son,
you know,

2884
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:34,540
I,
I,

2885
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:37,770
I thought during my bachelor stoner days
I want to stand up,

2886
02:05:37,771 --> 02:05:39,780
but the time you're doing news radio 
and,

2887
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,690
and I,
I thought it was really funny.

2888
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:45,190
I worked for weeks and weeks to get like
five minutes.

2889
02:05:45,191 --> 02:05:48,180
So you're in your fifties,
wow.

2890
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:53,200
Days and your fifth.
Couldn't even get my girlfriend to laugh

2891
02:05:53,201 --> 02:05:55,080
at more than one or two of the jokes and
I thought,

2892
02:05:55,081 --> 02:06:00,081
you know,
there's no way I'm going to an open mic 

2893
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:00,081
with this is that I need a new 
girlfriend.

2894
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:00,810
Well,
that happened to it,

2895
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:03,120
but it wasn't her fault.
It wasn't her fault,

2896
02:06:03,121 --> 02:06:06,720
but that's hard work to do that I.
I really admire you guys.

2897
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:11,490
It's hard work when it's not going well.
That's when it's hard work.

2898
02:06:11,491 --> 02:06:14,460
It's hard work when you're trying to 
come up with new material that it's hard

2899
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:16,450
work,
but when it's working it's not hard.

2900
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:16,980
I,
I,

2901
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:22,100
although I love music,
I always think comedy is just a step 

2902
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:24,360
above because laughing actually can heal
you and so I've,

2903
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:29,490
I've learned more comedians through your
show and one time I heard you say 

2904
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:33,531
something like,
you thought joey diaz was the funniest 

2905
02:06:33,531 --> 02:06:36,171
guy alive and so the next morning,
and I usually listen to your podcast at 

2906
02:06:36,171 --> 02:06:36,171
the gym,
you know,

2907
02:06:36,171 --> 02:06:40,590
it makes the gym time goes faster and I 
came home from the gym and I got youtube

2908
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:44,100
and I looked at joy dia's channel and 
6:00

2909
02:06:44,101 --> 02:06:45,300
that night I got stoned right.

2910
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:50,300
Then at 6:00
that night I had seen almost all of 

2911
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:50,880
july.
I haven't seen it all yet,

2912
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,460
but he,
he hits the tone with me.

2913
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:58,200
He and mark marin,
a couple of those guys really are in the

2914
02:06:58,201 --> 02:07:00,030
same group I'm in and so I just,
you know,

2915
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:02,450
I just couldn't get,
get google get lost.

2916
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:06,110
So it is an animal.
He's an and he seems to do,

2917
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:11,200
you know,
adlib roofs a lot in his best stuff is 

2918
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:11,200
ad libbing.
Yeah.

2919
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,380
When he.
The best thing that I ever saw,

2920
02:07:13,381 --> 02:07:16,380
the funniest thing I ever saw was joey 
diaz on the Alex Jones show.

2921
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:21,620
It was me and joey diaz and Alex Jones.
Alex wants to talk conspiracies and joey

2922
02:07:21,931 --> 02:07:25,280
hates that shit.
He doesn't want to talk about ufo was at

2923
02:07:25,281 --> 02:07:30,281
chem trails.
Get the fuck out of here with your 

2924
02:07:30,281 --> 02:07:30,281
bullshit.
So he just hijack the whole show.

2925
02:07:30,281 --> 02:07:31,350
Did you see that?
Or theY stuff on youtube?

2926
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,450
Yes,
I got to see that will pull it up.

2927
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:34,160
Jamie.
Pull it.

2928
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:36,180
Oh,
it's joey on the Alex Jones show

2929
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:41,580
and he went on this rant for like a 
couple minutes towards the end when he 

2930
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:43,540
left the podcast and I could.
I literally couldn't breathe and my face

2931
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:46,360
was beet red.
I've got to see what just killing it.

2932
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:48,700
And Alex Jones tried to jump in and he 
fucking,

2933
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:53,050
he stops him from jumping in,
just gets louder and crazier and hit the

2934
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:54,640
point.
One of the few people that could stop.

2935
02:07:54,641 --> 02:07:55,950
I like and saY,
oh,

2936
02:07:55,990 --> 02:08:00,990
Alex Jones had no idea what they're just
better at covering up with know don't 

2937
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:04,540
know.
He was dancing and singing,

2938
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,640
always oxygen,
no junk,

2939
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:08,510
junk,
junk,

2940
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:09,070
junk.
He,

2941
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:14,120
every day he doesn't wake up singing 
dance and then he has oxygen tanks at 

2942
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:14,320
night.
Something's not right there.

2943
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:19,540
I might taste like you're worth more 
dead than what you are alive.

2944
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:20,350
You understand me?
He ain't.

2945
02:08:20,351 --> 02:08:22,540
And now they got a new record coming out
that no more.

2946
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:27,570
He's Doing a tour next year with the 
people from vegas that jump up and down 

2947
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:28,240
the blue band group.
But the how that is,

2948
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:32,800
I mean he's the more than he's ever been
killed.

2949
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:36,410
Michael jackson.
Knowing what I know.

2950
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:38,230
I smoke another joint.
I'll break it down.

2951
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:42,230
What the music from paul mccartney 
didn't want to get back.

2952
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,740
And all of a sudden they put paul 
mccartney,

2953
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:49,741
the soup bowl.
They tried to build up the beatles to 

2954
02:08:49,741 --> 02:08:51,640
get the thing going and all sudden 
Michael Jackson circling the building.

2955
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:53,590
Right now,
we've gotten confirmation.

2956
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:58,820
The documents right here.
Obama strategy.

2957
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:07,910
Let me show you,
but when alex isn't even talking now,

2958
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,500
but not only 20 percent of my crazy.
Boy,

2959
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:15,220
you know whaT?
I'm [inaudible].

2960
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,060
No,
but I'm shango.

2961
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:17,800
I love you,
but I'm saying you're a character too.

2962
02:09:17,801 --> 02:09:19,570
On top of it.
This is talking about.

2963
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:20,800
He's way more fun.
I know,

2964
02:09:20,801 --> 02:09:21,370
I know.
I know.

2965
02:09:21,371 --> 02:09:23,320
You don't want to talk about yourself.
Okay,

2966
02:09:23,321 --> 02:09:24,990
well,
let's get back to a free country state.

2967
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Let's get all chinese.
We need joey diaz so we can poinT the 

2968
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
finger and say,
there's no bad man.

2969
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,220
What is art?
What is our model to,

2970
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:36,100
you know how we say the n word.
What are the chinese say about us?

2971
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:38,660
You know how they call us?
They call us boolei.

2972
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:40,330
Whatever that word is.
You know what that means?

2973
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:44,260
White ghost.
We are white fucking ghosts.

2974
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:47,260
That's what we are.
We're here to destroy the fucking world.

2975
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:49,500
Trust montonya,
but at the same time were built.

2976
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:51,760
They call us that low.
That's what they call us,

2977
02:09:51,761 --> 02:09:54,100
a white ghost.
They call black people something else,

2978
02:09:54,101 --> 02:09:56,910
but it's also a black ghosts.
I don't know if it's why low it goes and

2979
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:58,540
I say,
but that's the point,

2980
02:09:58,541 --> 02:09:59,010
man.
These.

2981
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:01,450
It's not people like me and you're going
to work this world.

2982
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,610
It's the suits.
It's the fucking bankers.

2983
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:07,180
It's that fucking guy that locked people
up in thousand prisoners all like giving

2984
02:10:07,181 --> 02:10:10,600
money to go to the very end of it when 
he goes crazy.

2985
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:14,390
This is like a real short clip is what I
thought we were gonna apply.

2986
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:16,870
This is actually the whole thing,
isn't it?

2987
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:19,660
This is the whole time.
HE was on a minute.

2988
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:22,200
Yeah,
this is it.

2989
02:10:22,530 --> 02:10:23,780
This is it.
A baggy clothes on.

2990
02:10:23,790 --> 02:10:25,930
They didn't know it was great.
They said,

2991
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:27,250
we're going to put you through the x ray
machine.

2992
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:32,460
I'm standing there sweating bullets with
this baggy under my fucking nuts than 

2993
02:10:33,210 --> 02:10:35,250
the writing because I'm a stuff people 
don't know that.

2994
02:10:35,251 --> 02:10:36,620
I told I had cancer for a couple of 
weeks.

2995
02:10:37,110 --> 02:10:42,110
Know the opposite hand is under his 
balls going to the airport thinking 

2996
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:48,950
they're like rodney dangerfield.
Rodney was sticking up a storm,

2997
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:52,460
not to mention my balls.
I'm sweating now because I'm going to go

2998
02:10:52,461 --> 02:10:53,890
to jail.
Goes,

2999
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:56,580
he's clear and he shook my hand.
I'm like,

3000
02:10:56,770 --> 02:11:01,770
tax payers are hard at work to your 
politician who's talking to you like a 

3001
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:02,660
christian.
He's lying.

3002
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:04,530
So you follow him saying,
no,

3003
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:09,560
no,
we're talking about naked body scanners 

3004
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:09,830
were talking about children being 
molested by tsa.

3005
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:15,070
We're taught.
We will listen to a politician with the 

3006
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:15,950
same story every four years with that.
Sorry ass line of shit,

3007
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:19,580
but these pockets of almost get offended
because I say the word fuck.

3008
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:24,820
That's why the camps and stupid to 
understand what's in front of them.

3009
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:28,760
Forget about the curse words.
At least the kids not fucking lion.

3010
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:32,660
So next time you listen to your bullshit
congressmen or your bullshit governor or

3011
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:35,090
even the bullshit presence,
somebody who's running for president and

3012
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:40,091
he's kicking you with that.
Same for shit that they give you every 

3013
02:11:40,091 --> 02:11:42,551
four fucking years and you still vote 
for the fucking momo and then you get 

3014
02:11:42,551 --> 02:11:43,370
mad.
Think about me saying the word fuck with

3015
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,990
that.
Amadea I got to go smoke a cigar.

3016
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:49,100
Very solid points.
Don't do the I don't know.

3017
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:50,130
I know joey,
you,

3018
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:53,150
you get it.
But then just to let the american public

3019
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:58,151
know that every four years they buy the 
same shit they've been buying it for 

3020
02:11:58,151 --> 02:12:02,230
years at the same people with their 
harvard articulation and the holiday 

3021
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:05,030
don't curse and they're christians and 
they had a family and these are the same

3022
02:12:05,031 --> 02:12:07,160
people that shove it up your fucking ass
every year.

3023
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:08,580
The one thing that you'll get it

3024
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:12,090
video,
there's an end to it where he goes crazy

3025
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:17,091
and says,
check yourself before you wreck 

3026
02:12:17,091 --> 02:12:17,091
yourself.

3027
02:12:17,091 --> 02:12:17,091
Hold on,
hold on one second.

3028
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,130
Here it is.
Take the shuttle.

3029
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:19,920
Joey,
did facebook,

3030
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:25,060
twitter,
check yourself before you wreck 

3031
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:25,060
yourself.
Big dixon gas.

3032
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,700
Get outta here.
You're in Trouble.

3033
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:29,390
You know I love that

3034
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:31,730
guy because he says what I'm thinking,
but he says,

3035
02:12:31,731 --> 02:12:34,340
it's so much better.
We've so crazy.

3036
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:35,810
It's so funny,
so entertaining.

3037
02:12:36,070 --> 02:12:37,730
It's just a maniac.
It's fine.

3038
02:12:37,731 --> 02:12:42,731
Having maniacs for friends just gives 
you a different perspective on things 

3039
02:12:42,731 --> 02:12:42,731
you realize,
oh,

3040
02:12:42,731 --> 02:12:45,280
that's a way to live to know.
Exactly.

3041
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:46,700
No,
there's a lot of us that are different.

3042
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:49,460
Yeah,
he's just a.

3043
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:54,530
He's one of a kind and I hadn't heard of
them until I heard him on your show and 

3044
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:54,680
now I'm a huge fan.
Yeah,

3045
02:12:54,681 --> 02:12:58,580
well the internet has really been very 
kind to joey diaz because people,

3046
02:12:58,610 --> 02:13:03,610
you know,
it was very hard for a guy like that to 

3047
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:03,610
show you what he can do without the 
internet.

3048
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:05,630
Can't do that on a radio show.
We just go off and crazy.

3049
02:13:05,631 --> 02:13:09,200
his comedy,
it's very hard to see on regular tv,

3050
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:11,180
unless It's showtime or hbo.

3051
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:16,360
So he was in a lot of.
It was in a weird category and then the 

3052
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:19,661
internet came along and podcasting came 
along and then people just got to see 

3053
02:13:19,661 --> 02:13:20,870
who this lady's.
He's riding high.

3054
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:21,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3055
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,150
Finally.
It's like he deserved it.

3056
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,600
Yeah.
Oh,

3057
02:13:23,601 --> 02:13:24,650
without a doubt.
It's the,

3058
02:13:24,651 --> 02:13:25,270
the,
you know,

3059
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,370
the internet is just sort of catching up
to the derricks,

3060
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,820
but there's so Many things you get 
exposed because of the internet that,

3061
02:13:30,821 --> 02:13:35,821
I mean,
your podcast would never be on a radio 

3062
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:38,841
show.
How could you ever have that on late 

3063
02:13:38,841 --> 02:13:40,970
night radio?
There's no way they would ever play 

3064
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:40,970
that.
It'd be impossible.

3065
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:40,970
No,
there's no way.

3066
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:42,830
Well,
if you coast to coast or something,

3067
02:13:42,831 --> 02:13:44,430
you know,
terrence is on there a lot,

3068
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:44,940
but you know,
it's,

3069
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:47,280
it's not,
it's still too long,

3070
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:48,540
too late.
Stuff like that.

3071
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:53,660
And yours.
I mean yours is a very specifically pro 

3072
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:53,660
drug to.

3073
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:54,360
Oh yeah,
that would be a real issue for sponsors.

3074
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:58,920
I mean every now and then art bell would
have mckenna on.

3075
02:13:58,921 --> 02:14:03,921
They would discuss the,
been the stoned ape theory and what 

3076
02:14:03,921 --> 02:14:03,921
happened and it would be very 
fascinating,

3077
02:14:03,921 --> 02:14:08,451
but the amount of just raw information 
over and over and over again talking 

3078
02:14:09,601 --> 02:14:13,320
about talking in a positive way about 
psychedelic experiences.

3079
02:14:13,321 --> 02:14:15,480
Like there's never been anything like 
your show.

3080
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:17,140
And if you think about it,
you know,

3081
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:20,370
they,
they don't talk about doing the drugs as

3082
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:22,950
much as about what they think about the 
thoughts that come back.

3083
02:14:22,951 --> 02:14:27,951
You know,
the show really it would be called 

3084
02:14:27,951 --> 02:14:27,951
philosophy,
but you know,

3085
02:14:27,951 --> 02:14:29,340
can you imagine having hundreds of 
thousands of young people listening to a

3086
02:14:29,341 --> 02:14:31,890
philosophy podcast.
But that's the category it's in.

3087
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:33,720
It is.
If you stop and think about it,

3088
02:14:33,721 --> 02:14:38,721
like most philosophical people,
if you call yourself a philosopher 

3089
02:14:38,721 --> 02:14:39,110
there,
there blowhards yeah,

3090
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:44,040
know there are people who pontificate 
and philosophy without the drugs sucks.

3091
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,720
It's very rare that it's right.
It's often overbearing,

3092
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,180
often self centered,
often not self aware,

3093
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:55,530
not objective and introspective.
It's missing an element.

3094
02:14:55,770 --> 02:15:00,770
That's a terrible thing to say,
but I think that without control of the 

3095
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:01,580
ego,
it's very good.

3096
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,380
Difficult to get philosophy,
right?

3097
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:07,690
Right.
It's very difficult to have unique ideas

3098
02:15:07,691 --> 02:15:12,470
that are that express like the the,
the,

3099
02:15:12,820 --> 02:15:17,820
the way that people want.
When someone wants to express a profound

3100
02:15:18,461 --> 02:15:22,570
thought to you.
If someone wants to express some sort of

3101
02:15:22,571 --> 02:15:24,610
a life changing idea that they've come 
upon,

3102
02:15:24,611 --> 02:15:29,611
realize themselves.
It's very difficult to do that 

3103
02:15:29,611 --> 02:15:29,611
sincerely.
Right?

3104
02:15:29,650 --> 02:15:31,990
Without coming off like a blowhard and 
an asshole.

3105
02:15:31,991 --> 02:15:36,991
there's something about expressing 
yourself in ways that it seems like when

3106
02:15:37,361 --> 02:15:39,520
people were trying to make profound 
statements,

3107
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,740
they're not just trying to make profound
statements.

3108
02:15:41,741 --> 02:15:46,741
They're also trying to sound awesome.
They're also trying to impress people 

3109
02:15:46,741 --> 02:15:48,690
with their capturing of the english 
language and their,

3110
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:53,930
their use of prose,
but when someone like says something 

3111
02:15:54,251 --> 02:15:56,860
like mckenna or someone says something 
like,

3112
02:15:56,910 --> 02:16:01,910
um,
I mean there's been a million people 

3113
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:01,910
that have said brilliant things.

3114
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:02,080
Alan watts is another one.
They,

3115
02:16:02,081 --> 02:16:07,081
they,
they've said something that just really 

3116
02:16:07,081 --> 02:16:09,391
rings true in an honest and unique way.
It's a little bit more than psych than,

3117
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:16,650
than just philosophy.
It's a little bit more than just 

3118
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:19,291
psychedelic.
It's like a combination of the two that 

3119
02:16:19,291 --> 02:16:20,710
sparks a conversation,
period.

3120
02:16:20,950 --> 02:16:25,950
It sparks thinking.
It's like it's a seed of an idea that 

3121
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:28,660
gets planted and when you hear it or 
especially when you watch it,

3122
02:16:28,661 --> 02:16:32,140
which is one the beautiful things about 
these user created youtube videos.

3123
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:35,950
They're so visually stunning.
They draw you in in that form as well.

3124
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:39,310
The music they attached to them and then
the actual words themselves.

3125
02:16:39,311 --> 02:16:44,311
It's like the combinAtion of them is so 
entertaining and captivating and 

3126
02:16:44,311 --> 02:16:46,490
inspiring that it becomes something way 
bigger than just philosophy,

3127
02:16:46,491 --> 02:16:48,190
right?
It becomes philosophy.

3128
02:16:48,191 --> 02:16:53,191
That's affective,
becomes philosophy that may actually 

3129
02:16:53,191 --> 02:16:53,191
change the way you think.

3130
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:58,500
It's very difficult to go to a 
philosophy class and then change your 

3131
02:16:58,500 --> 02:16:58,500
way of life.
Yeah.

3132
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,720
sometimes it's boring and dull,
but sometimes they just talk too much 

3133
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,690
and they don't see anything interesting.
Like that's a big part of what people 

3134
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:10,720
like when they like podcasts,
like a guy like joey diaz per se,

3135
02:17:10,721 --> 02:17:14,380
or a guy like duncan trussell.
They're entertained people.

3136
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:17,230
It's not just that they're saying cool 
shit.

3137
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:22,410
They're entertaining people and when 
you're not entertaining and you're just 

3138
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:22,900
saying shit,
you're doing it wrong,

3139
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:26,680
you're missing a big percentage of what 
makes people listen to you.

3140
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:29,170
right.
and retain it and retain it.

3141
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:34,620
Yeah,
I mean that is the medium of the 

3142
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:35,950
fireside chat.
You know that that's where it came from.

3143
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:40,360
One person would know or several people 
would share stories,

3144
02:17:40,361 --> 02:17:42,490
but when you learned how to do it 
correctly,

3145
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:47,240
it became exciting for the people that 
do are engaged in it and it became a,

3146
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:52,270
you know,
an educational experience as well as an 

3147
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:52,270
entertaining experience.

3148
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:56,210
Well,
that's the way we started doing mtma in 

3149
02:17:56,210 --> 02:17:58,911
dallas back in the eighties is is either
a couple or maybe three couples at most 

3150
02:17:58,911 --> 02:18:01,770
and we'd all take it.
We'd get together with our spouse or our

3151
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:06,890
significant other for awhile and then 
we'd get together in the last several 

3152
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:07,590
hours.
We'd just be talking and it would be,

3153
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:12,640
you know,
philosophical life changing and I 

3154
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,290
noticed you're doing this,
see it lowers your bear.

3155
02:18:13,291 --> 02:18:18,291
It's like like lowering your fear 
barrier where you can say something to 

3156
02:18:18,291 --> 02:18:19,500
somebody and know you're not going to 
hurt their feelings and so you,

3157
02:18:19,770 --> 02:18:24,770
the truth serum comes out and you can 
talk to your friends and your spouse or 

3158
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:25,170
whatever and say,
you know,

3159
02:18:25,171 --> 02:18:26,640
this has been bothering me lately.
Well,

3160
02:18:26,641 --> 02:18:27,990
you know,
I thought maybe you know,

3161
02:18:27,991 --> 02:18:32,220
it's really a healing proposition that 
you do for yourselves and each other.

3162
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:32,880
Yeah.

3163
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:37,010
I had a conversation with a friend when 
I did ecstasy with him where he's asking

3164
02:18:37,011 --> 02:18:39,290
me why wouldn't lend them money to start
his business?

3165
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:45,410
It was like,
ordinarily I would have avoided that 

3166
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:45,410
conversation like the plague because I 
want to stay.

3167
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:47,580
Your friend can't,
he can't do that difference.

3168
02:18:47,581 --> 02:18:48,900
It never works.
I'm not a bank.

3169
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:54,360
Banks.
Banks are there for a reason and nobody 

3170
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:54,360
ever pays a friend's back.
No,

3171
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:54,360
they just.
I mean,

3172
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:55,230
I don't,
I shouldn't say nobody maybe.

3173
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:57,870
But when somebody borrows 25 grand from 
you,

3174
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,130
most likely that shit's gone.

3175
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:01,360
You know,
when I started my computer company,

3176
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:04,400
the guy who was my mentor,
he loaned me a loan.

3177
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:09,200
Did he loaned me some money.
I need to get home and have it took.

3178
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:10,960
Uh,
he,

3179
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:15,961
uh,
he loaned me some money to start the 

3180
02:19:15,961 --> 02:19:17,611
business and then years later before I 
paid him back about half of it and then 

3181
02:19:17,611 --> 02:19:21,121
we went upside down and I was really 
upset about it and it wasn't a lot of 

3182
02:19:21,121 --> 02:19:22,870
money on them.
About $7,000

3183
02:19:22,871 --> 02:19:23,920
I guess.
It was a lot to me.

3184
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:26,230
And I was lamenting the fact that,
you know,

3185
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,340
I couldn't pay him,
I would eventually he says no.

3186
02:19:28,341 --> 02:19:29,730
He says,
and he,

3187
02:19:29,731 --> 02:19:31,700
he had a big tugboat business now.
he said,

3188
02:19:31,701 --> 02:19:34,250
when I started this business 25 years 
ago,

3189
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:38,530
my wife's father in law or father loaned
me the money and uh,

3190
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:41,150
that business went broke in.
Two others went broke in.

3191
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,760
He died before I could pay them back.
So that's his money.

3192
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:46,340
You've got to find somebody to pay that 
to you in the future.

3193
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:47,210
But now,
well,

3194
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:49,220
that's a very cool guy.
He was,

3195
02:19:49,221 --> 02:19:49,910
he was amazing guy.

3196
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:54,940
That's a very cool guy and it's very 
cool that you wanted to pay him back 

3197
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:54,940
early.
You making attempts to pay them back.

3198
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:55,910
It's,
it's brutal though.

3199
02:19:56,090 --> 02:20:01,090
I've had several friends that have lost 
friendships because they somebody money 

3200
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:05,720
and this one friend boy it,
it drove him crazy.

3201
02:20:05,721 --> 02:20:10,721
Like he would talk about it,
like this guy would come over his house 

3202
02:20:10,721 --> 02:20:14,381
and this guy would hang out with them 
and think I would never bring up the 

3203
02:20:14,381 --> 02:20:14,381
fact that he owed them all this money 
and you know,

3204
02:20:14,381 --> 02:20:16,460
and it would drive them crazy and they 
was like,

3205
02:20:16,461 --> 02:20:18,090
look man,
I'm going to pay you when I can pay it.

3206
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:21,550
But he would find out the guy just 
bought a new this or that.

3207
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,900
It'd be like,
what's this?

3208
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:26,300
And so it became like a big part of his 
life.

3209
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:31,630
It became like this thing is this guy 
who was a friend and he didn't want to 

3210
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:32,810
lose his friendship,
but he realized that the friendship was.

3211
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:37,810
Now all of a sudden there's like really 
negative thing where it was constantly 

3212
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:37,810
thinking,
hey,

3213
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:39,440
I fucking pulled out money out of my 
account.

3214
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:41,860
I lent it to you.
You have no intentions of puking,

3215
02:20:41,861 --> 02:20:45,410
pain me back because I don't do anything
because I don't threaten you.

3216
02:20:45,411 --> 02:20:47,990
I can't repossess your car.
I can't do anything that a bank can do.

3217
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,010
It's a fascinating thing when you see 
people that just.

3218
02:20:52,430 --> 02:20:57,430
They don't go all the way with stuff 
like they promise things they don't 

3219
02:20:57,430 --> 02:21:02,171
follow through.
They get an idea in their head and then 

3220
02:21:02,171 --> 02:21:02,171
they just fucking shut down and never 
finish it.

3221
02:21:02,171 --> 02:21:02,660
You know,
well,

3222
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:04,340
I'm going to start this business and 
within,

3223
02:21:04,341 --> 02:21:09,341
let me tell you something.
Within six months I'm going to pay you 

3224
02:21:09,341 --> 02:21:09,830
back with 25 percent interest.
It's impossible to lose.

3225
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,630
and then six months later what happened,
man,

3226
02:21:11,631 --> 02:21:12,610
you're not going to believe this.

3227
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,810
He got fucked bar manufacturer,
this and that.

3228
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:16,520
So I'm out of business.
I don't know what you want to do.

3229
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:18,800
What do I want to do?
You owe me a lot of money,

3230
02:21:18,801 --> 02:21:19,760
man.
Hey look,

3231
02:21:19,761 --> 02:21:21,130
you knew going in here.
This would be.

3232
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:23,030
I took,
I took a loss like,

3233
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:26,110
oh jesus christ.
And now you go right.

3234
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:27,200
We can't pay you back.
I mean,

3235
02:21:27,201 --> 02:21:30,320
it happens over and over and over again.
There's a lot of people out there.

3236
02:21:30,321 --> 02:21:33,260
Just like when you were talking about 
people that need people to help them,

3237
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,970
you know,
like people coming up to you,

3238
02:21:34,971 --> 02:21:35,690
hey man,
help me.

3239
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:37,070
This is,
hey man,

3240
02:21:37,071 --> 02:21:40,220
you just gotta let me some money.
Like there's other ways you know there's

3241
02:21:40,221 --> 02:21:45,221
other ways a guarantee you the best way 
is not borrowing money from your 

3242
02:21:45,221 --> 02:21:49,301
friends.
there's got to be a better way than 

3243
02:21:49,301 --> 02:21:51,011
that.
You need to figure out how to get some 

3244
02:21:51,011 --> 02:21:52,871
of that fucking money on your own.
It's not like we're in a totally closed 

3245
02:21:52,871 --> 02:21:53,780
system or it's impossible to get a job.
It may bE difficult,

3246
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:56,560
I understand,
but other people have figured it out.

3247
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:58,670
It might be possible for you to figure 
it out.

3248
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:01,310
This is not like something like holding 
your breath under water for an hour.

3249
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:03,510
It seems like it can be done.
It's like,

3250
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:04,100
you know,

3251
02:22:04,190 --> 02:22:05,690
do you ever have people come up to you 
and say,

3252
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,810
hey,
make me laugh and tell really,

3253
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,320
because what I was thinking of your job,
are you.

3254
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:12,210
Are your kids old enough for nimo yet?
Yes.

3255
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:15,500
So the little clown fish,
clown fish make me laugh.

3256
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:16,770
Make me laugh.
Yeah.

3257
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,280
no,
no.

3258
02:22:18,330 --> 02:22:23,330
I mean people have said like it's worth.
The worst thing is when you're doing an 

3259
02:22:23,330 --> 02:22:24,380
interview and like I feel like do a 
radio or something like that.

3260
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:26,130
Radio and they

3261
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,230
go give us an example of your material 
and like,

3262
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:30,870
oh,
christ yet 15 minutes.

3263
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:32,730
She will know.
It's like you can't.

3264
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:34,000
Yeah,
you can't just do the cold.

3265
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,570
it's stupid.
It's gross.

3266
02:22:36,571 --> 02:22:39,390
It's like just inept,
inept interviewing.

3267
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:44,470
I had a friend that was a drummer and we
are in an after hours club down and 

3268
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:48,321
kima,
Texas and my mentor actually got him a 

3269
02:22:48,321 --> 02:22:50,150
wanting to play the drums in this band 
and he didn't want to,

3270
02:22:50,151 --> 02:22:51,790
he didn't want to and he's in,
oh,

3271
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:53,600
I'm here to party.
And finally my,

3272
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:58,720
my friend bribes the band,
gives them some money and tim gets on 

3273
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:02,621
the drums and,
and he's just kind of playing a little 

3274
02:23:02,621 --> 02:23:02,621
bit and all of a sudden the guitarist 
says,

3275
02:23:02,621 --> 02:23:02,621
okay,
take it.

3276
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:04,640
And he hits the drum one time.
Bang.

3277
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,410
He gets up and he says,
you'd take it back now.

3278
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:10,220
That was funny.
Yeah.

3279
02:23:11,930 --> 02:23:13,280
it's uh,
I think,

3280
02:23:13,281 --> 02:23:18,281
uh,
one of the things about psychedelics 

3281
02:23:18,281 --> 02:23:18,740
that really aids people is they get a 
chance to see how annoying they can be.

3282
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:19,950
You know?
Um,

3283
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I've,
I've met people that have changed a lot 

3284
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,690
of their behavior and have apologized to
friends and stuff or being an asshole or

3285
02:23:26,691 --> 02:23:29,150
doing whatever just because of 
psychedelic trips.

3286
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,310
I,
I won't trip with anybody anymore.

3287
02:23:31,740 --> 02:23:32,480
You do it by yourself.

3288
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:37,900
I've,
I've had so many and I don't do hardly 

3289
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:40,041
any psychedelics anymore.
You start worrying about my heart now 

3290
02:23:40,041 --> 02:23:40,041
and all that,
but you know,

3291
02:23:40,041 --> 02:23:41,790
uh,
I eyewash goes different,

3292
02:23:41,791 --> 02:23:42,390
you know,
if I was,

3293
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:42,990
if I had,
you know,

3294
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I had cancer years ago,
if I had a recurrence,

3295
02:23:45,001 --> 02:23:50,001
I,
I'd go down to the jungle and spend a 

3296
02:23:50,001 --> 02:23:50,001
couple of weeks,
but I think that can fix you when you do

3297
02:23:50,001 --> 02:23:50,001
that.
I think I lost,

3298
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:51,740
can fix anything,
you know,

3299
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:53,410
I'm,
I'm a huge wire and it's,

3300
02:23:53,411 --> 02:23:54,900
it's,
it's a miracle,

3301
02:23:55,060 --> 02:24:00,060
you know,
it has changed my life more than 

3302
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:00,060
anything else I've ever done.

3303
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:00,670
Wow.
That's pretty awesome.

3304
02:24:00,671 --> 02:24:01,870
Yeah,
it is pretty awesome,

3305
02:24:01,871 --> 02:24:06,871
isn't it?
It's another thing that we've pretty 

3306
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:06,871
sweet.
If it was here,

3307
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:06,871
it was legal.
We had iowasca centers,

3308
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:06,871
right?

3309
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:07,830
Yeah.
You know,

3310
02:24:07,831 --> 02:24:08,440
iT's,
it's,

3311
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:13,460
it's,
it's such a weird state because it is 

3312
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:13,460
legal with some of the churches now.
But,

3313
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:13,750
uh,
the,

3314
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:14,530
you know,
it took me,

3315
02:24:14,531 --> 02:24:19,531
I was actively searching for it for 
about 10 years until all of a sudden I 

3316
02:24:19,531 --> 02:24:19,720
found it and,
and uh,

3317
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:23,920
that's happened to so many people when 
you don't find it until you're ready for

3318
02:24:23,921 --> 02:24:25,910
it and then it finds you.
And uh,

3319
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:26,980
you know,
I've had,

3320
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:27,820
had,
you know,

3321
02:24:27,821 --> 02:24:30,820
a lot of amazing experiences on some 
difficult ones,

3322
02:24:30,821 --> 02:24:33,810
but that all,
all in all there,

3323
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:38,850
it gives me more positive feeling about 
this life and any other potential life 

3324
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:40,390
than I've ever had.
It's a,

3325
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:42,280
but it's very earth centered.
You know,

3326
02:24:42,281 --> 02:24:47,281
I heard you talking to graham hancock 
about how everybody gets ecological on 

3327
02:24:47,281 --> 02:24:48,610
it and you know,
whereas acid is more mechanical,

3328
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:53,650
you know,
you can do all kinds of problems and 

3329
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:53,650
code and stuff like that.

3330
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:56,380
And mushrooms are pretty mystical.
But I will ask us earth centered,

3331
02:24:56,381 --> 02:24:56,730
you know,
it's,

3332
02:24:56,780 --> 02:25:00,970
it's an earth spirit that you're a 
playing were engaged with and uh,

3333
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:04,000
and it,
it can be a frightening and scary,

3334
02:25:04,001 --> 02:25:06,400
but you know,
amazing things that happened to me.

3335
02:25:06,401 --> 02:25:09,070
I,
I tried not to think too much about what

3336
02:25:09,071 --> 02:25:14,071
happens after death because I'm close 
enough to find out sooner than I want 

3337
02:25:14,071 --> 02:25:14,080
to,
but uh,

3338
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:15,430
and,
and at times I,

3339
02:25:15,431 --> 02:25:16,660
I say,
well,

3340
02:25:16,661 --> 02:25:21,661
there's nothing there.
And other times I say there's something 

3341
02:25:21,661 --> 02:25:21,661
there.
But uh,

3342
02:25:21,661 --> 02:25:22,630
as it happened four days after my mother
died,

3343
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:27,990
I had an iowasca experience with the 
circle that I've been with for quite 

3344
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:31,780
awhile and I didn't tell anybody that I,
that my mother had just died before the 

3345
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:37,080
ceremony.
I didn't tell I didn't want bum people 

3346
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:37,180
out or anything.
And occasionally the ios carol will call

3347
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,760
individual people up to the front for a 
healing or something.

3348
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,760
And this night he happened to call me 
and I go up to the front and it was 

3349
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:44,760
amazing.
You know,

3350
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:47,070
my mother,
I actually saw the,

3351
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:52,370
an image,
a huge image of my mother floating over 

3352
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:52,370
us that then,
well,

3353
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:52,450
the next morning,
you know,

3354
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:57,500
we all stay in the same room and sleep 
on the floor at night and the next 

3355
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:00,031
morning we have breakfast together.
And then we go around the circle and 

3356
02:26:00,031 --> 02:26:00,031
talk.
It's three different people said,

3357
02:26:00,031 --> 02:26:03,100
who was that spirit that appeared over 
your head when you're up there?

3358
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:05,710
And that just really freaked me out 
because I thought,

3359
02:26:05,711 --> 02:26:10,711
well,
I'm imagining it and I'm making up my 

3360
02:26:10,711 --> 02:26:12,220
head or whatever.
Three other people synced in some regArd

3361
02:26:12,221 --> 02:26:14,200
that there was a spirit there.
And I said,

3362
02:26:14,201 --> 02:26:15,280
well,
I think it was my mother.

3363
02:26:15,281 --> 02:26:15,970
She just died.

3364
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:19,030
Is that possible that it's also both?

3365
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:20,390
Oh,
it could be,

3366
02:26:20,391 --> 02:26:20,740
you know,
I,

3367
02:26:20,770 --> 02:26:23,420
I was thinking about it.
I could have projected it into the,

3368
02:26:23,421 --> 02:26:23,860
uh,
you know,

3369
02:26:23,870 --> 02:26:25,220
there's no question about,
you know,

3370
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:28,430
I don't buy one way or the other.
I'm open ended on it.

3371
02:26:28,431 --> 02:26:32,210
So all I know is that was a very moving 
experience for me.

3372
02:26:32,390 --> 02:26:34,730
And then other people saw something 
happen.

3373
02:26:34,731 --> 02:26:38,300
Now maybe they were just feeling the 
vibration of what I was going through

3374
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:39,640
for wonder.
Um,

3375
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:41,940
I wonder if you could.
I mean,

3376
02:26:41,941 --> 02:26:46,941
I don't understand exactly what's going 
on when you're having any sort of a 

3377
02:26:46,941 --> 02:26:50,280
psychedelic experience,
but I would imagine that if you are both

3378
02:26:50,281 --> 02:26:55,281
in the same mindset,
like if you and the person who was also 

3379
02:26:55,281 --> 02:26:58,911
on [inaudible] in the room and you're 
all in the same sort of psychedelic 

3380
02:26:58,911 --> 02:27:03,051
mindset,
there's gotta be some sort of an 

3381
02:27:03,051 --> 02:27:05,061
exchange of,
of information that's coming from your 

3382
02:27:05,061 --> 02:27:05,130
head to their heads.
I mean,

3383
02:27:05,131 --> 02:27:07,640
that's why they wanted to call it 
telepathy to let the thing.

3384
02:27:07,641 --> 02:27:08,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

3385
02:27:08,131 --> 02:27:11,250
Before they discovered that it was 
already named and was called harming.

3386
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:16,270
I have a friend that had some really,
really demonstrable,

3387
02:27:16,271 --> 02:27:18,370
a experiment like that that happened to 
him.

3388
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:23,371
And so he and another person who were 
thinking the same thing at the same 

3389
02:27:23,371 --> 02:27:23,640
time,
having the same vision,

3390
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:24,670
what they did.
Well it wasn't,

3391
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:26,340
uh,
they had uh,

3392
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:31,400
uh,
this one guy is on one corner of the 

3393
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:33,511
room and he's thinking he was having 
some ufo experience where there was a 

3394
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:34,190
spaceship.
And,

3395
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:35,190
and,
uh,

3396
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:40,260
he was thinking about getting on this 
spaceship and just as he's thinking at 

3397
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:40,260
the guy on the other side of the room 
and says,

3398
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:45,120
hey,
don't forget there's only room for 10 

3399
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:45,700
people.
They're opposite sides of the room,

3400
02:27:45,701 --> 02:27:46,150
quiet

3401
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:51,150
and stuff like that.
I've heard people have really like a 

3402
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:53,140
unique visuals that everyone in the room
had.

3403
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:58,380
And I alWays wonder if maybe you can 
conjure up something with your 

3404
02:27:58,380 --> 02:27:59,230
imagination or with your focus,
your ideas.

3405
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:01,990
You can conjure up sort of a psychic 
image in your mind.

3406
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,600
And because everyone's tuned into this 
thing,

3407
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:07,820
they see it in their hallucinogenic 
imagination as well.

3408
02:28:07,821 --> 02:28:09,310
It's definitely possible.
It's possible.

3409
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:09,790
right?
I know.

3410
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,910
And yet on the most intense experience 
I've ever had,

3411
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:18,660
I was really,
I'd never had an experience is 

3412
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:18,660
transformative.
This is this An osca.

3413
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,770
And,
and I can't even quite describe it,

3414
02:28:20,771 --> 02:28:25,771
but I was shocked the next morning that 
the world had ended and everybody 

3415
02:28:25,771 --> 02:28:30,430
experienced this.
Nobody in the room was even close to 

3416
02:28:30,430 --> 02:28:31,820
this and I'd had the most transformative
experience of my life.

3417
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:34,360
And to them it was just another night,
you know,

3418
02:28:34,361 --> 02:28:35,150
the,
yeah,

3419
02:28:35,151 --> 02:28:37,040
that's the weirdest thing about doing 
dmt,

3420
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:39,860
that you're sitting on a couch and 
outside your house,

3421
02:28:39,861 --> 02:28:42,050
nothing's changed,
but inside your head,

3422
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:47,120
a whirlwind of possibilities have opened
and you've all of a sudden seeing a 

3423
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:48,920
world that couldn't possibly have ever 
existed,

3424
02:28:48,921 --> 02:28:51,170
even in your imagination just a few 
minutes before,

3425
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:54,050
even in your imagination as a strong 
statement.

3426
02:28:54,051 --> 02:28:57,260
But it's absolutely true.
Once you do dmt,

3427
02:28:57,261 --> 02:28:59,810
if you've never done it and you have a 
breakthrough experience,

3428
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:02,930
the one thing that everybody always says
is,

3429
02:29:02,931 --> 02:29:04,310
I never saw that coming.

3430
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:09,640
Right?
Never would have imagined that that was 

3431
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:09,640
possible.
Yeah.

3432
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:09,640
It's,
it's,

3433
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:09,980
it's pretty awesome.
Some of the things that do happen,

3434
02:29:09,981 --> 02:29:13,370
but whether they're happening in your 
head or somewhere else,

3435
02:29:13,371 --> 02:29:16,900
it's just hard to say.
But they're both are both iowasca,

3436
02:29:16,901 --> 02:29:17,350
you know,
there's,

3437
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:20,990
I think a lot of what happens is what 
your intention is going in.

3438
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:22,210
Yeah.
And uh,

3439
02:29:22,370 --> 02:29:27,370
you know,
I had had one x one experience where I 

3440
02:29:27,370 --> 02:29:27,370
want to get rid of my fear.
that was really,

3441
02:29:27,370 --> 02:29:29,660
you know,
I couldn't watch the fear factor because

3442
02:29:29,661 --> 02:29:34,190
it was just so made me fearful a,
I'm a wimp,

3443
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:36,940
ya know what I'm saying?
I'm making the wine.

3444
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:43,060
But uh,
so I deCided that that was the night I 

3445
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:43,060
want to get rid of fear.
And you know,

3446
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:45,810
you fast watching fear factor,
you decided you want to deny Alaska.

3447
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:46,970
It was my intention that night.

3448
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:48,420
No,
it wasn't fear factor.

3449
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:51,150
I'd never go on it.
But uh,

3450
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:52,800
the.
So you,

3451
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:53,450
you,
you,

3452
02:29:53,540 --> 02:29:58,540
you fast the day before.
And I'd been fasting since around eight 

3453
02:29:58,540 --> 02:29:59,090
in the morning.
Only had a few sips of water.

3454
02:29:59,091 --> 02:30:02,570
So there's nothing in my stomach.
Sometimes you purge,

3455
02:30:02,571 --> 02:30:03,890
you vomit,
and sometimes you don't.

3456
02:30:03,891 --> 02:30:06,230
The first half dozen times I did it,
I did not vomit.

3457
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:08,320
And,
and you get disappointed too.

3458
02:30:08,321 --> 02:30:09,980
Once you,
once you get into the purging,

3459
02:30:09,981 --> 02:30:13,340
then you realize it's like being inside 
a fireworks display.

3460
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:15,200
It's really spectacular.
sounds gross.

3461
02:30:15,201 --> 02:30:16,910
But really,
so as you throwing up,

3462
02:30:16,911 --> 02:30:17,780
it's amazing.
Oh,

3463
02:30:17,790 --> 02:30:18,670
it's amazing.
It's,

3464
02:30:18,671 --> 02:30:21,710
it just amps the whole experience up.
It's close to an orgasm.

3465
02:30:23,510 --> 02:30:26,150
Not real close,
but it's that that's what it'll bring to

3466
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:28,290
mind.
So anyhow,

3467
02:30:28,291 --> 02:30:29,690
uh,
you sit there and,

3468
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:32,120
and all of a sudden a little voice will 
come into your head and said,

3469
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:36,230
grab your bucket because you sit with an
empty bucket and I can grab your bucket.

3470
02:30:36,410 --> 02:30:41,410
And whenever I hear that little voice,
I grabbed my bucket because I know I'm 

3471
02:30:41,410 --> 02:30:44,460
excited to throw up the first few times,
but after awhile I got into it and it 

3472
02:30:47,031 --> 02:30:49,400
said,
grab your bucket and said,

3473
02:30:49,401 --> 02:30:54,401
we're getting rid of your fear tonight.
And so I've started purging and purging 

3474
02:30:54,401 --> 02:30:56,390
and purging and I said,
oh wow.

3475
02:30:56,391 --> 02:30:58,130
I finally goT rid of,
oh no,

3476
02:30:58,131 --> 02:31:03,110
you got more to go.
And I purged for 45 minutes and the next

3477
02:31:03,111 --> 02:31:07,190
morning I go to empty the bucket.
There's a couple inches of black crap in

3478
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:08,180
this bucket,
you know?

3479
02:31:08,181 --> 02:31:10,400
And I didn't have hardly anything in my 
stomach.

3480
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:15,680
And,
and according to the way the shamans 

3481
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:15,680
speak is your psychic energy,
you're purging.

3482
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,160
And so I really had a visual pouring my 
fear down the toilet in the morning.

3483
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:25,310
Damn,
I would've saved that shit and sanitary 

3484
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:27,030
lab.
Do you imagine the isolated a new 

3485
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:27,030
compounds?
I never thought of that.

3486
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:33,380
That fear is actually.
Something exists in your body can be 

3487
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:33,380
removed.
She's.

3488
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:34,220
I wish I'd thought of that.
I don't know what lab,

3489
02:31:34,221 --> 02:31:35,380
but send it to.
What was it?

3490
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:36,900
Maybe we'll find out.
I was just like spaghetti.

3491
02:31:37,450 --> 02:31:40,790
You have some old spaghetti ingestion is
not fear.

3492
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:43,150
During the years when you were smoking 
cigarettes.

3493
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:47,310
Left some stuff on the walls of some,
some cigarette graffiti.

3494
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:52,850
That's fascinating.
You should have taken pictures of it or 

3495
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:52,850
something.
Well,

3496
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:52,850
you know at the time you don't really 
think of those things.

3497
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:54,980
Could.
Is it possible that it was just all like

3498
02:31:55,030 --> 02:31:55,920
[inaudible]?
He drank.

3499
02:31:55,921 --> 02:31:59,490
He drank too much.
He only drink a little shot.

3500
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:00,960
A little shot glass.
Yeah.

3501
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:04,310
So how was it two inches of liquid?
What was in it was just.

3502
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:05,350
It was,

3503
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:10,520
it was.
It was not real thick and it was just 

3504
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:10,520
bile.
I guess it looked black.

3505
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:12,370
What it smelled like.
Puke.

3506
02:32:12,550 --> 02:32:13,200
Puke.
Hmm.

3507
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:13,960
Interesting.

3508
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:18,050
Wow.
You should've taken a picture of that.

3509
02:32:18,051 --> 02:32:21,140
That sounds like pretty intense stuff 
and then once it was,

3510
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:24,130
is it possible you were still high when 
you saw two inches of a.

3511
02:32:24,230 --> 02:32:29,230
Yes,
I mean that was awesome.

3512
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:33,810
Yeah.
So you,

3513
02:32:33,811 --> 02:32:34,710
you,
you take,

3514
02:32:34,750 --> 02:32:36,340
you drink it about eight,
8:00

3515
02:32:36,341 --> 02:32:37,660
at night or so.
Right.

3516
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:40,420
And then by two in the morning,
three in the morning,

3517
02:32:40,421 --> 02:32:43,240
you're your most of the people that are 
down to base,

3518
02:32:43,241 --> 02:32:45,040
back to baseline and sometimes say,
oh yeah,

3519
02:32:45,041 --> 02:32:46,900
I'm back to baseline and you find you 
can't stand up,

3520
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:49,960
but then you sleep on the floor there 
and get up in the morning.

3521
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:55,320
By the next morning you're,
you're pretty much back to baseline as 

3522
02:32:55,320 --> 02:32:58,411
far as the chemical,
but you're still in the thrall of the 

3523
02:32:58,411 --> 02:32:58,411
thing and,
and uh,

3524
02:32:58,411 --> 02:32:58,411
you know,
you're,

3525
02:32:58,411 --> 02:33:00,330
you're somewhere else.
So yeah,

3526
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:02,040
it might've been two millimeters,

3527
02:33:04,130 --> 02:33:05,490
but either way there was something in 
there.

3528
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,320
I'm not going to change my memory of it 
though.

3529
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:09,540
That's a good idea.
Just hang onto it.

3530
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:14,460
That's how jesus got started.
Write it down in about a year.

3531
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:16,620
he lasted for awhile.
Tell it to a bunch of people.

3532
02:33:16,621 --> 02:33:19,470
Let it get crazier and crazier every 
time you tell it that a few years later,

3533
02:33:19,471 --> 02:33:21,870
write it down,
but write it down in like metaphors,

3534
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:22,560
right?
Right.

3535
02:33:22,610 --> 02:33:24,870
Damn,
latin and parables and you know,

3536
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:29,520
because I speak very well,
there's a guy in a,

3537
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:33,320
there's a scholar in jerusalem that,
uh,

3538
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:36,270
in a,
in Israel who wants to,

3539
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:37,620
um,
he,

3540
02:33:37,621 --> 02:33:42,621
he's trying to push the idea that moses 
was on psychedelics when he found the 

3541
02:33:42,621 --> 02:33:45,840
tablets and that the burning bush was 
actually the acacia bush,

3542
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:48,510
which is rich and dmt.
And that's why it's burning.

3543
02:33:48,511 --> 02:33:50,280
Like in burning the bush,
he saw god.

3544
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:55,460
He's trying to say that this.
What this meant was they burned the 

3545
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:55,680
contents of this plant.
You're just getting many,

3546
02:33:55,681 --> 02:33:56,190
many,
many,

3547
02:33:56,191 --> 02:34:00,120
many translations from ancient hebrew to
latin to greek.

3548
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:02,190
The fact that to this day in ancient 
hebrew,

3549
02:34:02,191 --> 02:34:05,260
there's a lot of dispute about what 
things mean in the first place.

3550
02:34:05,261 --> 02:34:08,640
Like for folks who don't know,
ancient hebrew didn't have,

3551
02:34:08,641 --> 02:34:11,400
they didn't have numbers,
so letters doubled his numbers.

3552
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:14,190
So the letter a was also the number one,
right?

3553
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:19,310
So words had numerical value,
like the word and the word god have the 

3554
02:34:19,310 --> 02:34:19,870
same numerical value.

3555
02:34:19,870 --> 02:34:24,870
It's a really strange system that we 
lost the context of all these magical 

3556
02:34:25,301 --> 02:34:28,930
sort of definitions of things and 
descriptions of things because there was

3557
02:34:28,931 --> 02:34:33,640
a mathematical qualities to these words 
that we went to this to this day we.

3558
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:38,680
It's,
it's such a unique way of looking at 

3559
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:38,680
things in comparison to how we look at 
things today.

3560
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:42,751
We look at words and then we look at 
mathematics is being completely 

3561
02:34:42,751 --> 02:34:45,511
separate.
They had it all kind of combined 

3562
02:34:45,511 --> 02:34:46,870
together in some sort of a weird ancient
language that doesn't exist anymore.

3563
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:51,990
So when people try to translate it and 
then you go from that to latin and greek

3564
02:34:52,901 --> 02:34:55,860
and it's gone.
It's all weird now.

3565
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:58,990
Right?
So when these guys are trying to go back

3566
02:34:58,991 --> 02:35:00,670
and look at these original descriptions,
they said,

3567
02:35:00,671 --> 02:35:05,671
well,
one burning bush might very well be the 

3568
02:35:05,671 --> 02:35:05,671
acacia bushes.
It makes sense.

3569
02:35:05,671 --> 02:35:07,930
It's prominent in the area.
And if they had figured out a way to get

3570
02:35:07,990 --> 02:35:12,990
dmt from this bush,
they had figured out a way to do some 

3571
02:35:12,990 --> 02:35:12,990
kind of a process.
And extracted,

3572
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:18,060
that could be how they described it and 
that was one of the things that mark 

3573
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:18,060
john,
margo allegro,

3574
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:22,801
it said about the bible when they had 
studied the dead sea scrolls and he 

3575
02:35:22,801 --> 02:35:24,130
wrote that book,
the sacred mushroom in the cross.

3576
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:29,430
He was saying that they were trying to 
hide these things from the romans when 

3577
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:33,571
they were capturing.
People were originally writing these 

3578
02:35:33,571 --> 02:35:35,551
things down and what they really were 
were descriptions of psychedelic 

3579
02:35:35,551 --> 02:35:39,751
mushroom consumption and of fertility 
cults that they hit all these stories 

3580
02:35:40,661 --> 02:35:44,140
and in parables because they wanted to 
keep the information,

3581
02:35:44,141 --> 02:35:46,290
but they didn't want other people to be 
able to access it.

3582
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:51,840
By the way,
I heard you mentioned that book we have 

3583
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:51,840
before and you said you got an old 
coffee,

3584
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,461
but you know,
I've got a couple of young urban health 

3585
02:35:55,461 --> 02:35:55,461
republished it,
so it's still a bit.

3586
02:35:55,461 --> 02:35:55,461
You can get it on amazon.
Yeah.

3587
02:35:55,461 --> 02:35:56,110
It's very cool to

3588
02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:56,860
done that.
Yeah,

3589
02:35:56,861 --> 02:35:59,050
you can get it now.
When I bought it,

3590
02:35:59,051 --> 02:36:02,770
I bought it many,
many years ago because of jack herer yon

3591
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:07,800
introduced me to jack hair and jack 
herer was working on a book with this 

3592
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:12,690
other guy who turned out to be a 
pedophile like wind up murdered in jail 

3593
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:13,390
or something like that.
Really crazy stuff,

3594
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:18,720
but they were working on this book about
santa claus and the connection between a

3595
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:23,820
santa claus and the amanita miscarry.
A mushroom and the crank have read all 

3596
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:23,820
that.
That was.

3597
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:24,550
Yeah.
That was basically all his work and then

3598
02:36:24,551 --> 02:36:29,551
it was the connection between psilocybin
mushrooms and religious experiences and 

3599
02:36:29,551 --> 02:36:33,600
jack had all these old images like 
really old images of ancient paintings 

3600
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:39,170
that showed naked people dancing under 
this translucent mushroom and that there

3601
02:36:39,171 --> 02:36:44,171
was.
There was their way of describing being 

3602
02:36:44,171 --> 02:36:46,651
under the excess and then he showed me 
all these different religious religious 

3603
02:36:47,681 --> 02:36:52,681
institutions and buildings and places 
that had mushroom shaped doorways and 

3604
02:36:52,681 --> 02:36:54,730
had mushroom iconography and the 
mushrooms all over the place.

3605
02:36:54,731 --> 02:36:59,731
So you didn't even think of with 
mushrooms like the way a cardinals ca 

3606
02:36:59,731 --> 02:37:03,780
outfit is red and white and the whole 
like saying like signifies the ancient 

3607
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:10,230
images of halos.
You've seen the ancient images of halos 

3608
02:37:10,230 --> 02:37:12,580
is a mushroom cap.
I mean it is a mushroom cap.

3609
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:18,190
Literally.
I've seen a lot of those old images in 

3610
02:37:18,190 --> 02:37:20,320
the first century.
The so called christian churches had a 

3611
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:20,320
lot of mushrooms.

3612
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:20,340
Yeah.
They art.

3613
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:25,520
They didn't have that,
that hulu thing floating or above their 

3614
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:28,221
head.
They have this thing behind them which 

3615
02:37:28,221 --> 02:37:28,221
showed this mushroom.
Yeah.

3616
02:37:28,221 --> 02:37:30,300
I mean with literally all the lines 
underneath the app,

3617
02:37:30,810 --> 02:37:32,370
pull it,
pull up images if you can.

3618
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:36,660
There's an article where I linked to it.
It was a santa claus was a mushroom.

3619
02:37:37,180 --> 02:37:41,010
It was,
I wrote it in like 2007 from my website.

3620
02:37:41,011 --> 02:37:45,780
It's on joe rogan.net.
And I put in it a bunch of photographs.

3621
02:37:46,020 --> 02:37:50,520
A couple of them have ancient people 
that had mushroom caps for,

3622
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:51,680
for their,
for their,

3623
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:52,900
uh,
their.

3624
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:57,970
yeah,
it's only about the last few thousand 

3625
02:37:57,970 --> 02:37:58,730
years that this has been suppressed,
but it was pretty active psychodelic,

3626
02:37:58,731 --> 02:38:00,650
uh,
in the ancient time.

3627
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:04,160
It's amazing that this is all true.
this sounds like nonsense.

3628
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,080
I mean,
this sounds like some flat earth shit,

3629
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:08,700
like when you hear,
if you don't know any better and you're,

3630
02:38:08,701 --> 02:38:10,880
you know,
you're listening to you and I talk about

3631
02:38:10,881 --> 02:38:13,040
this quite a bit in one,
but it's well documented.

3632
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:18,730
There's a lot of documentation about it.
There's a lot of information that shows 

3633
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:19,860
that there was,
you know,

3634
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:22,030
not just the christian religion,
but many,

3635
02:38:22,031 --> 02:38:22,550
many,
many,

3636
02:38:22,551 --> 02:38:24,830
many,
many religions were aware of psychedelic

3637
02:38:24,831 --> 02:38:27,900
mushrooms here.
Jamie's going to pull up this.

3638
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:31,270
Did you find it yet?
Um,

3639
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:32,120
the,
the,

3640
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,810
the,
uh,

3641
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:37,840
the images that Jack Harris showed me 
were really unique and I haven't been 

3642
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,770
able to locate him since he was in the 
middle of a book before he had a stroke.

3643
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:40,820
Right.
That's a shame.

3644
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:41,990
Yeah.
I was really sad.

3645
02:38:41,991 --> 02:38:44,870
He,
I met him and then he had a,

3646
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:47,600
he had a stroke and then he had a second
stroke as well.

3647
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:50,450
I met him,
I believe after the first one he was,

3648
02:38:50,451 --> 02:38:52,430
because he was having difficulty talking
then,

3649
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:55,680
but it wasn't as bad and then apparently
a bad one,

3650
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:59,150
but they were in the middle of creating 
this book and his,

3651
02:38:59,470 --> 02:39:00,020
you know,
he,

3652
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,150
his story was fascinating because jack 
hair,

3653
02:39:02,151 --> 02:39:07,151
like you was a republican,
he was a goldwater republican as you 

3654
02:39:07,151 --> 02:39:08,750
described it.
And then he got divorced and met a girl

3655
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:11,740
in the world.
Opened up,

3656
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:12,230
do,
do,

3657
02:39:12,231 --> 02:39:12,740
do,
do,

3658
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:13,420
do,
but you know,

3659
02:39:13,450 --> 02:39:18,450
a lot of the ufo thing may be a dmt 
released about 10 or 12 years ago.

3660
02:39:18,791 --> 02:39:23,791
I corresponded with quit whitney driver 
because in one of his books he had said 

3661
02:39:23,791 --> 02:39:25,360
something that to me sounded just like a
dmt trip.

3662
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:26,890
And he allowed his,
hey,

3663
02:39:26,891 --> 02:39:29,560
that might be possible.
And then about a year or so later,

3664
02:39:29,561 --> 02:39:33,360
he did a radio show with a straussman 
that you were in his movie,

3665
02:39:33,370 --> 02:39:35,230
a spirit molecule.
And uh,

3666
02:39:35,231 --> 02:39:35,890
he,
he,

3667
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:37,960
they,
the two agreed that this could,

3668
02:39:38,190 --> 02:39:42,970
some of the abduction experiences could 
be a spontaneous release of dmt.

3669
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:45,020
Yeah.
It makes sense to me why,

3670
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:50,080
when you think about it,
why are all these experiences where 

3671
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:50,880
people are getting abducted all 
happening in the middle of the night and

3672
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:55,920
that's when your brain is producing the 
most dmt allegedly mean they know for a 

3673
02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:00,131
fact now that's been proven by the 
cottonwood research work that 

3674
02:40:00,131 --> 02:40:00,680
strassman's done cottonwood research 
foundation.

3675
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:03,980
They've found dmt and a live rats pineal
gland.

3676
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:09,580
They found that regional,
so they know for a fact that the pineal 

3677
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:09,580
gland is a source of.

3678
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:13,840
That's the first I've heard that.
A real research because it has been 

3679
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:14,000
speculated on,
but had really turned it

3680
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:14,670
down.
Yeah.

3681
02:40:14,671 --> 02:40:15,460
That's,
uh,

3682
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:20,540
I'll,
I'll pull up the article because it's 

3683
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:20,640
pretty interesting found and live rats,
pineal gland.

3684
02:40:21,220 --> 02:40:26,220
It's um,
I mean it's one thing that they've 

3685
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:26,250
always pointed to it.
There's a lot of anecdotal evidence,

3686
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:31,730
especially the ancient,
the ancient religious work of the third 

3687
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:33,470
eye itself,
symbol of mysticism,

3688
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:37,530
much like the mushroom cap being the,
the halo why,

3689
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:39,370
right.
But we're just now getting back and,

3690
02:40:39,371 --> 02:40:44,371
and unfortunately we've lost so much 
information that humans had at one time 

3691
02:40:44,371 --> 02:40:49,021
about these substances.
But I think part of the transition that 

3692
02:40:49,021 --> 02:40:49,021
took place was,
you know,

3693
02:40:49,021 --> 02:40:51,510
the,
the rights of looses a were,

3694
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:54,010
you know,
so many thousands of people went through

3695
02:40:54,011 --> 02:40:55,840
that.
That lasted for a couple thousand Years.

3696
02:40:55,841 --> 02:41:00,841
But in about 300 bc,
the state took over control of the 

3697
02:41:00,841 --> 02:41:02,350
rights and once the government took over
control,

3698
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:03,580
things changed.

3699
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:08,000
This is the article on the cottonwood 
research.org

3700
02:41:08,001 --> 02:41:13,001
website,
which is strassman's foundation says 

3701
02:41:13,001 --> 02:41:16,151
we're excited to announce the acceptance
of for publication of a paper 

3702
02:41:16,151 --> 02:41:18,650
documenting the presence of dmt and the 
pineal gland of live rodents.

3703
02:41:18,651 --> 02:41:23,651
The paperwork will appear in the journal
biomedical chromatography and describes 

3704
02:41:26,721 --> 02:41:29,770
experiments that took place in dr joe 
schmo bore.

3705
02:41:29,771 --> 02:41:30,770
Wow.
This guy is a weird name.

3706
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,500
B o r g I,
g I,

3707
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:38,120
j I g I n,
b o r j I g I n.

3708
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:41,930
How do you say that?
Or does aj and a g together.

3709
02:41:41,931 --> 02:41:43,370
Bitch,
what are you trying to do to people?

3710
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:46,220
Why the fuck would you put aj and a g 
together?

3711
02:41:46,221 --> 02:41:47,600
One of the other.
You greedy bitch.

3712
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:50,600
They're both sound.
What is that saying?

3713
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:55,310
See those images you see the one mean?
That is about as clear as day.

3714
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:57,680
That's the bottom of a goddamn machines 
where the spores will come.

3715
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:58,310
Well,
there's one.

3716
02:41:58,311 --> 02:42:00,200
Don't go to youtube.
There's one on my website.

3717
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:03,260
Get to it.
Did you google it?

3718
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:05,900
Okay,
the fuck happened.

3719
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:09,860
So have you ever seen a machine elf or a
self transforming basketball?

3720
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,420
No,
I haven't either.

3721
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:16,480
But you know what?
I finally figured out those self 

3722
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:19,190
transforming basketballs,
I figured out I'm seeing the same thing,

3723
02:42:19,191 --> 02:42:21,500
but I wouldn't call it that.
I'd call it something else.

3724
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:23,490
Excuse me.
And that's,

3725
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:28,570
that's why I never described what I see 
because then you plant that seed in 

3726
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:31,691
somebody's head and terrence did Plant 
the seed of the self transforming 

3727
02:42:31,691 --> 02:42:34,160
machine elves and the basketball's a 
jeweled basketballs.

3728
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:37,190
And I think that if you get rid of those
words,

3729
02:42:37,191 --> 02:42:39,980
those labels,
you'll see things that you could say,

3730
02:42:39,981 --> 02:42:41,030
well,
I could say that,

3731
02:42:41,031 --> 02:42:45,140
but I'd rather say this about it.
So a lot of people get disappointed when

3732
02:42:45,141 --> 02:42:48,680
they smoked dmt and they don't see the 
machine elves in the basketballs.

3733
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:51,060
Yeah,
I don't know what that means.

3734
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:54,130
The machine elves,
the basketballs on this stuff is,

3735
02:42:54,131 --> 02:42:59,131
is my,
my website down or some point that it 

3736
02:42:59,131 --> 02:42:59,850
was linking back to the new podcast side
for some reason.

3737
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:01,980
Oh,
so the links are bad.

3738
02:43:01,981 --> 02:43:04,020
Is that what it is?
No way.

3739
02:43:04,021 --> 02:43:06,210
Really.
HM.

3740
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:08,100
Okay.
Well I found it in two seconds.

3741
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:10,440
If you Go to wordpress,
you can still find it.

3742
02:43:10,441 --> 02:43:13,750
But the images there I found that didn't
have any images flow was looking for.

3743
02:43:13,751 --> 02:43:16,180
So I've got to get these guys to fix my 
website.

3744
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:19,960
That's bullshit that although that stuff
should be up there with photographs none

3745
02:43:19,961 --> 02:43:22,150
up there and none of it's up there.
Oh great.

3746
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:24,160
Not that way.
At least somewhere else.

3747
02:43:24,250 --> 02:43:25,850
How dare they?
Um,

3748
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:31,200
but I think it's probably pretty obvious
that if you're dealing with people that 

3749
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:34,951
lived a long time ago and we know for a 
fact that these substances existed a 

3750
02:43:34,951 --> 02:43:35,080
long time ago.
They've been here forever.

3751
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:37,600
So people would have found them,
they would have ate them.

3752
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:42,630
They were freaked out and they would 
have told everybody or try to tell 

3753
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:44,290
people that they cared about or just 
information just like we do.

3754
02:43:44,730 --> 02:43:46,960
I mean,
it's withoUt a doubt,

3755
02:43:46,961 --> 02:43:51,961
it's got to be like one of the most 
powerful things that can happeN to a 

3756
02:43:51,961 --> 02:43:51,961
person outside of dying.
Yeah.

3757
02:43:51,961 --> 02:43:53,950
Outside of having,
having children dying,

3758
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:55,510
losing a loved one,
what have You.

3759
02:43:55,810 --> 02:44:00,810
One of the most powerful things and 
experiences that you can have is a 

3760
02:44:00,810 --> 02:44:00,810
second.

3761
02:44:00,810 --> 02:44:01,840
It shouldn't be missed whether you never
have a second one or not.

3762
02:44:01,841 --> 02:44:02,890
You should at least have one.

3763
02:44:03,150 --> 02:44:03,690
Yeah,
it's.

3764
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:09,010
Well,
it's just amazing that it's illegal 

3765
02:44:09,010 --> 02:44:10,791
still.
It's amazing that they've been able to 

3766
02:44:10,791 --> 02:44:12,120
hold on this long with everything that 
we know now about what is legal.

3767
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,800
We talked about before,
cIgarettes,

3768
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:16,320
cremini,
what are you trying to do?

3769
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:19,240
Trying to keep everybody week.
You know,

3770
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:21,070
if I was inclined to believe that 
that's.

3771
02:44:21,090 --> 02:44:26,090
There's the evidence right there.
If I was inclined to believe tHat they 

3772
02:44:26,090 --> 02:44:26,090
are trying to keep people stupid and 
weak,

3773
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:29,270
I buy into terrence's a theory that 
nobody's in charge.

3774
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:31,400
You know,
there's a bunch of competing groups that

3775
02:44:31,490 --> 02:44:36,490
have a lot of power,
but not any one of them is in charge of 

3776
02:44:36,490 --> 02:44:39,281
calling the shots and most of them are 
pretty stupid people that we think some 

3777
02:44:39,281 --> 02:44:40,880
of these people are maybe smart because 
they have money or something.

3778
02:44:40,881 --> 02:44:44,510
Most of them inherited it or they got it
as a derivatives trader or something,

3779
02:44:44,511 --> 02:44:49,190
but most people in congress and politics
and no matter who you meet,

3780
02:44:49,260 --> 02:44:51,010
you know there's like you and I were all
you,

3781
02:44:51,130 --> 02:44:56,130
all.
Some of them have experience in these 

3782
02:44:56,130 --> 02:44:58,301
jobs,
but we shouldn't give them all this 

3783
02:44:58,301 --> 02:44:58,301
credence of being.
Knowing all.

3784
02:44:58,301 --> 02:44:59,260
No.
They live a life that's.

3785
02:44:59,310 --> 02:45:04,310
That's the momentum of what they've done
in the past and what their ancestors 

3786
02:45:04,310 --> 02:45:07,591
have done and how they've gotten to this
position because of their family name 

3787
02:45:07,591 --> 02:45:10,321
and the business that they grew up in,
in what happened and it's just a 

3788
02:45:10,321 --> 02:45:11,080
momentous thing and once the family 
controls a certain amount,

3789
02:45:11,081 --> 02:45:16,081
whether it's the world bank or whether 
it's whatever the fuck you get all your 

3790
02:45:16,081 --> 02:45:16,081
corporation,
your,

3791
02:45:16,081 --> 02:45:19,720
your family owns.
Once someone has that kind of power and 

3792
02:45:19,720 --> 02:45:19,720
control,
they're not very,

3793
02:45:19,720 --> 02:45:22,960
it's not very likely that they're going 
to be willing to let that go

3794
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:25,240
and they bring their children up in that
same moment,

3795
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:30,370
you know,
they're going to private schools are 

3796
02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:30,720
meeting the same friends who are from 
the same kinds of families and so it's,

3797
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:32,440
it's a inbreeding kind of thing.

3798
02:45:32,470 --> 02:45:34,120
It's one of the problems with 
capitalism,

3799
02:45:34,121 --> 02:45:39,121
but I also think it's one of the ins and
the yang of life and one of the reasons 

3800
02:45:39,121 --> 02:45:42,541
why there's so much motivation for 
people to get things together today 

3801
02:45:42,541 --> 02:45:44,830
because we see so much evil and 
corruption and the hypocrisy.

3802
02:45:44,831 --> 02:45:46,570
We see it.
So we get motivated.

3803
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:48,170
Well,
the internet's changed everything.

3804
02:45:48,450 --> 02:45:51,260
We can see things without going through 
a corporate sense or not to.

3805
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:54,230
That's never happened before.
It's a.

3806
02:45:54,250 --> 02:45:56,380
And I think people are way more informed
now because of the,

3807
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:56,940
oh,

3808
02:45:56,940 --> 02:45:58,590
the internet's changed all the rules.
You know,

3809
02:45:58,591 --> 02:46:00,030
if the internet was around in the 
sixties,

3810
02:46:00,031 --> 02:46:01,290
there would have been a different 
outcome.

3811
02:46:01,350 --> 02:46:01,760
But,
uh,

3812
02:46:02,130 --> 02:46:07,130
I think,
I think that what's going on now is 

3813
02:46:07,130 --> 02:46:07,130
gonna make the sixties look like the 
fifties,

3814
02:46:07,130 --> 02:46:07,130
you know,
the thing.

3815
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:11,810
I think slowly but surely people are 
waking up to the idea that we aren't the

3816
02:46:11,811 --> 02:46:14,380
same people that we were in 1994.
Oh,

3817
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:20,020
seven years ago.
There was no iphone that has changed a 

3818
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:20,020
lot of things.
Yes.

3819
02:46:20,020 --> 02:46:21,100
Apps,
you know,

3820
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:26,000
twitter and facebook and all that jazz.
Just the ability to get like,

3821
02:46:26,001 --> 02:46:28,170
I love twitter because I get link sent 
to me like,

3822
02:46:28,490 --> 02:46:31,130
check out this new scientific findings,
look at this new discovery,

3823
02:46:31,131 --> 02:46:32,720
check out this video,
this is amazing.

3824
02:46:32,721 --> 02:46:35,240
This guy made this and look at that.
And it's like,

3825
02:46:35,270 --> 02:46:40,270
the amount of interesting information 
that comes to you directly on your 

3826
02:46:40,270 --> 02:46:42,110
phone,
a daily basis is pretty staggering.

3827
02:46:42,690 --> 02:46:47,690
When we were first trying to get the 
internet going and the phone companies 

3828
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:47,690
that,
uh,

3829
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:49,430
there wasn't a lot of acceptance.
Nobody,

3830
02:46:49,431 --> 02:46:51,950
the banks wouldn't talk to us,
the government wouldn't talk to us.

3831
02:46:51,951 --> 02:46:54,810
But our company bought bbn which,
uh,

3832
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:58,550
built the original routers and have 
control about a third of the backbone.

3833
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:00,680
And we were watching,
you know,

3834
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:01,190
say,
oh,

3835
02:47:01,191 --> 02:47:04,010
there's already a million people 
connected to the internet.

3836
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:05,780
Oh,
there's 2 million now.

3837
02:47:05,781 --> 02:47:09,800
There's $5 million and we're comparing 
with how fast phones a rolled out.

3838
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:12,830
And it was just several orders of 
magnitude faster.

3839
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:16,900
But to get to where we are today,
I don't think anybody 10 years ago would

3840
02:47:16,901 --> 02:47:19,700
have predicted to have a billion people 
connected already.

3841
02:47:19,790 --> 02:47:22,910
Nobody saw it coming and nobody knows 
what's going to be here in 10 years.

3842
02:47:23,350 --> 02:47:23,810
Yeah,
there's,

3843
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:26,630
it'd be crazy to try to predict it.
It's gonna be way weirder,

3844
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:27,700
but you know,
and,

3845
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:30,760
and the iphone and the ipad and all the 
wireless,

3846
02:47:30,761 --> 02:47:33,020
you know,
that when I was in the business,

3847
02:47:33,350 --> 02:47:35,720
I was at the dinner afterwards we get 
to.

3848
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:39,770
I was representing the phone company so 
they'd take me out to wine and dine me.

3849
02:47:39,771 --> 02:47:44,771
And uh,
talking to this one guy who's the 

3850
02:47:44,771 --> 02:47:47,210
president of a new combination of 
netflix and netscape and a son,

3851
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:50,600
they form an alliance and their senior 
vice president was saying,

3852
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:56,020
hey,
you need to start doing more research 

3853
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,020
and development in wifi.
And this was before why,

3854
02:47:56,020 --> 02:48:00,721
you know,
there was essentially no wireless and 

3855
02:48:00,721 --> 02:48:00,721
this is the only like,
I don't know,

3856
02:48:00,721 --> 02:48:00,980
14 years ago or something.
And I said,

3857
02:48:01,010 --> 02:48:01,860
oh,
the wireless,

3858
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:04,880
that's not gonna work.
He says we're putting all of our r and d

3859
02:48:04,881 --> 02:48:07,970
money into it because we're all living 
up in the hills over san jose.

3860
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:13,180
And there was no internet connectivity.
And by the time we retire we want high 

3861
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:17,441
speed wireless internet in their home.
That was a lot of the motivation for 

3862
02:48:17,441 --> 02:48:17,441
dol.

3863
02:48:17,441 --> 02:48:19,100
That's interest,
personal interest in,

3864
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:24,340
you know,
one of the things people don't want to 

3865
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:26,531
talk about about the internet,
but since we were running part of the 

3866
02:48:26,531 --> 02:48:29,951
backbone,
I could go to watch it through the 

3867
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:30,620
network,
the knock and watch them,

3868
02:48:31,060 --> 02:48:36,060
uh,
manage the traffic on the backbone of 

3869
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:36,920
the internet.
And it was in an a week day,

3870
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:38,750
around 3:30
or 4:00,

3871
02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:43,850
a big spike would hit of usage on the 
east coast.

3872
02:48:44,980 --> 02:48:49,040
Here's me.
And as the time would go four or five by

3873
02:48:49,041 --> 02:48:54,041
6:00,
the east coast spike would go down and 

3874
02:48:54,041 --> 02:48:54,320
the midwest would be up.
And then it was like a pig going through

3875
02:48:54,321 --> 02:48:59,321
a python and it was young kids coming 
home from school before their parents 

3876
02:48:59,321 --> 02:49:03,020
where they're downloading porn without 
porn.

3877
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:08,030
The,
the phone companies wouldn't put all 

3878
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:08,100
that money into the backbone because it 
huge business,

3879
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,770
you know,
they're not always works though.

3880
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:14,520
That's how the video recorder videotape 
came out,

3881
02:49:14,521 --> 02:49:16,300
you know,
because people go to watch porn at home.

3882
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:17,340
Yeah.
Vhs,

3883
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:20,780
remember those bought a beta.
Does you really?

3884
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:23,910
You're one of those guys.
They Were supposed to be better though.

3885
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:24,910
Weren't saying.
Well the.

3886
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:26,970
Yeah.
But they couldn't get many titles on.

3887
02:49:27,810 --> 02:49:30,400
The quality was better.
It was better.

3888
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:33,060
You got to go with whatever the mass 
produced thing is.

3889
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:38,150
Do you remember those things that used 
to have to go through to look at the 

3890
02:49:38,150 --> 02:49:41,091
porn?
You still have to go through beads or a 

3891
02:49:41,091 --> 02:49:42,990
oh,
the doors and you go in a little cubby 

3892
02:49:42,990 --> 02:49:42,990
hole or something like that.
Yeah.

3893
02:49:42,990 --> 02:49:47,970
Yeah.
To have to go through so doors in order 

3894
02:49:47,970 --> 02:49:50,091
to answer the warrants.
And then in the afternoon she could see 

3895
02:49:50,091 --> 02:49:50,730
the cars from all the salesmen's cars 
are parked out there,

3896
02:49:50,731 --> 02:49:51,000
you know.

3897
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:53,760
And people just look at you so squirrely
like,

3898
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:56,970
oh,
I can't believe I'm in this place.

3899
02:49:56,971 --> 02:49:59,820
You know,
you don't sit down on the seat.

3900
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:02,700
The people were interesting like that.
They,

3901
02:50:02,701 --> 02:50:07,701
they,
they don't want you to know that they 

3902
02:50:07,701 --> 02:50:09,201
like sex or like masturbating.
Like they want to pretend like they 

3903
02:50:11,671 --> 02:50:12,890
never do it.
That's.

3904
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:17,900
Yeah.
It's a fascinating aspect of us were so 

3905
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:20,841
weird.
I don't think that humans have always 

3906
02:50:20,841 --> 02:50:20,841
been that way.
You know?

3907
02:50:20,841 --> 02:50:20,841
I think really,
I,

3908
02:50:20,841 --> 02:50:20,920
I think,
you know,

3909
02:50:21,090 --> 02:50:23,100
the last 2000 years had been pretty 
repressive.

3910
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:28,390
What happened?
Christianity largely I think organized 

3911
02:50:28,561 --> 02:50:29,080
religion,
you know,

3912
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:34,420
the sex thing was weird because we know 
there's a lot of sex going on in the 

3913
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:34,770
clergy,
you know,

3914
02:50:34,771 --> 02:50:36,000
but uh,
you know,

3915
02:50:36,001 --> 02:50:37,890
the boy boy sex,
etc.

3916
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:39,900
But I think it's been,
you know,

3917
02:50:39,901 --> 02:50:42,330
you read about the borgia pope's and 
stuff like that,

3918
02:50:42,331 --> 02:50:47,331
you know,
if the higher elevations of the church 

3919
02:50:47,331 --> 02:50:48,180
have always been big involved in sex,
but they'd been telling the people no,

3920
02:50:48,181 --> 02:50:48,690
no,
no.

3921
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:53,870
Well,
they used to have sex like popes and 

3922
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:53,870
priests and bishops.
These to have sex with women.

3923
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:55,680
Oh,
used to be like totally normal that they

3924
02:50:55,681 --> 02:50:56,770
had kids,
some of the pope's.

3925
02:50:56,820 --> 02:50:57,750
Yeah,
but they had,

3926
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:01,080
they were getting so much pussy guts,
so out of control.

3927
02:51:01,410 --> 02:51:02,160
Hey,
I'm the pope,

3928
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:03,060
you know,
who's going to say no,

3929
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:05,160
exactly.
So people go and you know what,

3930
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:06,090
listen,
that's it.

3931
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:11,360
You can't have sex anymore unless you 
become a priest and join our little 

3932
02:51:11,401 --> 02:51:12,450
group here.
And uh,

3933
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:15,870
but even then there wasn't even an 
undercover sex with kids.

3934
02:51:15,930 --> 02:51:20,930
You know,
like how the idea that an undercover 

3935
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:24,141
group of kid fuckers could run a 
gigantic cult that would encapture like 

3936
02:51:25,710 --> 02:51:30,710
a billion people worldwide.
That 2013 is in one of the most 

3937
02:51:30,721 --> 02:51:33,200
incredible facts about our,
our reality.

3938
02:51:33,201 --> 02:51:34,290
Yeah.
You know,

3939
02:51:34,291 --> 02:51:35,010
I,
I was,

3940
02:51:35,011 --> 02:51:37,410
uh,
I was raised catholic and a altar boy.

3941
02:51:37,530 --> 02:51:40,480
I served mass all,
all through four years of college even.

3942
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:42,390
And uh,
did you ever get touched?

3943
02:51:42,960 --> 02:51:44,280
Never once,
never will.

3944
02:51:44,281 --> 02:51:49,281
Never approached,
never touched nobody often just 

3945
02:51:49,281 --> 02:51:49,860
cigarette or it's not a thing for a 
drink.

3946
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:55,100
You know,
all those four years I was an altar boy 

3947
02:51:55,100 --> 02:51:57,171
in college.
I never went to communion because I 

3948
02:51:57,171 --> 02:51:57,171
wouldn't go to confession because I 
didn't want to tell him I masturbated,

3949
02:51:58,060 --> 02:51:59,960
but uh,
you know,

3950
02:52:00,090 --> 02:52:02,400
during all that time I was never once 
approach.

3951
02:52:02,401 --> 02:52:05,980
But a guy he became a priest was a close
friend of mine when

3952
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,750
he was a kid.
We went to boy scout camp together.

3953
02:52:07,751 --> 02:52:10,300
Now he turned out to be a pedophile 
priest,

3954
02:52:10,301 --> 02:52:12,430
you know,
it's a real tragedy for the family.

3955
02:52:12,431 --> 02:52:13,650
You know,
we knew all of these and

3956
02:52:14,030 --> 02:52:19,030
yeah,
there you think that that happens just 

3957
02:52:19,030 --> 02:52:20,561
because of repression that someone has 
an access to know sex and then when they

3958
02:52:21,131 --> 02:52:23,780
were on kids,
they just almost are overwhelmed.

3959
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:24,730
Yeah,
I know.

3960
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:29,840
You know how you are when you're 20 
years old and it's all you think about 

3961
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:29,840
and if you're,
if you're repressed,

3962
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:31,840
you know,
maybe go wherever the first option is.

3963
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:36,860
And the opportunity is.
But I don't think he was actually 

3964
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:40,260
molested as a child because he and I 
went through the same priests and 

3965
02:52:40,260 --> 02:52:43,060
everything and I'm pretty sure he wasn't
molested a.

3966
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:45,010
This happened to him after he got to the
seminary.

3967
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:46,480
Wow.
That's horrible.

3968
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,650
yeah,
it's,

3969
02:52:47,790 --> 02:52:52,790
it's even more horrible if,
if the actual act of making someone 

3970
02:52:52,790 --> 02:52:56,641
celibate sorta perpetrates this turns 
people in some ways towards having sex 

3971
02:52:56,951 --> 02:53:00,460
with almost basically anybody that can 
celibacy is going to go away eventually.

3972
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:05,580
I hope so.
It hasn't been here only a few hundred 

3973
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:06,360
years.
The.

3974
02:53:07,150 --> 02:53:07,990
Yeah,
I mean,

3975
02:53:07,991 --> 02:53:12,991
but this,
the idea that peOple have done that 

3976
02:53:12,991 --> 02:53:14,060
throughout time is also another 
disturbing fact of,

3977
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:19,080
of,
of civilization when you find out about 

3978
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:20,710
socrates and they had sex with young 
boys on a regular basis

3979
02:53:21,860 --> 02:53:26,860
in some countries.
I know that we had a friend who told us 

3980
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:29,871
some real what I considered horror 
stories that they considered serving 

3981
02:53:29,871 --> 02:53:29,871
normal behavior,
you know?

3982
02:53:29,910 --> 02:53:34,910
Yeah.
I've had friends who've gone to 

3983
02:53:34,910 --> 02:53:36,411
Afghanistan described,
you know what they call man loved 

3984
02:53:36,411 --> 02:53:38,520
thursdays are a boy loved thursdays or I
don't know how much is true now.

3985
02:53:38,521 --> 02:53:43,521
It's not,
but you know the idea that people have 

3986
02:53:43,521 --> 02:53:45,650
sex with young boys for pleasure and 
women for procreation.

3987
02:53:45,651 --> 02:53:48,330
Right.
And that this is practice has been.

3988
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:51,330
I can't get my head,
I can't get my head around that.

3989
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:56,720
Well,
hopefully the internet will expose that 

3990
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:56,720
as well.
I mean,

3991
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:56,720
I,
I,

3992
02:53:56,720 --> 02:54:00,230
I wonder what it would take to 
psychically clean us up of all our weird

3993
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:05,930
patterns that were caught up in 
entrapped in regular and frequent 

3994
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:09,711
psychedelic experiences that could help 
and also communication and the 

3995
02:54:09,711 --> 02:54:09,711
communication in a way.

3996
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:10,790
Good.
Alex.

3997
02:54:10,791 --> 02:54:12,750
Lubricate communications.
CertainlY.

3998
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:17,950
First of all,
there's a lot of things that you can't 

3999
02:54:17,950 --> 02:54:19,541
even put words around and so you get 
together and you start trying to do art 

4000
02:54:19,541 --> 02:54:22,811
or music or some way to do that and 
let's communicate and get a new 

4001
02:54:22,811 --> 02:54:22,811
language.
Looking at what all alex grey is done.

4002
02:54:22,811 --> 02:54:23,420
Yeah.
You know,

4003
02:54:23,790 --> 02:54:27,200
in getting that message out there.
So you're right,

4004
02:54:27,250 --> 02:54:27,700
we're,
we're,

4005
02:54:27,770 --> 02:54:30,290
we're local.
how far we've come in our lifetime.

4006
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:35,890
We're nowhere near where I want to be,
but I've been in new orleans when I had 

4007
02:54:35,890 --> 02:54:38,270
to look white drinking fountain,
black drinking fountain,

4008
02:54:38,271 --> 02:54:40,310
where to sit on the street car and you 
know,

4009
02:54:40,311 --> 02:54:42,770
that,
that segregation is still here,

4010
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:47,300
but it's not nearly as bad as it was.
It's not quite as sanctioned as it was.

4011
02:54:47,301 --> 02:54:48,680
And uh,
you know,

4012
02:54:48,770 --> 02:54:53,770
women's rights are a little bit little 
bit better and my son was able to get 

4013
02:54:53,770 --> 02:54:54,440
married to the man he loved,
you know,

4014
02:54:54,441 --> 02:54:59,441
so we are making some social progress 
and probably making a lot more in a 

4015
02:54:59,481 --> 02:55:01,720
short period of time than we realize.
Yeah,

4016
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:06,620
that's where the exponential growth 
really kicks in is in social progress.

4017
02:55:06,621 --> 02:55:07,330
And you know,
like,

4018
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:12,460
I've,
I've made fun of a lot of like really 

4019
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:14,681
heavy duty lefties,
people that are like ultra progressive 

4020
02:55:14,681 --> 02:55:18,551
to the point of being ridiculous.
But I kind of appreciate the effort 

4021
02:55:18,551 --> 02:55:20,390
because this powerful strong effort for 
whatever it is.

4022
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:22,190
I mean,
I've gotten in trouble for saying that I

4023
02:55:22,191 --> 02:55:27,191
don't think a transgender man we came,
a woman should be able to fight and 

4024
02:55:27,191 --> 02:55:30,941
women's mma it.
My point is from the safety of the 

4025
02:55:30,941 --> 02:55:34,260
athletes,
but people have defended transgender 

4026
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:38,171
people because of the fact that they 
automatically stand up for someone they 

4027
02:55:38,171 --> 02:55:39,650
feel like is being oppressed.
And I appreciate that.

4028
02:55:39,651 --> 02:55:44,651
I appreciate the idea behind that.
I think I appreciate the sentiment 

4029
02:55:44,651 --> 02:55:48,071
behind that.
And I think that's fascinating as a 

4030
02:55:48,071 --> 02:55:48,440
culture that there are people that if 
you repress gay rights,

4031
02:55:48,441 --> 02:55:50,390
they will go after you and they will.

4032
02:55:50,810 --> 02:55:53,870
I think that's a good thing,
whether it's misguided or not.

4033
02:55:53,871 --> 02:55:58,871
And a lot of times it is when it comes 
to certain aspects of progressive 

4034
02:55:58,871 --> 02:56:02,891
thinking,
the fact that heavy duty lefty behavior 

4035
02:56:02,891 --> 02:56:06,521
exists and exists in like big groups and
big organized groups I think is very 

4036
02:56:06,681 --> 02:56:11,681
important.
I think it's very important because it 

4037
02:56:11,681 --> 02:56:14,021
balances out the heavy duty,
right end right wing and right leaning 

4038
02:56:14,021 --> 02:56:17,300
groups.
I think all those things eventually with

4039
02:56:17,301 --> 02:56:21,590
education and with the undeniable truth 
at the internet presents,

4040
02:56:21,770 --> 02:56:26,770
we'll find some sort of a comfortable 
medium of truth were really self 

4041
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:27,470
aggrandizement,
douchey behavior.

4042
02:56:27,471 --> 02:56:30,080
No laughed is just as gross as self 
aggrandizement,

4043
02:56:30,110 --> 02:56:35,110
douchey behavior on the right.
And people realize that compassion does 

4044
02:56:35,110 --> 02:56:36,750
not have to have an ideology attached to
it.

4045
02:56:36,770 --> 02:56:38,870
It should be a part of how human beings 
behave.

4046
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:41,030
You know,
when I was a rep republican,

4047
02:56:41,031 --> 02:56:44,000
I was not a bad person.
I was very misinformed.

4048
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:44,790
I,
you know,

4049
02:56:44,870 --> 02:56:47,420
and I came up from the poor side of the 
street,

4050
02:56:47,421 --> 02:56:52,421
you know,
my dad didn't have a car when I was 

4051
02:56:52,421 --> 02:56:52,421
growing up and stuff and so I,
I,

4052
02:56:52,421 --> 02:56:52,421
you know,
I made a lot of money.

4053
02:56:52,421 --> 02:56:52,910
I thought,
oh this is great.

4054
02:56:52,911 --> 02:56:54,770
I did this on my own,
but I didn't,

4055
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:55,480
you know,
I,

4056
02:56:55,640 --> 02:57:00,640
I've decided that an until everybody has
the same advantages as a white college 

4057
02:57:01,491 --> 02:57:06,491
educated american male,
I'm not allowed to complain that it's 

4058
02:57:06,491 --> 02:57:06,491
not.
Even then it's not,

4059
02:57:06,491 --> 02:57:07,580
you know,
I've had.

4060
02:57:07,581 --> 02:57:09,200
So even though we didn't have money,
I was,

4061
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:11,060
I had so many advantages.
Oh,

4062
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:12,960
we're running out of time here.
So.

4063
02:57:13,060 --> 02:57:15,660
But we.
But I would like to talk to you a little

4064
02:57:15,661 --> 02:57:16,650
bit more.
Do you want to talk some more?

4065
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:20,100
WhaT's his end this and we'll talk a 
little bit more.

4066
02:57:20,310 --> 02:57:20,940
