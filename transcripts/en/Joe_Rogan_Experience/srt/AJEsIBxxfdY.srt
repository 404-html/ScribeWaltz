1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,710
And we're live.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,290
We're live.

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,123
There's

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,921
Eddie Bravo,

5
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,701
Brian Cowen,

6
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,720
Brendan Schaub,

7
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,741
Eddie Bravo.

8
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,470
The man introduced me
to marijuana for him.

9
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,170
I will forever be grateful
for medical reasons.

10
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:13,861
Medical reasons,

11
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,240
medical reasons.

12
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:15,870
Yeah,

13
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,531
totally illegal.

14
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,650
Now we don't even know

15
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,570
what is it that goes into effect?

16
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,651
It's now,

17
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,940
it was midnight that night.

18
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,920
What's legal?

19
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,200
Marijuana recreationally legal.

20
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,093
Wow.

21
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,750
You got to be 18 or 21 I think you have
to be 21 but now with attorney general

22
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,860
Jeff sessions,

23
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,060
if he gets confirmed,

24
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,680
can he override the federal
powers do not painted.

25
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,480
He would go against the will of Trump.

26
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,170
And I think the Trump for all of his
faults that you might find in him,

27
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,130
he's a populist.

28
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,180
The,

29
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,400
I think the best argument
is that a guy like him,

30
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,450
you can sort of influence him with the,

31
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,960
the opinion of the country,

32
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,561
you know?

33
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:58,140
And so it's kind of an interesting thing
because it might be one of the first

34
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,681
times ever,

35
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,430
like the,

36
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,720
the opinion of the country
might significantly
influenced some guy who's just

37
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,110
completely foreign to
the idea of politics.

38
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:06,960
It's kind of a good thing.

39
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,093
Yeah.

40
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,160
Like many things in life,

41
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:12,871
very practical.

42
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,190
This is not perfect.

43
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,500
Nothing's perfect like
many things in life,

44
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,850
but it might ultimately be a good thing
to completely shake up the system.

45
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,620
The thing that troubles people that oppose
that idea is all the Wall Street guys

46
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,830
he's bringing in like right away he's
bringing in all these billionaires and

47
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,664
Goldman Sachs.

48
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,930
He's bringing a lot of business
people to practical as well,

49
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,630
so who understand the
economy will sit and wait,

50
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,350
listen,

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,880
it might be good.

52
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,440
That might be a good thing and you might,

53
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,370
that might be what they need to honestly
figure out the economy and isn't a,

54
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,560
I mean I'm not saying it's impossible,

55
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm not saying it's definite,

56
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,050
but isn't it possible that you could be
a billionaire and still want to fix the

57
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,884
fucked up?

58
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,710
Especially if you have
everything you've ever wanted.

59
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,420
And a lot of these guys,

60
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,650
they do operate on that,

61
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,580
that you know,

62
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,890
infinite growth idea,

63
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
like to constantly want
to give bigger yards,

64
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:03,900
bigger match.

65
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,733
It's bigger houses,

66
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,220
but it's also possible that God could be
just an intelligent guy that did really

67
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,054
well in business.

68
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,040
Like even some of the
things Trump said himself.

69
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,281
He said,

70
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:11,461
yeah,

71
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:12,780
I took advantage of these loopholes,

72
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,980
but let's get rid of him.

73
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,230
He shouldn't think about
what he did for a long time,

74
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,040
which was he was at,

75
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,470
he owned what hotels,

76
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
buildings and wanted to give you
the best experience possible.

77
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,100
A guy like that who has,

78
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,760
he has a massive ego of
course is it's going to do,

79
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,770
he wants a legacy he can point to.

80
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,160
He wants to go down as the greatest
presidents who wants to fix the fix these

81
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,491
problems.

82
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,271
I can see that.

83
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,050
Hope my worry.

84
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,500
That's where his ego's my worry is that
a guy like that is used to getting his

85
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,334
way all the time.

86
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,040
That did.

87
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,290
The nature of the presidency is one
in which you don't get your way,

88
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,450
where you have to compromise
what you've got to like.

89
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,790
A lot of times you get very
frustrated with the power.

90
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,624
You don't have

91
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,970
a lot though in business like he's
filed for chapter 11 multiple times,

92
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,460
like he's had a lot of
failures as as all business,

93
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,810
most successful people have.

94
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,771
I'm just saying,

95
00:02:58,771 --> 00:02:59,860
I wonder when,

96
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,160
what's

97
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
going to happen when he can't
convince companies to do his bidding,

98
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:10,381
when a lot of his policies maybe don't
give his voter base the jobs they wanted

99
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,620
because he can't implement
the policies he wants.

100
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,950
That's when it's going to be interested.

101
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
Do you think we'll see
an assassination attempt?

102
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,780
Jesus crushed printed Shab what?

103
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,614
Man?

104
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,110
I don't think it's going to happen.

105
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,861
I don't think so.

106
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,694
It was a crazy,

107
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,230
I don't tell me people are upset.

108
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,911
It's possible.

109
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:28,120
There are a lot of people
that's always pasta.

110
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,930
What kind of people?

111
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,820
People have tried to kill
the president many times.

112
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,090
Most of America,

113
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,800
Hillary won the popular vote.

114
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,930
Actually currently it by what?

115
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,931
55 500,000 but the crazy thing about
the debate between Hillary and Trump,

116
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,260
Trump's done some debug
things or whatever,

117
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,390
but when he goes,

118
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,250
you guys know what pizza gate is about.

119
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,523
Oh,

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,370
are you familiar with it?

121
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,090
Pizza Gate?

122
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,620
Yes.

123
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,453
No,

124
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,720
no.

125
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,020
Yes,

126
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,250
yes,

127
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,791
I do.

128
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,650
But I never heard of him.

129
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,880
He's explained to me and I said,

130
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm going to explain it.

131
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,391
I'm not going to get to it,

132
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,440
but I'm just [inaudible] shit.

133
00:03:59,530 --> 00:03:59,771
Eddie,

134
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,130
Eddie,

135
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,341
Eddie.

136
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,174
Before you go into it,

137
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,380
it's been debunked.

138
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,030
It's the biggest bunch of bullshit.

139
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,490
Oh my God,

140
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,500
it's fake news.

141
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,030
They felt moved his fake news.

142
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,423
It's the fee.

143
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,110
So the debit credit for the power,

144
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,230
the power structure and the Democratic
Party are pedophiles and they all

145
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,030
communicate with each other
with those secret paddles.

146
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,810
Is this where we're going
to going to hop off Ebay?

147
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,350
It was proven to be a horse shit story.

148
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,310
If you buy into it,

149
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,630
the joke is on you.

150
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,464
I'm telling you.

151
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm telling you how.

152
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,850
Wow.

153
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,880
I'm telling you what.

154
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,910
That's very unbelievable.

155
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,570
It's incredible.

156
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:34,831
So,

157
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:35,441
so what does the,

158
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:35,651
so,

159
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,281
so are you saying,

160
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,140
what are you saying that
the power structure,

161
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,800
no one files.

162
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,431
This is what I'm saying.

163
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:39,700
Come on.

164
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,270
This is what I'm,

165
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,020
this is really like,

166
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,950
but hold on a second.

167
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,910
This is what I'm saying.

168
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,030
This is what I'm saying
is it's so fucking dark.

169
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,250
All the Shit Alex Jones has been saying.

170
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,490
He's been saying all that
Pizza Gate Shit for 20 years.

171
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,031
He's been saying.

172
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,864
Everyone thought he was.

173
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,650
No,

174
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,730
you couldn't believe anything he said
because of the things he's saying now when

175
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,630
you look at pizza gate,

176
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,690
all that shit he was saying that
everyone thought he was crazy for cause.

177
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,541
Shit's real now.

178
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,760
The fake news story,

179
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,001
Eddie.

180
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,610
Dude,

181
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,010
it's a new story.

182
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:06,880
Every newspaper,

183
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,420
every,

184
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,320
every credible news
organizations bullshit.

185
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,550
Then like,

186
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,031
I don't know,

187
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:16,140
she just posted more than you are today.

188
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,700
Economist.

189
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,533
Take both sides.

190
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,460
Take the right and the left.

191
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,210
It's a lot.

192
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,020
It's a joke.

193
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,410
It was a Joe [inaudible] is.

194
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,430
Wow.

195
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,810
So any power structure.

196
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,950
You didn't get the joke eddy,

197
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,843
the power structure.

198
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,900
All pedophiles.

199
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,030
What are you talking about?

200
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:30,400
Hey,

201
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,660
what are you talking about?

202
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,520
That's what I'm talking about and love.

203
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:33,821
So,

204
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,800
so the power structure,

205
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,663
ours.

206
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,643
Brian,

207
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,790
have you seen the documentary
conspiracy of silence?

208
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,690
Have you seen that?

209
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,590
Sure haven't buddy.

210
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:44,981
You still,

211
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,030
of course you're having,

212
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,700
I don't cause I don't
get my news from Youtube.

213
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,331
I get my news from,

214
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,220
from see what angle?

215
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,390
Both credible news organizations show
top independent lines of inquiry.

216
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,960
Hey Joe,

217
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,920
can you do me a favor?

218
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm outside looking in.

219
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,190
What

220
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,640
is pizza gate is,

221
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,390
there's a guy who worked for
Hillary Clinton's campaign
and his name is Podesta.

222
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:05,661
Right?

223
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,800
John Podesta.

224
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,663
That's his name.

225
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,470
There's a this some pizza restaurant in.

226
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,790
Is it in DC?

227
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,530
I'll leave it to Washington.

228
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,870
It's in Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza
and apparently they have art that's like

229
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,380
this kind of famous
pedophile like Pat Art,

230
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,890
which is close to the man
love is that finishes.

231
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,370
What about those paintings?

232
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,010
There was no,

233
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,650
no,

234
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,801
no.

235
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,160
He's just,

236
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,611
he's not saying,

237
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:39,290
he's just saying it's just also
with some hands on what it would do.

238
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:39,771
But Brian,

239
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:43,850
what are the paintings that they're
being accused of having love?

240
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,490
No,

241
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,021
but not that.

242
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,920
Not the symbol.

243
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,221
There's,

244
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,290
there's some paintings
that were connected to,

245
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,250
do you know what I'm talking about?

246
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,080
There was some like very bizarre.

247
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,660
It disturbed the shit out of me so much.

248
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,051
I said,

249
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,060
I don't want to spend
any time looking at this.

250
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,811
You know what?

251
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,920
I know for sure though,

252
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,521
for sure.

253
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,860
100% that speaker of the House Guy,

254
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,120
Dennis Hastert.

255
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,430
Yeah,

256
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,430
they've got put away for like 15 months
for being an admitted child molester.

257
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:07,910
That's right.

258
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,640
The idea that you could only get in the
idea that this guy was the speaker of

259
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,210
the house.

260
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,780
Yikes.

261
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,350
He was the speaker of the house and he
was fucking kids when he was a wrestling

262
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,080
coach and eating pizza and
now this is a different guy.

263
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,033
Well that was stabbed.

264
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,791
I don't do it.

265
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,100
I don't know what it was.

266
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,460
I don't know if it was because he's
old and he's very sick and ill,

267
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,230
but it means nothing to me.

268
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,160
The idea that you could take,

269
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,420
get a admitted kit fucker and
you only give him 15 months.

270
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:32,990
That's shit.

271
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,980
There's more to the story.

272
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,330
I'm sure there is.

273
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,470
I'm sure there is more of the story,

274
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:41,471
but the facts remain that that guy got a
very short sentence end was the speaker

275
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,900
of the house and it was
like a child molester.

276
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,741
Really?

277
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,300
100% was normal.

278
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,930
Yeah.

279
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,490
But there are always going
to be pedophiles now,

280
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,080
but instead of having this like gigantic
blanket attitude that what he's saying

281
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,660
is ridiculous and then getting
super emotional about it.

282
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Let's just look at the actual fact
that a guy who was a pedophile was the

283
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,890
speaker of the House has
nothing to do with this store.

284
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,341
You're right,

285
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:04,880
it doesn't.

286
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,620
But to mock the idea that people were
pedophiles can't get the high positions of

287
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,510
power was exactly what you were doing.

288
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,101
It's not an old one.

289
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,520
It's where are you getting real emotional?

290
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:17,000
Cause I was getting emotional because
this story was proven through many

291
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,510
independent lines of
inquiry I believe to be,

292
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,800
to be literally a hoax.

293
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,410
And when you give it a voice,

294
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,670
when it's a hoax and you know these
people look at it way closer to anybody at

295
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,760
this table and it's not about
the conspiracies to here.

296
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,571
What I'm trying to do is,

297
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,040
I'm trying to say guys,

298
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,401
guys,

299
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:34,881
hold on.

300
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,310
This was,

301
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,350
this was kind of a,

302
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,800
this was a big hoax and so many
different people who looked at who,

303
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,340
I don't have it,

304
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,750
they don't have an agenda.

305
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,830
They looked into it and I'm like,

306
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,340
Whoa,

307
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,971
what's going on?

308
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,840
It's a fake story,

309
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,470
but one of those fake science.

310
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:46,930
Yeah.

311
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,763
Just makes sense.

312
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,670
Do we really want to
spend time on fake Remy?

313
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,870
Let's talk about real stories.

314
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,220
Let me establish where I am.

315
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,980
I know the very brief outline
of what it's all about.

316
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,510
I know that a lot of people think are
pedophiles and crazy and Satan worshipers

317
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,030
and there was that some
spirit cooking thing,

318
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,830
some bizarre thing that was a released
in an email about something that Podesta

319
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,650
was going to get into.

320
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:08,971
True,

321
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:09,490
right?

322
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,270
Yeah,

323
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,951
that's true,

324
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,050
but it's like some bizarre,

325
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,640
I don't know what the fuck it is.

326
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,590
It's weird.

327
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,610
It's not,

328
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't know if we've not even knows.

329
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,370
All that won't speak up over here.

330
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,910
Looked into it deeply and I,

331
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,250
I'll conspiracy theories
make sense to me now.

332
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,880
I get it.

333
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,713
Every single one.

334
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,803
Sorry.

335
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,220
That's annoying.

336
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,661
Kind of.

337
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:39,270
I can a guy speak in general terms
without being checked every got damn time.

338
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,141
Yes.

339
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:40,340
Yes,

340
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,741
of course.

341
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:41,574
It's general.

342
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,893
When it got dead,

343
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,030
he beat him every God damn time.

344
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,590
I would say damn time,

345
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,520
but 90% of the time do you know who
you're explaining this shit any would you

346
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:50,910
admit?

347
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,230
And speaking in general terms,

348
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,340
what do I got to give you actual numbers.

349
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,530
But Eddie would you admit it?

350
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,670
You admit that human beings,

351
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,211
you me,

352
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,870
all of us tend to get a feeling and
then we have what's called confirmation

353
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,141
bias,

354
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,490
which is we'll find,

355
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,840
we'll find we all,

356
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,830
we all do it.

357
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,221
I do it,

358
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:05,730
we'll do it.

359
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,480
We'll find,

360
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,060
we'll find facts to support our feeling.

361
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,260
That's so human.

362
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,830
Listen,

363
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,670
all you have to do is hear an argument
between me and my wife and I'll fucking

364
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,940
justify it any way I can.

365
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,100
Cause I find facts to get
until the Highland on,

366
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:17,934
on my side.

367
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,783
Yeah.

368
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,430
So let's all be careful
about confirmation bias.

369
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,700
I mean all I'm saying is like to just
to get super emotional and say it's

370
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,120
impossible.

371
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,630
Like I don't necessarily
think it is impossible.

372
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,700
If that speaker of the
house guy was in place,

373
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,950
this story particularly
in particular pizza gate,

374
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,784
you just got to love them.

375
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,040
I know zero about story,

376
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,490
but let me,

377
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,323
let me,

378
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,770
that's what I'm from where I am.

379
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
I looked into it very little.

380
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:45,730
I saw it was,

381
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm like,

382
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,890
I'm going to just let this scuffle go
on and then look into it when the dust

383
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:53,730
settles and a couple of weeks and that
scared that figure out exactly what it

384
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,061
does,

385
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:55,710
whether it's bullshit or real.

386
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,441
It made me,

387
00:10:56,441 --> 00:11:00,750
me looking into it made me want to shut
the fuck up about conspiracy theories

388
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,270
because people,

389
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,920
people,

390
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,000
people get killed when you actually
look into it and I'm like Brian,

391
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,470
count when you actually look into it.

392
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:07,770
Yeah.

393
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,030
With LP to fucking mind.

394
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:09,864
Yes.

395
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,710
Shim it.

396
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,100
Brian.

397
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,933
I trust.

398
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,140
I don't trust you need a politician.

399
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,603
That shit.

400
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,410
All I'm saying truth is
somewhere in the middle.

401
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:22,951
You know?

402
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:27,951
I think everybody picks a position and
I bet it's probably not nearly as fucked

403
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,880
up as everybody's making it out to be,

404
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,380
but there's some weird,

405
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,891
first of all,

406
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,571
that Podesta Guy,

407
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:33,121
I was like really?

408
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,370
In the UFO shows too.

409
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,260
There's smoke,

410
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,150
there's fire guys,

411
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:36,391
guys,

412
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:36,660
guys.

413
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,231
No,

414
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:37,711
I'm sorry.

415
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,430
It hasn't stopped,

416
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,040
isn't pedestrian.

417
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,460
Hold on.

418
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,990
Hold on.

419
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,823
I don't believe so.

420
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,490
Wait a minute.

421
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,001
Hold on.

422
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,834
I care about that.

423
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,250
And you just storm troops over there
in the middle of what I'm saying is I'm

424
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:51,330
reacting to what I had read from
credible sources as we wish.

425
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,200
You can cite what it says she

426
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,123
was.

427
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,341
Okay.

428
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:55,620
Okay,

429
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:55,800
cool.

430
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,410
My phone,

431
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,640
pull it up just to,

432
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,000
well,

433
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,940
just give it to Jamie.

434
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,200
I'll throw it up on one of the big
screen and then we'll knock this out.

435
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,150
Yep.

436
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,270
All I got to say is,

437
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,590
I don't even want to get into it,

438
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,760
but all you need to do is go to youtube
and watch the conspiracy of silence.

439
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,780
It's a documentary.

440
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,520
How long has it was
supposed to be on the BBC,

441
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,480
but they never aired it.

442
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,314
Who made it?

443
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,183
Uh,

444
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,300
your mother Kalin?

445
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:16,771
No Hood.

446
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,020
Who made it important?

447
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,370
No,

448
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,040
it's not.

449
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,740
It's not.

450
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,041
No.

451
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,791
Disney made it.

452
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:21,891
I've,

453
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,950
I've done don't you believe
to have Disney made it?

454
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,160
What the Hell is pizzagate?

455
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,073
Here it is,

456
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:26,531
Jamie.

457
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,430
I'm going to give this to you.

458
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:27,970
Hold on.

459
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,271
Hold.

460
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:28,930
Please tell him.

461
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,000
Just tell him what it is
and he'll get it online.

462
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,500
Here's a computer as well.

463
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,800
It's interesting because the two,

464
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,130
you guys are so on the opposite end
of the holes and conspiracy thing.

465
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,880
Complete Ahmoud tend to immediately
go towards conspiracies.

466
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:50,881
He tends to immediately go towards
the mainstream [inaudible].

467
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,200
Those guys guys want
someone to convince me.

468
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,230
It's not that what it is is
I tend to not trust shit.

469
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,170
They say he tends to
trust everything they say.

470
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,093
Mr. Scenario,

471
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,700
that's not a fair characterization.

472
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,670
On the macro story side,

473
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:09,971
dude,

474
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,930
you're one of those guys.

475
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,043
I read

476
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,750
Washington Post

477
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,930
New York Times,

478
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,821
Washington,

479
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,400
the second oldest magazine in the world.

480
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:24,234
You read all of them.

481
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,841
Do you remember the Bulls?

482
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,420
Do you know how those editorial boards,

483
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,070
you study the bullshit he do.

484
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,870
You know how those editorial boards work?

485
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,160
Do you know you?

486
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:37,020
Do you really think that the
entire editorial board of
the New York Times or the

487
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:40,540
wall or the economist or the Wall
Street Journal where people who run the

488
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,400
country in the world
get their information?

489
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Do you think all those people are lying
game together and being conspiratorial

490
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,480
to give us fake news and for what?

491
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,950
Is that really what you believe?

492
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,813
That's exactly it.

493
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,541
It's been proven.

494
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,460
They spent $500 million.

495
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:59,200
It's Eddie put up two
books that I do believe.

496
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,850
So everything that the New York Times,

497
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,900
The Wall Street Journal,

498
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,400
the Economist reports,

499
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,230
not everything.

500
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,020
And what the,

501
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,270
just the agenda.

502
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,550
Just getting me a gen y.

503
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
There's an agenda.

504
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,630
21 is,

505
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,351
I don't Eddie,

506
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,320
but I want you to tell me,

507
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:13,780
you know what the new world order is.

508
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,531
I don't,

509
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,364
but do you know,

510
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,820
of course you don't because you think
people are controlling everything like the

511
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,000
world economy or the oil markets.

512
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,660
How'd you know how oil is priced?

513
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,920
Do you know how oil is priced?

514
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,640
Huh?

515
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:24,971
Okay.

516
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:25,141
It's,

517
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,920
it's an open market commodity.

518
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,150
It's a world commodity,

519
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:28,630
right?

520
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,450
So it really depends on how much
is available in that given day.

521
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,991
So exam,

522
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,070
for an example,

523
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,210
you may have an oil tanker that it's on
its way to a country and then somebody

524
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:41,890
on the market in the market place bids
on that oil and wants that oil and that

525
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,380
ship will turn back around
and go to that market.

526
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:48,790
It all depends on what the marketplace
and what all the different players who

527
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,560
need oil and the amount
of oil that's available,

528
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,670
whether it's crude or raw,

529
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,504
whatever it might be.

530
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,070
It,

531
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,220
there's so many different
factors that go into pricing oil.

532
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,660
Look at what happened,

533
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:04,661
look at what happened when we came up
with ways to shale to to get the the oil

534
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,840
out of the Shales Sands,

535
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,674
right?

536
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,580
Well what happened?

537
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,060
The price of oil went down because the
United States became an exporter of oil.

538
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,570
There was such,

539
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,500
there was an oil glut and that's why
Russia is having a major problem because

540
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,450
they're oil used to be $100 a barrel,

541
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:17,781
what is it,

542
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,460
$47 a barrel or something.

543
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,000
So what I'm saying is that
that's how oil is priced.

544
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
That's helped design.

545
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,521
You're talking about,

546
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:24,930
I know this,

547
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,550
if an organism called the world
economy called the u s economy,

548
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,420
where there are so many different moving
parts and so many different competing

549
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:33,254
interests.

550
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:33,621
So the,

551
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:38,621
say that one group of seven men or
whoever they might be or 21 men controls

552
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:43,070
things is holding the strings
is Hollywood movie stuff.

553
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,870
It would be impossible.

554
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,910
It's hard to control anything.

555
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,140
Even in Washington,

556
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,540
it's such a chaos fuck job.

557
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,140
So when you are so far on
the other Goddamn side,

558
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,243
there's an unknown.

559
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,620
The dudes in the middle there
somewhere we'll rolling.

560
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,020
It's not possible,

561
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:03,380
but I mean people have influenced people
like the people that run the World

562
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,381
Bank,

563
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,880
people that have massive influence
over just enormous sums of money.

564
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,210
Don't you think it's possible they
can have some influence due to the

565
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:12,500
relationships with the shrine?

566
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,650
They all try and they try to
have some [inaudible] at the top,

567
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
but he knows what's going on.

568
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,890
What I'm saying is that it,

569
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,500
again,

570
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,830
they're,

571
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,310
they're competing with each other.

572
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,620
There's so many different competing.

573
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,350
Right.

574
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,400
I mean that's the issue.

575
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,370
The World Bank is a massive bureaucracy.

576
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,100
Uh,

577
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,280
the IMF has a massive bureaucracy.

578
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,530
No,

579
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:31,800
I couldn't,

580
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,780
I completely understand.

581
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,811
I think there,

582
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:37,910
there has to be some sort of
control and manipulation involved.

583
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,140
Well,

584
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,973
let me give you an example.

585
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,700
So let's say let's take the,

586
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,331
let's take the,

587
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,320
let's take the division.

588
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,620
Uh,

589
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,060
let's take the Latin American Bank,

590
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,900
which is,

591
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,733
uh,

592
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,780
I think it's a subsidiary
of the World Bank,

593
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:48,231
I believe.

594
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,500
And I sat next to this guy on the plane
and talked to him and he said that so

595
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:52,370
much of them,

596
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,440
the sort of projects and the money,

597
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,170
what they were there for
was to essentially invest,

598
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:57,950
uh,

599
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,820
give investments.

600
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm sorry,

601
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,960
give money to investments in
the Latin American economy,

602
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,710
uh,

603
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,840
to build up the Latin American
economy in one way or another.

604
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,060
And I'm generalizing,

605
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,930
what happens sometimes is that that bank
no longer becomes necessary because the

606
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,100
economy of Latin America,

607
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:13,791
whatever that country is,

608
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,624
is running on its own.

609
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,460
So now here's a conspiracy for you,

610
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,294
which makes sense.

611
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,710
They go,

612
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,341
but now they go,

613
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:19,611
they go,

614
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,060
well we got 3,500 people
who are working at the bank,

615
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,050
the Latin American Bank.

616
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,100
If there's nothing,

617
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,900
if there's nothing left for them to do,

618
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,840
we've got to come up with something
that for them to do and they might,

619
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,770
they now they have a vested interest in
staying in business because he had 3,500

620
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,350
people whose jobs are at stake now.

621
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:38,930
You can come up with projects
that are fake or you'll like,

622
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
you guys still need us,

623
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:40,341
you know,

624
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,660
because we should do this and that.

625
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,310
That makes sense.

626
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,941
That would be,

627
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,260
if you want to call
that conspiracy theory,

628
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:47,450
I would call that people who are
just want to hold onto their jobs.

629
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,710
And do you come up with reasons to exist?

630
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,630
Do you know what operation mockingbird is?

631
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,320
Cool.

632
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,920
She doesn't.

633
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,990
Of course she don't.

634
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,853
I don't buy

635
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,430
because if you did you wouldn't
be saying all that shit that,

636
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,930
did you hear what I said?

637
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,370
Did I say anything that has any real idea?

638
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,121
What the fuck you said?

639
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:05,780
I wasn't listening to shit knows.

640
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,110
Got a good top game here.

641
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,960
So good fight to the operation.

642
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:10,794
Mockingbird.

643
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,730
You're strong.

644
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,660
Where can I look that up?

645
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,763
Anywhere?

646
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,440
The library but can I,

647
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,720
the fibers are not real
Burberry mockingbird.

648
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,710
So it up to him.

649
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:19,921
Why?

650
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,170
Why do you believe she,

651
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,751
we know.

652
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:25,710
What operation do you believe in all
these conspiracy theories like operation

653
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,553
mockingbird.

654
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,760
Do you believe documentary on
Youtube over the economist?

655
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,331
Why would you believe?

656
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,111
And you don't even know who made it,

657
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,030
but you believe in a documentary versus
talking about some shit you've never

658
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:39,361
seen.

659
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,860
Just because it's on youtube.

660
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,150
It's like it's not real.

661
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:42,984
It's on youtube.

662
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,280
You don't even know what the fuck I'm
talking about about this documentary that

663
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,290
you believe that document.

664
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,600
You don't even know what it is
you believe that has really no.

665
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,170
I'm asking you why you were being seen it.

666
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,850
Why do you believe and
I think people talk.

667
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,321
There's evidence.

668
00:18:58,321 --> 00:18:59,580
I see the evidence.

669
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,660
I don't read about it.

670
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,150
I see him stepping in as
you both have your friends.

671
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,290
We've gotten so crazy here that you
guys are arguing and we haven't even

672
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,270
discussed what this movie's about.

673
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,040
Like it hasn't even been whether or
not it is a operation mockingbird,

674
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,130
whether it was a conspiracy theory
or whether it was a real event.

675
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,430
We didn't even discuss what it is and
you guys are at each other's throats.

676
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,720
It's kind of crazy.

677
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,780
I mean we didn't,

678
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,700
Louie literally didn't even
bring up what the subject is.

679
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,511
And Brian,

680
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,350
you jumped on him?

681
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:29,500
Uh,

682
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,780
no,

683
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,140
no I did not jump box.

684
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,003
Just me sir.

685
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,210
Excuse me sir.

686
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,601
You did.

687
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,520
Because the seat's may
really started talking about,

688
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:35,850
well look,

689
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,070
you can't say it's a real
thing cause the Wikipedia,

690
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,600
it's on the Internet.

691
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,563
Sorry,

692
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,380
you brought a pizza gate.

693
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,860
Fucking

694
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,160
no,

695
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,993
he brought up,

696
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,660
there's no way I was saying please.

697
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,630
I just want to know what pizza gate.

698
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,430
The fucking shit.

699
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,450
I want to talk about it
and I don't want to talk.

700
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,470
He's the guilty and I don't mean

701
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,001
no.

702
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:06,540
Look at him.

703
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,270
He's the one who shared her pizza.

704
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,180
I was fucking interested
then you should bring it up.

705
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,530
Yeah,

706
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,380
you son of a bitch.

707
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,280
You son of a bitch.

708
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,620
You through kindling
talk before he thought,

709
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,480
why don't I think Eddie
brought it up the whole time.

710
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,314
I'm like,

711
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,233
shut.

712
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,480
That sounds interesting.

713
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,800
You had me at pizza gate.

714
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,970
I wanted to know what it was,

715
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,500
but I just wanted to say,

716
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,350
because a lot of people on the Internet
want me to bring that shit up and I'm

717
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:31,740
like,

718
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,090
I really don't want to bring it up.

719
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,070
That's some scary shit when
you really look into it.

720
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,710
Shit that you've never
done when you actually,

721
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,650
we actually look into it doesn't even know

722
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,170
operation mockingbird is a CIA
operation where they were to prevent

723
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,620
and control communism infiltration.

724
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,520
They thought it would be best
to buy up as many different uh,

725
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,443
um,

726
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,110
a broadcasting companies and
they wanted to own the media.

727
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,000
They wanted to magazines,

728
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,990
newspapers,

729
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,000
CNN is part of that shit.

730
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,900
Anderson Cooper is admitted a CIA agent.

731
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,711
He admits it.

732
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:08,951
He goes,

733
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:09,181
yeah,

734
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:09,840
it was in the CIA.

735
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,673
So what

736
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,650
he actually worked for them
like when he was in college.

737
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:15,380
Is that what it was?

738
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,380
It did when you're in your internship
or something like that to go to the CIA

739
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,330
college to be a CIA agent?

740
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,630
No,

741
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,810
no,

742
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:22,990
no.

743
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,000
They make random internationally.

744
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,540
CIA and it's,

745
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,290
Uber is not a CIA agent.

746
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,610
He could look into it.

747
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,410
Guys looking for the CIA.

748
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,440
CIA had had to do some
operation mockingbird.

749
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,790
We're going to control the media.

750
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,320
You buy into the media.

751
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,690
That's why you don't know
about operation mockingbird.

752
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,920
You've been caught

753
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,870
in the media.

754
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,210
They do.

755
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,520
They got you strong song a long time ago.

756
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,480
Metro pro vaccine,

757
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,150
right?

758
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,401
Ah,

759
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,234
yes.

760
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,210
You're anti vaccine all the,

761
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,093
all the way across.

762
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,090
Okay.

763
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,880
Have you not,

764
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,790
not where for smallpox to theory and
measles and all the things and mumps

765
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,640
seems aren't the same.

766
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,960
So when you talk about vaccines,

767
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,831
they're not all the same.

768
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:06,100
True.

769
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,933
Some,

770
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,570
uh,

771
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,700
can be safe and some
can be dangerous school.

772
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,220
That's true.

773
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,561
I can,

774
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:11,051
I can understand.

775
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,160
That's all I'm going to say about that.

776
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,610
That's a reasonable
thing with any of that.

777
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,960
Many doctors agree on that.

778
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,893
Yeah.

779
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,810
You know what happened in 1986 Ronald
Reagan signed a bill that made big Pharma

780
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,920
immune to lawsuits because
big Pharma was about to say,

781
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:28,090
fuck making vaccines.

782
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
Too many people are suing us,

783
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,970
so Ronald Reagan had to come and say,

784
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,140
keep making them all.

785
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:34,490
Make a bill where no one
can see you want to be.

786
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,291
They can't be sued.

787
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:35,561
That didn't,

788
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,400
they can't be sued.

789
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,920
They can't be sued if Pharma
gets sick all the time.

790
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,680
Folks for vaccines,

791
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,783
vaccines,

792
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,200
they can't get sued for vaccines.

793
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,230
If you want to sue anybody for vaccines
or a kid gets fucked up from vaccines,

794
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,820
you go to the vaccine court.

795
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,130
It's a,

796
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,630
it's a,

797
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,330
it's a federal agency where they give out,

798
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,630
I don't know how many fucking buildings
that damn don't have allergic reactions

799
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:58,280
to vaccines of course reactions,

800
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,523
but you can't,

801
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,630
but since 1986 what happened is
since 1986 since big Pharma said,

802
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,170
shit,

803
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,040
we can't get sued.

804
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,290
That's when if you actually look at that,

805
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,700
things are not just go hook polio.

806
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:10,630
What about Polo?

807
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,500
What about smallpox?

808
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,550
When you look at what happened,

809
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,000
they fucking greenlit.

810
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,210
They're like each vaccines
cause you can make truly in dog.

811
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,253
And they went,

812
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,640
so now the kid can bless his shot.

813
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,210
64 it's crazy.

814
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,341
No,

815
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:22,760
no but that,

816
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,300
no,

817
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,630
that's the prize mode.

818
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:24,910
So what?

819
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,320
So so,

820
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,590
so that would make sense.

821
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,371
So if you said to me,

822
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,204
hey bri,

823
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,021
the once,

824
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,230
once the pharmaceutical companies saw
that there was a lot of money in getting

825
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,590
yeah,

826
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,210
preventative vaccines and it goes up
to 64 when it used to be six or 10 or

827
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,050
whatever when I was a kid.

828
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,010
Now,

829
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,843
now you go,

830
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,440
oh well that makes sense.

831
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,610
Because what is big?

832
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,470
What does big Pharma do?

833
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,010
They manipulate the

834
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,431
FDA.

835
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:47,830
They manipulate government.

836
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:48,440
CDC,

837
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,861
yes.

838
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:52,310
They all this so that they write so that
they can be saying something very much

839
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,530
like you can spirit slow

840
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,490
down switch teams

841
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,690
in a CIA operation.

842
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,560
Mockingbird.

843
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,570
It's not conspiracy.

844
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,440
That is,

845
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,390
that makes sense from a
business point of view,

846
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,721
which,

847
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:11,991
which,

848
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,700
which I can understand is insidious.

849
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,380
When you have huge corporations in
cahoots with government can't fucking

850
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,450
vaccines are dangerous and shit,

851
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,090
they don't care.

852
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,930
And we can't get sued.

853
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,330
White tests that green.

854
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,880
They're convincing the sea CDC with money.

855
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey pass this motherfucker.

856
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,500
Really Quaker points for using in
cahoots in a sentence correctly.

857
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,970
5,000 points.

858
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,530
It's just common sense,

859
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,860
common sense.

860
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,090
Really.

861
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,080
They own the media.

862
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,110
You don't think the fucking
people that run shit on the media,

863
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,130
you gotta be an idiot to fucking nothing.

864
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,480
The people that run shit own
the media on entertainment,

865
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,540
on everything we can cousin gangster

866
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,580
shit don't on the fucking
need and you don't own the TV.

867
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,650
Doesn't mean that you can't get credible
information on a lot of topics like the

868
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:01,911
economy,

869
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:02,750
like the war,

870
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,584
whatever it is.

871
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,910
If you know where to look,

872
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:09,140
it doesn't mean you can't get credible
information on the number set of what's

873
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:09,481
going on.

874
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:10,314
And that's what I'm saying.

875
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,830
But Eddie's port Washington Post
is that the control all that,

876
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,090
the main stream media is all controlled.

877
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:20,990
That ain't real shit.

878
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,210
That's all controlled
as part of the agenda.

879
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,550
It's all slowly inch by inch,

880
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,340
take away the guns and that's fucking,

881
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,260
that's control everybody and implode
economies fucking start civil wars.

882
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,100
Like love that chat.

883
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,120
I don't think they liked that.

884
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:40,121
I think that the love that you said
to me that the mainstream media and on

885
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:45,310
whether it's on the right or the left has
agendas and has been corrupted and has

886
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:50,411
allowed their own personal points of
view to infiltrate the news and so report

887
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,020
on fairly and so report in a bias
fashion and the news is no longer,

888
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,260
I said Jack active as
it was or should be now.

889
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,333
Now that makes sense.

890
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,690
If you say for example,

891
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:07,691
that gt or GE owns certain
news organizations and
that's a conflict of it or

892
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:11,930
could be a conflict of interest and we
have to be very careful because they may

893
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,630
not report on ges practices.

894
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,010
If they're irresponsible.

895
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,790
Now I can have a conversation
because that would make sense to me.

896
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,350
That would make sense because,

897
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:21,830
but when you,

898
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,310
when you say that everybody in the
New York Times the Washington Post,

899
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,730
it's a CIA once you know
this is what I'm saying.

900
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,180
There's an operation that the
CIA is not a conspiracy theory,

901
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,420
right?

902
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,710
Operation Mockingbird,

903
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,180
they operation paperclip taken
all the Nazis after World War II,

904
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,640
operation paperclip taking
thousands of Nazi into

905
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,370
the government and creating NASA,

906
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,240
NASA,

907
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,620
Nazi scientists,

908
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,470
and you believe this,

909
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,130
they're masters of propaganda.

910
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,070
The Nazis were masters.

911
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,710
They put out films just to get
people get they just to get people,

912
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,800
the people to get used to killing people.

913
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,270
Like if there were a certain condition,

914
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,630
they put out propaganda films and go watch
this shit of a deranged people on the

915
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,730
street killing people.

916
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,790
People thought they would watch these
news reels and they thought there was

917
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,880
demented people on the
streets killing people.

918
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,780
And that was never happening.

919
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,380
They just wanted the people to
agree that we can kill those people.

920
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:23,120
Right?

921
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,310
Yeah.

922
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,090
Cause they're crazy.

923
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,320
They're no one's killing anybody,

924
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:28,610
but it was all part of
a propaganda gender.

925
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:28,720
Have

926
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,640
a little perspective on that.

927
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,600
So Einstein came from Germany and a lot
of the Jewish scientists and the 30s

928
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,670
when there was this rise of antisemitism,

929
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:36,600
migrated,

930
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,180
immigrated to the United States.

931
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,160
What about the Nazis to the operation?

932
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,620
Paperclip was now,

933
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,600
and then when we realize that the Nazis
were very close to creating a nuclear

934
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:48,811
bomb,

935
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:51,030
that they had some really
amazing scientists.

936
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,351
Well,

937
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:52,540
they were,

938
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,700
they knew a lot of stuff that,

939
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,061
you know what I mean?

940
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:55,590
There was a real scientific tradition.

941
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,050
Remember where,

942
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,560
that's where Einstein
came out of a lot of,

943
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,380
a lot of,

944
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,040
in fact,

945
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,040
the antisemitism that rose up in the
30s is y w a lot of historians have

946
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,310
credited the United StatesStates' ability
to create a nuclear bomb before the

947
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,920
Nazis because of that immigration.

948
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,490
So antisemitism in Germany actually
pushed a lot of these brilliant scientists

949
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,820
toward the UK,

950
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,250
toward the United States.

951
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,150
Didn't a bunch of the Nazi guys go to
a Russia as well go the Russian special

952
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,980
Russia,

953
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,160
half of them went to the state,

954
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,450
probably will probably when Russia took,

955
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,280
took half of Germany,

956
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,030
remember?

957
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,130
So there was east Berlin
and West that was,

958
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:32,400
um,

959
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,911
east Germany,

960
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:33,511
west Germany.

961
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,110
So when they,

962
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,270
when they took his Germany,

963
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,360
nobody's getting out of East Germany.

964
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,500
It was understandably.

965
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:37,771
Look,

966
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,211
if you're,

967
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:39,390
if you're going to be intelligent,

968
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:40,110
pragmatic,

969
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,820
and the war is essentially over right,

970
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,500
it's understandable to want to get
their brightest minds of course,

971
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,370
and bring them over.

972
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,000
Of course,

973
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,110
you've already conquered them,

974
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:49,351
right?

975
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:54,351
This is post World War II till to let
them linger and become used by the

976
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,730
establishment that you just defeated.

977
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,863
That's crazy.

978
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,370
These are super geniuses.

979
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,080
If you're a genius dude,

980
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:01,910
these guys,

981
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,780
but torturing,

982
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,980
experimenting on these physicists,

983
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,080
sociopath.

984
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,060
If we don't listen,

985
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:09,780
we don't know.

986
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,440
We don't know,

987
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,190
but I do know that the Simon Wiesenthal
Center said that if Wernher von Braun,

988
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,150
who was the head of NASA,

989
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,010
they've Wernher von Braun was alive today,

990
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,150
they would prosecute him
for crimes against humanity
because he was instrumental

991
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:23,490
in coming up with weaponry
that killed a lot of,

992
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,300
you know,

993
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,133
the allies.

994
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,771
It was that.

995
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:30,771
It was also that they hung the five SLU
slow as Jews every day in front of his

996
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,190
rocket factory.

997
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,030
Berlin,

998
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,910
the ones who work the same motivations.

999
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,763
Yeah,

1000
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,960
they would hang them.

1001
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,700
These guys remembered these
guys who lived in [inaudible],

1002
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,840
the guys who lived in Miami,

1003
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,460
come on,

1004
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,750
come on,

1005
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,480
hurry in the concentration camps,

1006
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,700
they interviewed him
for this documentary on,

1007
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:52,510
on the moon landings and NASA and all
the scientists stood behind it and they

1008
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,320
were saying like that.

1009
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,210
They would see those guys come in.

1010
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,900
They would see those scientists come
in and they would hang the five slow as

1011
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,760
Jews in front of the building.

1012
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,720
Those are the guys that say the least
of what went on in Nazi Germany.

1013
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,741
I mean,

1014
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,130
who knows?

1015
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,941
We don't know,

1016
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:07,420
man.

1017
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,970
I don't know what.

1018
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,791
When I studied,

1019
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,540
that was my area of focus in my mind.

1020
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:13,120
Straight history majors
and history majors.

1021
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,440
That was my area of focus.

1022
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,070
Not too dry.

1023
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,770
Maybe I'm wrong about
the Nazis and I'm wrong,

1024
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,980
but they seem like they were fucking sick,

1025
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,520
twisted motherfuckers.

1026
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,121
That's what they see,

1027
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:23,954
what they were,

1028
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,963
but maybe they weren't.

1029
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,570
Maybe you're right.

1030
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,470
Maybe we was saying they weren't.

1031
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,740
You were calling him amazing and geniuses.

1032
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:28,970
No,

1033
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,201
no,

1034
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:29,411
no,

1035
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:29,621
no,

1036
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:29,771
no.

1037
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:34,350
We're talking about the
scientists talking about the site,

1038
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,250
like the [inaudible],

1039
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,180
the program programs.

1040
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,660
Hold on it.

1041
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,590
There's different scientists that are
the medical scientist versus different

1042
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,680
scientists that are engineers versus
different scientists that are working

1043
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:48,850
towards nuclear weapons.

1044
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,170
But they were part,

1045
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,680
they were though that,

1046
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,721
no,

1047
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:52,991
Eddie,

1048
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:53,201
Eddie,

1049
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,001
many of the sizes,

1050
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:54,834
which you know,

1051
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,050
and they weren't killed because
they were instrumental date.

1052
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,421
They couldn't,

1053
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:58,181
they were too valuable.

1054
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:58,950
Right.

1055
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,010
NASA is fine.

1056
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,480
So a lot of them are fine.

1057
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:01,800
Well,

1058
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,790
a lot of the inventions that
were made by like the f,

1059
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,990
the hybrid method that was made
by a guy who was a Jewish guy,

1060
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,400
which is a crazy story.

1061
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,010
He also created something
called [inaudible] a,

1062
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,330
which had,

1063
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,570
it was a gas that has a smell added to it.

1064
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:19,030
So it would warn you that
the gas was presence.

1065
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:19,530
And then secondly,

1066
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,650
the night the Nazi.

1067
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:21,151
Exactly.

1068
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:24,220
And the Nazis took it and they
switched to design clon B.

1069
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,520
They took the smell out of it
so that you wouldn't smell it.

1070
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:28,960
And then they use it in the gas chamber.

1071
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:32,950
So this guy who invented the harbor
method where 50% of the nitrogen that's in

1072
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:35,870
most of the human beings on the planet
earth comes from because that's where it,

1073
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:37,420
because nitrogen is how you fertilize.

1074
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,900
He'd create fertilizer and this guy
figured out how to draw nitrogen out from

1075
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:41,291
the atmosphere.

1076
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,700
But this is how complicated he was.

1077
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,130
He's a Jewish guy and he,

1078
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:47,890
while he was like winning the,

1079
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,980
I believe it was a Nobel
prize for the harbor method,

1080
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,180
he was also being wanted
for crimes against humanity
because he figured out how

1081
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,430
to gas people too.

1082
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,610
So this was like one,

1083
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,870
because he was a German patriot.

1084
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,620
I exactly,

1085
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,131
and he was,

1086
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:01,780
there was a war going on and he would,

1087
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,810
they were using gas warfare for
the first time when the allies,

1088
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,730
so the same time that he created this
method that's going to like double the

1089
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:10,750
population of the world,

1090
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,830
like sack a lot of lives,

1091
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,480
people from starvation during the winter.

1092
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,691
Well,

1093
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:17,020
there's so much more food available
now because most people don't know,

1094
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,250
like you gotta throw something
into the ground in order for the,

1095
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,960
the soil to you.

1096
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:23,110
It's supposed to be a cycle.

1097
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,550
Things are supposed to die on it.

1098
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,140
Those things like get absorbed.

1099
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,970
The cert cycle of the soil.

1100
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,860
The soil is nutrient rich,

1101
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,061
powerful,

1102
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,560
healthy plants grow from it,

1103
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,520
but when you just keep putting corn in
the same spot over and over and over

1104
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,060
again,

1105
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,310
you got to throw some shit
into the soil and Fritz

1106
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,390
harbor figured out how to get it out of
the air itself because the air is like

1107
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,950
80% nitrogen.

1108
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,130
You think of the air
as being mostly oxygen,

1109
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,651
you know,

1110
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,500
you think oxygen and carbon dioxide.

1111
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:51,771
No,

1112
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,860
it's mostly nitrogen is.

1113
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,860
That's most of what's it.

1114
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:58,650
So this guy is a revolving line or the
Internet now that was on [inaudible].

1115
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,870
This is just the fact to read
that I saw her radio lab,

1116
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:06,500
but then I've read it all over the
place on the internet or in the library.

1117
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,753
I read on the Internet.

1118
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,330
Fuck,

1119
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,163
that's bullshit.

1120
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,740
Done.

1121
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,100
Anyway,

1122
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,690
this hobble,

1123
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,400
hey man,

1124
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,233
you're

1125
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,630
just think about what I don't
forget about like pumps.

1126
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,660
Making a nonsense for a second.

1127
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,250
Just think about what a genius you have
to be to figure out how to pull nitrogen

1128
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,910
out of the air and put it in the soil
and all of a sudden everything grows

1129
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:26,180
better.

1130
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,990
Smart Dude.

1131
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,750
But what's also amazing is that
how complicated human beings are,

1132
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:32,090
because it raises some
really interesting questions.

1133
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,550
The guy who invents the gas
that was used on the Jews,

1134
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:35,384
his own people,

1135
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,950
however he was,

1136
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,980
he invented chemical weaponry because he
was a German patriot and wanted Germany

1137
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,970
to win World War One and said,

1138
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,410
I have a better way to do this.

1139
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,360
And so you put yourself in his position.

1140
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:47,901
It's a very,

1141
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,590
it's it,

1142
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,570
it raised a lot of difficult questions.

1143
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:50,901
Oh yeah.

1144
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:52,670
Well he was a super complicated person.

1145
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,370
Yes.

1146
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:53,780
But as,

1147
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,740
as are we only,

1148
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,630
and like many geniuses,

1149
00:33:56,631 --> 00:34:01,070
many like really fucking smart people
like that are fucking very complicated.

1150
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:01,520
Why did,

1151
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,181
why did,

1152
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:02,720
uh,

1153
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,190
why didn't the Nazis just shoot the Jews,

1154
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:08,380
like line them up and just shoot?

1155
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:08,990
They did.

1156
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,310
They did a lot of 6 million.

1157
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,810
Why would they bother gas?

1158
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,980
And then they got to drag them out,

1159
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,200
put him in the shower.

1160
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,250
They did a lot of different things.

1161
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,150
Put them in a storm.

1162
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,420
Yeah,

1163
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,720
they did a lot of different [inaudible]
the gas them and then they all die.

1164
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,190
And then who's going to drag them out?

1165
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:22,380
Well,

1166
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,140
if you ever seen drags him out,

1167
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:24,560
you know,

1168
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,430
heavy boy ever happened?

1169
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:26,841
No,

1170
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:27,680
I'm just saying,

1171
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,580
why am I just shoot?

1172
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:29,181
Oh No,

1173
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:30,014
he's saying why?

1174
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,380
I would've thought like
they did shoot him.

1175
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,810
They slid a lot of and
perverted and twisted psychos.

1176
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,970
Exactly.

1177
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,650
Why gas shoot him when they got,

1178
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,900
a lot of times when they gassed him,

1179
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:43,160
they didn't know they
were getting guests to.

1180
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,030
Does that make any sense?

1181
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:44,920
Why not just shoot them,

1182
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:45,951
drag them out.

1183
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,930
So can I like Mexicans
is the way they do it.

1184
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,780
They dig a big ass fucking hall with,

1185
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:49,910
uh,

1186
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,470
with the,

1187
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,690
uh,

1188
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,030
abdominal cocktails and
then they just line them up.

1189
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,260
But you know what they did got to clean
up that they can about that they're

1190
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:56,780
going ahead.

1191
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,690
But they did that in
the Russian countryside.

1192
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:58,870
They do,

1193
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,050
you can see video of it.

1194
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,500
They,

1195
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,580
they dug massive graves and they would,

1196
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,200
they'd make them dig their own graves
and then they would just show him smart.

1197
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,651
But what,

1198
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,960
what happens when they
drag him out of the shower,

1199
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:09,890
when they got chemicals,

1200
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,701
listen,

1201
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,970
what they would do is when they would
bring them on the trains to Auschwitz,

1202
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,760
triplink and Dachau and all
the different death camps,

1203
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,810
they couldn't,

1204
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,980
if they started lining people up,

1205
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:19,814
what would happen?

1206
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,620
Especially women and children hysteria.

1207
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,430
So what they said is they get off the
train after this horrible train ride and

1208
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:25,701
they'd say,

1209
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:26,930
here's a bar of soap.

1210
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,250
You're going to take a shower.

1211
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,430
That they put them all in
tourism and they trick them.

1212
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,510
They'd be in these showers,

1213
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:33,350
quote unquote showers,

1214
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:34,184
but some,

1215
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,361
what's that?

1216
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,040
Some take shower and some would be killed.

1217
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,610
That's right.

1218
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,510
So they didn't know.

1219
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,440
So the strong,

1220
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,430
so they mix it up.

1221
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,480
The ones that look strong,

1222
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:42,751
they could,

1223
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,860
they could use for work,

1224
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,791
they would work.

1225
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:44,901
They,

1226
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:45,240
they,

1227
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,010
and the ones who are
children went right away.

1228
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,090
They don't teach ELA gassing
seems so twisted it in.

1229
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:51,740
So why not just make,

1230
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,120
did a lot of horrible things.

1231
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,550
That's what I'm talking about,

1232
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:55,681
dude.

1233
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,710
No doubts,

1234
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,303
no words you're saying,

1235
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,473
but hold on.

1236
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,520
Gas To kill Jesus.

1237
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:02,770
I'm like,

1238
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,410
but there's a difference between the,

1239
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,400
there's always going to be a difference
between concentration camp guards and

1240
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,400
scientists signed off,

1241
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,090
but that's the same thing as us.

1242
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,130
It's like saying that
you as a martial artist,

1243
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,200
you train people out of fight.

1244
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,830
You probably have some connection with
someone who was a corrections officer.

1245
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,080
It's like it's,

1246
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
you know what I'm saying though?

1247
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,150
You do.

1248
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,940
You know,

1249
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,270
but how much do you have a an effect
of what they do with their life.

1250
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,020
The people who are working in the Er
as a corrections officers are probably,

1251
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,801
or the the,

1252
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:36,150
the guards rather at Auschwitz or
probably so far removed from the fucking

1253
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:36,960
scientists.

1254
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,550
It's not like they all
get together and go,

1255
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,271
we're all evil,

1256
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:39,601
right?

1257
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:39,841
Yeah.

1258
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:41,170
What are you doing today for evil?

1259
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,710
I'm torturing the Jews.

1260
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,193
Evil,

1261
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,400
all of those signs.

1262
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:47,971
A percent.

1263
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:48,960
That's not what I'm saying now.

1264
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm 100% they're all,

1265
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:52,350
anybody who subscribed
to that ideology is evil.

1266
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,520
Cost Eddie.

1267
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,090
Eddie.

1268
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,090
Eddie was just like,

1269
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,550
please no please.

1270
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,040
No,

1271
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,391
no Eddie.

1272
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:57,940
You know what,

1273
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,441
but hold on.

1274
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,700
The scientist didn't have a choice.

1275
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:00,630
They had to work you.

1276
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:00,851
You,

1277
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:01,101
you,

1278
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:02,820
you couldn't say it to the Hitler,

1279
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,960
the Nazi regime.

1280
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,740
Hey guys,

1281
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,900
I'm not going to work on your super bomb.

1282
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,711
Listen man,

1283
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:11,640
when kill you with a white
with a white fucking coat on,

1284
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,810
just in front of a beaker,

1285
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:15,150
like all day those dudes went to twist it.

1286
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,110
A cultish shit.

1287
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,850
So like the ones that brought it in,

1288
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,980
maybe somebody can do it.

1289
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,531
Nazis.

1290
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,430
It was a religion.

1291
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,210
It wasn't just like,

1292
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,930
oh they had a white coat and I got them
a week or two to understand if there was

1293
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:28,530
a lot of people that we're trying to
get rid of dude to want her to fuck.

1294
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,630
But there was people that were trying
to get rid of Hitler that thought he was

1295
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:31,081
crazy.

1296
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,280
There was a lot of that going on too.

1297
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,080
There was failed assassination attempts,

1298
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,840
failed coup attempts
that it wasn't a smooth,

1299
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:38,460
it wasn't like they were all on board.

1300
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:41,610
It's just he had massive amounts of
power and he was a fucking terrifying

1301
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:42,360
individual.

1302
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,130
And he was a dynamic speaker.

1303
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,090
He could get thousands of people's screen.

1304
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,040
Hitler was that people were hurt.

1305
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,770
Have you seen his speeches there?

1306
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,030
So theatrical moments.

1307
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,200
I don't know what the
fuck you say you guys,

1308
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,960
which is,

1309
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,793
I don't know what the fuck.

1310
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,211
No,

1311
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:56,410
no,

1312
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,243
no.

1313
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,980
He was so well spoken.

1314
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,570
I don't know what he was saying.

1315
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,980
I don't know what he was saying.

1316
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,413
I didn't know what he say.

1317
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,000
When you listened to that guy talk.

1318
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,983
He's guys,

1319
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,620
Jamie bringing out whatever he's doing.

1320
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:18,280
Whatever he could,

1321
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,550
Joey did hit that.

1322
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,413
I'm sure.

1323
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,980
I bet he could do Castro Castro.

1324
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:23,814
Yes.

1325
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,770
Hitler wouldn't go over well,

1326
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,401
but guys,

1327
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,310
if you've seen my standup,

1328
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,740
my standup is pretty amazing.

1329
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,891
That fucking guy.

1330
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:32,724
What his limp.

1331
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,063
How's the best?

1332
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,280
I love him cause he only calls,

1333
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,941
I'll never texted him.

1334
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,780
I texted me because he
just did a thing for a CSO.

1335
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,770
He just did this,

1336
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:42,604
um,

1337
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,650
um,

1338
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,620
standup comedy special.

1339
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:45,710
He's fucked for CSO.

1340
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,211
Yeah.

1341
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:46,451
See,

1342
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,350
so where do you shoot it up?

1343
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,070
Uh,

1344
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,420
he shot it in Chicago.

1345
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:49,661
Oh,

1346
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:49,930
no.

1347
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,290
Yeah.

1348
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,101
Outside of,

1349
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:51,934
um,

1350
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,380
the theater we'll just outside of Chicago.

1351
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,570
Rosemont was that is out there.

1352
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:55,911
No,

1353
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:57,640
we weren't even my specials
available on Monday.

1354
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,001
Oh,

1355
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:58,834
Jesus.

1356
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,763
I'll call you.

1357
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,300
Call me.

1358
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,133
Let's do it.

1359
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,580
But you don't know the platform be,

1360
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,211
uh,

1361
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,200
it's going to be on iTunes.

1362
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,120
It'll be on stitcher,

1363
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,963
everything.

1364
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,380
You can buy it Monday.

1365
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,110
No polyps,

1366
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,670
stitcher.

1367
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,570
How's it stitcher?

1368
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,460
I mean,

1369
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,630
that's all I to look at it.

1370
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,583
Stitchers uh,

1371
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,710
for a podcast,

1372
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:14,921
right?

1373
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:16,120
Getting all the info on Monday.

1374
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:16,790
Doesn't know.

1375
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,501
Stitch or people,

1376
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:17,711
look,

1377
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,281
what the fuck,

1378
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:18,551
Bro,

1379
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,110
you bugged what she lived down,

1380
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:20,650
man.

1381
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:20,771
Hey,

1382
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:21,431
what's crime?

1383
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,820
You were always my book.

1384
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:22,970
No,

1385
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,910
you're number four.

1386
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,210
The audio will be slipping,

1387
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:25,540
Bro.

1388
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,900
He audio will be available and I'll tell
you what's really close she made today.

1389
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,070
I want to punch you in the face.

1390
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,160
You fucked up.

1391
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,260
I fucked it up.

1392
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,420
No,

1393
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,161
it'll be on iTunes.

1394
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:34,060
It'll be on Google play.

1395
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,100
I don't think we've made
one comment about the fight.

1396
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,570
Hey,

1397
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:37,871
Jake.

1398
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:38,704
Jake Ellenberger,

1399
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,320
uh,

1400
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Mazda doll.

1401
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,140
That's a very long fucking fight.

1402
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,760
Very good fight tonight.

1403
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:43,601
But,

1404
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:43,900
uh,

1405
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,410
the rugged handsomeness of Brett Farve
just distracted me for a brief moment.

1406
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:47,990
I'm right.

1407
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,560
Better,

1408
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,630
better as he gets older,

1409
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,550
he gives less of fuck.

1410
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,630
You ever seen his dick pic?

1411
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,350
Yes.

1412
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,183
Not Sad.

1413
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,003
Photoshop.

1414
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,730
Hope I wouldn't allow him in the hall of
fame for that came out before the hall

1415
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:05,731
of fame might be an inside joke that
just no one's telling you about Naza

1416
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:05,830
Harari.

1417
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,371
He's a grower,

1418
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,000
not a shower.

1419
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,850
It could be any thoughts on Sun.

1420
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,820
Could it had some fun?

1421
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,440
It might've been part of the inside joke.

1422
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,473
Yup.

1423
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,340
I beat the shit out of it right now.

1424
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,820
Uh,

1425
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,180
Brett,

1426
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,020
he didn't even comment on,

1427
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:18,010
he's just get what can you do?

1428
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:18,551
Yeah.

1429
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,384
That's the way to do it.

1430
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,110
The best way to do it and that the best
way to go scan just probably depends on

1431
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:23,980
what the scandal is.

1432
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,110
If your wiener know Anthony Wiener,

1433
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,120
go ahead and address that shit.

1434
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:27,954
They probably should,

1435
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,700
but sometimes he's just like
half fucking this fucking fight,

1436
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:30,941
man.

1437
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:34,210
Pedes versus hallways going to
pay Max Holloway that today.

1438
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,110
That's next week.

1439
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,621
Hey,

1440
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,560
what happened cowboys?

1441
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:36,880
I,

1442
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,480
is that real?

1443
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,290
No,

1444
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,660
it's not.

1445
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,493
No,

1446
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,530
but you're talking about right.

1447
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,850
So it's salt.

1448
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,050
It's serves its purpose.

1449
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,560
Yeah.

1450
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,460
That's a fun card,

1451
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:45,730
man.

1452
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,563
It's a great car.

1453
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,290
Holloway.

1454
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,220
Nine in a row.

1455
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,210
Fucking Connor had to be like,

1456
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,030
I'm not going.

1457
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,110
They had to strip them of belt.

1458
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,950
Then finally he gets a title shot.

1459
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,630
God Damn it.

1460
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,493
Give the,

1461
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,780
and it's kind of a fake inter
cause they're like shows.

1462
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,830
He's the champ for interim title,

1463
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,940
but he's the chair.

1464
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,090
Why not just give it to them?

1465
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,550
No,

1466
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,911
I know,

1467
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:10,290
but you already have a chance
to fight for their term.

1468
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,830
I like belts.

1469
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,301
Fuck it.

1470
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:12,850
Let's do it.

1471
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,530
If that gets Max or empty pests.

1472
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:14,891
A belt.

1473
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:15,760
Let's fucking ride.

1474
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,470
I feel the same way.

1475
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,370
I feel the same way.

1476
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,570
I like it.

1477
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,680
I like that fight.

1478
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,730
Everyone gets belts.

1479
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,070
The only thing I wonder
about that fight is,

1480
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:24,460
um,

1481
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,460
I wonder how well pedis is body adapted
to one 45 here's the real question is

1482
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:30,730
remembered.

1483
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,870
They weren't the main event.

1484
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,650
Now they are five rounds.

1485
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,400
Now

1486
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,240
we've seen them adapt.

1487
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:35,631
All right.

1488
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,370
With two to three rounds at 45,

1489
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,930
imagine round four and five,

1490
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,860
the championship rounds.

1491
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,930
Now let me ask you this,

1492
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,773
cause he loses weight.

1493
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,080
Is that cardio,

1494
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,851
let me ask you this.

1495
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:44,720
As a guy who you,

1496
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:45,590
have you ever fought five?

1497
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,091
Never fought five?

1498
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:47,630
No.

1499
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,230
Um,

1500
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,063
never fought for title.

1501
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,233
Thanks for bringing that up.

1502
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,680
No.

1503
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,513
Someone I met,

1504
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,393
I know I'm just kidding.

1505
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,040
But do you feel that the,

1506
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,740
those like when you get in
shape to go a hard three,

1507
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,190
how much of a difference is there between
the heart three and the hard five?

1508
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,940
Is it mental like at a
certain point in time,

1509
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,320
how much more training?

1510
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:08,510
Like how much in better
shape could you really get?

1511
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,790
And is it one of these things
where it's just harder?

1512
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,230
It's,

1513
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,460
you've got to be more educated.

1514
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:12,940
The pace.

1515
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,120
Yeah.

1516
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Is it just harder or is it like does it
require more time to prepare for five

1517
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,124
rounds?

1518
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,570
So you get in peak shape,

1519
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,110
no matter shape is peak shape and the
differences between you just having to

1520
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,970
fight 15 minutes in the potential of 25?

1521
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:26,391
Correct.

1522
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:28,820
And that fee didn't use bar
25 minutes all the time.

1523
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,481
All the city.

1524
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:30,670
I usually do have seven rounds.

1525
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:30,780
Yeah.

1526
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,520
But yeah,

1527
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,410
but the uh,

1528
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,570
but the,

1529
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,460
to your point,

1530
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,600
I think it's the pacing in the early
rounds because like take for instance,

1531
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:39,051
Brunson,

1532
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:39,884
Bruce Whittaker,

1533
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,090
when he came out with,

1534
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,301
oh,

1535
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:41,961
he's not fighting,

1536
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:42,920
you go five rounds.

1537
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,230
Like he's just trying to get out of,

1538
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,410
to win and get out because everyone
in the world knows at that level.

1539
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,440
You can't go for five rounds sites.

1540
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,303
Impossible.

1541
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,930
Ben's about to fight.

1542
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,650
Um,

1543
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,560
she feels like glaze and t bow and
you put your hand on her shoulder.

1544
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,880
I mean that in a good way.

1545
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,060
Yeah.

1546
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,590
She's,

1547
00:42:59,590 --> 00:42:59,780
I mean,

1548
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,350
she's such a,

1549
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,600
she's a morph tank she's at,

1550
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,490
I'm a fan of hers girls.

1551
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:05,324
Really strong,

1552
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,340
powerful silver medals in
the Olympics too though.

1553
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,313
I hope

1554
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,650
that she said it.

1555
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,220
She said she's so good at.

1556
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,230
And is there any woman that
you've ever rolled with that,

1557
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,110
that gave you any kind
of fits or any problem?

1558
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,400
Not to be sexist,

1559
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:23,630
but beyond.

1560
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:25,460
I'm sure if I rolled with Gabby Garcia,

1561
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:26,300
she'd fuck me up.

1562
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,583
Big.

1563
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,283
Heavy on you.

1564
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,700
[inaudible] is Davis.

1565
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,531
They're little.

1566
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,210
They're like 125 pounds.

1567
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,050
135

1568
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,520
one 45 hey,

1569
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:42,140
let me queue up the time here so
we'll actually try to wash us.

1570
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:47,141
Four 402440144439 all of the first round.

1571
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,210
It's a Sarah McMahon versus Alexis Davis,

1572
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,961
I think.

1573
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,860
Do you think that that stoppage when she
fought Ronda and gotten hundred percent

1574
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:55,410
legit,

1575
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:00,410
it was Rhonda cracked or the right hand
and cracked or with a knee and then put

1576
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,574
the miniature?

1577
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,013
Yes.

1578
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,100
What effect meant McMahon
develop some serious stand up.

1579
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,840
She does have good standup.

1580
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,610
She just ran into the freight train.

1581
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:11,660
That is Ronda Rousey.

1582
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,120
She also,

1583
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,330
she's a decent fighter round.

1584
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,780
She does a lot of things good all around.

1585
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,240
She just needs to get,

1586
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,260
she has muscular as fuck

1587
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,721
dude.

1588
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:25,520
How much of a bummer that dcs out,

1589
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,830
I guess rumble as,

1590
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,580
is that his knee or what is it?

1591
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,490
You know Alexis surgery to
Alexis Davis beat Amanda Nunez.

1592
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah.

1593
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,550
Way Back in the design.

1594
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,510
She's tough dude,

1595
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,840
but Rhonda just was just too
much for you to be both of them,

1596
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:40,674
right?

1597
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,843
Who else?

1598
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:42,300
Uh,

1599
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,761
Rhonda B.

1600
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:43,531
Both of these girls,

1601
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:43,711
right?

1602
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:43,991
Yes.

1603
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:44,400
Yes,

1604
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,020
yes.

1605
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,330
Yeah.

1606
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,710
Rhonda smushed both of them.

1607
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:47,760
The frustrated both of them.

1608
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:51,210
The smush Merino Sheep Mcmahon with it.

1609
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:51,951
Oh,

1610
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:52,160
that.

1611
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,210
That's a good move with
that elbow right there.

1612
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:54,631
Shit.

1613
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:55,464
That's butch.

1614
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,730
People don't do that enough.

1615
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,390
Look at that.

1616
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,890
Why not just throw those short ELB?

1617
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,320
Ooh,

1618
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,050
that hurts shit going on and
you got to react to it too.

1619
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,120
When they throw up like that.

1620
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:05,471
Edie.

1621
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:06,790
Andy was the first dude.

1622
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,490
Anytime Palae Landy back in the day
in the late nineties and Brazil.

1623
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,433
Oh,

1624
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,040
he would do this all day
on dudes cause her heart.

1625
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,030
She's trapped now.

1626
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,110
Those messages up to,

1627
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,411
yeah.

1628
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:17,900
Instead of her being in good position,

1629
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,541
she's trapped.

1630
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,374
Getting elbowed.

1631
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:19,531
Well,

1632
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:20,610
she's in protection mode.

1633
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:20,881
Eddie,

1634
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:23,910
do you remember Jason Day was like one
of the first guys to figure out how to do

1635
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:24,900
that from the rubber guard?

1636
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,970
Anybody doing this situation right?

1637
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,670
Chuck throwing elbows right now.

1638
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,220
What is she?

1639
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,380
What Sarah McMahon do here
cause she needs to pause.

1640
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,850
She needs to posture up or not punch
because if Alexis Davis really knew how to

1641
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,500
play some high level rubber guard,

1642
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,300
she would never let Sara Mcmann has her
hand on the mat and then have a hat on.

1643
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,460
The chasse had the hand on
the mat at the end of it.

1644
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,510
Once the hands on the map,

1645
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:48,691
boom,

1646
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:49,291
it stays there.

1647
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,970
We're not going back to
check this out though.

1648
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,200
She's about to triangle this bitch.

1649
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,123
Ah Fuck.

1650
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,890
I didn't mean she has a lot of potatoes.

1651
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,563
I started

1652
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,450
about drag.

1653
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,293
I was

1654
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,150
free from Fox.

1655
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,880
You can just let those bitches loose.

1656
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,030
You got them all corralled up
and your brain and come on,

1657
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,190
let the crowd on this side like
when she on her right side,

1658
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:16,230
see where Sarah Mcmahon's right arm is.

1659
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,310
That should never be there.

1660
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,130
When your right arm is pinned to the
ground like that and you have someone with

1661
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:21,180
a strong rubber guard,

1662
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,750
especially someone who has already taken
mission control with that left leg up,

1663
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,880
the first thing to do is to trap that arm.

1664
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:29,280
So once that arm is down
in the ground like that,

1665
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:30,390
you'd never want to give it back.

1666
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,100
And she keeps giving it
back over and over and over.

1667
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,580
There's winning series
winning this round gentlemen.

1668
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:35,780
Yes,

1669
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,151
she is.

1670
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:39,140
But what I'm saying is there's a lot
of opportunities for Alexis Davis offer

1671
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,410
back.

1672
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:39,551
No,

1673
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:44,551
I'm wishing every time Sara McMann puts
her hand onto the the ground like that.

1674
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,960
She's extremely vulnerable

1675
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,710
person with a very good rubber guard.

1676
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,960
As soon as you put your
arm down on the mat,

1677
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,180
they're going to immediately
over hook that arm,

1678
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,170
try to trap it in place,

1679
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,670
and then try to go to mission control.

1680
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,260
She achieved mission control.

1681
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,900
She just didn't exactly know
what to do once you got there.

1682
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,760
So she didn't try to progress any further.

1683
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,230
And then there was a the punches.

1684
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,353
But she,

1685
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:08,761
first of all,

1686
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,140
if you just want to elbow someone,

1687
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,630
if you watched the Allen
Day are Alan Belcher.

1688
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,830
Jason Day fight.

1689
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,390
Jason Day was a,

1690
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:19,410
you know he beat Alan Belcher
really early on when belt,

1691
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,830
you know I'm belches of fantastic
fighter and he's since then

1692
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:24,850
he,

1693
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,850
Paul Harvey said his only crime game went
leg lock with a the position and beat

1694
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:30,820
the shit out of him.

1695
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,770
I love out so it's not,

1696
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,880
it's not a dis on Alan Belcher.

1697
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:34,451
I love that dude.

1698
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,260
But Jason Day showed how effective that
position could be in holding that spot

1699
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,880
and blasting elbows in place.

1700
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,720
So there's a lot of people that use
like the first couple of steps of the

1701
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,530
position,

1702
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,770
but they don't know high
level shit from then out.

1703
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,300
It's a long process.

1704
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,480
It's like I try to shoot doubles but
you don't really practice wrestling

1705
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,320
position kind of.

1706
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:53,801
You know what I mean?

1707
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:54,311
It's like okay,

1708
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,610
I see you're trying to shoot a doubled.

1709
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,091
Whoa,

1710
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:58,780
look at that.

1711
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,750
She was in a good position and she's
so close to finishing this fight.

1712
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,300
Look at this.

1713
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,100
So close.

1714
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,933
She's got shot.

1715
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:04,883
She shouldn't hit her.

1716
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,190
She should cinch it up cause hitting.

1717
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:08,110
There's going to bash her out and she

1718
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,540
knows she needs to pull that leg over.

1719
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,580
She's got to scoot that punchy off.

1720
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:16,151
Don't tap.

1721
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:17,110
You've got 10 seconds.

1722
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,480
The left light has got to be close with

1723
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,060
coach Cheryl.

1724
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,821
Oh Man.

1725
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:25,511
That was phenomenal.

1726
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:28,300
Alexis Davis got a lot
of potential offer back.

1727
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:30,220
She can be as fucking assassin.

1728
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,980
She should should've finished that.

1729
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:33,814
That was nasty.

1730
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,330
That was nasty smell.

1731
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,880
Mcmahon's what level you are with it?

1732
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,220
Like my high level rubber guard players.

1733
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,730
They wouldn't last one
like 30 seconds there.

1734
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:43,550
They were really rat.

1735
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:44,820
That would have all just been a wrap.

1736
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,360
You're saying pure Jujitsu guys?

1737
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,470
Pure Jujitsu.

1738
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:47,790
Yes.

1739
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:47,980
Pure.

1740
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,550
Just gut.

1741
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,820
When punches with punches it doesn't,

1742
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,690
it didn't even matter what the punches.

1743
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:53,524
We'll make it easier.

1744
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,040
The punches make it easier when
the way you stopped Robert.

1745
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:57,910
Gard don't punch.

1746
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,290
That's live.

1747
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,950
You wrote cop elbows you
in the fucking murder.

1748
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:02,410
Then you,

1749
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,160
then you don't have,

1750
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,240
then you're not in rubber guard.

1751
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:04,501
Bang.

1752
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:05,334
You're not in a rubber room.

1753
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,540
You can't get elbowed in rubber,

1754
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,380
so you get elbowed

1755
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:10,690
me.

1756
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,940
Talk to get a guy in rubber guard
if he's aware of rubber guard.

1757
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:13,270
Yes.

1758
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,860
And then the mayor saying once,

1759
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:15,061
not,

1760
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:15,190
uh,

1761
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,023
not really.

1762
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,133
Not really.

1763
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,610
I mean there's counters,

1764
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,451
but then you know,

1765
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,350
you just keep playing the game.

1766
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,960
It's like saying,

1767
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,520
uh,

1768
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,760
if you try to throw that head
kick due to get out of the way,

1769
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,420
right?

1770
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:25,781
Yeah.

1771
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:26,441
They'll get out of the way.

1772
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,270
But you still fucking,

1773
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,330
there's ways to set it up.

1774
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:28,691
Yeah.

1775
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:29,524
You sent it out.

1776
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,500
It's the same.

1777
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,750
Exactly the same.

1778
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:33,010
I do trust it.

1779
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,870
I got guys all they play as rubber guard
and high level guys come through all

1780
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:38,830
the time and I see it,

1781
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:39,664
I witness it.

1782
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,350
I'm looking at him like I,

1783
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,490
that's all I play.

1784
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,323
Oh No,

1785
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:43,630
no.

1786
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,090
You go home the rabbit hole.

1787
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,760
You're Trump.

1788
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,350
I wouldn't be a cray.

1789
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:52,060
Imagine how crazy I would be pushing or
some shit that I don't even apply to.

1790
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:52,690
M good leg.

1791
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,360
How crazy,

1792
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,193
man.

1793
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,160
It just takes a lot of time.

1794
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,590
This is a hell of a scram.

1795
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,440
Beautiful takedown.

1796
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,431
Syracuse.

1797
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:04,264
Yeah,

1798
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,190
100% he invented it.

1799
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:10,560
He named it the whole deal and it
was all that's innovative guys.

1800
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,240
There were some guys that did some,

1801
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,690
some interesting guards in the past and
there was a Nieto Schembri had a lot of

1802
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,524
really cool stuff,

1803
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,330
but what Eddie did was he put together
a system and especially a system that's

1804
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,460
really effective Nogi and named it.

1805
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,030
Yeah,

1806
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,691
well he's,

1807
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:26,111
he's,

1808
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:28,190
and then he came out with the
Eddie Bravo and invitational,

1809
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,380
which I've heard you guys say is
way more exciting to last night.

1810
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,130
Did you watch it?

1811
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:31,371
No,

1812
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:31,760
but they,

1813
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,593
but guy here,

1814
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,850
I like CBI here.

1815
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:39,240
Are we doing one Saturday Eddie and
that on it invitational this Saturday.

1816
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:39,590
Eddie,

1817
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,890
look at this total potential
electric chair position.

1818
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:44,031
Shouldn't look.

1819
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:44,291
She goes,

1820
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:44,561
no,

1821
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:45,394
she was,

1822
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,840
she was in a position where
she could have totally done it.

1823
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,750
Sarah gets serious.

1824
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,440
She keeps gaze is ridiculous,

1825
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:51,651
man.

1826
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,960
Being an Olympic level wrestler,

1827
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,590
that's tougher to deal with.

1828
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,360
What Sara McMann needs to do is three,

1829
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:58,460
her right knee and then
go to three quarter mount.

1830
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,620
That's all she's got to do.

1831
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,860
That's the Damien Maia route.

1832
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,200
If she's Damien Maia.

1833
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:05,060
Something else got really good control.

1834
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,380
Have you ever wrote with Damien?

1835
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,363
Nope.

1836
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,990
He'd probably fucked me up.

1837
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,580
Always bigger than you.

1838
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:10,911
Well,

1839
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:11,744
he's just,

1840
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,620
he sold like he's a man.

1841
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,050
You know what I've loved
about what he does.

1842
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:15,381
It's like,

1843
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:16,730
so it's so old school,

1844
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,211
but yeah,

1845
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:18,440
it doesn't look like he's doing much,

1846
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:19,660
but he's on top of you back

1847
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,420
cutting right through all your bullshit.

1848
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,520
Jibber Jabber.

1849
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,380
He's just cut through all your bullshit
and putting the smashed out on.

1850
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah.

1851
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,380
When you watch the really high level,

1852
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,980
high level wrestlers,

1853
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:36,890
it's the same thing that do things to
pants and do an arm drag single legs,

1854
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,600
but they're so flawless with it.

1855
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:38,991
Well,

1856
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,610
you know when he did it to Carlos Condit,

1857
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:40,970
I was,

1858
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,440
I just was shaking my head like,

1859
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,890
God damn everyone.

1860
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,260
Oh look at this man with the arm trial,

1861
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:49,310
but she's still in the guard.

1862
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,440
She's trapped into half guard.

1863
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,270
It would be over here with

1864
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,643
this half guard.

1865
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,161
You don't really need,

1866
00:51:58,161 --> 00:51:59,140
she could take her time here.

1867
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,030
She could just wear out right here and
eventually pulled out right in the out.

1868
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:02,360
Yeah.

1869
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,380
Just go to three quarter mile.

1870
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,223
You don't know what else.

1871
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,770
You didn't don't really even need a mouse.

1872
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:09,290
She knows what's up.

1873
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,123
She's like,

1874
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:12,561
oh,

1875
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,640
it's just an empty rifle.

1876
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,023
She would've just

1877
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,980
held onto her leg.

1878
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,993
She would have been fine.

1879
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,170
Like man,

1880
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:30,741
her handle,

1881
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:31,990
she turned into the truck.

1882
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:33,120
You Go away from that.

1883
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,860
Just say this,

1884
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,150
Sarah McMahon is the master of a side
show cause it wasn't about just choking.

1885
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,280
It was the 17 steps before that out.

1886
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:42,230
She set it all up,

1887
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,981
man.

1888
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:44,110
She was on that dimension.

1889
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,920
She's a fucking horse.

1890
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,593
She gets it.

1891
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,411
She gets it.

1892
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:49,490
She got the chopping block.

1893
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,890
You can't go horse.

1894
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,240
He's a horse to it.

1895
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,991
Fuck if he,

1896
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:00,830
if he got that and you,

1897
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:02,480
and he was fucking crabs.

1898
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:03,350
Dale crushed,

1899
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:03,681
crushed.

1900
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,341
You're fucking,

1901
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:07,970
you guys want to see grappling
and it's like what it looks like.

1902
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,930
Literally he's titles.

1903
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,140
Cael Sanderson's gold medal match,

1904
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,430
I think against this Korean guy.

1905
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,050
Watch what he looks like.

1906
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:16,850
He's like going for a walk in the park,

1907
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:19,910
like he's doing ankle picks and weird
shit where it looks like he's literally

1908
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:20,900
kind of like,

1909
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:21,500
you know,

1910
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,480
kind of moving at half
speed marijuana's yes.

1911
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,040
Oil

1912
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,060
Ramiro beat Cael Sanderson twice,

1913
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:29,941
twice.

1914
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,160
That's how scary dude freak athlete

1915
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,280
chances in that fight.

1916
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,213
She should.

1917
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:39,710
She should.

1918
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,400
She held that aunt.

1919
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,361
She slept.

1920
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:46,320
She turns it into it like I
to the leg and it was done.

1921
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:46,771
Hold on.

1922
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,604
Look at Eddie.

1923
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:48,990
Let me know if I'm wrong here.

1924
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,400
Hold on the leg and turn
away from the church.

1925
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,190
It doesn't matter at that point.

1926
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:54,930
You're just like that
until they let go the book.

1927
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,920
Soon as they let go of that grip,

1928
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,520
hold on to her leg.

1929
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,281
She held on her,

1930
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,114
her on

1931
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,101
the arm.

1932
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:03,300
That's in the choke.

1933
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,750
You don't want it like this.

1934
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,760
Want it like this.

1935
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,070
If it's like this elbow here,

1936
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,030
you're Gotcha.

1937
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,080
If you're like this,

1938
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:10,621
you're choked.

1939
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:12,870
So we want to do this.

1940
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:13,350
Keeps it here.

1941
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,071
Holding her own leg.

1942
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:14,840
You're like this.

1943
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,210
Oh.

1944
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,290
If someone does that,

1945
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,640
do you go to the impaler?

1946
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,630
If they tried that,

1947
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,970
that defense you tried
to go knee to chest?

1948
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,020
I never,

1949
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,890
I always do.

1950
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,120
I'm trying was from the mount.

1951
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,700
I never let them have the
opportunity to grab their leg.

1952
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,810
You just take it right from the mouth.

1953
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,300
I never even leave them out
because if I leave them out,

1954
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:30,901
they're going to do that.

1955
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,471
If you know that,

1956
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:32,640
and if you know that defense,

1957
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,170
if you know that defense,

1958
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,000
it stops all arm triangle.

1959
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,140
But from the impaler I
remember trying that defense.

1960
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,200
That's mount,

1961
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,410
that's kind of a mountain he shored up.

1962
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:44,190
That knee is going to
be in the way of this,

1963
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:44,581
right?

1964
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,560
But you can push that motherfucker out.

1965
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,000
So really the best thing
to do is just do a,

1966
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,560
um,

1967
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,660
a amount worth,

1968
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,690
kind of like me on the belly,

1969
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:53,190
but your knees on the ground,

1970
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:54,240
so it's like a deep,

1971
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,080
and he on the belly,

1972
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,910
that's the best spot right there.

1973
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,600
There's no defects which
needs in the ground.

1974
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,380
Say if you're on less on the belly,

1975
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:01,740
right.

1976
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,210
Same side that she just got right.

1977
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:03,590
Okay.

1978
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,800
So it'd be your left knee on her belly.

1979
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,190
Okay.

1980
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,390
But instead of having the neat,

1981
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:07,260
actually on the belly,

1982
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:08,670
it's actually all the way through.

1983
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,470
It's like your Shin across the stomach.

1984
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:11,281
Knee,

1985
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:14,670
really heavy on the map because if you
had your knee on your belly and they knew

1986
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:15,420
the defense,

1987
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,050
they would fucking pop that motherfucker
up and grab their leg and now they're

1988
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:19,440
good.

1989
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,730
And I see you have the left knee on the
right side of their body and the Shin

1990
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:24,570
across the top.

1991
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,060
So there's no way they could graduate.

1992
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,210
This is more of a mouse.

1993
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,020
It's more of a mouse.

1994
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:28,810
You might as well not,

1995
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,890
but that is actually
better than a mountain.

1996
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,760
Well I know when you would do it,

1997
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,250
a lot of times you would do it
and we would call the impaler.

1998
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,240
Do you still do that?

1999
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,030
No,

2000
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,910
I don't even need it.

2001
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,860
That's terrifying because
they stopped doing it.

2002
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,330
It was horrific.

2003
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:43,080
It was just there.

2004
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,771
It's always there.

2005
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:44,610
It's a need to,

2006
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:48,600
the right to the sternum is just a
massive pressure at the side choke.

2007
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,690
So you put the shy side choke in
and then the knees on the sternum.

2008
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,440
The sternum neck.

2009
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:56,541
Both,

2010
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:57,720
but I mean it doesn't work on everybody,

2011
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,690
but that's the best way
to stop that defense.

2012
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,650
Where you grabbing the leg?

2013
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,030
For me it was always the impaler,

2014
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:03,671
the impaler.

2015
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:03,731
Oh,

2016
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:07,260
we stopped that because you wanted so
bad to get that knee off your chest.

2017
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,080
You were willing to let your legs go.

2018
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:13,480
Just try to push that knee aside and
then just fall right into the church.

2019
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:14,400
I don't,

2020
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,870
I only go to the impaler when the regular
shit ain't working and he's got like a

2021
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,490
little angle has got a little spot.

2022
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,110
It's not lined up perfect.

2023
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,320
So now we go,

2024
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:23,741
fuck it.

2025
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:23,980
Let's

2026
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,220
just hold this and drive
the knee right in his neck.

2027
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,750
And that's usually what makes him tap.

2028
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,291
Dude,

2029
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:32,770
you did the impaler on me one time and
I really thought my chest was gonna

2030
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,633
crack.

2031
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,650
I thought my sternum was going to crash.

2032
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,310
Jesus.

2033
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,120
It's a terrible feeling because like
someone's cranking down in your neck,

2034
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,380
you got a head and arm trapped in there,

2035
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:41,830
right?

2036
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,390
You're the arm choke in there and then
they got their neat on your shift.

2037
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,470
It's just shit.

2038
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:48,790
Eddie,

2039
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,460
how long ago was we
wrestled for a restaurant?

2040
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:51,340
I see years.

2041
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,121
Just two years.

2042
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:53,200
But you were going to suck.

2043
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,400
Really terrible.

2044
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,830
I got one take them two years.

2045
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,910
When did you realize that when
you started rolling and Jujitsu,

2046
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,190
when did you one realize this
was it like you want to do it?

2047
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:03,930
That's true.

2048
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:04,930
That's what I did learn.

2049
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:07,780
I did learn the twister that which
is actually the rest of the wrestlers

2050
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:08,614
guillotine.

2051
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,660
Oh you weren't laughing
about my shitty wrestling.

2052
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:10,940
No,

2053
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,840
I was one take down in two years.

2054
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:14,783
It was after that,

2055
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,860
but I didn't get shit out
of take downs or anything.

2056
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:21,310
I was actually pretty good at arm drags
but you know they say it's like a bike.

2057
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,960
I think after like 30 years,

2058
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,160
it's not like a bike no more.

2059
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,060
You've got to start all over.

2060
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:28,420
Your body completely forgot it and you
are a fucking white belt because I suck

2061
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:29,700
at arm drags but I,

2062
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,150
I in high school that was my shit.

2063
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,330
But what was also my shit was I was a leg
rider cause it was weak and I at crave

2064
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,540
while everybody was supposed
to be lifting weights,

2065
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,780
I was on the side of the
fucking the building just like,

2066
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,373
like

2067
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,900
so I to be a leg rider,

2068
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:46,270
they every wrestling
team at three leg riding.

2069
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,460
All my wrestling my whole life.

2070
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:49,090
I never,

2071
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,040
I never once threw legs in.

2072
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,050
I don't know why people are so good.

2073
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:53,150
No,

2074
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:53,981
most people don't.

2075
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:57,270
There's only like three per class
and I was one of those guys.

2076
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:57,941
It was the week guys.

2077
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,410
They just started podcasts.

2078
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,053
Nico,

2079
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,350
Nico,

2080
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,430
Chia was the guy who show up on Twitter.

2081
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,280
I forget his last as first
name something Nicco Chia.

2082
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:12,890
Fuck.

2083
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,540
Cause he's only showed me the twister.

2084
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:17,501
I got a question.

2085
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:17,710
Right.

2086
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,940
What do you think's next for your boy,

2087
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:19,774
Tony?

2088
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,250
Alex Nicco Chia.

2089
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,310
That guy is the guy who
taught shut up to Algebra.

2090
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:24,880
Yeah,

2091
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,760
that's what I'm trying to do.

2092
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:26,770
A shout out to Alex.

2093
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,633
Alex,

2094
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,960
you showed it to me.

2095
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,940
Alex Nica Chair should
be a fucking tee shirt,

2096
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:31,721
but he's still alive.

2097
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:32,350
Right?

2098
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,030
He's still your positive.

2099
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:34,864
Juliana.

2100
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,990
46 [inaudible] 80

2101
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,860
the guy was in 11th grade
and I was in ninth Oh,

2102
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,300
Gotcha.

2103
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,930
I thought he was the coach Jesse Barrios.

2104
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:45,500
He was the only other leg Raj Shadow.

2105
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:46,960
So that was a twist to that.

2106
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,170
I learned the twister in high school
and then when I went to Jiu Jitsu,

2107
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:50,441
I was like,

2108
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:50,950
shit,

2109
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,530
I already got it and a one move.

2110
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,600
So I might take down suck,

2111
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,560
but I got one move,

2112
00:58:56,561 --> 00:59:01,390
which I couldn't fucking do it on Jujitsu
players because in wrestling you could

2113
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:03,280
do it because you give up backs.

2114
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,630
You know when you give up a back,

2115
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:05,650
you stick a leg hook in.

2116
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,221
It's really easy.

2117
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:07,054
But in Jujitsu,

2118
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,670
giving the back is the ultimate sin.

2119
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,421
So it was like,

2120
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:10,631
damn,

2121
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:10,751
what?

2122
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:12,280
No one's even giving
me their fucking back.

2123
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:13,960
How am I going to do this?

2124
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,661
Only the,

2125
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:18,850
the only move I know in grappling and
then so slowly I had to figure out how to

2126
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,130
get to the wrestlers guillotine,

2127
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,430
which later became the twister
because Hagen and John jock named it.

2128
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,340
That shit I didn't

2129
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,980
out truck was your original teacher,

2130
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:31,310
right?

2131
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:31,910
Yes.

2132
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,450
Yes.

2133
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,170
What a great guy.

2134
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:33,451
John.

2135
00:59:33,451 --> 00:59:33,680
John,

2136
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,300
is this a promotion
for these two fighting?

2137
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:36,021
What's going on right now?

2138
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:36,860
I can't hear shit.

2139
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,960
It seems like it's a two below gets the
title now because he wanted the interim

2140
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:46,961
title with Frankie and now they're
showing pedis highlights the showtime kick

2141
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,371
and it's a little weird.

2142
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:50,091
He's fighting for a title.

2143
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:50,341
Yeah.

2144
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:51,800
Cause he's lost two of those last three.

2145
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,360
Um,

2146
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:53,750
what,

2147
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,890
what happened in his last fight?

2148
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:55,700
He Won.

2149
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,870
He beat who did he beat?

2150
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,370
Olivera right.

2151
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,540
That's right.

2152
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,373
He submitted him.

2153
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,130
Yep.

2154
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,600
And before that he lost.

2155
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:03,411
Look,

2156
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:05,710
he's still Anthony
motherfucking pedis dude.

2157
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,531
He was still,

2158
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:08,880
I love the summer.

2159
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,370
You're gonna win some doesn't mean like,

2160
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:10,551
oh,

2161
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:11,300
it's over for him.

2162
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:11,510
Like he's,

2163
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,343
he just got fired.

2164
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,181
No one saying it's over.

2165
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,330
I'm saying it's a little strange
that he's getting a title shot.

2166
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,140
That's what I'm saying.

2167
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,140
My question to life now at
four 45 is fucking Stan.

2168
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:24,920
Anthony Pettis was the 55 champ.

2169
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,470
It was cancer two years ago.

2170
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:28,400
45.

2171
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:28,791
It's like,

2172
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,001
yeah,

2173
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,620
he's going to be right there in the mix.

2174
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,521
That's my momma,

2175
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:31,701
man.

2176
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,400
That's Anthony fucking pen for
45 it's always one nightmare.

2177
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:34,671
Okay,

2178
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:38,960
well Max all we won nine in a row and
he's just getting a title shot and is true

2179
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,180
fan the UFC just,

2180
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,870
you know that it's a good point.

2181
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,850
I'm just saying that I love Andrew,

2182
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,370
but it's one of my
favorite people in the UFC.

2183
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,810
I'm scared of what's going on with,

2184
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,860
I'm scared of,

2185
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,920
of the direction that UFC is
going for some reason should be

2186
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,200
all of us.

2187
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,120
It used to be that it was Dana,

2188
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:56,751
the end,

2189
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:58,220
the Renzo and frank was right there,

2190
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,070
but it was like you had
faced whatever like you need,

2191
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,760
you could actually get to
them and like make a change.

2192
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,593
Like if something,

2193
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,850
it was like doing the
right thing for the sport.

2194
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:09,110
It was all about every buns.

2195
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,831
We're all here,

2196
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:10,670
we're working together,

2197
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,350
we're doing the right thing for the sport,

2198
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,550
the right rules for the sport.

2199
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,210
We're trying to make it
right and now to this,

2200
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,890
those guys don't even fucking own the UFM.

2201
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,330
I said,

2202
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,470
who is it?

2203
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,420
That shit when you start looking at owns
when you still faceless famous people,

2204
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,440
you six hours,

2205
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,630
seven basically not faceless.

2206
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:29,931
There's,

2207
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:31,190
there's already a manual gate.

2208
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,060
Dana White,

2209
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,170
Conan O'brien.

2210
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:33,600
There's a few,

2211
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,020
it's a few celebrities in particular.

2212
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,280
I met Ari,

2213
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,900
I've talked to Orange is a very nice guy.

2214
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,340
I'm sure he is very smart guy.

2215
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,213
He listens.

2216
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:41,871
He's,

2217
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:43,040
he's really wants to,

2218
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:43,701
that's good to hear.

2219
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,700
He wants to do the best
thing they can cause poor.

2220
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,460
Who knows what kind of changes they'll
make once they settle in and get a get

2221
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:49,530
it.

2222
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,160
But these guys are masters
of entertainment business.

2223
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:53,240
They know how to handle things,

2224
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,190
but the fans of the sport but also it,

2225
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,800
and for it on the fighter's side,

2226
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:58,940
that mixed martial arts,

2227
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,450
uh,

2228
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,740
athletes association is the first time
where it's like a serious issue for them

2229
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:04,330
to address.

2230
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,061
Let me ask you this,

2231
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:08,150
how many different unions are there?

2232
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,140
I heard there's more than,

2233
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:09,820
I'm not sure about.

2234
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,611
I tell you this or that,

2235
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:14,030
that it's a mixed martial
arts athlete's Association,

2236
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,250
which I'm part of.

2237
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,790
Tim Kennedy is,

2238
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,340
was there.

2239
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,620
So there's four board members,

2240
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:19,830
right,

2241
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,041
right.

2242
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,090
And they just announced it.

2243
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,860
They have over 200 fighters
right now on board with it.

2244
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,020
So first like legit movement of it.

2245
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,240
Now what does that entail?

2246
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,650
Like when you're on board.

2247
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,520
So that means like if
you go to fight for uh,

2248
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:36,321
you know you have a,

2249
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:37,650
a UFC fight coming up.

2250
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,480
Like how does that or a bell tore,

2251
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:39,721
right.

2252
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:40,411
Cause it's for everything,

2253
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:40,770
right?

2254
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:41,640
It's for everything.

2255
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,470
It's just for,

2256
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,420
it's for any organization
that's mainly made up.

2257
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:46,290
Especially right now,

2258
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,520
major UFC player.

2259
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,510
She was a good question.

2260
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:50,940
Does that hold true for like
rises and stuff like that?

2261
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,140
Like what about um,

2262
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:53,700
if you fight overseas,

2263
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,713
I'm not sure.

2264
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,060
So the idea is,

2265
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:56,210
you know,

2266
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,290
their focus is UFC cause the top dog,

2267
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,300
so if you start at the top
is going to trickle down.

2268
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,360
So the idea is that they're going to have
a like a set a set amount of money or

2269
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,830
we're going to make per fight,

2270
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:08,860
correct.

2271
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,693
Basic basically.

2272
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,690
And they're modeling
after it after the base,

2273
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:13,201
while union,

2274
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:17,070
which is like the best in the world as
far as compensation and equal rights.

2275
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,640
Good stuff.

2276
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,420
This is good stuff.

2277
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,140
Great stuff.

2278
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,770
Oh Shit.

2279
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:19,920
Okay.

2280
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,290
Is there an essential,

2281
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,130
is there any potential?

2282
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,461
Yeah,

2283
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:25,080
well a bunch of UFC fighters,

2284
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,520
which is Tim Kennedy,

2285
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,450
Donald Cerrone,

2286
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:28,284
which is a big one.

2287
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,123
GSP.

2288
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:33,360
Tj Dillashaw was really weird
with Tim Kennedy said love.

2289
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,080
You hear what Tim Kennedy said about
beyond those and he was like a necessary

2290
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:37,470
evil.

2291
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:37,710
He's,

2292
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,730
he's basically like the,

2293
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,150
the WHO.

2294
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,300
Who's your boy from Nalco?

2295
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:40,870
Not your boy.

2296
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:41,730
He found me on the show.

2297
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,820
Victor Conte from Victor Conte was on
the dark side and then he came out.

2298
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:46,530
It was like,

2299
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,080
I know how this shit works
now for the good guys.

2300
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:50,370
I'm gonna tell you what
they're trying to do.

2301
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:50,601
Right.

2302
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:51,510
That's what Bjorn is doing.

2303
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,381
He's like,

2304
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:53,280
when they say this,

2305
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,690
this is what he means by this.

2306
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,230
Wow.

2307
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,850
Well you know who the fuck knows.

2308
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:58,680
Cause I suspect when I
saw Bjorn I was like,

2309
01:03:58,681 --> 01:03:59,131
I can't be,

2310
01:03:59,131 --> 01:03:59,430
you know,

2311
01:03:59,430 --> 01:03:59,790
you know,

2312
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,720
I've heard stories about something
like I don't want to be part a.

2313
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,120
And then when I talked to Tim Kennedy,

2314
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,280
that mother Fucker talk me
in to run through a wall.

2315
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,220
Who's taken my goal in one spot

2316
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,800
is not Mike Goldberg is not
part of the MMA association.

2317
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:17,911
There's rumors.

2318
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:18,331
He was,

2319
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:19,141
he's not that.

2320
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:20,550
That'd be kind of conflict of interest,

2321
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,800
but the thing is is about Bill Goldberg.

2322
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,390
Yeah,

2323
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,730
the dude's familiar with the rest.

2324
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,310
No.

2325
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,260
Whoopi Goldberg like we all hire you

2326
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,920
over and made a come back,

2327
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:32,500
man.

2328
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:32,720
Yeah,

2329
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,140
he thought he played in the NFL,

2330
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:34,974
which I didn't know.

2331
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,510
He's a guy called the Goldberg.

2332
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,390
He's a giant dude.

2333
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:39,000
You're on it.

2334
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,940
You're on the Goldbergs.

2335
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,220
Yes,

2336
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:40,770
I am.

2337
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,020
That's the one where you're like a coach.

2338
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,830
You're a coach.

2339
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:44,690
I'm not only my coast,

2340
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,670
but they're doing a spinoff
on ABC as the character.

2341
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,390
Holy Shit.

2342
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:49,224
It's kind of exciting.

2343
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,220
It's cool.

2344
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,371
Yeah.

2345
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,180
That's awesome dude.

2346
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:51,961
It's about time.

2347
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:52,141
Dude.

2348
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:53,130
You're a funny motherfucker.

2349
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,750
You may be lost in politics.

2350
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,100
I'll never forget that
new year's fucking me,

2351
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,993

2354
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,360

2356
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,500
I heard you laughing from the wings.

2357
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,300

2360
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:12,830

My favorite place to play.

2364
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,441
And you go there,

2365
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:18,340

2366
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,630
I don't go there nearly enough.

2367
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:20,470
I go there once here.

2368
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,240
That's wish I could go.

2369
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,520
Yeah.

2370
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,630
And I love it so much.

2371
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,660
We're going to bring the
fighter and the kid there.

2372
01:05:23,661 --> 01:05:24,600
We have to cause that.

2373
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,810
Is that in Florida or fucking savage?

2374
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,071
Greatest.

2375
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:32,230
My greatest shows her at
the Fort Lauderdale Improv.

2376
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,640
How Beach Florida this weekend.

2377
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,980
Florida people are savage.

2378
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:36,311
Eddie.

2379
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:37,160
I can hear you laughing.

2380
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:37,931
It was so great.

2381
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:38,131

2382
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:42,490

2383
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:43,324
wings.

2384
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,343
It was beautiful.

2385
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,521
Let's be a fun one.

2386
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:46,780
Are you guys doing some kind of new,

2387
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:49,930

2388
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:51,311
Oh,

2389
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:51,900
you know what I did?

2390
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,280

2391
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,990
Uh,

2392
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,040

2393
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:54,370

2394
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,390
Tony and Joey Diaz.

2395
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,760
Tony just started his podcast.

2396
01:05:56,761 --> 01:06:00,520
I was his first guest yesterday at
the comedy store called the Pony Hour.

2397
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,383
I named it.

2398
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,493
That's perfect.

2399
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:02,850
He was like,

2400
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:03,521
I don't have a name.

2401
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:03,791

2402
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,091

2405
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,150

2406
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,830

2408
01:06:16,781 --> 01:06:20,200

2409
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:21,034

2410
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,300
that's the one that came to me with.

2411
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,163

Where's this?

2419
01:06:34,601 --> 01:06:35,820

2420
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,180

Excuse me sir.

2429
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:52,781
No,

2430
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:54,880
I'm just saying the Orpheum
when I was there for Eddie,

2431
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:56,500
I didn't know it sat that many people.

2432
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,280
Pretty sure cause we were down on the
front of them and it looked all right.

2433
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,240
No,

2434
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:00,640
no,

2435
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:00,941
no.

2436
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:02,940
19 I think it's 18 or 19

2437
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,020
something like lead or man,

2438
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,030
that's one of those places
where you look at it and you go,

2439
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:11,920
Whoa,

2440
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,350
when Steve First asked
me to do Ebi is there,

2441
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,740
cause we were doing it with the floor
king gardens initially at the in

2442
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:18,574
Hollywood.

2443
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,350
I W I looked at the website,

2444
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:20,680
I'm like,

2445
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,131
Oh man,

2446
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:22,950
this guy does and he obviously
doesn't know what you do.

2447
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:26,230
You ever see this is
too classy for Jujitsu.

2448
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,760
We're dirty motherfuckers.

2449
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,850
So I just turned it
down and then he again,

2450
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:31,210
it said,

2451
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,560
just come down and check it out.

2452
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:32,960
And I'm like,

2453
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,461
okay.

2454
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:33,910
I went down,

2455
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,290
checked it.

2456
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:34,900
I'm like,

2457
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,351
dude,

2458
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,990
this is like you do like
the Oscars and shit here.

2459
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,340
Why would you want Jujitsu?

2460
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,050
But he's so into Jujitsu.

2461
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,480
The guy that owns Orpheum,

2462
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:44,530
he's dude,

2463
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:44,651
man,

2464
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:48,700
he's doing privates with
Capella and he's so he competes.

2465
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:51,570
He's 65 and his complaints
a strong motherfucker.

2466
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,410
That's such an awesome guy.

2467
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,150
And he do when we show up and
he's got his Ebi shirt on,

2468
01:07:58,151 --> 01:07:59,500
he's got his 10 plan a shirt on.

2469
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,420
The guy who owns that whole
fucking thing loves Ebi.

2470
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:05,260
Like he seemed like a super talk to him.

2471
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,141
He's a super fan.

2472
01:08:06,141 --> 01:08:08,710
So when they brought to me
the options of places to go,

2473
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:09,790
that was one of the first ones.

2474
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:10,121
I was like,

2475
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:10,391
yeah,

2476
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:11,224
I love that place.

2477
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,530
You want to be in La Joe?

2478
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,190
1987

2479
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,603
New Jersey.

2480
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,750
What date does that fall on?

2481
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,593
On a Thursday.

2482
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:20,810
I think it's Saturday.

2483
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:21,850
Jamie.

2484
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:22,130
Yeah,

2485
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:26,570
Saturday night on a Saturday night because
there's a UFC on Friday because UFC

2486
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:28,190
didn't want to come to New Year's Eve.

2487
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,660
So that's the Ronda Rousey.

2488
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:30,800
Amanda Nunez fight.

2489
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:31,341
Oh,

2490
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:31,940
Shannon.

2491
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,910
Max Holloway and Pedis.

2492
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,540
That's next week.

2493
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,403
That's next week.

2494
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,853
No one's here to fight.

2495
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,010
It's not Max Holloway.

2496
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:41,000
When,

2497
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,833
when is that fight?

2498
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,681
Max Holloway.

2499
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:44,240
And Anthea pest is December 10th.

2500
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,580
What does the other fight next week?

2501
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:47,414
What does the other fight?

2502
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:47,900
Uh,

2503
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,020
the other fight is a cowboy Cerrone now.

2504
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:51,861
That's right,

2505
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,130
Matt Brown map out.

2506
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:53,650
Okay.

2507
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:57,170
See I have those both in like
the same level of expectation.

2508
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,890
I just don't have the answer.

2509
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,370
I look at Pettis Holloway
and then I'm looking at,

2510
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,204
uh,

2511
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,691
look,

2512
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:04,610
I think Matt Brown,

2513
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:05,900
it's always death.

2514
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,250
It's always destruction.

2515
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:07,990
It's always hell.

2516
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,380
You know,

2517
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,280
training together.

2518
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,740
They've trained together at muscle.

2519
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,440
Well how was that?

2520
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,850
Give us insight

2521
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:17,990
whenever they tell me

2522
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:20,390
don't,

2523
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,980
don't do that.

2524
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:21,813
But listen,

2525
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,680
I mean everybody knows I'm
a big Matt Brown fat boy.

2526
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:25,450
He's a killer.

2527
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:29,060
How boy at one 70 is a
video game character.

2528
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:29,601
Oh,

2529
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:30,434
he's a video game.

2530
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,240
Character works people.

2531
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,074
I'm training.

2532
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,011
He smirks.

2533
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:37,310
He's doing something different now because
he's not fucking his body up to make

2534
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:40,070
one 55 we're seeing 100% cowboy.

2535
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,151
He's got so much.

2536
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:45,050
Don't give a fucking him that to take a
guy like that and like extract all the

2537
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:47,480
water out of his body and
drained them and deplete him.

2538
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,720
You deplete some of that spirit
that makes him exceptional.

2539
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,890
When that guy is healthy,

2540
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:55,610
it's like a lot of what I call it
carries into the octagon with him.

2541
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,150
It's like this zest for life and
it comes out when he's fighting.

2542
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:04,280
You know like that gets depleted
when you bodies look at common fact.

2543
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,440
How good to kind of look at 55 insane.

2544
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:07,400
We should fights.

2545
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,971
I believe so.

2546
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:08,800
It's like cheese,

2547
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,400
except obviously way too much.

2548
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,110
He should five.

2549
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,361
You're like,

2550
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:12,530
Holy Shit.

2551
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,930
He should have Aldo come up
to you and can't see shit.

2552
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,270
Let's just get this done.

2553
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,160
All those set that it goes.

2554
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:23,700
Let me beat the winter of Max
and in pedes I'll win that belt.

2555
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,490
I'm coming at 55 he should.

2556
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,240
I'd love to.

2557
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:26,710
Well,

2558
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,330
but the beach in 19 seconds.

2559
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,223
Let me rematch,

2560
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:30,840
Nate.

2561
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,030
Oh,

2562
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,500
I might fight Josie.

2563
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,310
Doesn't he have a motherfucker of a time?

2564
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,510
55 this guy's got tits.

2565
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,680
He's cute.

2566
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,940
Joe Say's had some real issues and get

2567
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,790
the whole campaign with Cisse.

2568
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,310
Now God damn you

2569
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,040
walk right up to that guy.

2570
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,690
Throat famous fighter.

2571
01:10:58,960 --> 01:10:59,870
He's going to be a star.

2572
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,933
What is he up?

2573
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,090
He scared fucking scares in this country.

2574
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,440
What if he just gets
knocked out at vicious head?

2575
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:10,540
Kicked in five seconds.

2576
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,031
Let me see.

2577
01:11:11,031 --> 01:11:12,200
I got to sit on your lap for this dude.

2578
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:12,411
Yeah,

2579
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:13,244
I'm scared,

2580
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,220
dude.

2581
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,480
He's got some tech path.

2582
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:17,323
Nema.

2583
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,890
That's a bitch ass shit.

2584
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,080
Why can't do that after
you do the other thing?

2585
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,060
Definitely kid,

2586
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:24,870
he's going to get lit up.

2587
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,170
Powerful Rico.

2588
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:27,751
Michael Clarke,

2589
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:28,584
Duncan.

2590
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,940
Hey Man,

2591
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,890
he does look like a good uppercut.

2592
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,221
Oh,

2593
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,240
he's not fucking around.

2594
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:37,650
He's already hurt throat slash and
not fucking come out of booming.

2595
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:38,341
Oh,

2596
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:39,630
what if he gets knocked out though?

2597
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,460
[inaudible] then he will
never do this ever again.

2598
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,890
He made us play mean.

2599
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,540
It's a psychological good move,

2600
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,101
but it's,

2601
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,030
it's kind of negated by the fist bump.

2602
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,340
The fist bump brings a
confidence level back up.

2603
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,173
A solid shirt.

2604
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,670
Well,

2605
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,850
cannoneer is got to get over it.

2606
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:54,451
The God factor,

2607
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:56,430
the guy's face looks so
intimidating and once he does,

2608
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,264
he's going to win.

2609
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,080
Yeah,

2610
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,441
Brian,

2611
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:00,000
I don't think he's looking
at his face anymore.

2612
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,320
Now they touch gloves again.

2613
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,780
There's a lot of unity
going on the ship and,

2614
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:08,080
and he's going to touch with the right
hand that's going to favor cannoneer

2615
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,870
keeps his hands down.

2616
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:10,141
Guys.

2617
01:12:10,141 --> 01:12:10,590
It's about,

2618
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,341
it's about fundamentals.

2619
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:11,881
I've always told you,

2620
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:12,360
you guys,

2621
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,800
it's about fundamentals.

2622
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,990
I believe I've heard that from you.

2623
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,610
That's something you really do.

2624
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:18,600
This guy's an animal.

2625
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,900
I do recreational boxing and
I'm a blue belt in Jujitsu.

2626
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,180
You know my problems.

2627
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,930
My problem lately with the MMA is
that I've been watching too much.

2628
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,340
Moitai oh,

2629
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:29,970
watching.

2630
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,770
I've been watching a ton of Moitai lately.

2631
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,210
You're a stickler for technique.

2632
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:33,481
Well,

2633
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:34,110
it's just,

2634
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:38,680
I just recognize there's another
level to be achieved that you're,

2635
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:39,720
you're seeing like,

2636
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,260
especially with striking
with a lot of guys,

2637
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,370
you're seeing like a certain level of
technique well on a consistent basis

2638
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:47,880
because it's,

2639
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,590
they have to concentrate
a lot of different things.

2640
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:49,861
Yeah,

2641
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:50,191
I know,

2642
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:51,024
I understand that.

2643
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:56,070
But it's hard when you have a
few guys that have achieved like,

2644
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,520
like this Rory Macdonald's
sort of spectrum and they
can kind of do everything

2645
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:01,590
really good at a very high level.

2646
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:04,660
Like you remember when Roy McDonald
fought JT tourism metamorris yeah.

2647
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,020
Tinchy towards very
high level Jujitsu guy.

2648
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,131
Roy Hung out with them,

2649
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:09,060
almost got Kimora,

2650
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:10,000
didn't tap holes.

2651
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,801
Got his arm broke.

2652
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:11,280
Yeah.

2653
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,850
But ultimately went to a draw,

2654
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,621
like fight.

2655
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:13,880
Uh,

2656
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,280
um,

2657
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,113
what's his name?

2658
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,430
The guy that the really
high level French striker,

2659
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:18,180
um,

2660
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:18,580
uh,

2661
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,530
tarkes avatars half.

2662
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,100
Yes.

2663
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,450
And he came up with a
whole different style.

2664
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:25,680
I was watching shows like Joe is it
about the evolution of the sport?

2665
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:29,040
Like Roy started MMA when he was 12 MMA.

2666
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,780
He didn't specialize in anything.

2667
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,950
So you're going to see like,

2668
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:33,480
you look at fucking homeboy,

2669
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,320
uh,

2670
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,750
what's his name with the spiky here,

2671
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:37,560
it looks like a more

2672
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:39,720
Northcutt.

2673
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,020
He's also a kid who started,

2674
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,210
so you're going to get this wave
of guys who just do wellness.

2675
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:49,250
Sage started with karate and he's way
more of a karate guy that needs a Jujitsu

2676
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:49,651
guy.

2677
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:52,500
It's not that he's not
better at Jujitsu now.

2678
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,890
I mean he definitely showed that in his
last fight and he submitted guys in the

2679
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:56,341
past.

2680
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:56,521
He,

2681
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:57,810
he's just a young kid.

2682
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,130
Yes.

2683
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:58,963
Fruits,

2684
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,230
genetically fantastic athlete.

2685
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,310
Who's a young kid who's got a lot of
life to learn guard against Micky Gall.

2686
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:08,290
When the fuck is you saying rip
that Apple and that's a barn burner.

2687
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,143
When is that?

2688
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:10,180
When is that?

2689
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,013
Ah,

2690
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,261
no.

2691
01:14:11,261 --> 01:14:12,480
That fight is somewhere else.

2692
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:13,930
Am I wrong?

2693
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,860
I feel like that fights.

2694
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,740
Sage Northcutt is a fun fight.

2695
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,480
I feel like that fight is somewhere else.

2696
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,340
Mickey calls him fucking get
C's in my car is a motherfucker.

2697
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,380
It's very good.

2698
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,960
I think he's more talented
than sage Northcutt.

2699
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,261
Oh,

2700
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,700
I think he's extremely talented and
I love how many calls the guys out.

2701
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,250
Big Kid,

2702
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,610
but we've seen two real good fights
from mum and of course one of them was

2703
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:34,444
against.

2704
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,171
Oh there it is,

2705
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:35,560
right?

2706
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,770
There's Saturday the 17th UFC fight night.

2707
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:39,604
Two cans.

2708
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:42,100
Michelle Waterson boys.

2709
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,140
I'm not going to be here
for you all in Japan too.

2710
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:46,750
How dare you can damage your eye a favor.

2711
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,790
This is the problem with having family.

2712
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,650
Where are you going man?

2713
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,993
Where are you headed?

2714
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,590
Just go.

2715
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,300
I go on a lot of vacation shirt done.

2716
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,960
I wish I could try to.

2717
01:14:58,961 --> 01:14:59,800
I want to just,

2718
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,591
this is I'm,

2719
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:01,331
I'm in the,

2720
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,640
I just want to live life phase of my life.

2721
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,320
I just want to experience
that I'm not good at vacation.

2722
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,450
I want to go places.

2723
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,320
I want to experience things.

2724
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,131
I get better all the time.

2725
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:09,780
You know what helps me?

2726
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:10,613
Edibles,

2727
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,190
boy.

2728
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,240
Really Knowledge.

2729
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,433
Boy,

2730
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:15,670
you got it.

2731
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,420
But you know the certain
place where you can get them.

2732
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:18,970
Don't bring them though.

2733
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,090
They're pretty easy to get.

2734
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:21,280
Don't bring him.

2735
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,020
Definitely not worth it.

2736
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,810
I put my paper everywhere when we do
like should I bring him everywhere?

2737
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,120
Amin,

2738
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,900
Tsa,

2739
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,050
we're homies mean TSA or cools.

2740
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,480
Fuck how I asked Brian
and a few years pass.

2741
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:38,750
What's up in a few years there's going
to be places where they have like the

2742
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:41,350
spots where you could
vape up at the airport.

2743
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,500
Well like to have wine bars
right next to those will.

2744
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:45,550
There'll be counselors,

2745
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,900
therapists,

2746
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,640
and just start fucking crying
and thinking about their dad.

2747
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:56,620
Oh Shit.

2748
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,690
I just use it to calm down
and turned my brain off.

2749
01:15:58,691 --> 01:15:59,190
I can't do it.

2750
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,460
I don't do it during the day.

2751
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,290
This dude is heavily muscled.

2752
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,071
Which guy?

2753
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:03,904
The black guy.

2754
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,893
White Fella.

2755
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,141
Yeah.

2756
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:05,870
You're looking too much.

2757
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:08,030
The white guy built better black guys.

2758
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,140
Jack,

2759
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:09,940
Jack,

2760
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,420
Jack,

2761
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:11,020
fine,

2762
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,820
but I just like the white guy.

2763
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,410
White Guy can identify with them.

2764
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:14,620
No,

2765
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:14,860
look,

2766
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,641
they're both Jack.

2767
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:16,960
They're both jacked,

2768
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,180
but that was a confused opening.

2769
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,250
We're going to talk to
that guy about strategy.

2770
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,240
Do we really do?

2771
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,010
Don't ever fuck them.

2772
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:26,530
They went a slash and I
was all just for place.

2773
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,551
Let's touch gloves.

2774
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:28,390
Let's be friends.

2775
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,050
Yeah.

2776
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,800
Unless you're the mother fucker of
motherfuckers and it doesn't matter.

2777
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,010
Right?

2778
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,390
You come out and Conor Mcgregor,

2779
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:36,070
I'm with a straight left
and just put them away.

2780
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,371
He didn't.

2781
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:38,010
It doesn't matter if
you touch gloves degree.

2782
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:43,140
Do you remember when Conor Mcgregor talked
a freight train full of shit against

2783
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:48,190
Dennis Seaver and then beat his ass
beat when they got into the octagon?

2784
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,090
Before the fight,

2785
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,040
he read to shake hands with Dennis.

2786
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,610
Even Dennis Eve or
wouldn't put his hand out.

2787
01:16:52,611 --> 01:16:53,290
He goes,

2788
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,123
fuck you.

2789
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,720
And then he went out merch dumb.

2790
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,050
You can't do that to CBRE.

2791
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,770
Cbre was in their lights.

2792
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,760
Only had that spinning back
kick in his wheel house.

2793
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,693
I understand,

2794
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,800
but you know,

2795
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,100
then the CBREs like I'm from

2796
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,641
Germany,

2797
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:11,570
you fuck,

2798
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,040
we're not having this.

2799
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:15,180
And then the Scot model.

2800
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:16,783
Wow.

2801
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,520
The world is a better place
because a condom McGregor,

2802
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,120
100% how about he got his boxing license,

2803
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,960
Joe Boxing license.

2804
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:24,870
Do you see that?

2805
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:25,703
Yeah.

2806
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,660
Do you see what he said?

2807
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,380
Did you see,

2808
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,990
did you see Oscar de
la Hoya drunk as fuck?

2809
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,070
Talking about

2810
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:34,640
this corner,

2811
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,690
that corner he was talking
about Conor McGregor fight.

2812
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,771
Canelo Alvarez.

2813
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:41,210
I love Oscar silver up,

2814
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,180
but on my giant too.

2815
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:46,010
People forget how fucking talented the

2816
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,200
fight at the forum.

2817
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:49,760
Yo,

2818
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,100
you ever see them fight the
first round when he lit up,

2819
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:52,491
Julio,

2820
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:53,480
Cesar Chavez,

2821
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,081
I said,

2822
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:55,880
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.

2823
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,910
That boys legit time.

2824
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,393
I was talking,

2825
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:04,920
I saw that close circuit TV at the
La where the clippers used to play.

2826
01:18:04,921 --> 01:18:05,271
What was that?

2827
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,140
Not the La Forum,

2828
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:06,974
but the La,

2829
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,930
the Great Western Forum
and all his La arena loss.

2830
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,660
Sandra fucking the clippers arena.

2831
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,020
They had closed circuit.

2832
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,490
Remember these?

2833
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:13,941
They do that.

2834
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:16,910
You'd go to an arena and watch
the screens of the boxing.

2835
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:20,960
I was a big Oscar fan of
big Julio Cesar Chavez Fan.

2836
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:21,973
I was torn.

2837
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:24,410
I had to go with the one
who was more Mexican.

2838
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,453
I had to go.

2839
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,391
He didn't stick.

2840
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,190
You know what the mix is a real Mexicans.

2841
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:29,024
He like,

2842
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,250
Yo can't even speak English.

2843
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,350
[inaudible]

2844
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,820
listen to this for say I go with him.

2845
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,240
I'm going to tell you how
legit Oscar de la Hoya is.

2846
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,450
He fought Julio,

2847
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:41,690
Cesar Chavez and Bernard Hopkins.

2848
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,260
What's that?

2849
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,450
Manny Pacquiao and may pack.

2850
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:45,290
You'll be went all the way.

2851
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:47,870
The fuck up and sugar
Shane all do and sugar.

2852
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:50,240
Shane went to Bernard hub.

2853
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:51,930
What the fuck is [inaudible]?

2854
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:55,010
Who was the 175 counties?

2855
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,560
World champions.

2856
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:57,740
You went up to him.

2857
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:58,250
John,

2858
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,600
his fight with Fernando Vargas.

2859
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,213
Boy,

2860
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:07,540
a lot of shit talked before that fight
to the public can do to and doing.

2861
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,383
Very good.

2862
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:08,961
Hey,

2863
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,040
ask your boy your boy hush.

2864
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:11,480
Hush.

2865
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:11,811
Hush,

2866
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:11,991
hush.

2867
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:12,720
I'm all that.

2868
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,020
That's your boy hockey about,

2869
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,111
no,

2870
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:18,050
I'm just saying it's
hush hush upon all that.

2871
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:22,890
Amen.

2872
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:23,120
Yeah.

2873
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:23,481
Listen,

2874
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:24,140
people have fun.

2875
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:24,741
Let's protect it.

2876
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:25,390
Oscar.

2877
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,150
I hate,

2878
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,740
I love Oscar.

2879
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,790
He got punched him sprawl hard.

2880
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:39,791
Elbows on top shouldn't
get just a good fire.

2881
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:44,570
What's really cool about MMA is that
you can't really be the very best at

2882
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,350
everything.

2883
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:48,650
You could be the best to put it all
together for your specific body.

2884
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:51,290
You bring the best at handling
pressure in your division,

2885
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,780
but you can't be the best Jujitsu guy.

2886
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:55,940
The best kickbox are the best wrestler.

2887
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,693
You don't have time.

2888
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,510
So many super athletes out there that
it's almost impossible for one person to

2889
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:03,770
be the very best at everything.

2890
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:07,950
That's one of the things that makes
MMA so exciting is because you see this

2891
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,900
collision of different strategies and
you'll see one strategy work for a long

2892
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:13,501
time and you go,

2893
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:13,681
hey,

2894
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:15,150
ground and pound is where it's at.

2895
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,000
I remember when Vitor Belfort got up to
240 pounds because that was the mother

2896
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:24,030
fucking Mark Coleman era who turns wine
on was for a little while while he was,

2897
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:25,111
but see,

2898
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:25,771
this is what happened.

2899
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:30,771
That's what you get was just tackling
dudes and smashing their fucking faces and

2900
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:32,490
everybody panicked.

2901
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:33,510
Do you remember when you interviewed?

2902
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:34,344
He was

2903
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,860
interviewed him one time and this
was like literally 1516 years ago,

2904
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,310
joined and Marco's Joba.

2905
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:44,080
So what's your strategy and Mark Marcus,

2906
01:20:44,081 --> 01:20:45,160
I'm going to beat the
fucking shit out of him.

2907
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,541
No,

2908
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:45,681
no,

2909
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:45,871
no,

2910
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:46,111
no,

2911
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:46,260
no,

2912
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,471
no,

2913
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:46,780
no.

2914
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,010
He,

2915
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:47,850
he was drunk,

2916
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,860
but first of all that's scared.

2917
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:51,030
I'd never seen you get scared,

2918
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,330
but I love mark and mark and I
had been friends for a long time.

2919
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:55,200
So even though I was scared,

2920
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,880
I was reasonably sure he
wasn't going to hurt me.

2921
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,610
But he picked me up like a pillow.

2922
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:04,680
Like I was a pillow and he spun
me around the hair long ago.

2923
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,003
Maybe a day,

2924
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,260
maybe a day.

2925
01:21:08,261 --> 01:21:08,610
A day.

2926
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,030
Dude,

2927
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,200
he's so strong.

2928
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,280
I remember you said to me,

2929
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:12,601
you were stammering.

2930
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:12,960
You Go,

2931
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,411
hey man,

2932
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:14,430
I was fucking scared.

2933
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,073
He's so strong.

2934
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,730
He's like,

2935
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,060
I felt like I've never felt lighter.

2936
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,143
I was like,

2937
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,230
I'm going to pick them up,

2938
01:21:22,231 --> 01:21:23,490
throw them around and
beat the fucking shit.

2939
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:23,751
I didn't know.

2940
01:21:23,751 --> 01:21:24,050
He goes,

2941
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:24,883
he goes,

2942
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,680
who's,

2943
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,461
I'm taking him down.

2944
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:28,500
I'm going to ground down
the fucking shit out of him.

2945
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,111
I was like,

2946
01:21:29,111 --> 01:21:29,944
Oh shit.

2947
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,470
I was asking him about him
coming and you stammered.

2948
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:35,940
I to forget,

2949
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:39,000
I'll never forget when I met
him the first time I met him,

2950
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,660
it was after he got beat
by Maurice Maurice Smith.

2951
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:43,770
And if you were a member,

2952
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,100
he was supposed to crush Maurice Smith.

2953
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,960
Kickboxers coming very well.

2954
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,020
And at that point striking
was useless at that point,

2955
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,250
striking was useless.

2956
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,800
And Mark Coleman emerge after hoists.

2957
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,750
So here comes Maury Smith,

2958
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:58,291
the striker,

2959
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,220
he don't know any digits.

2960
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,100
You don't know Russell,

2961
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,990
he's going to get fucked up.

2962
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:02,760
But he beat him on cardio.

2963
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,281
Right?

2964
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:05,840
Cause remember Mark Homey like
taking them down leg kicks.

2965
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:11,850
He got also give credit to frank shamrock
cause frank shamrock worked a lot with

2966
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,170
Maury Smith before that fight.

2967
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:16,560
And one of the things they developed
as a really good butterfly guard for

2968
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:17,220
Maurice.

2969
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,750
Maurice kept elevating marks.

2970
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:20,070
Hips kept moving around a lot,

2971
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,380
a very hard guard to pass.

2972
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:24,770
Very Good Smith,

2973
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,151
Maurice Smith.

2974
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:31,050
What Maurice Smith had been most guys
didn't happen in the early days is you

2975
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:32,130
couldn't pass his guard.

2976
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,940
He had a very good butterfly garden.

2977
01:22:34,941 --> 01:22:38,430
He know how to retail and use
Lothrop done shit back in the day.

2978
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,240
So,

2979
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,850
so uh,

2980
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,070
Marc Coleman kept taking him down at
will but he couldn't finish him off.

2981
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:44,700
He didn't have any.

2982
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,600
Here's another point.

2983
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,800
He was in his late guy.

2984
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,580
His Fun.

2985
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,413
I love Maurice.

2986
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,620
Cause another important,

2987
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:51,840
very important point if you are,

2988
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:56,030
if you are a an outstanding
world class kickboxer like his,

2989
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:00,240
he is the same principles of defense
apply on the ground with ground and pound.

2990
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,980
It's harder to move your head backwards,

2991
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:02,340
right?

2992
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:07,340
But a guy like that is significantly
harder to hit than a guy who's not used to

2993
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:08,350
taking punches.

2994
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:08,711
Sure.

2995
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:10,930
Front of someone just turned
on many and freezes up.

2996
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,720
So when he sees these
big bombs come coming,

2997
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,070
he's doing a lot of this.

2998
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:15,250
Yeah,

2999
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,150
he's grabbing you.

3000
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,073
He's,

3001
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,760
he's not going to sit there.

3002
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,550
And of course there are
guys that are overwhelming.

3003
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:22,390
There's guys like,

3004
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:26,530
like I keep bringing up cro cop versus
Gonzaga cause the second fight with cro

3005
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:28,660
cop got revenge when he
got on top of Gonzaga.

3006
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:28,871
I'm like,

3007
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:31,900
when you see a world class striker,

3008
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,240
drop elbows on your head from the guard.

3009
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,530
He doesn't need to be in the mount.

3010
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:38,260
He doesn't need to be inside control.

3011
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:43,380
Cro Cop just needs that amount of space
and he is opening your head like a

3012
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,550
fucking coke and shatter my nose.

3013
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:46,510
Oh dude,

3014
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:47,291
it's so,

3015
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,610
so impressed by that elbow.

3016
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:49,570
He dropped down Gonzaga.

3017
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:49,811
I'm like,

3018
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:50,171
see,

3019
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:50,921
I knew it.

3020
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:51,670
I knew it.

3021
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:56,280
If you could get an Ernesto hoost on top
of you on your mountain of devastation

3022
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,390
on top of that,

3023
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,200
he was the strongest guy you'd ever,

3024
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,560
you don't Mirko was supposed to
fight Wanderlei soon in rising.

3025
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,160
I thought Mirko No.

3026
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:06,810
Vandelay to violate for no.

3027
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:07,661
I don't know why.

3028
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:08,141
I Dunno why,

3029
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:11,740
but Mirko was saying all kinds
of crazy shit about who knows.

3030
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:12,574
He might get an injured,

3031
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,151
I don't know.

3032
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:13,940
Let me fuck no.

3033
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,570
Let me finish my Maurice smart goes.

3034
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,320
I would love to see so camp back then,

3035
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:17,770
by the way,

3036
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,603
Mark Coleman,

3037
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:20,080
so in her house,

3038
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,630
logs on your back,

3039
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,493
running up hills,

3040
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,900
fucking each other up
when Mari Smith Five.

3041
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:26,320
Dot.

3042
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,250
Mark Coleman,

3043
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:30,970
his pre fight footage was
hidden running upstairs.

3044
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,180
It was either that fighters fight
with Ken and Sylvia Sylvia era,

3045
01:24:34,181 --> 01:24:35,890
but I remember him,

3046
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,040
he interviewed a,

3047
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:38,181
Hi,

3048
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:38,831
I'm Maurice Stans.

3049
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:39,880
I've been kickboxing intended,

3050
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:40,720
I'm a world champion.

3051
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:45,100
And then show him like running upstairs
and shit and like a football stadium.

3052
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:49,330
That was his B roll and that's
how he beat Mark Coleman.

3053
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,520
And he beat him on and you
know he'd beat them on car.

3054
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:54,610
Mark Coleman was fucking
holding his knees.

3055
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:56,470
He was like bent over and,

3056
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,130
and Mari Smith's just start a fucking
leg kicking him and beating the shit out

3057
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:00,964
of his legs.

3058
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,350
But let me tell you this,

3059
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:05,770
Maurice Smith was probably the first guy
to ever talks shit in the middle of a

3060
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:06,970
world championship fight.

3061
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,300
This is back when I was
the post fight interviewer.

3062
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:13,811
He was going,

3063
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:15,400
come on mark grunted pump me mark.

3064
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:15,911
Come on.

3065
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:20,911
Mark [inaudible],

3066
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,540
Mark Growney,

3067
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,530
he'll forget Maury Smith
was every bit of 230 pounds.

3068
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:27,880
Maurice,

3069
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,770
since it was the first guy to incorporate,

3070
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:30,011
like,

3071
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:33,850
like first got incorporate high kick
in like a world championship fight.

3072
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:35,080
When he fought Conan and era.

3073
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,381
Yes,

3074
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,950
he fought Kona and Sylvia
and world extreme cage fight.

3075
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:39,380
I remember that shit he hits,

3076
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,600
that was back when John Perretti
was the interview was the,

3077
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:44,620
he was doing my job.

3078
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:48,400
John Perretti shout out to John
Perretti should love John Jansen.

3079
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:51,550
Adversial I love that guys commentary.

3080
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,490
Always loved his coffee
shop ready with the stunts.

3081
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,541
Shout out to him.

3082
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,740
He worked in stance on Oz back.

3083
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:58,550
So I got,

3084
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:01,140
I sent me a fucking direct message on,

3085
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:01,520
uh,

3086
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,380
on Twitter one day and you know,

3087
01:26:03,381 --> 01:26:04,430
I know everybody gets busy,

3088
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:05,110
but he is,

3089
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,040
I'm not shitting on him.

3090
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,070
He sent me a direct message,

3091
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,170
like I always had respect for you.

3092
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,591
You know,

3093
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:09,781
I,

3094
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:13,100
I can't believe that you
wouldn't have me on your podcast.

3095
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:14,570
So I sent him a text message,

3096
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,493
John Perretti.

3097
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,910
So I sent him a Twitter message back.

3098
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:17,091
I was,

3099
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:17,331
dude,

3100
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:18,620
I'd love to have you on my podcast.

3101
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:19,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

3102
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,150
If somebody,

3103
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,130
whoever said that is definitely,

3104
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,600
there's definitely encouraged.

3105
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,473
But I was,

3106
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:27,230
I was always a fan of John
[inaudible] and he never heard back.

3107
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,483
They've heard back from him,

3108
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,350
but if I did hear back from him,

3109
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,610
but if he hears this,

3110
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:34,100
I got nothing but respect for John Preti.

3111
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,260
I enjoyed his commentary back in the day.

3112
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,530
I thought he was fun and
honest and he knew the fuck.

3113
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,840
He knew a lot of shit
about fighting God dog.

3114
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:42,890
We got a scrap here.

3115
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:44,090
Are Boys getting fucked up?

3116
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:44,361
Yeah,

3117
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:45,810
he's guys doing the throat slashing.

3118
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:46,940
Yeah,

3119
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:47,510
he's getting,

3120
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,480
he's getting beat up singing some shots
but like John Pridey doesn't get the

3121
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:51,201
respect he deserves.

3122
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,970
There was no one before him.

3123
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:57,050
You have to understand this guy was like
literally one the very first guys who

3124
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:59,820
was a high level mixed martial artists.

3125
01:26:59,821 --> 01:27:03,470
Did you Jitsu kickbox and
was doing commentary for MMA.

3126
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:06,710
He was like one of the very first
guy to show that battle king show.

3127
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:11,711
Exactly which had some great fucking
fights for the world was so pissed because

3128
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,880
he's very direct.

3129
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,970
He's very first.

3130
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,290
He's one of the first promoters
have personalities and they're like,

3131
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:22,580
you're going to have to have a certain
personality to deal with the fighters.

3132
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,620
The staff man,

3133
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,693
he spoke,

3134
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,960
but live Johnson and his mind like John
John Brendan's out on the set and that

3135
01:27:31,281 --> 01:27:34,460
guy was not interested in being
a diplomat or your friend.

3136
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:38,660
He was just very direct and very honest
and had the confidence built like a

3137
01:27:38,661 --> 01:27:40,130
brick shit house by the way.

3138
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:40,431
Yeah,

3139
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:43,870
we had a good conversations back when
I used to work for the UFC back in

3140
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:45,290
[inaudible] 97 and I
never got to know him.

3141
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:45,740
Well,

3142
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,071
you know,

3143
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:48,950
and then I took a break and then the UFC,

3144
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:53,120
they sold in his shop ready wasn't
there with any more hands up bro.

3145
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,110
So nice fist.

3146
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:55,280
Oh,

3147
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,670
he's backing him down back to
the Mark Coleman in his hand.

3148
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:02,680
Never let any brought a fit
Mark Coleman stove for all that.

3149
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,700
Maury Smith Beats Mark Coleman.

3150
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:09,560
I go to a UFC and in Louisiana I need
Joe Joe's doing backstage commentary.

3151
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:10,640
I go down there with Ricky,

3152
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:14,330
rocket drummer from poison were like
hanging out like let's go see a UFC.

3153
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,490
It's in a small 3000 seat arena.

3154
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,520
Just a bunch of crazy
motherfuckers and Kemper,

3155
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,730
Louisiana in 1997 when Frank Shamrock,

3156
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,920
a double leg,

3157
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:28,430
Igor is innovative and broke his clavicle
and that was the end of the fight that

3158
01:28:28,431 --> 01:28:29,264
was managed them.

3159
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,690
When Mikey Burnett beat
up fucking Eugenio Tad.

3160
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,340
That's old school shit.

3161
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,140
Most of y'all don't remember that shit,

3162
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,370
but that's old school shit.

3163
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:41,110
I was actually there live
met Joe Vito was there yet.

3164
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,870
Remember yet if you throw out a white,

3165
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,733
uh,

3166
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:46,923
it was awesome.

3167
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,410
But he was all young and shit.

3168
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,513
But anyways,

3169
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,403
I rent a home.

3170
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,150
That's when met Eddie
Bravo and I became friends.

3171
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:53,451
I was like,

3172
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:56,180
we can veto like he's on my
fucking set of Miami Vice.

3173
01:28:57,590 --> 01:29:01,500
We were just cracking up
[inaudible] I was like 19 years old.

3174
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:02,490
Looked like a fucking

3175
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,320
like a buff ass.

3176
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,130
Changed your life and
read getting glasses.

3177
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,011
But anyways,

3178
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:09,750
so I run into Mark Coleman at that show.

3179
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,471
This is the end.

3180
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:11,170
I promise.

3181
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:12,200
I did all that.

3182
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:16,560
She was a setup Marcola match it
to set up and I'm like grilling.

3183
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:18,030
I'm like asking him all these questions.

3184
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:18,420
I'm like,

3185
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,430
so this is after the Maurice
Smith fight where he gassed.

3186
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:22,711
I go,

3187
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:23,544
dude,

3188
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,091
I go,

3189
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:24,540
uh,

3190
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,500
what are you going to do?

3191
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:27,000
What did you learn from that fight?

3192
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:27,834
And he goes,

3193
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,550
what are you going to do different?

3194
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:30,330
He goes,

3195
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,850
brother that down on my feet.

3196
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:38,630
I like jogging shoes on that
Nike's cause I'm running,

3197
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:40,163
I'm running

3198
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,453
increases.

3199
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,300
Look at my

3200
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,900
tennis shoes on and we're at the UFC.

3201
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:52,680
Um,

3202
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,400
I should be having some fucking
boots on or some tennis shoes.

3203
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:57,293
Well,

3204
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:00,180
I'll give you a recent story.

3205
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,320
It's not the shit I'm going to come.

3206
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:05,280
And I sat next to him at a live belt where
I went to and he had some of the best

3207
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:06,114
stories of all time,

3208
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,780
but he is a chatty Cathy.

3209
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:10,410
I could,

3210
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,760
I was listening to him tell stories.

3211
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:13,470
I missed every single fight,

3212
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,010
man.

3213
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,940
He's the right dude.

3214
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,000
Here's my advice.

3215
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,290
In the fucking future.

3216
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,730
You DVR the fights.

3217
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:24,570
You go back and you watch me joy time
with one of the fucking hall of famers,

3218
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,150
Mark Coleman.

3219
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:31,800
He was heck destroyer.

3220
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,980
He was like destroyer
for why you should be.

3221
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:38,610
You should have been buying him beer
and lean in your ear in his direction.

3222
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,520
He wouldn't give me an inch either.

3223
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,413
I was squished.

3224
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,280
It was the hands,

3225
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:46,200
bottom Tequila and drinks.

3226
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:47,230
I didn't have a chance to buy.

3227
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,420
It's Mark Coleman.

3228
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:52,210
That's great.

3229
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:53,090
He kind of had a little,

3230
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:55,110
but then he won that pride.

3231
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:57,440
Fucking grandpa came back strong.

3232
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:58,441
Dude.

3233
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:00,720
He was fucking Vegas.

3234
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,710
Remember stayed working crazy.

3235
01:31:02,711 --> 01:31:05,790
His body was Mark Coleman and pride dude.

3236
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:06,450
He was like,

3237
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,220
he's strong

3238
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,583
lately.

3239
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,970
He choked out.

3240
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:12,691
Dan Henderson,

3241
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:13,840
would that scarf hold?

3242
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,550
Remember that he had them
like a side headlock scarf.

3243
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:17,820
Old type situation.

3244
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,860
I remember when he had an idea,

3245
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,890
and excuse me,

3246
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,753
um,

3247
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:22,740
Dan Severn,

3248
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,510
did I say Henderson,

3249
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,343
et Cetera.

3250
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,090
That was the shit.

3251
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:27,900
Mark Coleman for awhile.

3252
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,441
That was a shit.

3253
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:29,610
I'm going to hit block you and fucking,

3254
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,220
that's a legit model
when you're that strong.

3255
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:33,150
And he said,

3256
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,073
hey brother,

3257
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,210
a skill of a strong,

3258
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,813
he's strong,

3259
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,780
but that's a skilled move.

3260
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:40,021
I know.

3261
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:40,770
It's true.

3262
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,610
I know it is though.

3263
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:42,573
He worked hard.

3264
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:44,883
He would do that.

3265
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:47,430
He's 7,975 pounds,

3266
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,060
and he was really good at just taking
that side headlock and just fucking

3267
01:31:51,061 --> 01:31:51,894
balancing

3268
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:54,330
zit doing.

3269
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:55,830
It's not just a strong man move.

3270
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:58,020
It's actually a real move
that people just don't,

3271
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:58,360
uh,

3272
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,220
explore.

3273
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,040
But I,

3274
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,630
there's a guy named dude am the fucking,

3275
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:05,590
tap me with that shit in a headlock
and he's hundred and 75 pounds.

3276
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:06,250
Like a big dude.

3277
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:06,491
Dude.

3278
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:07,390
I was very talented.

3279
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,721
Hey,

3280
01:32:07,721 --> 01:32:08,770
before I forget,

3281
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,800
what was the Duda there was a like
a move from it's rubber guard move.

3282
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:19,300
It's like a in the rubber guard family
after just trying to get a Zombie.

3283
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:20,110
It's like you can't,

3284
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:23,980
it's a halfway through your hands through
it and you just do a Bicep crusher,

3285
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:24,251
right?

3286
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:25,084
Your legs.

3287
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:25,931
I remember it,

3288
01:32:25,931 --> 01:32:29,920
but I don't remember how old your shit
and do out or this guy's getting crazy.

3289
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:33,400
That guy has a whole system around her
and there's nobody on the planet like

3290
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:34,550
that motherfucker with that shit.

3291
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:37,360
I never seen anybody from
the guard setting up risks,

3292
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,820
fucking biceps smashers and flipping,

3293
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,630
enrolling people in 30 seconds.

3294
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,930
Fuck three,

3295
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,700
not 38 seconds.

3296
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,360
This one.

3297
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,730
People were giving a standing
ovation look pretty good.

3298
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:49,241
Yeah.

3299
01:32:49,241 --> 01:32:50,810
Well it's always interesting.

3300
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,910
Next two fights or big gives the
fucking Kaboom is getting much better.

3301
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:55,561
Good boxer.

3302
01:32:55,561 --> 01:32:56,740
This said next slice.

3303
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:57,221
Yeah,

3304
01:32:57,221 --> 01:33:00,730
we definitely was way more calm on his
feet when he stood in front of them and

3305
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:01,120
it was like,

3306
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,160
well you also realize this
dude was kind of gassed out.

3307
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,810
You get a little emotional with the fight.

3308
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:08,530
You know you're either a killer or you
want everybody to think you're a killer

3309
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,850
or killers or like fade or never
did any of that stupid shit.

3310
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:13,953
Quiet.

3311
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,480
Can't leave Cain.

3312
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:21,510
Cain Velasquez is my all time favorite
way in face cause like he doesn't give a

3313
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:22,450
fuck thing.

3314
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,310
He's like,

3315
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:23,960
Oh shit.

3316
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,170
I to be a little nervous.

3317
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:30,580
I'm going to have a PA tank of gas and
I'm going to rain bombs down on you until

3318
01:33:30,581 --> 01:33:31,300
it's all over.

3319
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,133
Bitch.

3320
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:33,490
When does he fight next?

3321
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:37,030
December 30th he's fighting
December 30th but man,

3322
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,260
there was just some surgery.

3323
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,640
What the fuck is he need surgery.

3324
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:40,180
You say?

3325
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,990
I don't want to hear that.

3326
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,830
It's like his 12th surgery
since he's been in.

3327
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:46,660
But you can't say you got a fight coming
up and then afterwards you're going to

3328
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:47,371
get surgery.

3329
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,990
No sound because that's a
ridiculous thing to say.

3330
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:51,100
That's the life they live,

3331
01:33:51,101 --> 01:33:51,430
brother.

3332
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:52,091
I understand.

3333
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:54,670
But to say it publicly
seems pretty ridiculous.

3334
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:56,290
Efficient insurance involved.

3335
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,840
It's a good point from a business move,

3336
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,730
but as a fan you got to
appreciate the honesty.

3337
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:01,111
He goes,

3338
01:34:01,111 --> 01:34:01,601
it's true too.

3339
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:01,991
It was really,

3340
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:02,830
I should have surgery,

3341
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,950
but I don't want to beat this motherfucker
so bad and get to the title shot.

3342
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:07,150
I'm going to wait and do it after.

3343
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:08,080
Here's a good question.

3344
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:11,640
Do you think you say he
does look very helpful?

3345
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,730
It looks very clean.

3346
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:13,690
Let me ask you this.

3347
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,880
Do you think that insurance should cover
all of the injuries sustained during

3348
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:19,361
training,

3349
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:20,860
which of course all of them are.

3350
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:21,400
Yes.

3351
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,720
100% right.

3352
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:23,554
I agree with.

3353
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,960
Is that the case right now?

3354
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,390
Like what does insurance cover now?

3355
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,190
Does it only cover things
that happened in a fight?

3356
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:30,791
No,

3357
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:31,360
it covers,

3358
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:31,960
uh,

3359
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,480
I'm almost positive you got
asked when your UFC boys,

3360
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:37,990
but I'm pretty sure it covers when
you're in training camp for that fight.

3361
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:38,320
Okay.

3362
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:38,801
You know what I'm saying?

3363
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:41,890
Like certain amount of weeks outside of
training camp as you're preparing for

3364
01:34:41,891 --> 01:34:42,580
the bout.

3365
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,260
But if let's say I have nothing scheduled,

3366
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:44,771
I get hurt.

3367
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:45,431
It doesn't cover that.

3368
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:46,750
So that's the case then it doesn't,

3369
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,180
then what he said was
actually kind of gangster.

3370
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:50,423
Yeah.

3371
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:50,960
Super gangs.

3372
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,100
Cause he's already covered by insurance
and he's going to come in and say,

3373
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:54,311
look,

3374
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:55,990
I know I'm kind of injured here,

3375
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:57,560
but I'll deal with it and your ass.

3376
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:57,980
Yep.

3377
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,760
How great is that?

3378
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,370
That's pretty good.

3379
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:02,000
All Mike Brown warming
up must get the early.

3380
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,960
Frankie Edgar had a fucking pretty
significant knee injury leading up to the

3381
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:07,070
fight with Jeremy Stephens.

3382
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,210
Well how about for doom?

3383
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:11,080
They said he went into the fight
against trash with a broken foot.

3384
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:13,010
Me Lie jumping side kicked him in.

3385
01:35:13,011 --> 01:35:15,110
The face landed that shit dumb.

3386
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,110
They tricks and wobbled
first food for the fight,

3387
01:35:18,111 --> 01:35:18,360
man.

3388
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,690
So gangster man.

3389
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:20,390
Oh,

3390
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,223
fighting hard enough,

3391
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:22,520
let alone with broken.

3392
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,080
That was just what they'll,

3393
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:27,100
Travis Browne to crazy things
happen to him in that fight.

3394
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,940
There's that kick that
he opens up with like,

3395
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:30,470
where the fuck is this coming from?

3396
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,573
And then,

3397
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:32,540
um,

3398
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:36,660
when Verdomme threw that
punch and hit his finger is,

3399
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,503
oh my God,

3400
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,261
this is a call.

3401
01:35:39,261 --> 01:35:40,370
I see the crazy,

3402
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:41,450
he snapped his friend.

3403
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:41,631
You,

3404
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:42,740
you wouldn't have waited a second.

3405
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:42,951
Right?

3406
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:44,330
That's he spare fucking game there.

3407
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:44,541
Oh,

3408
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:44,670
he's,

3409
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,430
I call I went skews me.

3410
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,121
Yeah.

3411
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:48,770
You want to kick you right in the face.

3412
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:49,020
Oh,

3413
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:49,611
it's awful.

3414
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:50,930
It's a weird thing man.

3415
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:51,681
Because if he says,

3416
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:52,221
excuse me,

3417
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,120
I'm done.

3418
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,811
It's over.

3419
01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:54,680
My finger's broken.

3420
01:35:54,681 --> 01:35:55,700
Then they stopped a fight,

3421
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,680
then you're correct and not attack him.

3422
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,040
But I went just get a
second limit my finger.

3423
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:01,461
I mean,

3424
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:02,360
but here's the thing.

3425
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:07,361
I didn't want that fight to end right
there to Ju [inaudible] I went to stay

3426
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:08,420
dead.

3427
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:13,420
Do you want to leave room for an emotional
mistake in a time of duress like that

3428
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,150
where someone might have fun?

3429
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:16,560
You,

3430
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:16,941
Kay,

3431
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:17,691
you ready to go on?

3432
01:36:17,691 --> 01:36:18,590
He's okay.

3433
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:18,980
Yeah,

3434
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:19,221
yeah,

3435
01:36:19,221 --> 01:36:19,520
yeah,

3436
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:19,731
yeah,

3437
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:19,940
yeah.

3438
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,330
And then jumps back in like there's
moments where something could go wrong.

3439
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:26,690
Well you don't even realize like
this there a malfunction of my glove.

3440
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:26,940
Yes.

3441
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,490
Why's my finger bed sideways?

3442
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:28,791
Hold on.

3443
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:29,091
Hold on.

3444
01:36:29,091 --> 01:36:29,900
What the fuck's going on?

3445
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,530
Yes,

3446
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:32,000
there is moments but,

3447
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:32,834
but

3448
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:36,710
you know you'd take it back
to game of fucking Thrones.

3449
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:37,820
They would let him draw the line.

3450
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:39,531
I'll tell you what.

3451
01:36:39,531 --> 01:36:40,364
I'm going to come around.

3452
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,260
It's like an iPad.

3453
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:48,250
No Shit on both these.

3454
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:54,000
The reason why that doesn't
count is because it didn't
happen from him going for

3455
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:59,001
a on this sketch it happened because for
June threw a punch at La aimed at his

3456
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:00,590
hand and that broke his finger

3457
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,990
in your nose right now,

3458
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,490
Travis Travis,

3459
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:06,860
Travis had his hands up and
for doom through one of them.

3460
01:37:06,861 --> 01:37:09,110
Crazy Chuck Odell style or brand,

3461
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,760
but it was a pie ended on the fingers.

3462
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:11,623
Correct.

3463
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:14,180
That broke his finger broke

3464
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:17,320
up.

3465
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:17,530
Yeah,

3466
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:17,961
you're right.

3467
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:20,630
Function of that injury is,

3468
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,280
you could argue is poor technique,

3469
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:22,731
right?

3470
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:25,520
Because that might hold technique
that might work with MMA.

3471
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:26,600
Where with boxing gloves rather,

3472
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:27,434
a more tech gloves,

3473
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,801
you know,

3474
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:28,634
to have your hands

3475
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,280
like this and to have a kid coming at
you and held your hands and also helps

3476
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,910
them to braise.

3477
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,140
It gives us more space.

3478
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:40,340
If we could see it.

3479
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,240
Let's see if we can see it,

3480
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,430
but break John Jones
about having an open hand.

3481
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:43,580
Yeah.

3482
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:43,881
Oh yeah.

3483
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:44,360
Well that's,

3484
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,560
that's authentically though.

3485
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:46,493
Let's look at,

3486
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,300
let's look at,

3487
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,590
let's look a good pot bottle.

3488
01:37:48,591 --> 01:37:49,220
I liked that.

3489
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:51,450
That's a good point in time.

3490
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:52,363
Breaking a finger

3491
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:54,440
fingers.

3492
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,250
How often do practice punching fingers

3493
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:56,701
in the gym?

3494
01:37:56,701 --> 01:37:57,780
Once a week or twice a week.

3495
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,190
I don't practice snapping.

3496
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:01,340
Arms are knocking guys out.

3497
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,193
Hold on.

3498
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:03,580
That's your frankness.

3499
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,291
Our bars.

3500
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:04,750
Let's look.

3501
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:05,730
Practice armbars.

3502
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,020
How could you not break his arm bar?

3503
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,210
No.

3504
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,850
Practice snapping natural art.

3505
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,370
No bars aren't snapping arms.

3506
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,230
Guys were looking at
this fight right here.

3507
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:13,831
This is a,

3508
01:38:13,831 --> 01:38:15,090
the punch where that landed,

3509
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,520
I mean authentic move by for doom,

3510
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:19,350
but I can't fault anything Travis did.

3511
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,430
That was a freak accident because
he's doing the right thing to Joe.

3512
01:38:22,431 --> 01:38:23,790
That doesn't mapping his hand up.

3513
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:24,810
You're right.

3514
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:25,360
No,

3515
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:25,741
listen,

3516
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,500
I agree with now if he did it and his
finger at in his shorts and he's like,

3517
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:28,741
fuck,

3518
01:38:28,741 --> 01:38:29,551
give him a second limb.

3519
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:30,540
Figure out if he wants Canadian.

3520
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,850
Here's a question.

3521
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:33,000
Offensive move.

3522
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:34,940
The hundred percent is the fish fingers.

3523
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:35,761
His name is breaking the face,

3524
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:37,770
breaking it or the more different
than people in your arm,

3525
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:38,311
your shoulder,

3526
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:38,790
your neck.

3527
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,770
But we have some weird
sort of distinction.

3528
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:40,981
Right?

3529
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:43,020
Which is why you can
say time out for that,

3530
01:38:43,021 --> 01:38:44,940
but you can't say timeout
if you get hit in the nose.

3531
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:45,750
That's right.

3532
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:46,291
You can't,

3533
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,820
if you're ever doing crew for there,

3534
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,080
no fucking timeouts.

3535
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,040
And when the afternoon was like,

3536
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,150
that's ridiculous.

3537
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:52,013
Why is that?

3538
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:54,300
Brought that up to the
post fight interview.

3539
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,970
I was really clear like you were well
within your rights to go after him.

3540
01:38:56,971 --> 01:38:57,331
Correct.

3541
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:02,331
That was inside the rules for their
audience and for let's just be cool about

3542
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:03,450
it.

3543
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:03,871
Okay,

3544
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:04,950
your finger got caught.

3545
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,600
I don't fucking want you to die,

3546
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:09,630
but that's there's millions of dollars.

3547
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:10,920
It's like come on,

3548
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:11,761
but hold on a second.

3549
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:16,020
Test Freddy's got a good point to
the audience wants it to go on.

3550
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:18,510
Like we were like we'd pay
and it's not like Anderson,

3551
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:19,800
so big deals and,

3552
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,830
and for that one guy only,

3553
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:24,240
it only makes sense for the
guy that threw the punch.

3554
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,500
That's the only guy that
didn't make sense inflicted

3555
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:30,530
but nobody,

3556
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,850
nobody's trying to break
fingers with punches.

3557
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,170
If that was part of the sport,

3558
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,180
you gotta practice prick fingers.

3559
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,620
It's not illegal.

3560
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:39,990
Let me knock out some walls here.

3561
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:40,970
It's not illegal to

3562
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,783
give Joe Rogan.

3563
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,530
Let me knock down some walls here.

3564
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,790
You're both right.

3565
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:48,683
You're both right.

3566
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:49,500
You're both right.

3567
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,820
Yeah is absolutely.

3568
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:51,181
Listen,

3569
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:52,020
it's absolutely

3570
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:55,441
and the Phi.

3571
01:39:55,441 --> 01:40:00,441
It's absolutely an injury caused
by someone executing a technique.

3572
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:02,850
But wouldn't you like
to fight to keep going?

3573
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:03,380
Just tore.

3574
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,710
Would you like to say Matt,

3575
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:05,544
would you like,

3576
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:10,500
would you like Cain Velasquez or excuse
me a for BC we're doing to win on

3577
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:12,510
technical knockout due
to a fingerprint break.

3578
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:13,383
Doesn't matter.

3579
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,510
I agree.

3580
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,710
I agree with the answer.

3581
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:17,311
I agree with you,

3582
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,500
but I'm not saying guys within the rules.

3583
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:20,670
I'm saying what do you want to see?

3584
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,290
Let me knock some walls down.

3585
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:23,803
Let me

3586
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,570
wrap this shit up.

3587
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,540
You got to stop talking over
each eye and it's brutal.

3588
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:31,320
But I'm Brown.

3589
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,080
I'm the wise one.

3590
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,120
Let me wrap this up guys.

3591
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:33,630
Okay,

3592
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:33,871
let me,

3593
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:34,704
let me cork it up.

3594
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,540
Quote some from the Washington parents.

3595
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,391
Hold on.

3596
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:37,710
No,

3597
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,700
it's fair to say.

3598
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,940
It's fair to say you'll
know it when you see it.

3599
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:42,570
Yes.

3600
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:42,931
Right.

3601
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:44,130
And it's up to you.

3602
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:45,300
There's distractions in life.

3603
01:40:45,301 --> 01:40:46,170
There's discretion.

3604
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:46,591
No,

3605
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:48,900
when you see it and leave
it up to the fighters,

3606
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,793
leave it up to the ref.

3607
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,910
You'll know it when you see it.

3608
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,410
It's going to be a case by case basis.

3609
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,250
Just one.

3610
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,860
Just one Brendan in one.

3611
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,270
There's just choices.

3612
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,870
There's,

3613
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:02,460
you have to,

3614
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,240
there's a reason every
situation's different,

3615
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:04,871
but they also,

3616
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:06,580
you don't know what
happened to your finger.

3617
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:07,870
I mean he just got cracked.

3618
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,130
He doesn't know what happened.

3619
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:11,800
He might thought he might've thought his
finger cause it wasn't working right.

3620
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,120
Was tied up in his glove.

3621
01:41:13,121 --> 01:41:14,260
What does it look at it?

3622
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,690
I don't think Verdomme is wrong.

3623
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:18,730
I think for dooms 100% right.

3624
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,520
But I think there's a moment of confusion.

3625
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,820
It's not like Travis got head kicked
and was confused cause you've got almost

3626
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:25,630
knocked out.

3627
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:27,670
I think when his finger was fucked up,

3628
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:29,650
he didn't necessarily
know what was going on.

3629
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,220
Yeah,

3630
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,630
I think we have split second.

3631
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,710
Whether or not that's true.

3632
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:33,191
I don't know.

3633
01:41:33,191 --> 01:41:33,761
Only he knows,

3634
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:35,980
but I'm saying there's
a total possibility.

3635
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:37,940
So I'm sure you get your finger smashed.

3636
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:40,380
Mediator Joe's,

3637
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:41,483
right?

3638
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:42,643
No,

3639
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:43,880
the whole thing.

3640
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:45,190
I tried to look at the whole thing.

3641
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,881
I am,

3642
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:47,230
I'm saying even if he was like,

3643
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:47,621
oh shit,

3644
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:48,730
my fingers broke.

3645
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:49,421
I'm looking like,

3646
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:49,630
Damn.

3647
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:50,190
Is that bro?

3648
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:51,023
You all right bro.

3649
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:51,341
All right,

3650
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:52,450
let's keep going on the street.

3651
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:52,951
What would you do?

3652
01:41:52,951 --> 01:41:56,980
It broke your fucking finger when it
comes to a head kick to finish it off

3653
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,410
because we have millions
of dollars on the line yet.

3654
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,583
Not Angry.

3655
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:00,960
No,

3656
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,111
no,

3657
01:42:01,111 --> 01:42:01,231
no,

3658
01:42:01,231 --> 01:42:01,381
no,

3659
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:01,511
no.

3660
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:02,320
I agree.

3661
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:02,920
You're right.

3662
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,660
You're right to no,

3663
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:04,991
it's,

3664
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:06,580
I agree this and here's a thing.

3665
01:42:06,581 --> 01:42:08,290
Then I argue with the finger,

3666
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:08,551
I,

3667
01:42:08,551 --> 01:42:08,770
Hey,

3668
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:09,540
here's your coach.

3669
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,373
I'm leading.

3670
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:14,410
I'm literally not even arguing with you
because I see your point 100% but I also

3671
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:16,570
saw you are to Brendan and I see even if,

3672
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:20,140
but I also as a person who's
greedy when I'm at home,

3673
01:42:20,141 --> 01:42:21,490
I want to see them keep fighting.

3674
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:22,840
I'm with you.

3675
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:26,890
You're right.

3676
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,520
I'm greedy.

3677
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:27,941
You know what?

3678
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:30,190
I'm a fan of Fabrizio and I
would like to see him win.

3679
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:30,790
But there's,

3680
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:34,300
there's a feeling that I get from
someone winning by a broken finger that I

3681
01:42:34,301 --> 01:42:35,051
don't like.

3682
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:35,560
Correct.

3683
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:40,270
I liked the feeling furbish you'll want
a clear decision because shit out of

3684
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:41,143
him,

3685
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,630
I promise.

3686
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:49,850
Brendan's are like,

3687
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,231
yeah,

3688
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:52,450
he want his shit broken.

3689
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:54,880
Finger broken.

3690
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:57,610
Here's a better question.

3691
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,650
Here's a better question
cause it's an illegal move.

3692
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:04,810
How much of an effect should I
poke B because I really feel like,

3693
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,550
I think not only does it change the game,

3694
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:08,190
like mitre own versus Travis Browne.

3695
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:11,410
Here's a case where the foul
went and Travis has favor.

3696
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,510
When when he poked uh,

3697
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:17,800
Mitrione and stated the permission
to by the grace and he did it twice.

3698
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,130
It was two IPOs.

3699
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:19,720
Yeah.

3700
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,020
And then you know Mitch reone who was
winning the fight then goes to losing the

3701
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:23,310
fight.

3702
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:23,620
Yeah.

3703
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:25,030
It's a significant factor.

3704
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:25,910
Nice.

3705
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:26,410
Almost.

3706
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:30,280
It's almost so significant that if
you're marginally impaired from it,

3707
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,380
you might want to stop the fight.

3708
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:32,860
I agree.

3709
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,531
How do you feel?

3710
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:35,590
So it's just crazy because
you're in the moment.

3711
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:38,350
It's such a difficult like
rational decision to make.

3712
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:41,250
But if you're fucked up and you
could barely see out of one eye,

3713
01:43:41,251 --> 01:43:41,501
you're like,

3714
01:43:41,501 --> 01:43:41,681
no,

3715
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:42,281
I want to keep going.

3716
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:42,780
I want to,

3717
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:43,810
so you've been poked in the eye.

3718
01:43:43,811 --> 01:43:48,811
How terrible for that bitch recover those
Tuesday and some guys never come back

3719
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,100
from that is well that was a kick.

3720
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,900
I believe any,

3721
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:58,901
any eye injury could be like [inaudible]
is a full third possibility that that

3722
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:05,090
could design some kind of
like fighting goggle thing.

3723
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:06,570
Is that a possibility?

3724
01:44:06,610 --> 01:44:08,470
It would have to look
up to protect the ice.

3725
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,173
Yeah.

3726
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,900
When you guys are getting poked,

3727
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:15,170
the only way you could do it is if you
came up with some sort of adhesive,

3728
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:16,190
like some crazy,

3729
01:44:16,191 --> 01:44:20,270
crazy glue shit that you could stick this
fucking thing to your face where it's

3730
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:24,170
impossible to pull it off for
all those are the only way.

3731
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:28,280
But it would have to like literally
almost be like cups that covered your eyes

3732
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,080
but were like glued in your head.

3733
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:31,640
And then afterwards they
put some solvent on it,

3734
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:36,020
but then we would find out five years
later that fucking people are dying from

3735
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:37,130
cancer brain.

3736
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:40,160
You guys are soaking them
in testosterone and shit.

3737
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,120
Planet of the apes when they make you
dirty days to have a chemical that they

3738
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:44,750
would make your,

3739
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:45,240
your,

3740
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:45,621
your,

3741
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:46,030
uh,

3742
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:46,320
you,

3743
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:50,050
you know your [inaudible] Sandy.

3744
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:50,300
Yes.

3745
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:51,530
The movie with Mark Walberg

3746
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:57,010
know that they found the stuff that they
used was a chemical that doesn't listen

3747
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,000
to Hank.

3748
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,800
Can we please guys as Ofso MMA fan,

3749
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:02,180
we actually watched this fight.

3750
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:03,930
Don't fight.

3751
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:08,230
Don't fight Jorge Mosbey
doll versus Chase Shaka.

3752
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,600
Fuck yes.

3753
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:09,980
Oh,

3754
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,970
he's a mosfet lik great.

3755
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:13,833
Paul shorts,

3756
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:15,020
a great striker.

3757
01:45:15,021 --> 01:45:15,340
He's,

3758
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,960
it's a short humans.

3759
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:19,760
Kimbo Kimbo but I gotta tell you,

3760
01:45:19,761 --> 01:45:20,001
man,

3761
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:23,240
Jake Ellenberger coming off
of that Kao of map brow,

3762
01:45:23,241 --> 01:45:24,800
like he was on the death doorstop.

3763
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:24,981
Dude,

3764
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:26,150
he had to beg for his job.

3765
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,560
He had a bag for his job and he said,

3766
01:45:27,561 --> 01:45:28,470
please just give me one more fight.

3767
01:45:28,471 --> 01:45:28,761
And they go,

3768
01:45:28,761 --> 01:45:29,091
okay,

3769
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:29,670
Matt Brown.

3770
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:29,990
He was like,

3771
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,890
oh my God,

3772
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:31,700
I can't believe this.

3773
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:32,120
Hey Kid.

3774
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,391
He's like,

3775
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:32,991
I'll take it.

3776
01:45:32,991 --> 01:45:36,950
And he went out there and stop Matt
Brown and one round his man whose manager

3777
01:45:36,951 --> 01:45:37,460
went,

3778
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:38,121
come on Joe,

3779
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:38,691
give someone else.

3780
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:39,381
And Joseph said,

3781
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:39,921
fuck it.

3782
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:40,680
Then you're cutting like,

3783
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:40,801

3784
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:40,931
no,

3785
01:45:40,931 --> 01:45:41,001
no.

3786
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:41,421
We'll take it.

3787
01:45:41,421 --> 01:45:41,940
We'll take it.

3788
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,250
How do you know nick curse?

3789
01:45:43,251 --> 01:45:44,120
How does that get out?

3790
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,020
How does shit like that?

3791
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:46,720
Not say that.

3792
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:47,553
Let's not say that.

3793
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:52,630
Let's say really weakened
action of gossip and Innuendo.

3794
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:56,180
Not Ellenberger got Ellenberger in this

3795
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:01,670
Washington like justify
voting for chicken.

3796
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,950
All due respect to my spin on,

3797
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,431
because Austin,

3798
01:46:03,431 --> 01:46:04,264

3799
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:04,850
I love Jake.

3800
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:06,140
Jake Ellenberger is a bow hunter.

3801
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:06,441
Come on,

3802
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:10,540
just going to be a left wing
MMA and then a right wing Nma,

3803
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,290
and they're going to get into
their personalities in their lives.

3804
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:13,790
What?

3805
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:15,050
Right when he's going to win,

3806
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,300
it's going to be a real problem.

3807
01:46:17,301 --> 01:46:17,531
Right.

3808
01:46:17,531 --> 01:46:19,010
We need to meet with the sports,

3809
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:22,130
the guys who have the money that
when a lot are going to be right.

3810
01:46:22,131 --> 01:46:22,371
Where he,

3811
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:22,671
fuck.

3812
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:23,000
Yeah.

3813
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:23,410
Helen.

3814
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,243
Dot.

3815
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,840
Ellenberg doesn't support Nafta.

3816
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:32,020
Made MMA.

3817
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:32,520
Yeah,

3818
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,360
it'd be hilarious.

3819
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:40,280
Treaty of a massive dollar had Hashtag
I'm with her on his Twitter account for

3820
01:46:40,991 --> 01:46:41,824
four hours.

3821
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:45,320
We have screenshots and Democrats.

3822
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:47,400
It's red and blue in the future.

3823
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,333
Red Fox,

3824
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:53,050
Democrat,

3825
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,270
and it has to be that way.

3826
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,870
Jake has more power check.

3827
01:46:55,871 --> 01:46:56,460
No,

3828
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,031
not mosfet.

3829
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:58,950
Donkin cracked my phone
will get knocked down.

3830
01:46:58,951 --> 01:46:59,670
It's like,

3831
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:00,503
oh dude.

3832
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,531
Left Hook.

3833
01:47:01,531 --> 01:47:03,270
They play this gas for all can cracked it.

3834
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:05,430
He's the first guy to knock
out Eve Edwards at MMA.

3835
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,580
He had kicked Eve Edwards back in.

3836
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,400
That's hard.

3837
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,310
That was back in Bodog fight.

3838
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,950
I would have never pegged mass
of the dog for a republic.

3839
01:47:13,951 --> 01:47:14,140
Oh,

3840
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:14,420
good.

3841
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,480
Glad body

3842
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,030
that hurt him.

3843
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,840
Oh Shit.

3844
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,770
Oh Shit.

3845
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,633
Oh fuck.

3846
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:22,460
Oh,

3847
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:23,360
he's in big trouble.

3848
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:24,650
Trouble.

3849
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:25,230
It's over,

3850
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:26,063
son.

3851
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:26,760
Oh,

3852
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,420
he's getting dead.

3853
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:27,541
Oh,

3854
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:28,320
that's it.

3855
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:28,501
Oh,

3856
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:31,830
herb dean went to ask first he went
asked towards him hips towards him.

3857
01:47:31,831 --> 01:47:32,720
It's going to stop us.

3858
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:34,320
Was the stay Dan.

3859
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,430
That's what he tells him.

3860
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:40,710
This Jake is talking
about the check come back.

3861
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:42,460
He's not going to in here.

3862
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:43,363
You don't know.

3863
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:43,580
Well,

3864
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:44,413
no,

3865
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:47,670
not stopping it or been doing a great job.

3866
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,810
She made the ask move

3867
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,340
to see the ass must be starving.

3868
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,420
Such a monster that shows
you how good herb dean is.

3869
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,280
That shows you right there
how he knows his shit.

3870
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,390
Yes ass look at this,

3871
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,000
but Mazda doll has got
pinned up against the cage.

3872
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:07,290
Ellenberger has got to get some space.

3873
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,040
There you go.

3874
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:08,670
There you go.

3875
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:08,950
Damn.

3876
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:09,880
Circle left circle.

3877
01:48:09,881 --> 01:48:11,820
Lap shake has done a boxing bag these up.

3878
01:48:12,170 --> 01:48:12,720
Hey,

3879
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,260
well Jake still possesses that
crazy fast twitch muscle fiber.

3880
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:17,610
So if he can connect,

3881
01:48:17,611 --> 01:48:18,444
he can crack you.

3882
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:18,611
Well,

3883
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:19,441
the last thing he goes,

3884
01:48:19,441 --> 01:48:20,110
Powell.

3885
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:21,030
Jake's always had power,

3886
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,770
but when you get hurt,

3887
01:48:22,771 --> 01:48:25,740
you always start reaching for that cause
you know you're not going to play like

3888
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:28,230
a points game from here on
out cause you're diminished.

3889
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:31,710
So you've got a few like
significant rounds in your chamber.

3890
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:33,660
It's just a matter of how
long it's going to take.

3891
01:48:33,661 --> 01:48:35,400
Jake Ellenberger right now to recover.

3892
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:36,241
But here's the thing,

3893
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:37,340
if he's been trained with curse on,

3894
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:38,370
I think he has for this fight.

3895
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:39,330
I know he asked for this fight.

3896
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,231
As a matter of fact,

3897
01:48:40,231 --> 01:48:42,030
it's been at kings to training with nick.

3898
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:43,080
Curse on is a big thing,

3899
01:48:43,081 --> 01:48:43,420
man.

3900
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:43,960
Nickerson.

3901
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:44,400
Who was that?

3902
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,820
MARV Marinovich disciple.

3903
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,610
That guy's a wizard man.

3904
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:51,210
He knows off fuck load about strength
and conditioning and getting guys ready

3905
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:53,580
for fights both physically and mentally.

3906
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:57,540
And I think he helped Ellenberger a lot
would giving them the confidence with

3907
01:48:57,541 --> 01:49:00,480
being in that insane shape
to get ready for Matt Brown.

3908
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:00,780
There's,

3909
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:02,910
there's no coach on the planet and go,

3910
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:03,151
Hey,

3911
01:49:03,151 --> 01:49:07,380
you're gonna get fucked up the first
minute and then we can work on that.

3912
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:07,981
You know what I'm saying?

3913
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:08,460
Yeah.

3914
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,690
There's no conditioning for that,

3915
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:10,380
right?

3916
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:10,860
You're right.

3917
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,390
There's nothing you got to the x factor,

3918
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:16,320
but it's also like Ellenberger is a real
veteran now and he's experienced those

3919
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:17,810
disappointing defeats.

3920
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:21,750
He's been in those super highlight
knockouts like the map route fight like

3921
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:22,850
shields fight.

3922
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:27,850
He's composed after taking a look at how
compelling elements more legit and war

3923
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:31,230
and the best of all,

3924
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,520
Hillary loves them.

3925
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:34,180
Do you know Ellen Bird?

3926
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:34,711
Oh Shit.

3927
01:49:34,711 --> 01:49:35,081
The fuck up.

3928
01:49:35,081 --> 01:49:35,720
It's a joke.

3929
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,480
I know that Ellenberger knocked
out palae Landy with one punch.

3930
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:40,320
Yes.

3931
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,230
That was back in the Disney Belfour.

3932
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:43,141
Oh no,

3933
01:49:43,141 --> 01:49:43,371
it wasn't.

3934
01:49:43,371 --> 01:49:44,670
I don't think it was a belt.

3935
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:45,220
We're fighting.

3936
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:45,980
Is that right?

3937
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:46,591
And he took it on.

3938
01:49:46,591 --> 01:49:47,190
She was you.

3939
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:48,110
That's a good boxer.

3940
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:55,380
He was some Jake Ellenberger oh one with
the wheelchair left kick to the body.

3941
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:57,693
Oh.

3942
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:58,471
Oh Ellen.

3943
01:49:58,471 --> 01:50:02,890
Berta slipped and broke his
foot toe stuck in that cage.

3944
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:04,840
You should let him recover.

3945
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,393
What happened?

3946
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:06,581
He,

3947
01:50:06,581 --> 01:50:09,030
I think he broke his foot and ankle.

3948
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,120
You can the cage.

3949
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,130
What do you do at this point?

3950
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,033
No,

3951
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,740
this is hilarious guys.

3952
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,600
We're seeing exactly what we saw

3953
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:20,670
as pregnant is going to say fuck him.

3954
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:21,030
He said,

3955
01:50:21,030 --> 01:50:22,330
is this fight stopped?

3956
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:23,440
Is this fight stopped?

3957
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,420
John Joe Joe's going to say,

3958
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:25,961
hey,

3959
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:29,980
give the guy a little chance to your side.

3960
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:30,671
That's the problem.

3961
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:31,120
Eddie,

3962
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,050
I'd haven't picked aside.

3963
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,180
I'm on both of your sides.

3964
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:34,330
Say What my side was,

3965
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,550
but then we did before when we
were talking about the finger side,

3966
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:40,720
at this point he was getting fucked up,

3967
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:41,583
so

3968
01:50:42,990 --> 01:50:46,630
he was already getting Johnny and let's
find out what the hell happened here.

3969
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,640
Ellenberger prints like a
psychic throws the kick.

3970
01:50:51,641 --> 01:50:53,030
He slides in Tacos.

3971
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,283
Boom.

3972
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:58,510
I get it.

3973
01:50:58,540 --> 01:50:59,061
I go,

3974
01:50:59,061 --> 01:51:01,930
stop is snapped his foot.

3975
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,970
Let me tell me what you think.

3976
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:04,810
If I'm Mazda doll,

3977
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:09,250
I wail away exactly like he did and when
the fight exactly like he did was too

3978
01:51:09,251 --> 01:51:10,040
much riding on.

3979
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:10,610
Dude,

3980
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:12,330
you're so fucking mean.

3981
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:12,641
Okay,

3982
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:14,380
well the fights over it is over.

3983
01:51:14,381 --> 01:51:15,230
The fight is over.

3984
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:18,010
I see that your homeboy,

3985
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:19,120
this is what I feel like.

3986
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:20,380
This is my take on this.

3987
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:22,160
This is a great fight.

3988
01:51:22,161 --> 01:51:24,160
Have Fun fight that ended
with a freak accident.

3989
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,220
The mosfet all got some great shots.

3990
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,300
Sullenberger looked like
he was staying calm,

3991
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:31,480
but if you had to go to
decision off of the injury,

3992
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:32,780
you had got to give it to Moscow.

3993
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:35,110
Moscow was putting it to them.

3994
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:37,860
My hospital had him in a lot of trouble,

3995
01:51:37,861 --> 01:51:38,120
like clue.

3996
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,360
There's slides in his toe,

3997
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:40,510
wet right in there and it's,

3998
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:44,720
oh,

3999
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,970
he's just snapped his toe back row.

4000
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:49,900
No,

4001
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,220
no,

4002
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:50,520
no,

4003
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,320
no.

4004
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,910
You're so ruthless as a
favor because I'm nosy,

4005
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:55,744
lighter.

4006
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,920
You mark them as fast,

4007
01:51:56,921 --> 01:51:57,250
your kid.

4008
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,150
Hey guys,

4009
01:51:58,151 --> 01:51:59,170
let's look at it this way.

4010
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:00,490
As a pres,

4011
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,680
as people that love the sport,

4012
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:05,110
maybe we should redesign
the bottom of the cage.

4013
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,093
Yes,

4014
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,540
it may be down for that,

4015
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:08,740
but it's not his fault.

4016
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,583
It's not his fault.

4017
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:12,610
This guy caught in the fence.

4018
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,130
Let me ask you this game.

4019
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,320
Do you think that that part of the
game ball still gets mad at you?

4020
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:20,290
You moved to the left and he fucking
slides in and he gets his foot.

4021
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:22,871
Let me ask you this.

4022
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:24,190
As a person who's fought in the octagon,

4023
01:52:24,191 --> 01:52:26,530
is there an argument for
extending the lip a little bit?

4024
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,150
So instead of Tuck it,

4025
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,230
Tuck it up.

4026
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:30,560
We'd be putting in a bar fish.

4027
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,120
How many would you could only have to go
up a few inches and it would remove the

4028
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:35,630
problem of the edge move,

4029
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,590
but you wouldn't be able to use,

4030
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:38,720
you know that take down a fence.

4031
01:52:38,721 --> 01:52:39,910
So this guys against the cage,

4032
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:41,660
take your heels in twice.

4033
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:44,350
Well that's Kinda cheap too,

4034
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:44,950
isn't it?

4035
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:46,130
That body that caught oh

4036
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,820
well that would help everybody then
everyone like having a little bit of a,

4037
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,020
let's talk about that.

4038
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:55,310
Having a little bit of fabric pulled
it through and up and connect it to the

4039
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:56,144
cage.

4040
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:57,470
That would be a good thing.

4041
01:52:57,471 --> 01:52:58,304
So he slipped in there.

4042
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,791
Oh my God.

4043
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:01,250
It's awful fucking told.

4044
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,560
He's getting punched in the head and
he's still trying to get his phone up.

4045
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:06,261
They don't cut them.

4046
01:53:06,261 --> 01:53:06,981
Give them one more.

4047
01:53:06,981 --> 01:53:07,291
It's flipped.

4048
01:53:07,291 --> 01:53:09,380
That kind of gave him 100% man.

4049
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:12,260
He just knocked out Matt Brown
and he has his controversial,

4050
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:12,561
uh,

4051
01:53:12,561 --> 01:53:13,300
injury.

4052
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:13,440
Uh,

4053
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:13,591
don't,

4054
01:53:13,591 --> 01:53:16,970
we'll go by 100% here's the problem
with the controversial injury.

4055
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:21,170
Mazda doll is the one who got robbed here
cause Mosfet Woodall was putting it to

4056
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:22,370
him before that he still gets,

4057
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:22,770
he gets,

4058
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:23,310
he won,

4059
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:23,891
they won.

4060
01:53:23,891 --> 01:53:26,000
But if it was a draw like dope,

4061
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,380
he's injured both guys.

4062
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:31,130
I feel like both guys robbed got
robbed a little bit and doesn't burn.

4063
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,050
Got Robbed and potential for a comeback.

4064
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:33,740
Correct.

4065
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:37,790
Justice was done because Mazda Bell who
was winning and he still gets his wind

4066
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:38,780
bonus and Jake got you.

4067
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:40,070
It's not a happy justice.

4068
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:40,851
It's not justice.

4069
01:53:40,851 --> 01:53:42,530
It makes them feel cheer and sewing.

4070
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:44,140
It feels not chair.

4071
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,040
Who feels not changing?

4072
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:45,950
There'll be no singing.

4073
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:46,520
Nope.

4074
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,870
Zero but yeah,

4075
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:48,680
I agree with that.

4076
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,513
I think you're right.

4077
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:52,040
When you and Eddie were like
going at it back and forth,

4078
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:53,480
I'm on both of your sides.

4079
01:53:53,810 --> 01:53:54,643
I come and get him.

4080
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,641
I get it.

4081
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:56,391
Finger break.

4082
01:53:56,391 --> 01:53:57,021
It's a break.

4083
01:53:57,021 --> 01:53:59,090
It's through due to an attack.

4084
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:00,500
Look,

4085
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:01,340
honestly,

4086
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,920
anytime you feel like you,

4087
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:04,670
maybe you should stop the fight.

4088
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:08,300
You should stop the fight like almost
every time for something like that.

4089
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,320
It should you let a guy go.

4090
01:54:09,321 --> 01:54:10,250
If you can't see it all,

4091
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:13,130
whatever's right eye is 50
seconds left in the round,

4092
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:14,270
50 seconds.

4093
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,133
It's for the title.

4094
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:15,561
The guys,

4095
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:16,394
the champion,

4096
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:16,911
he can't see.

4097
01:54:16,911 --> 01:54:17,630
He says he's fine.

4098
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,290
What do you do?

4099
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:19,250
Stop at Brendan.

4100
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,233
What do you do?

4101
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,480
It's a good question because sometimes
guys go out and they win that case by

4102
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:23,791
case.

4103
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:24,560
It's case by case.

4104
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:25,281
It's hard,

4105
01:54:25,281 --> 01:54:25,761
man.

4106
01:54:25,761 --> 01:54:26,840
It is not easy.

4107
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:27,890
It's not easy,

4108
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,223
easy.

4109
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:34,040
I'm saying there's a fight and you're
in there and you know what the magnitude

4110
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:37,580
of that wind will do for your career
and get you to next level and you're

4111
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:38,270
punching and goes,

4112
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:39,103
damn dog you,

4113
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:40,370
you got me in the eye.

4114
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:41,520
You're all about in the winter.

4115
01:54:41,521 --> 01:54:41,781
You're like,

4116
01:54:41,781 --> 01:54:42,210
what?

4117
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:42,640
No,

4118
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,131
no Eddie,

4119
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:43,964
you don't.

4120
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:49,080
You're a winner as motherfucker
something with that comment.

4121
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:50,631
You're right.

4122
01:54:50,631 --> 01:54:51,620
Look you right in that,

4123
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,260
that you know that might
be part of the problem,

4124
01:54:54,261 --> 01:54:54,441
right?

4125
01:54:54,441 --> 01:54:57,680
Like a killer instinct in
the minutes it looks like,

4126
01:54:57,681 --> 01:54:58,460
I know what you're saying.

4127
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:03,020
Like it's not just the ethics of winning
or losing or under the fair here get a

4128
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:03,800
win and fighting,

4129
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,420
get out bonus and yeah.

4130
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:06,410
Is that an issue?

4131
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:08,960
Is when bonuses are when bonuses an issue.

4132
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:14,350
And did they ever exist in boxing before
MMA started adopting them in boxing?

4133
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:15,291
I don't think so.

4134
01:55:15,291 --> 01:55:16,830
Nobody's going to watch boxing.

4135
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:17,773
That's not true.

4136
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:18,440
Um,

4137
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,160
I don't think so.

4138
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:19,993
I don't think they are.

4139
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,630
No.

4140
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:22,430
I think boxers they fight for a purse.

4141
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:23,330
Yes.

4142
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:24,530
And then it's a flat fee.

4143
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:26,000
The flat fee.

4144
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:27,350
And then you got your paper if you bust.

4145
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:31,040
Is there an argument that when
bonuses make the fights more exciting?

4146
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:32,400
Uh,

4147
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,710
I don't know if you need them,

4148
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:34,040
like,

4149
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,300
cause cause people,

4150
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:37,300
I mean obviously they're
aware of women dentists,

4151
01:55:37,301 --> 01:55:37,790
but no one's like,

4152
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:38,270
God,

4153
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:41,750
I gotta make this aside and I'm going to
go do this because hopefully I get the

4154
01:55:41,751 --> 01:55:42,310
wind bonus.

4155
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:43,550
Here's Tony Ferguson.

4156
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:44,393
Does

4157
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:44,760
he,

4158
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:45,600
that's his style.

4159
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:46,500
That's his style.

4160
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:47,130
He does.

4161
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:47,870
He goes after him.

4162
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:48,091
Eddie,

4163
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:48,741
he tell you what,

4164
01:55:48,741 --> 01:55:49,680
there's wind boats or not.

4165
01:55:49,681 --> 01:55:50,610
He's going to fight like that.

4166
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,660
That's totally,

4167
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:53,160
that's in his blood.

4168
01:55:53,161 --> 01:55:54,250
Let me ask you this question.

4169
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,410
He wants to get that money.

4170
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:56,630
No,

4171
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:57,930
but friends like that,

4172
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:01,440
he's a fucking and seen him
train six hours straight.

4173
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:01,740
Um,

4174
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:02,550
you know when people say,

4175
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,750
Oh,

4176
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:03,810
I tried eight hours straight,

4177
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:05,190
I trained seven hours and you're like,

4178
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:05,431
okay,

4179
01:56:05,431 --> 01:56:07,440
you're taking all these
breaks I seen that day.

4180
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:12,620
He was trained at all God Damn Day
and in big bear in altitude mass,

4181
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:13,793
six hours,

4182
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:14,663
dude,

4183
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:19,670
hanging out with Tony Marx in big bear
made me feel like a fucking little mouse.

4184
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,520
Like Holy Shit.

4185
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:27,990
Not only where is that?

4186
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:30,030
They thought it was gonna be an Anaheim,

4187
01:56:30,031 --> 01:56:30,401
but they,

4188
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:30,650
they,

4189
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:31,201
they were like,

4190
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:31,351
oh,

4191
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:32,250
we're going to Manheim light.

4192
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,240
Remember they took,

4193
01:56:33,241 --> 01:56:34,400
they pulled the paper.

4194
01:56:34,401 --> 01:56:35,011
You from Manheim,

4195
01:56:35,011 --> 01:56:35,481
is it Paul?

4196
01:56:35,481 --> 01:56:36,110
The hundred percent.

4197
01:56:36,110 --> 01:56:36,301
Yes.

4198
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:37,230
They canceled Anaheim.

4199
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:37,410
It.

4200
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:38,670
When did it get cancelled today?

4201
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:39,051
Two days.

4202
01:56:39,051 --> 01:56:39,380
Can I have it?

4203
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:41,580
So is that official Tony and Khabib?

4204
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:44,080
It was supposed to be on the anum 800 cars

4205
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,470
schedule it.

4206
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:47,160
But that's the fight.

4207
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:47,993
But that's the fight.

4208
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,210
Fight,

4209
01:56:49,210 --> 01:56:50,043
fight,

4210
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,283
fight

4211
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,170
Conor and wants to take some time off.

4212
01:56:55,171 --> 01:56:56,730
He's about to have his first child.

4213
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,570
Totally get it.

4214
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:59,730
Tarnished fight is with
WWE and Ari Emanuel.

4215
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,030
Tony keep saying that and it
sounds like God damn mantra.

4216
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,960
It's like Donald Trump KKK.

4217
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,840
How good that's going to be anti gay

4218
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:12,960
is real fight is with Ari
menu because it's true.

4219
01:57:12,961 --> 01:57:13,650
The placard.

4220
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:14,580
It's true though.

4221
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:15,600
Whoa.

4222
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,433
Dan's got

4223
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,290
negotiation room.

4224
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:20,340
Maybe they're in a good place.

4225
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,203
Who's his girl?

4226
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:21,421
Well,

4227
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:22,590
even if they're in a good place,

4228
01:57:22,591 --> 01:57:23,370
that's the fight.

4229
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:24,870
You're a little bit of a gossiper.

4230
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,763
He like it

4231
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:30,650
little bit,

4232
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:31,830
but hey,

4233
01:57:31,831 --> 01:57:32,664
but

4234
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:37,770
Robert Dinero was good fellas.

4235
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:38,893
Guys out

4236
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:43,910
little bet little bars
when he says you were a

4237
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,580
little bit,

4238
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,130
little bit,

4239
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:48,610
little bit,

4240
01:57:48,610 --> 01:57:49,830
go get your shine box.

4241
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:54,270
That's a great stabs him
in the neck to the pen.

4242
01:57:54,410 --> 01:57:55,243
Great team.

4243
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:56,253
Um,

4244
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,240
so yeah,

4245
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,370
but I'm not wrong because when Conor goes,

4246
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:00,600
and I still have some inside info,

4247
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:01,523
but when we caught him,

4248
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:02,850
but when Conor goes,

4249
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:03,870
when Conor goes,

4250
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,760
I need a portion of the company now,

4251
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:06,350
I'm not finding,

4252
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:07,183
if you give me that,

4253
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:09,080
who's his battle with Tony Ferguson?

4254
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,170
It could be they don't,

4255
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:11,670
they have no ownership of that.

4256
01:58:11,671 --> 01:58:12,900
They don't have control of that.

4257
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:17,760
Here's why it's foolish to get a
portion of the company because he,

4258
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:22,761
by very nature of his dynamic being and
presence makes the paper views that he's

4259
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:25,050
on spectacular.

4260
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,960
He doesn't elevate the other paper views.

4261
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,160
So when he's there is,

4262
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:30,700
he was saying,

4263
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,220
should you get a percentage
of the paper views?

4264
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:33,780
Absolutely does.

4265
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:34,650
He does.

4266
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,750
He should get a percentage of the company.

4267
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:39,720
You would have to prove that
you're making the company bigger.

4268
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:40,201
No,

4269
01:58:40,201 --> 01:58:40,831
you're not.

4270
01:58:40,831 --> 01:58:42,190
You're making yourself bigger.

4271
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:43,121
And he is.

4272
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:43,600
He's by,

4273
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,530
in my opinion,

4274
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:46,180
the most famous,

4275
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:49,360
but by four fights that he draws for,

4276
01:58:49,361 --> 01:58:52,090
he will get compensated for
an extraordinary manner.

4277
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,193
The idea,

4278
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:54,850
the idea of him,

4279
01:58:54,851 --> 01:58:59,851
him being an owner of the entire company
based on what he's able to do in his

4280
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:04,060
own individual paper views
is that would be foolhardy.

4281
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:04,923
But what about,

4282
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:05,860
what about mark time,

4283
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,190
obviously not a businessman,

4284
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:12,940
but just what about Conor McGregor?

4285
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:17,670
Like fucking he doesn't get paid paid
Affleck and like he can be listened to

4286
01:59:17,671 --> 01:59:18,580
more in the country.

4287
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,200
Why did it not get pulled?

4288
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:21,880
Because it didn't have
a fucking title fight.

4289
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:22,661
What does that mean?

4290
01:59:22,661 --> 01:59:27,661
That the UFC without gigantic stars like
Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey or John

4291
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:32,050
Jones or Petterson Holloway without
the killers nobody wants to watch.

4292
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,033
Correct.

4293
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:33,730
Correct.

4294
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,220
Should be,

4295
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,610
and I want to pay for pain killers,

4296
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:37,331
part of guests,

4297
01:59:37,331 --> 01:59:41,530
superstars make the company that you
can have some fights and colors by you

4298
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,460
fights.

4299
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:45,730
You can have some fights that are
paper view fights without without world

4300
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:46,564
champions on it.

4301
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:51,660
It is totally possible if you had a
bunch of Cowboy Matt Brown type fights on

4302
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:54,490
and you know just a bunch of them
and none of them for the world title.

4303
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:56,660
You're telling me what new watch
you tell me when you watch.

4304
01:59:56,661 --> 01:59:57,101
He will heal.

4305
01:59:57,101 --> 01:59:57,431
Well,

4306
01:59:57,431 --> 02:00:00,780
Romero versus a Luke Rockhold a drawl.

4307
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:02,730
You tell me you would watch that.

4308
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:03,750
I'm not talking to

4309
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:10,570
a socialist and unions and shit.

4310
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:10,920
Yeah,

4311
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,360
you fucking union.

4312
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,140
Cause I left winger.

4313
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,390
Daddy knows what's up.

4314
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:24,093
Info wars.

4315
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,451
Oh Jordan,

4316
02:00:25,451 --> 02:00:26,530
me and versus a meal.

4317
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:27,070
Meek.

4318
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:29,300
That's a good fucking join.

4319
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,410
Kt Kelvin Jordan Meehan on Cyborg.

4320
02:00:32,411 --> 02:00:37,411
The male Cyborg in Strikeforce landed
one of the most devastating fucking elbow

4321
02:00:37,601 --> 02:00:42,601
combinations to put outside Borg and
Amil Meek is a guy who beat up to keen

4322
02:00:43,031 --> 02:00:43,690
mule.

4323
02:00:43,690 --> 02:00:47,800
He knocked out to Kenya when he
first got kicked out of the UFC.

4324
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:48,611
When who's smart?

4325
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:50,200
Paul Horez got kicked out of the UFC.

4326
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,600
He fought this mad viking and meal meek.

4327
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,830
He'd beat the fuck out of him.

4328
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:55,120
He killed him in the first round.

4329
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:56,910
What's Turkeys Code?

4330
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:01,840
He keeps hitting KOD cause he had been
pictures legs off and Emma and Jujitsu.

4331
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:02,990
He fought Gary Cohn.

4332
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:06,190
Tonin in a straight up
traditional went to draw.

4333
02:01:06,191 --> 02:01:08,350
But Gary Tonin was dominating.

4334
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:08,861
Gary.

4335
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:11,330
Tony was attacking him way
more than he was tapped.

4336
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:13,180
How scary to Keno was for a while.

4337
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:13,721
And here's the thing,

4338
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:16,580
Gary Tonin is maybe 30
pounds lighter than I am.

4339
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:18,010
No Bush won best in the world.

4340
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:22,720
I'm just saying and crass
Chino was Paula Harris.

4341
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:25,480
Motherfuckers were terrified.

4342
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:29,710
You know why I was fascinated about that
fight was not just the Gary tone as a

4343
02:01:29,711 --> 02:01:30,280
motherfucker,

4344
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:35,140
but that John Donahoe and I had this
conversation about the entrances that uh,

4345
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:36,310
Tokyo uses,

4346
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:36,971
you know,

4347
02:01:36,971 --> 02:01:38,710
and I'm like the entrance is how he,

4348
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:42,560
how he establishes the entrance into his
techniques that he has like some pretty

4349
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:44,120
obvious entrances.

4350
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,781
He's like,

4351
02:01:44,781 --> 02:01:48,230
he's kind of basic in the way he
approaches leg locks and like his,

4352
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:53,200
his take was that they would always
be like one step ahead of them.

4353
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:53,810
Like I mentioned,

4354
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:56,250
the strength would run out
and recommend cause you,

4355
02:01:56,251 --> 02:01:58,400
you can see it coming so
you know how to stop it.

4356
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:02,660
That's how high level and sophisticated
that whole Eddie Cummings Yup.

4357
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,101
Hands up.

4358
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:06,210
Well it's John Danaher
is a big part of it.

4359
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:06,640
Oh yeah.

4360
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,371
But he was also,

4361
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:08,420
there's a ton of guys,

4362
02:02:08,421 --> 02:02:12,080
Dean lister contributed to that in a
big way because he came over there.

4363
02:02:12,081 --> 02:02:12,390
There's a,

4364
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:14,750
there's a lot of leg lock
knowledge that came out of there,

4365
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:16,550
but even so,

4366
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:21,470
g o still one knee behind
last night through respect.

4367
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:23,250
It was sent to jail.

4368
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:24,220
Dude,

4369
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:26,730
I like the way you brought that
down and did bring it back and you

4370
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,333
tell everybody,

4371
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:31,530
give it a name drop.

4372
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,130
Tell stories.

4373
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:35,260
The most feared leg rocker she Omani.

4374
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,070
He says the most fear,

4375
02:02:38,071 --> 02:02:39,860
the freak show I think is the best Lego.

4376
02:02:39,861 --> 02:02:40,320
I call.

4377
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,230
I call him Eddie leg lock Cummings.

4378
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,770
Well I do.

4379
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:44,460
She probably taught,

4380
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:45,293
stop talking.

4381
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:46,890
You guys be shut off for a moment.

4382
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:47,753
I'll wrap it up.

4383
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:48,540
I'll bring it.

4384
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,373
I'll bring it back.

4385
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:49,920
Keep calling.

4386
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:50,753
Who's calling?

4387
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,030
I don't know.

4388
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,531
Don't fight it.

4389
02:02:53,531 --> 02:02:54,364
This hasn't gone.

4390
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:56,280
It's so Hutto Benevidez coming up.

4391
02:02:56,281 --> 02:02:56,610
Sorry.

4392
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:57,443
Go ahead.

4393
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:03,930
Most of Eddie Cummins fights an n Ebi
and just me as just the Jujitsu guy

4394
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,300
watching him like right
there on top of it.

4395
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:09,280
I can't fucking believe it,

4396
02:03:09,281 --> 02:03:09,610
man.

4397
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:13,780
Eddie Cummins as just mow in
through fucking everybody.

4398
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:15,610
The whole damn her crew,

4399
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:16,391
Gary,

4400
02:03:16,391 --> 02:03:17,530
Tony and Gordon Ryan,

4401
02:03:17,531 --> 02:03:20,600
the fucking everybody up
with those leg box manic.

4402
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:23,050
They got a super sophisticated,

4403
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:25,420
highly complex leg lock system and,

4404
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,220
and you know,

4405
02:03:27,490 --> 02:03:28,840
once Ebi,

4406
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:29,470
uh,

4407
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:30,160
came out,

4408
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:34,540
that's when it was exposed
and me as a teacher,

4409
02:03:34,541 --> 02:03:35,110
I thought,

4410
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:35,531
fuck,

4411
02:03:35,531 --> 02:03:40,090
I thought I was already a
leg lock friendly enough.

4412
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:44,700
I had a bunch of leg lock wizards all
over the association there were there

4413
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:45,331
everyone I thought,

4414
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:45,630
oh,

4415
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:47,500
I'm totally open on leg locks.

4416
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:48,341
Me Personally,

4417
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:49,840
I'm not heavy into heel hooks,

4418
02:03:49,841 --> 02:03:50,770
but man,

4419
02:03:50,771 --> 02:03:55,771
I love the fact that every class has
like three heel hook fucking just dudes

4420
02:03:55,961 --> 02:03:56,830
that are obsessed with it.

4421
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:57,731
And,

4422
02:03:57,731 --> 02:03:59,440
but that wasn't enough once Abi came,

4423
02:03:59,450 --> 02:03:59,800
I'm like,

4424
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:02,650
that wasn't enough liquid.

4425
02:04:02,651 --> 02:04:03,370
These guys,

4426
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:08,370
when you obsess with leg locks in the
system and every possibility in every

4427
02:04:08,591 --> 02:04:12,430
counter and the way Danaher's
put that system together,

4428
02:04:12,431 --> 02:04:13,240
man,

4429
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:13,620
man,

4430
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:18,070
now I realized right away I got to
get fucking mid evil with this shit.

4431
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:20,740
So we did over the last
couple of years and

4432
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:25,580
cause he feel to feel like you're
competing a little bit with John or 100% I

4433
02:04:25,581 --> 02:04:27,150
love that 100% yes,

4434
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:28,560
there's that.

4435
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,371
There's an IB,

4436
02:04:29,371 --> 02:04:30,870
j j f crew,

4437
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:32,910
you know the like the people,

4438
02:04:32,911 --> 02:04:33,960
the fans and the,

4439
02:04:33,961 --> 02:04:34,181
and,

4440
02:04:34,181 --> 02:04:34,770
and the,

4441
02:04:34,770 --> 02:04:35,603
the competitors.

4442
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:38,220
There's the Danaher crew and they're like,

4443
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,360
they're like Conor Mcgregor,

4444
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:39,601
you know,

4445
02:04:39,601 --> 02:04:42,840
cause like Gordon Ryan's kind
of outspoken and you know,

4446
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:44,970
he's like wearing a
crown everywhere he goes.

4447
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:46,440
And Gary Tone and he's like,

4448
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:47,990
he's,

4449
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:50,040
he's there were all super cool man.

4450
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:53,730
And then Eddie come and just like
the coolest motherfucker ever.

4451
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,490
Eddie come astrophysicists.

4452
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:59,160
Cool ass dude.

4453
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:00,780
I never just,

4454
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,730
all those guys are awesome man.

4455
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:06,480
And I would Danaher's done
with that leg lock system.

4456
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:07,201
Did he just,

4457
02:05:07,201 --> 02:05:11,820
so he took what Dean lists or showed
him dean lister came down in the late

4458
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:16,470
nineties and at Hanzo school and dropped
some heel hook knowledge on Danaher and

4459
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:18,120
Danner just systemize that shit.

4460
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:19,320
Blew it the fuck up.

4461
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:20,460
And if you're not paying it,

4462
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:24,300
paying attention to the Jujitsu
world and the sub only movement,

4463
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:26,160
the Danaher Death Squad,

4464
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:27,960
Eddie Cummings,

4465
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:29,070
uh,

4466
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:29,581
Gordon,

4467
02:05:29,581 --> 02:05:30,180
Ryan,

4468
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:31,110
Gary Tonin,

4469
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:31,993
even uh,

4470
02:05:32,010 --> 02:05:32,940
Gordon Ryan's brother,

4471
02:05:32,941 --> 02:05:33,750
Nicky Ron,

4472
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,583
they got there,

4473
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:39,860
they got this leg lock system that no
one can fuck with their bowling through

4474
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:42,810
our distributor bar districts
mowing through every,

4475
02:05:42,811 --> 02:05:43,200
everybody

4476
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,220
that grill artistry.

4477
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:44,560
Yeah.

4478
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:44,921
You feel it.

4479
02:05:44,921 --> 02:05:48,060
You feel like that that's what
did you feel like you were,

4480
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:50,540
at what point when you
were rolling Jujitsu,

4481
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:55,550
did you feel like it became more art than
sport in that you were improvising as

4482
02:05:56,851 --> 02:05:59,370
you went along in that
everything was a reaction.

4483
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:02,670
Everything was sort of
predicated by your mindset,

4484
02:06:02,671 --> 02:06:03,570
your mood,

4485
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:04,350
uh,

4486
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:05,340
of that day,

4487
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:08,900
what that person was doing and do what
the mood of the day that I could tell it

4488
02:06:08,901 --> 02:06:12,870
had to do with it just had to do with
how many times can you do a movement and,

4489
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:14,100
and train your body,

4490
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:17,340
your body at whatever you do,

4491
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:20,610
tell became backs,

4492
02:06:20,611 --> 02:06:21,211
basketball,

4493
02:06:21,211 --> 02:06:22,020
whatever you do.

4494
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:24,150
If you do it over and over and over again.

4495
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:27,930
If you're working in a factory and you
got a job or you're doing something,

4496
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:28,950
the more you do it,

4497
02:06:28,951 --> 02:06:29,551
whatever it is,

4498
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:31,050
putting this contraption here,

4499
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:33,000
you're going to be so fucking good at it.

4500
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,540
Pam,

4501
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:35,220
your body is,

4502
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:39,360
will master anything you tell
it to do a thousand times,

4503
02:06:39,361 --> 02:06:40,194
right.

4504
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:42,360
So it becomes a language
you're flowing in that you're,

4505
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,470
that you know,

4506
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,120
physically that you know.

4507
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:45,870
Uh,

4508
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:46,550
uh,

4509
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:47,420
so it's like in the

4510
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:52,770
a building fucking blocks,

4511
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:54,600
the factory work and whatever,

4512
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:55,860
it's all about numbers.

4513
02:06:55,861 --> 02:06:58,080
It's just practice makes perfect.

4514
02:06:58,081 --> 02:07:03,081
It's just how the more you do what your
body will end up doing it magically and

4515
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:06,600
you'd have to just kind of like executive
produce things and your body just

4516
02:07:06,601 --> 02:07:07,560
doesn't magically like,

4517
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:08,603
like uh,

4518
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,380
like tying your shoes,

4519
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:15,040
like playing violin when you're shredding
on violin or a piano or whatever type

4520
02:07:15,041 --> 02:07:18,090
Brian or type that shit typing.

4521
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:18,971
When you type it,

4522
02:07:18,971 --> 02:07:22,860
you just sort of thinking like now I've
been typing for so many years and not,

4523
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:24,330
I'm not perfect match a fuck up.

4524
02:07:24,331 --> 02:07:25,080
But when I type,

4525
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,130
when I'm in the groove,

4526
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:26,370
yeah.

4527
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:29,880
I'm just looking at the screen of
thinking and then the words just start,

4528
02:07:29,881 --> 02:07:30,810
my fingers start moving.

4529
02:07:30,811 --> 02:07:34,110
It's weird you send it because
I was typing and my father said,

4530
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,170
Jesus Christ,

4531
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:36,003
you type fast,

4532
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,270
and it didn't even dawn on me.

4533
02:07:37,271 --> 02:07:37,661
I was like,

4534
02:07:37,661 --> 02:07:37,990
Huh.

4535
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:39,160
Well that's what Dan has done.

4536
02:07:39,210 --> 02:07:41,830
We learned that's what they've done.

4537
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:44,080
They've gotten a system down and they,

4538
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:44,801
what happened,

4539
02:07:44,801 --> 02:07:45,011
Jim,

4540
02:07:45,011 --> 02:07:47,320
they understand practice makes perfect.

4541
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:47,770
Right.

4542
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:50,830
And they understand that
perfect practice makes perfect.

4543
02:07:50,831 --> 02:07:51,440
Right?

4544
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:51,891
Exactly.

4545
02:07:51,891 --> 02:07:52,070
Yeah.

4546
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:52,820
That's even better.

4547
02:07:52,820 --> 02:07:53,653
Yeah.

4548
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:53,940
No,

4549
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,360
I love that about life.

4550
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:58,510
I love that about the idea that you can
master something that you definitely

4551
02:07:58,511 --> 02:07:59,070
can.

4552
02:07:59,070 --> 02:07:59,800
Yeah.

4553
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:01,150
I mean you get better at anything.

4554
02:08:01,151 --> 02:08:02,310
You put your time too.

4555
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:03,280
If you don't get perfect,

4556
02:08:03,281 --> 02:08:04,330
it's so worthwhile.

4557
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:08,780
Does never ever endeavoring down that
road that the reaching for it is,

4558
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:10,210
is the whole lesson,

4559
02:08:10,211 --> 02:08:10,540
right?

4560
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:10,720
Yeah.

4561
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:11,890
You'll have milestones.

4562
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,580
Yes.

4563
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:14,110
But the through those milestones,

4564
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:15,300
the the most important things,

4565
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:18,910
you'd just enjoying the process and then
one day you wake up and you realize,

4566
02:08:18,911 --> 02:08:19,540
Whoa,

4567
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,380
we look at or I could do.

4568
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:21,790
Are you always learning
what you do through?

4569
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:22,061
Are you,

4570
02:08:22,061 --> 02:08:24,080
do you feel like you're
kind of over it all?

4571
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:24,430
Man,

4572
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,150
everybody.

4573
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:28,700
Everybody learns for what we're talking
about right now with what Danaher's

4574
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:31,260
dealt with the leg lock system and what
they've done with and that you're just

4575
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,130
completely dominate that.

4576
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:38,460
Bringing it back to the GL Martinez wind
last night he beat Geo or he beat Eddie

4577
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,900
Cummings in the finals
at Ebi 10 last night.

4578
02:08:40,901 --> 02:08:42,130
I was just in Mexico City.

4579
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:43,210
It was,

4580
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:43,940
what'd you give it back?

4581
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:45,610
Yeti nuts this morning.

4582
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:49,090
Damn jetlag or no dude,

4583
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,073
it was just,

4584
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,641
it was just,

4585
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:54,400
that was no jet lag about to get
turnt up in Austin this weekend.

4586
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,470
What's was gone this week?

4587
02:08:56,471 --> 02:08:57,490
I think we hate each other,

4588
02:08:57,491 --> 02:08:58,960
but were commentating together.

4589
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:01,060
Why did they think people are just silly?

4590
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:03,100
So you know what,

4591
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:05,800
like this conversation that happened
in the beginning of this podcast when

4592
02:09:05,801 --> 02:09:06,670
everybody went crazy.

4593
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:07,120
Yeah.

4594
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,540
We're like the best trends.

4595
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:09,930
I don't feel bad about it.

4596
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,080
You guys don't feel bad about it.

4597
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:11,730
I'm a little bit,

4598
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:12,563
but here's the

4599
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:14,771
thing,

4600
02:09:14,771 --> 02:09:15,131
man,

4601
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:18,010
is that thing that like
people have to understand you.

4602
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,680
You're allowed to disagree
about shit and still be cool.

4603
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:21,730
You could be both.

4604
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:22,653
Well not only that,

4605
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:24,100
you don't have to disagree
with something and go,

4606
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:25,810
you're cause you're a fucking retard.

4607
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,840
That's why every fucking look at is Eddie
is Eddie wants to solve a problem and

4608
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:32,560
Eddie like when I think

4609
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:35,410
we're going to go deep into the router.

4610
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:37,060
No,

4611
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:37,751
not doing that.

4612
02:09:37,751 --> 02:09:38,584
I'm not doing that.

4613
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:42,283
No.

4614
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:44,140
Listen everyone.

4615
02:09:44,141 --> 02:09:44,860
Listen.

4616
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:48,610
What I'm saying is that when somebody
is passionate and cares about the world

4617
02:09:48,611 --> 02:09:50,830
and wants a world to be a
better place like he does,

4618
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:52,870
that's where it's coming on the same team.

4619
02:09:52,871 --> 02:09:53,410
That's where it,

4620
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:53,890
yeah.

4621
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:54,820
So when you know that,

4622
02:09:54,821 --> 02:09:57,670
when you know that he's genuinely a
good person through his fucking core,

4623
02:09:57,671 --> 02:09:58,840
which I know that about him,

4624
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:01,590
like Eddie seven different point of view.

4625
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:02,670
I've texted Eddie about,

4626
02:10:02,671 --> 02:10:03,221
but there's no way.

4627
02:10:03,221 --> 02:10:05,760
There's no way I'm going to
look at Eddie is like that.

4628
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:06,431
I can't do that.

4629
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:06,940
What do I said?

4630
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:07,773
You bought it online?

4631
02:10:07,930 --> 02:10:10,150
I've always had like a bottom line.

4632
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:15,520
Is this the bottom line is
I think they are fucking us,

4633
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:16,660
right?

4634
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:16,781
Oh,

4635
02:10:16,781 --> 02:10:17,070
it's,

4636
02:10:17,070 --> 02:10:17,903
that's what I think.

4637
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:20,390
They are fucking and you meet everyone.

4638
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,090
Everyone's over back in jail.

4639
02:10:22,091 --> 02:10:22,924
Shit.

4640
02:10:23,210 --> 02:10:24,043
Goddammit.

4641
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:25,033

4646
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,120
don't think you're fucking me.

4647
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:37,460

oh no,

4767
02:14:08,411 --> 02:14:09,440
no,

4768
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:09,691
no.

4769
02:14:09,691 --> 02:14:10,200
I'm down.

4770
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,011
I'm down with dinner.

4771
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:11,251
No,

4772
02:14:11,251 --> 02:14:11,401
no,

4773
02:14:11,401 --> 02:14:12,230
forget it now.

4774
02:14:12,230 --> 02:14:12,451
No,

4775
02:14:12,451 --> 02:14:13,590
no boys.

4776
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:14,371
Boys,

4777
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:15,840
please bet no.

4778
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:17,190
Can I bet for some money?

4779
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:17,960
Yes.

4780
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:18,160
You,

4781
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:18,590
Britain,

4782
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:19,423
France

4783
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:28,540
and he a hundred I'm just as bad.

4784
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:30,610
We're in.

4785
02:14:30,610 --> 02:14:32,220
We're when we got action.

4786
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:32,701
Fuck.

4787
02:14:32,701 --> 02:14:33,420
Yeah.

4788
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:35,820
I just want everyone to know
that I'm not betting on anybody.

4789
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:37,170
That Emilia backer.

4790
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:37,480
Yeah.

4791
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:39,730
You're giving them a Lennon.

4792
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:40,583
Why you have so much?

4793
02:14:40,730 --> 02:14:41,563
Oh,

4794
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,930
and chose a friend of mine,

4795
02:14:42,931 --> 02:14:43,910
so of course it would.

4796
02:14:43,911 --> 02:14:47,430
It would go for him was a friend of
yours because Joe's a friend of mine.

4797
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:47,701
Oh,

4798
02:14:47,701 --> 02:14:49,560
well Joe Benevidez is a
friend of mine as well.

4799
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:50,930
I looked and I love so who to?

4800
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,331
Oh,

4801
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:52,010
nut kick.

4802
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:52,843
Oh,

4803
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:54,030
that's some honor right there.

4804
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,050
Respect to that.

4805
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:55,913
Right?

4806
02:14:57,050 --> 02:14:57,631
It's different.

4807
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:58,760
He understood the nutcase.

4808
02:14:58,800 --> 02:14:59,161
Yes,

4809
02:14:59,161 --> 02:14:59,430
you're right.

4810
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:00,030
It's illegal.

4811
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:00,271
Right.

4812
02:15:00,271 --> 02:15:01,051
Punches to the finger.

4813
02:15:01,051 --> 02:15:01,680
Not Illegal,

4814
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:03,170
but he recognized it was correct.

4815
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:05,460
Not kicked a little
different as a respect thing,

4816
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:06,030
man.

4817
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:06,271
There's,

4818
02:15:06,271 --> 02:15:08,040
that's a bad thing when you see a guy.

4819
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:08,311
No,

4820
02:15:08,311 --> 02:15:09,700
he kicked the dude in the nuts and then go

4821
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:12,780
was dead on.

4822
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:14,340
That's going to be honest.

4823
02:15:14,341 --> 02:15:17,280
A little bit more taint than
balls still hurts though still,

4824
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:21,730
and she gets the Obama that sad.

4825
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:21,960
No,

4826
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:23,010
I'm not an apologist.

4827
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,510
I'm not a neighbor list.

4828
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:29,250
I'm not a nut shot now eve Levine
and let you get your ass whooped.

4829
02:15:29,251 --> 02:15:30,440
Now he's been known to let it go.

4830
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:31,783
Oh,

4831
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,220
well he's no Steve Gaudy,

4832
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:33,871
but yeah,

4833
02:15:33,871 --> 02:15:35,070
he'll let you tap for a little bit.

4834
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:39,280
[inaudible]

4835
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:40,133
my favorite.

4836
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,060
I love you.

4837
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:50,150
Got To let anything happen.

4838
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:50,660
Hey,

4839
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:52,590
it must have gotten stuck
and rough and texts me.

4840
02:15:52,591 --> 02:15:53,850
I'll fucking watch it anywhere.

4841
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,640
Maurice was taking his fingers into Jake,

4842
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:59,130
Jake shields eyes and
massive guy just sat there.

4843
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:01,660
Maza got all the best highlights
or Mazda honey fights.

4844
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:02,370
You ever notice that?

4845
02:16:02,370 --> 02:16:02,820
Yeah.

4846
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:02,970
Well,

4847
02:16:02,970 --> 02:16:06,900
how bout when Mazda Gotti was reffing
Brock Lesnar versus Frank Mir?

4848
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:10,260
Almost a separated his hips from his legs,

4849
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:12,330
tapping like Taylor hit
him in the Dick Again,

4850
02:16:12,970 --> 02:16:13,803
Roy.

4851
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:16,290
He's a no nonsense,

4852
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:17,400
no bullshit aside,

4853
02:16:17,401 --> 02:16:17,851
joking around.

4854
02:16:17,851 --> 02:16:18,600
I love eve.

4855
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,830
He's a no nonsense guy.

4856
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:22,230
If he thinks that that is a two in a row,

4857
02:16:22,231 --> 02:16:24,270
he will take a point
and here's the argument,

4858
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:24,960
right?

4859
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,550
If it was unintentional,

4860
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:27,630
should you take a point?

4861
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:27,961
Well,

4862
02:16:27,961 --> 02:16:28,860
here's the problem.

4863
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,400
The damage done.

4864
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:30,970
Oh,

4865
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:34,130
Benevidez is legit as far
as like it diminishes him.

4866
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:37,960
So that is worth more than a point on his,

4867
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:39,640
his potential performance.

4868
02:16:39,641 --> 02:16:40,630
Same with an eye poke.

4869
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:40,930
Yeah,

4870
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:42,520
got to get my books even worse.

4871
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:43,920
I poke right away.

4872
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:44,860
Should be a point taken away.

4873
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:46,390
I think you're 100% correct.

4874
02:16:46,391 --> 02:16:48,000
It changes the magnitude of the fight.

4875
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:48,551
I agree with him.

4876
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:50,320
100% agreed with him.

4877
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:53,320
100% Eddie Bravo thinks
that Brian count is a bar.

4878
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:54,940
I think he's gotten so drunk.

4879
02:16:54,941 --> 02:16:57,040
He's just holding as Gladys out to Brian.

4880
02:16:57,041 --> 02:16:58,590
Callan is not even looking at him.

4881
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:01,630
Shab who's a loving that point.

4882
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:02,464
You've got to pull out

4883
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:07,720
Washington Post for a driver.

4884
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:08,570
I got it.

4885
02:17:08,570 --> 02:17:09,080
Yeah.

4886
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:09,570
Mantra.

4887
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:11,020
You can throw those kicks like that.

4888
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:12,610
You can't and you're
not disciplined enough.

4889
02:17:12,611 --> 02:17:13,570
You can't throw the kicks.

4890
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:15,440
They're moving targets.

4891
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:18,310
Taekwondo in 10th grade.

4892
02:17:18,311 --> 02:17:19,010
Say Stop It.

4893
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:21,850
Those kids moved a little too tiny

4894
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:25,870
quiet in 10th grade.

4895
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:31,530
I'm just picturing guys named Chad with
no fucking facial hair at this balance

4896
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:32,210
here,

4897
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:32,440
man.

4898
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:33,720
I said switches.

4899
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:36,430
Dances with no fucking
plan for the fences.

4900
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:39,970
Random colored belt.

4901
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:40,151
Oh,

4902
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:41,080
this fight is awesome.

4903
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,020
Bra.

4904
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:42,371
Who knows?

4905
02:17:42,371 --> 02:17:45,250
Walking him down pissed because
his last fight off suitors.

4906
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:46,870
Demetrius Johnson got annihilated.

4907
02:17:46,890 --> 02:17:51,670
So these also probably pissed because
he's lost one point already in this first

4908
02:17:51,671 --> 02:17:51,971
round,

4909
02:17:51,971 --> 02:17:52,661
so he's got a wind.

4910
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:53,540
Significantly.

4911
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:57,280
Brian would be a draw because if he's
with one point he's been winning the whole

4912
02:17:57,281 --> 02:18:00,730
fight less Benevidez does something
strong and which he'll when it,

4913
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,230
oh crap,

4914
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:03,310
but you know what man?

4915
02:18:03,311 --> 02:18:04,750
Sometimes some people take a point away.

4916
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:05,710
They automatically say,

4917
02:18:05,711 --> 02:18:07,930
well that guy is losing the fight now.

4918
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:09,820
Like it's almost like
a psychological thing.

4919
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:11,890
The judges are tough man by tough.

4920
02:18:11,891 --> 02:18:12,724
Some of them,

4921
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:13,930
some of them are not good.

4922
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:14,100
No,

4923
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:15,220
some of them are not good.

4924
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:16,960
Some of them definitely not good.

4925
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:18,123
Let me ask you this.

4926
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:21,340
What did you think of the
Tyron Woodley Wonderboy fight?

4927
02:18:21,341 --> 02:18:22,174
Have you watched that fight?

4928
02:18:22,410 --> 02:18:23,710
I called it a judge.

4929
02:18:24,010 --> 02:18:24,843
I think you're right.

4930
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:26,051
I think you were Brian,

4931
02:18:26,051 --> 02:18:27,310
what I say to you before,

4932
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:28,300
before they came out,

4933
02:18:28,301 --> 02:18:29,134
when he was my,

4934
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:29,973
my thinking,

4935
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:34,360
I think it's only a draw
because we look at fights wrong.

4936
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:37,900
I think Woodley one because he
did a way more way more damage,

4937
02:18:37,901 --> 02:18:39,070
way more knocked them down.

4938
02:18:39,350 --> 02:18:40,183
You're the fight.

4939
02:18:40,390 --> 02:18:41,320
How about that kid he had,

4940
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:45,090
he had moments of total dominance like
that first round when he got on top of

4941
02:18:45,091 --> 02:18:45,220
it.

4942
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:48,280
There was never a point where Wonderboy
was running the fight and it was a vat

4943
02:18:48,281 --> 02:18:48,830
should be.

4944
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:50,890
There should be like a
point aspect to that.

4945
02:18:50,891 --> 02:18:51,580
I agree with you.

4946
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:51,911
You're right.

4947
02:18:51,911 --> 02:18:52,330
Correct.

4948
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,060
You're right.

4949
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:56,830
I used to this moments where you're like
maybe like you land a jab and he lands

4950
02:18:56,831 --> 02:18:59,050
a leg kick and what's
better and what's worse.

4951
02:18:59,051 --> 02:19:00,160
And there's a debatable moment.

4952
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:03,160
But when Woodley took him down and beat
him up with the first round and smashes

4953
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,000
nose open,

4954
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,330
that was a significant and the guilty.

4955
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:09,540
How about the punches that
led to the Guillotine?

4956
02:19:09,541 --> 02:19:09,841
Yes.

4957
02:19:09,841 --> 02:19:10,360
It had him hurt.

4958
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:11,230
Almost had him finished.

4959
02:19:11,231 --> 02:19:13,690
So he made a mistake going for the guilty.

4960
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:16,270
He probably did fine.

4961
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:16,691
Yeah,

4962
02:19:16,691 --> 02:19:17,290
you're probably right.

4963
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:18,220
Let's watch this fight.

4964
02:19:18,221 --> 02:19:19,410
You Fuck No.

4965
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:22,000
But to Joe's point is my hand right now,

4966
02:19:22,001 --> 02:19:22,340
right?

4967
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:26,380
I won the fight in fight aspects.

4968
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:27,214
He won the fight.

4969
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:28,250
Some shit

4970
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,010
that happened that he's
right and he's right.

4971
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:32,203
You're both right.

4972
02:19:32,490 --> 02:19:33,111
And any problems,

4973
02:19:33,111 --> 02:19:36,660
the voice of reason who to fucking ever
thought these guys are having 15 bands.

4974
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,530
That's why for now,

4975
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:42,670
really way one third and they're amazing.

4976
02:19:42,671 --> 02:19:44,600
But there was a bed shut the fuck Yo.

4977
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,310
I mean Brandon got dammit.

4978
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:47,750
You fucking giant.

4979
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,160
Giant privilege.

4980
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:51,620
Giant privilege.

4981
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,510
The viewers would agree with me.

4982
02:19:53,511 --> 02:19:57,560
He left writing critically different
male privilege and giant privilege.

4983
02:19:57,561 --> 02:19:58,750
You're a disgusting humans.

4984
02:19:58,751 --> 02:20:01,370
There's nothing bad ever happened to him.

4985
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,660
He's never had any bad.

4986
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,660
You have four thirsty
blues of white privilege.

4987
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,810
You have big Dick Privilege,

4988
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:10,550
podcasts,

4989
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:11,480
privilege.

4990
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,230
It's got it all.

4991
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:13,580
You're the son of a bitch.

4992
02:20:13,581 --> 02:20:17,140
I knew that John Privilege so stupid.

4993
02:20:17,150 --> 02:20:17,781
Son of a bitch.

4994
02:20:17,781 --> 02:20:19,490
He's like a fucking son of a bitch.

4995
02:20:19,491 --> 02:20:20,271
Shut the 10 years.

4996
02:20:20,271 --> 02:20:21,560
Move out of the way out of a bitch.

4997
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,200
Fuck her.

4998
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:22,900
There's going to be that,

4999
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:23,661
that one night,

5000
02:20:23,661 --> 02:20:23,931
Brian,

5001
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:24,890
when he can't follow them.

5002
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:26,600
I know you son of a bitch.

5003
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:28,790
I know it was paid out
how to be funny than me.

5004
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:33,840
They're funnier with your fat garden
hose dangling out of the inside of your

5005
02:20:33,861 --> 02:20:34,694
jeans.

5006
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:36,470
What the fuck is that?

5007
02:20:36,471 --> 02:20:37,700
How about you tuck that thing,

5008
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:40,820
that bad boy and hide
it from the children?

5009
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:42,830
Do Your fucking job.

5010
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:43,790
Put it away.

5011
02:20:43,930 --> 02:20:44,690
God,

5012
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:45,523
the soccer away.

5013
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:48,440
Did you guys see the road
runner killed a rattlesnake?

5014
02:20:48,441 --> 02:20:50,000
I've shown everybody on own casting.

5015
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:50,511
No,

5016
02:20:50,511 --> 02:20:51,111
I haven't seen it.

5017
02:20:51,111 --> 02:20:51,944
Roadrunners,

5018
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:54,590
fucking kill and eat rattlesnakes.

5019
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:55,453
Fuck,

5020
02:20:56,930 --> 02:20:57,763
that's bird.

5021
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:58,040
Yeah.

5022
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,630
You look at a road runner rattlesnake.

5023
02:20:59,631 --> 02:20:59,961
You would say,

5024
02:20:59,961 --> 02:21:01,710
well for sure the rattlesnakes
are eating the road.

5025
02:21:01,711 --> 02:21:02,544
Runners

5026
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:04,550
roadrunners,

5027
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:05,250
eat watched.

5028
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:07,340
It runs from the rattlesnake.

5029
02:21:07,360 --> 02:21:08,700
It incorrect.

5030
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:09,740
The road runners hunting it.

5031
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:10,250
Damn.

5032
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:11,330
Oh is literally hunt.

5033
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,670
Look at that dinosaur looks
nothing like the cause.

5034
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,600
They're up close.

5035
02:21:14,601 --> 02:21:16,100
When you're a close look at this shit.

5036
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:17,750
The road one are so fast.

5037
02:21:17,751 --> 02:21:19,300
One C shop away.

5038
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,210
Camera tricks.

5039
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:21,980
Well look,

5040
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:22,461
it's right there.

5041
02:21:22,461 --> 02:21:23,294
You didn't see that.

5042
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,081
This is,

5043
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:25,910
I looked it up after I saw this video.

5044
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:27,120
It's a fact roadrunners.

5045
02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:28,003
He fucking say,

5046
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:29,510
Oh shit.

5047
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:31,910
Face and now look at this.

5048
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:34,250
He smashes his head on the fucking rocks.

5049
02:21:34,251 --> 02:21:34,980
Help gangster.

5050
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:35,900
This bird dude,

5051
02:21:35,901 --> 02:21:37,060
I got a new fingernails.

5052
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:38,660
I got a new favorite animal.

5053
02:21:38,930 --> 02:21:40,280
Holy Shit.

5054
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:43,030
He's just smashing that
fucking head on the rocks.

5055
02:21:43,031 --> 02:21:47,030
Look at this wet to road runner to food.

5056
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,193
He just,

5057
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:50,300
that motherfucker,

5058
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:51,193
he just

5059
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:55,820
fucking snapped the whole fucking day.

5060
02:21:55,821 --> 02:21:57,860
Swallow the whole fuck.

5061
02:21:58,650 --> 02:22:01,540
Someone say he deep throated
that rattlesnake should beds.

5062
02:22:01,541 --> 02:22:03,470
My guys fights back.

5063
02:22:03,471 --> 02:22:05,520
Gosh Dan,

5064
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:06,950
to keep that.

5065
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:08,030
Keep that Brian,

5066
02:22:08,031 --> 02:22:08,601
go for it.

5067
02:22:08,601 --> 02:22:09,434
Keep that left hand.

5068
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:12,070
Right hand man.

5069
02:22:12,071 --> 02:22:12,904
A boy.

5070
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:13,730
Jesus.

5071
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:14,630
So who does winning?

5072
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:15,513
Right?

5073
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:17,150
So who to looks pissed.

5074
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:17,630
I'm nursing him.

5075
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:19,330
Fight with this much bad.

5076
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:22,880
They've worked alongside each other for
a long time and talked to a lot of shit

5077
02:22:22,881 --> 02:22:23,440
to each other.

5078
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:26,280
Well Joe keeps swaying for
that right hand counter.

5079
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:27,420
Just lights a little off tonight.

5080
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:27,601
He,

5081
02:22:27,601 --> 02:22:31,620
well he's probably been tagged a few times
that first round and now he's looking

5082
02:22:31,621 --> 02:22:33,720
for that big right hand
and get things back.

5083
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:35,550
The reason I thought Joe
would win this fight,

5084
02:22:35,551 --> 02:22:36,750
and I'm not saying he's not going to,

5085
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:40,170
he does everything really well
and pseudo does a few things.

5086
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:41,004
Great.

5087
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,550
So I thought Joe would kind of
edge it out with just mixing it up,

5088
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:45,840
but he's not doing that well.

5089
02:22:45,841 --> 02:22:50,400
So who always doing a stone where near
the level of experience other than the

5090
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:51,240
Johnson fight.

5091
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:52,760
Seven fights.

5092
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,190
Yeah,

5093
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,581
I mean,

5094
02:22:53,581 --> 02:22:56,310
and Benevidez is fought
Johnson a couple of times.

5095
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:57,511
That,

5096
02:22:57,511 --> 02:22:58,321
how about that one?

5097
02:22:58,321 --> 02:22:58,790
When I,

5098
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:59,940
God damn mighty mouse,

5099
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:01,190
mighty mouse from mercy,

5100
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:04,290
he worked both of these guys.

5101
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:05,370
So who do I mean?

5102
02:23:05,371 --> 02:23:06,204
He said,

5103
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:10,080
how many did he knock out
joy Benevidez oh yeah.

5104
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:11,100
Oh my God.

5105
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:11,221
Yeah.

5106
02:23:11,221 --> 02:23:12,054
He crushed him,

5107
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:12,871
you know,

5108
02:23:12,871 --> 02:23:15,960
and then what he did this or Huda was
pretty God damn impressive to some

5109
02:23:15,961 --> 02:23:16,794
amazing,

5110
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:21,360
beautiful down to the technical
kicks or knees rather to the body.

5111
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:23,010
The morning time from the clench.

5112
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:23,940
Jesus was perfect.

5113
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:25,620
Did you hear what mighty
mouse said before that fight?

5114
02:23:25,621 --> 02:23:25,831
They went,

5115
02:23:25,831 --> 02:23:26,071
well,

5116
02:23:26,071 --> 02:23:27,760
he is an Olympic gold medalist and rested.

5117
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:28,230
He went,

5118
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:30,480
there's 250 gold medalists.

5119
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:31,620
There's one,

5120
02:23:31,930 --> 02:23:32,370
you know,

5121
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:34,230
fucking world champion like this.

5122
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:35,693
Fuck.

5123
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:37,830
Oh my God.

5124
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:38,330
Yup.

5125
02:23:38,330 --> 02:23:40,560
So legit love mighty mouse.

5126
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:42,870
I've been singing mighty
mouse is praises forever.

5127
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:44,610
He's not by pound for pound number one.

5128
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:47,670
Who's your pound for pound number one?

5129
02:23:47,671 --> 02:23:50,220
Jon Jones over Conor Mcgregor.

5130
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:50,660
Yeah.

5131
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:50,910
See,

5132
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:51,870
but you can't say that,

5133
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:52,710
but here's what I think.

5134
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:53,820
When you look at John Jones,

5135
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:54,654
I think Jon Jones,

5136
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:54,771
uh,

5137
02:23:54,771 --> 02:23:57,360
ultimately it absolutely has
a potential to be number one,

5138
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:00,990
but he's been to inactive and
the fight with OVN St Prue,

5139
02:24:00,991 --> 02:24:01,890
although Ovince Saint [inaudible],

5140
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:03,240
it fills a very good fighter.

5141
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:04,260
It's a very tough fight.

5142
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:08,340
If you look at who has beaten
over and Saint Pru and who,

5143
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:11,210
you know how John Jones looked
against [inaudible] one five,

5144
02:24:11,211 --> 02:24:11,491
right?

5145
02:24:11,491 --> 02:24:13,410
You can't tow entirely by,

5146
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:14,880
but as of late,

5147
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,070
he's been incredibly inactive.

5148
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:20,860
Cla has been not change

5149
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:25,650
when you mighty mouse has been active.

5150
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:27,480
He's been spectacular.

5151
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,770
He's been spectacular.

5152
02:24:28,771 --> 02:24:30,840
But the thing is is we've
seen mighty mouse lose.

5153
02:24:30,841 --> 02:24:32,160
We've never seen John Jones Lewis.

5154
02:24:32,161 --> 02:24:32,700
You're right.

5155
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:32,911
God,

5156
02:24:32,911 --> 02:24:34,140
you guys are missing a great fight.

5157
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:34,710
You're right.

5158
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:35,850
But he's not fun.

5159
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:37,800
And also what mighty mouse is,

5160
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:40,380
he can he and make a mistake
at punch with right hand.

5161
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:41,460
There are 125 pounds.

5162
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:41,911
They keep on,

5163
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:42,450
keep on.

5164
02:24:42,450 --> 02:24:47,450
John Jones makes one mistake and
[inaudible] he fell because classes,

5165
02:24:47,941 --> 02:24:49,560
I don't have a pound for pound number one.

5166
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:50,270
That is.

5167
02:24:50,270 --> 02:24:54,960
It did as a good argument except for
guys like John Lennon grew and knock guys

5168
02:24:54,961 --> 02:24:58,390
out with one punch and mighty mouse
who knocked out Benevidez with one pot.

5169
02:24:58,391 --> 02:24:59,610
It's still different than it is.

5170
02:24:59,611 --> 02:25:00,121
A little bit.

5171
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:01,140
205 pounds.

5172
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:02,250
Your rosters,

5173
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:02,730
you guys,

5174
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:03,780
it's a little bit different.

5175
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:04,530
He's a little bit,

5176
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:06,600
have you forgotten about a
guy named Anderson Silva?

5177
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:08,840
Brian Callen coming in and fucking shut.

5178
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,833
Shut it down.

5179
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:10,840
What about gas pump?

5180
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:11,773
The best ever.

5181
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:18,340
Right now it's entirely possible to
make the case of either fade or Anderson

5182
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:20,190
Silva or mighty mouse.

5183
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:22,110
I make the case chest pain.

5184
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,040
Maybe if he didn't lose

5185
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,150
his last STP,

5186
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,450
fine,

5187
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:29,620
but not for doing junior fight.

5188
02:25:29,621 --> 02:25:31,270
Anderson Silva who finished everybody.

5189
02:25:31,271 --> 02:25:33,760
It's arguable that for Jim's the best
heavyweight of all time you can make

5190
02:25:33,770 --> 02:25:34,010
something.

5191
02:25:34,010 --> 02:25:34,781
That's what I'm arguing.

5192
02:25:34,781 --> 02:25:35,321
Not Pound from.

5193
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:36,154
Sorry.

5194
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:36,700
Heavyweight.

5195
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:37,120
Yes.

5196
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:37,781
Pound for pound.

5197
02:25:37,781 --> 02:25:38,830
John Mighty mouse.

5198
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:39,100
Yeah,

5199
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:40,300
you can put Connor up there.

5200
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:40,590
Oh,

5201
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:42,040
Anderson Connors and argument

5202
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:45,821
on something that was,

5203
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:48,010
don't you think he's the
number one fighter of all time?

5204
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:48,611
As far as like,

5205
02:25:48,611 --> 02:25:48,880
no.

5206
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:51,750
I think finishing everybody
think Gianna's with style.

5207
02:25:51,751 --> 02:25:52,211
The way he did.

5208
02:25:52,211 --> 02:25:53,380
What are we talking about here?

5209
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:53,650
You know,

5210
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:55,030
I don't know shit about stepping up.

5211
02:25:55,031 --> 02:25:55,930
Everybody know that.

5212
02:25:56,110 --> 02:26:01,110
I don't know shit about striking can
visibly see when he's corner countering

5213
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:02,950
with his,

5214
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:03,761
with his left hand.

5215
02:26:03,761 --> 02:26:06,850
I could see that and I don't really
see it with a lot of fighters.

5216
02:26:06,851 --> 02:26:07,241
I know.

5217
02:26:07,241 --> 02:26:08,021
I don't know shit,

5218
02:26:08,021 --> 02:26:08,950
but is that,

5219
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:09,330
no,

5220
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:09,710
you're right.

5221
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:11,590
It like an amazing counterpart.

5222
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:14,290
100% of that because I'm seeing like your,

5223
02:26:14,291 --> 02:26:15,400
as soon as someone throws he goes,

5224
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,000
oh,

5225
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,030
it's like just waiting for
such a hundred percent clean.

5226
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:20,860
It's so obvious.

5227
02:26:21,150 --> 02:26:21,461
It's so,

5228
02:26:21,461 --> 02:26:22,151
it's waiting for you.

5229
02:26:22,151 --> 02:26:22,841
As soon as you throw,

5230
02:26:22,841 --> 02:26:23,750
he's going to fucking spots.

5231
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:24,743
Good.

5232
02:26:24,910 --> 02:26:29,910
Connor has this ability to slide
back and counter with such incredible

5233
02:26:30,791 --> 02:26:31,271
precision.

5234
02:26:31,271 --> 02:26:32,104
He's just got it.

5235
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:33,123
It's beautiful.

5236
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:33,581
Joe,

5237
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:35,200
don't you get a full precision to,

5238
02:26:35,201 --> 02:26:35,981
it's the techniques.

5239
02:26:35,981 --> 02:26:36,551
Perfect.

5240
02:26:36,551 --> 02:26:37,890
He plants it right on your chin.

5241
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:39,100
He's super accurate.

5242
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:40,180
He's so fast.

5243
02:26:40,181 --> 02:26:40,990
You get surprised.

5244
02:26:40,990 --> 02:26:41,411
You don't.

5245
02:26:41,411 --> 02:26:46,300
You think his strength is to is he's
had some sort of skill where he can

5246
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:48,670
predetermine what you're going to do.

5247
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:49,331
You know what I'm saying?

5248
02:26:49,331 --> 02:26:50,800
Like really seen it.

5249
02:26:50,910 --> 02:26:54,460
We've never really seen a lot of
understanding of striking and movement.

5250
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:55,031
How do you get,

5251
02:26:55,031 --> 02:26:56,160
how do you get that good time?

5252
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:57,101
If you say,

5253
02:26:57,101 --> 02:26:57,521
I want to be,

5254
02:26:57,521 --> 02:26:58,750
if a guy comes to you and says,

5255
02:26:58,751 --> 02:26:59,470
Joe,

5256
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:00,730
I'm going to dedicate my life to you.

5257
02:27:00,731 --> 02:27:01,271
I want me,

5258
02:27:01,271 --> 02:27:03,850
I want you to turn me
into the ultimate counter.

5259
02:27:03,851 --> 02:27:07,420
I would say go to that fucking dude on
his knees in front of Joseph Benevidez

5260
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:07,550
Twitter.

5261
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:09,470
Duane Ludwig about the counters.

5262
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:10,420
Toad,

5263
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:10,640
toad,

5264
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:11,260
Duane Ludwig.

5265
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:11,801
How about the fuck.

5266
02:27:11,801 --> 02:27:15,350
Just get the fastest ever fucking
Caleb in the UFC from account.

5267
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:17,800
Then you find writing the Canadian.

5268
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:18,130
Yeah.

5269
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:18,963
Um,

5270
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:19,840
he had uh,

5271
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:20,980
multiple colored here.

5272
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:21,610
God,

5273
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:22,480
why can't I remember his name?

5274
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:22,871
God,

5275
02:27:22,871 --> 02:27:24,460
I can't remember his fucking name either.

5276
02:27:24,910 --> 02:27:25,450
God does.

5277
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:26,600
Joey had a twin brother.

5278
02:27:26,601 --> 02:27:27,660
What would you do?

5279
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:28,370
No,

5280
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:32,290
like actual sending me Duane Ludwig.

5281
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:35,680
But what would like a drill you would
come up with that you would take,

5282
02:27:35,681 --> 02:27:35,831
hey,

5283
02:27:35,831 --> 02:27:37,330
you got to do this shit every day.

5284
02:27:37,710 --> 02:27:39,070
Depending on where you're at.

5285
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:39,980
Like skill wise,

5286
02:27:39,981 --> 02:27:40,141
like,

5287
02:27:40,141 --> 02:27:40,841
can you kick,

5288
02:27:40,841 --> 02:27:41,451
can you punch?

5289
02:27:41,451 --> 02:27:42,790
Should you not even bother kicking?

5290
02:27:42,791 --> 02:27:44,290
How much time do we have to work with you?

5291
02:27:44,590 --> 02:27:45,341
Like what are you going to do?

5292
02:27:45,341 --> 02:27:45,791
Like if you,

5293
02:27:45,791 --> 02:27:48,460
if you took a guy who like
almost no kicks whatsoever,

5294
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:48,731
you'd say,

5295
02:27:48,731 --> 02:27:48,941
okay,

5296
02:27:48,941 --> 02:27:49,181
let's,

5297
02:27:49,181 --> 02:27:50,170
let's forget the kicks,

5298
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:51,970
but I want you to do is just check kicks.

5299
02:27:51,971 --> 02:27:53,200
We're gonna work on punches.

5300
02:27:53,201 --> 02:27:54,160
Can you throw elbows?

5301
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,350
I don't want you off balance
throwing kicks you your,

5302
02:27:56,351 --> 02:27:58,030
there's a lot of different
things you would think of,

5303
02:27:58,031 --> 02:28:00,100
but when you see Connor's counters,

5304
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:01,630
his counters are so precise.

5305
02:28:01,631 --> 02:28:05,550
You only get that through that 10,000
hour principle to work with someone yet

5306
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:09,520
five years be obsessed and they ought
to be genetically gifted because there's

5307
02:28:09,521 --> 02:28:13,530
certain punchers they just did not have
that kind of snap to be counter guy.

5308
02:28:13,531 --> 02:28:17,470
It's like a guy like Matt Hamill who was
a really powerful wrestler and a good

5309
02:28:17,471 --> 02:28:19,120
puncher and a good striker.

5310
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:20,560
Ultimately later in his career,

5311
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:21,591
he never had that.

5312
02:28:21,591 --> 02:28:23,090
But there's that fucking,

5313
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:26,550
there's that fucking Tammy
some bad have you don't.

5314
02:28:26,551 --> 02:28:27,384
But you know what I mean?

5315
02:28:27,730 --> 02:28:28,970
Got Good example.

5316
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:29,451
Good example.

5317
02:28:29,451 --> 02:28:30,950
Cause he's a tough guy in a strong,

5318
02:28:30,951 --> 02:28:31,820
powerful resume.

5319
02:28:31,821 --> 02:28:32,780
Explosive.

5320
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:33,400
Right,

5321
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:33,641
right,

5322
02:28:33,641 --> 02:28:33,980
right.

5323
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:38,450
Kind of accuracy that there's a bunch
of guys you could say that you could put

5324
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:42,230
in that category who were like really
powerful grapplers who just weren't the

5325
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,390
most lightning like strikers.

5326
02:28:44,391 --> 02:28:44,621
There's a,

5327
02:28:44,621 --> 02:28:46,760
there's a certain type of striking,

5328
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:51,290
there's striking where you know that
the guy has good technique and you know

5329
02:28:51,291 --> 02:28:56,060
that the guy pretty much understands where
to be and where not to be and when to

5330
02:28:56,061 --> 02:28:56,730
be defensive,

5331
02:28:56,730 --> 02:28:57,800
when to be offensive.

5332
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:59,120
That's like a well rounded Stryker.

5333
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:01,280
And then there's guys like Roy Jones Jr.

5334
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:03,930
There's every now and then
you have these tank creeks.

5335
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:09,080
But Roy Jones Jr was a weird one because
Roy Jones Jr abandoned all of the

5336
02:29:09,081 --> 02:29:10,820
Orthodoxy of boxing.

5337
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:12,920
I mean he kept his hands low,

5338
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,510
barely threw jabs.

5339
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:19,160
He threw a leaping left hook instead
and he had ridiculous speed and power to

5340
02:29:19,161 --> 02:29:20,720
the point where nobody can fuck with it.

5341
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:23,870
Met when he was in his prime.

5342
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:24,290
Yeah.

5343
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:25,520
Fuck he was so funny.

5344
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:28,360
Did you watch the Kovalev Andre Ward?

5345
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,180
Yes.

5346
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:29,790
Tight man.

5347
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:30,151
Terrible.

5348
02:29:30,151 --> 02:29:31,190
I watched it again.

5349
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:33,410
I watched it again and uh,

5350
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:36,920
I wanted to see if I was biased cause
I thought the Kovalev won and I still

5351
02:29:36,921 --> 02:29:37,510
think you won.

5352
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:37,670
Yeah.

5353
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:39,830
I said why I didn't think
you won by one much.

5354
02:29:39,831 --> 02:29:42,200
And I think Andre Ward did a
really good job of holding his own,

5355
02:29:42,201 --> 02:29:47,201
but I just don't think there was enough
convincing rounds where ward one in the

5356
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:49,520
way that I think the
rounds that Kovalev won.

5357
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:50,030
I agree.

5358
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:51,080
So I was like,

5359
02:29:51,081 --> 02:29:51,830
man,

5360
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:52,641
I was watching my God,

5361
02:29:52,641 --> 02:29:53,360
I feel like Cola.

5362
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:54,140
Definitely one.

5363
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:55,160
But it was close.

5364
02:29:55,420 --> 02:29:57,140
And then when Letterman was like,

5365
02:29:57,141 --> 02:29:57,231
oh,

5366
02:29:57,231 --> 02:29:58,100
it's a complete blowout.

5367
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,341
I'm like,

5368
02:29:58,341 --> 02:29:59,240
well I don't agree with that.

5369
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:02,750
I don't think I'll j ward one but
I don't think he got blown out.

5370
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:03,111
No,

5371
02:30:03,111 --> 02:30:06,680
I think it was a one point for Kovalev
and I think the reason why you can make

5372
02:30:06,681 --> 02:30:09,890
that is because I think that Andre
Ward sorta clawed his way back.

5373
02:30:09,891 --> 02:30:11,230
You won some rounds like,

5374
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:14,750
like later in the fight it seem like he
had got that jab establish more and he

5375
02:30:14,751 --> 02:30:16,020
popped a couple of real good,

5376
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:18,020
he was doing work but he got,

5377
02:30:18,021 --> 02:30:18,530
he was,

5378
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:19,251
he was a 10,

5379
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:20,670
eight round I think in the second,

5380
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:21,973
second round.

5381
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:23,143
I mean you could,

5382
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:25,850
you could see a one point round for cove,

5383
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:27,890
a 1.5 for coke won the fight though.

5384
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:29,053
But I just,

5385
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,230
I don't,

5386
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:30,980
Oh shit.

5387
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:31,813
It's crazy.

5388
02:30:32,410 --> 02:30:33,560
Crazy land and bombs.

5389
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:34,423
Crazy fight.

5390
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:35,330
But again,

5391
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:38,000
it depends entirely on
how you score fights too,

5392
02:30:38,001 --> 02:30:38,480
right?

5393
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:40,190
I mean everybody has their own idea.

5394
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:40,650
Kill him.

5395
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:40,941
Again,

5396
02:30:40,941 --> 02:30:42,380
when you look at the numbers though,

5397
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:46,940
Charlie's with numbers of like w
significant punches favors Covello true,

5398
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:47,541
but by,

5399
02:30:47,541 --> 02:30:48,011
by Joe,

5400
02:30:48,011 --> 02:30:48,380
uh,

5401
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:49,410
you're number one fighters.

5402
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:51,470
Mighty mouse number two is Anderson Silva.

5403
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:51,980
Yeah,

5404
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:56,030
that's my number one and number two
because I judge him on what I see from him

5405
02:30:56,031 --> 02:30:56,840
right now.

5406
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:59,300
And when I see like I understand
that he's fighting smaller guys,

5407
02:30:59,301 --> 02:31:00,770
I understand they don't
have as much power.

5408
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:03,680
I understand that the margin
of error is different.

5409
02:31:03,681 --> 02:31:04,191
However,

5410
02:31:04,191 --> 02:31:08,510
what I factor in is the greatness of
movement and what I see in mighty mouse is

5411
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:09,740
so pure efficiency.

5412
02:31:10,130 --> 02:31:14,060
I see crazy shit like when he got so Hutto
in the clinch and he's throwing these

5413
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:17,030
precision knees to the body
that come with no wind up.

5414
02:31:17,180 --> 02:31:18,800
So who has no idea they're coming.

5415
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:20,070
Mighty mouse puts it on

5416
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,370
them.

5417
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:24,090
I've seen the mighty mouse that saw Joseph
Benevidez leaving his chin out there

5418
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:27,570
and caught him with one punch and k owed
him when the knock on him was that he

5419
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:29,130
wasn't a one punch Stryker.

5420
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:30,890
I saw him when he fought he,

5421
02:31:30,891 --> 02:31:31,171
okay.

5422
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:32,220
Where he dominated.

5423
02:31:32,221 --> 02:31:35,310
He oakey for all five rounds
and what a second to go.

5424
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:36,840
She always catches him with an arm bar.

5425
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:36,970
Yeah.

5426
02:31:36,970 --> 02:31:38,160
You know who we don't include them.

5427
02:31:38,161 --> 02:31:40,620
Pound for pound is not active enough.

5428
02:31:40,621 --> 02:31:41,454
Dominick Cruz.

5429
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:43,230
But if you look at this record,

5430
02:31:43,231 --> 02:31:44,240
it's days.

5431
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:45,520
He's great point,

5432
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:46,560
but he doesn't,

5433
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,240
he's not looking at it as a great,

5434
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:49,290
I'll tell you what man,

5435
02:31:49,291 --> 02:31:50,011
him and Cody,

5436
02:31:50,011 --> 02:31:51,040
no love is going to be

5437
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:54,870
quite interesting because Cody taxes,

5438
02:31:54,871 --> 02:31:55,890
anyone that goes to sleep,

5439
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:56,850
he's my friend.

5440
02:31:56,850 --> 02:31:57,880
He's my favorite fighter at wait,

5441
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:58,710
go see this.

5442
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:01,770
And that's a good point because what
we're talking about is about like guys who

5443
02:32:01,771 --> 02:32:03,900
are really good at
certain things like Cody,

5444
02:32:03,901 --> 02:32:06,150
no love is way better at striking the,

5445
02:32:06,151 --> 02:32:08,250
what you're seeing
right now is way better.

5446
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:10,080
He's the chocolate Delta class.

5447
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,540
He does creepy,

5448
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:14,160
scary shit to people.

5449
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:17,560
Like when he merch Thomas Almeda
with that combination hike,

5450
02:32:17,570 --> 02:32:17,851
he's,

5451
02:32:17,851 --> 02:32:20,280
his stacking is like these
guys make no mistake about it.

5452
02:32:20,281 --> 02:32:21,940
Benevidez and so who does he always,

5453
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:22,560
trainers.

5454
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,310
Joyce winning.

5455
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:25,230
I'm not sure you're writing at all.

5456
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:26,600
And I bet on,

5457
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:27,433
I don't know about that.

5458
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:28,620
You not catching man.

5459
02:32:28,621 --> 02:32:30,390
They do this every time
it's been watching it.

5460
02:32:30,391 --> 02:32:31,224
We've been talking.

5461
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:33,300
The thing is though is with,

5462
02:32:33,301 --> 02:32:33,900
uh,

5463
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:35,310
with Dominick Cruz and Garbin.

5464
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:37,110
Dominick Cruz isn't a knockout artist.

5465
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:38,160
He's far from it.

5466
02:32:38,220 --> 02:32:40,410
So he might win 30 punches.

5467
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:43,320
Garburate needs one in 25,

5468
02:32:43,321 --> 02:32:46,200
but we've never seen God
Brant four and five rounds in.

5469
02:32:46,201 --> 02:32:46,750
Correct.

5470
02:32:46,750 --> 02:32:48,270
It's going to be interesting
because he's a very explosive,

5471
02:32:48,271 --> 02:32:49,320
it's such a fun fight though,

5472
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:53,420
but he's never been a guy that shows
any sort of a slow down in his style get

5473
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:53,760
man.

5474
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,900
Some people are upset that he got it.

5475
02:32:54,901 --> 02:32:55,500
I love it.

5476
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:55,861
Oh No,

5477
02:32:55,861 --> 02:32:56,694
it's great.

5478
02:32:56,730 --> 02:32:57,090
The only,

5479
02:32:57,090 --> 02:32:58,560
but personally I feel bad for it.

5480
02:32:58,561 --> 02:32:58,711
Yeah.

5481
02:32:58,711 --> 02:32:59,930
I feel bad for Tj went,

5482
02:32:59,931 --> 02:33:00,481
oh Tj,

5483
02:33:00,481 --> 02:33:02,370
here's fucking Linacre too.

5484
02:33:02,371 --> 02:33:03,204
Oh my God.

5485
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:06,270
Here's Linacre the monster
edge Liniger's is scary.

5486
02:33:06,610 --> 02:33:06,810
Yeah,

5487
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:07,600
he's the scare.

5488
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:08,220
Yes.

5489
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:10,000
He's got so creepy power in his hands.

5490
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:12,240
The motherfucking yeah.

5491
02:33:12,241 --> 02:33:12,571
Right.

5492
02:33:12,571 --> 02:33:14,520
And linear cause seems
to have an iron chin too,

5493
02:33:14,521 --> 02:33:15,300
which is scary.

5494
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,041
Fight scared.

5495
02:33:16,041 --> 02:33:16,320
Right.

5496
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:16,920
He fights.

5497
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:18,880
He said terrifying powerhouse.

5498
02:33:18,881 --> 02:33:23,370
See I thought John Dotson beat him really
cause lot Linacre was gonna come and

5499
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:24,840
forward nonstop at Dotson.

5500
02:33:24,841 --> 02:33:25,674
When that fight,

5501
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:27,060
I'd have to go back and watch it again.

5502
02:33:27,090 --> 02:33:29,850
I remember seeing the decision
thinking it was correct.

5503
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:32,070
I'd have to go back and watch that again.

5504
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:33,510
Who Do you think won this fight?

5505
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,790
We weren't paying attention.

5506
02:33:34,910 --> 02:33:36,760
I've been talking to me
showing up for think.

5507
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:38,220
Join landed more strikes,

5508
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:40,890
has persistent like clean
strikes on his face.

5509
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:42,100
That's where it looked like to me.

5510
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:46,370
Might have and then you're going to
have to pay his because Katie's throwing

5511
02:33:46,371 --> 02:33:46,551
but,

5512
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:46,770
but,

5513
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:47,700
but Joey was just,

5514
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:48,563
was

5515
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:51,540
not getting her like it.

5516
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:54,690
I like putting a little on
on it and just done backer.

5517
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:56,250
I like being in action.

5518
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:57,383
I hear you man.

5519
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:59,710
I don't really care who the horse
and then the main event does,

5520
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:00,001
does it?

5521
02:34:00,001 --> 02:34:01,190
Is anyone take it to Mellon?

5522
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:02,480
Not You wrote and you know what I mean?

5523
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:05,820
Cause they want to bend down
to order pizza right here.

5524
02:34:05,821 --> 02:34:06,160
No,

5525
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:06,810
that's my cheat.

5526
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:07,980
Some players to know where we are.

5527
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,360
Pizza players.

5528
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,821
I was like,

5529
02:34:11,821 --> 02:34:13,220
what the fuck's up pizza player?

5530
02:34:13,230 --> 02:34:14,700
How do you guys do it over here?

5531
02:34:15,030 --> 02:34:15,841
I can answer the door.

5532
02:34:15,841 --> 02:34:16,674
How would know,

5533
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:18,220
we could just say it's

5534
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:19,123
Brian.

5535
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:22,780
You could do it next door and just have
him text you probably be out of here by

5536
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:23,614
the time they come.

5537
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:25,120
We have some protein bars.

5538
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:25,954
You want a protein bar?

5539
02:34:26,070 --> 02:34:27,100
It's just as good as pizza.

5540
02:34:27,101 --> 02:34:27,820
You want to prompt him.

5541
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:30,490
That would be nice to [inaudible]
afterwards and you know what?

5542
02:34:30,491 --> 02:34:31,660
Fuck you got to do a set right?

5543
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,460
Part of the agenda.

5544
02:34:33,461 --> 02:34:34,570
21 store.

5545
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:35,433
I'm at the store at night.

5546
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:37,203
Oh Shit,

5547
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:38,360
motherfucking man.

5548
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:41,440
He's always there putting
together my new hour.

5549
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:46,840
I abandoned my had to
branch expression counts.

5550
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:47,980
I'm talking about myself.

5551
02:34:47,981 --> 02:34:48,391
Is that okay?

5552
02:34:48,391 --> 02:34:50,430
Can I definitely get the gun?

5553
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:50,801
Stop,

5554
02:34:50,801 --> 02:34:51,634
relax.

5555
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:53,193
I'm over on this side.

5556
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:54,690
I just can't believe you guys

5557
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,320
get so greedy.

5558
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,680
People talk about themselves.

5559
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:04,630
I try to tell people some
shit that's happening.

5560
02:35:04,631 --> 02:35:05,464
Two nights

5561
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:10,140
he pushed the microwave.

5562
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:10,990
Did you see that?

5563
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:14,470
I've never thought about a
special guy to you guys together.

5564
02:35:14,471 --> 02:35:15,820
You fight over each other so much.

5565
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:16,211
You coming here,

5566
02:35:16,211 --> 02:35:17,170
you'd be putting on us.

5567
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:17,860
That's right.

5568
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,420
Now we're not about that.

5569
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:20,800
We're not about guys about harmony.

5570
02:35:21,610 --> 02:35:22,830
Here's the difference in
the Eddie Bravo night.

5571
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,310
We get high when you guys aren't around.

5572
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:27,760
When you guys are,

5573
02:35:27,761 --> 02:35:28,451
you guys are together.

5574
02:35:28,451 --> 02:35:29,284
You're not getting high.

5575
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:30,993
Thank you.

5576
02:35:31,470 --> 02:35:33,010
Do you only 500 bucks?

5577
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:34,660
You owe me 500 no,

5578
02:35:34,661 --> 02:35:35,110
I thought it was,

5579
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:35,211
oh,

5580
02:35:35,211 --> 02:35:36,560
that's God bless choosing Smith's.

5581
02:35:36,561 --> 02:35:37,050
Joey,

5582
02:35:37,050 --> 02:35:38,090
I forgot who I was rooting for.

5583
02:35:40,990 --> 02:35:41,800
He won that fight.

5584
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:44,110
Brian counselors aware and correct.

5585
02:35:44,111 --> 02:35:44,944
Let's see here.

5586
02:35:45,730 --> 02:35:48,040
Any booze volume please.

5587
02:35:48,300 --> 02:35:49,133
I shouldn't be booze.

5588
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:49,750
Beautiful.

5589
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:50,040
It's hard.

5590
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:50,890
It's hard to tell.

5591
02:35:50,891 --> 02:35:52,970
It's like to road runner's
fighting styles change.

5592
02:35:52,971 --> 02:35:55,330
Those riders killed
rattlesnakes with their face.

5593
02:35:55,331 --> 02:35:57,550
You fuck you do not pay attention and joy.

5594
02:35:57,580 --> 02:36:00,340
Benzo Ludwig's technique.

5595
02:36:00,341 --> 02:36:02,470
His technique has changed
and he looks amazing.

5596
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:06,160
He looked very different in this fight
than any of his other fights ever.

5597
02:36:06,970 --> 02:36:07,661
Totally different.

5598
02:36:07,661 --> 02:36:08,680
Not just from the little I saw.

5599
02:36:08,681 --> 02:36:09,514
Look you lost.

5600
02:36:09,550 --> 02:36:10,380
Nope.

5601
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:10,810
Yeah,

5602
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,501
I absolutely,

5603
02:36:11,501 --> 02:36:12,334
it wasn't paying enough.

5604
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:16,480
He landed extension load plus I have
marijuana in my system which impairs my

5605
02:36:16,481 --> 02:36:17,314
judgment.

5606
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:18,853
Shall we crushed it.

5607
02:36:19,130 --> 02:36:20,280
I'm about three wines.

5608
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:22,600
This fudge thing,

5609
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:25,450
I'm just about the fun stuff is the shit.

5610
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:26,333
It was nice,

5611
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,250
friendly.

5612
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:28,031
It's really good for you.

5613
02:36:28,031 --> 02:36:28,780
Good job.

5614
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:29,740
Been back on Paleo.

5615
02:36:29,990 --> 02:36:30,521
Yeah,

5616
02:36:30,521 --> 02:36:35,180
I only got off of it cause I went on
vacation for the holidays and I told you I

5617
02:36:35,181 --> 02:36:36,160
had the worst headaches.

5618
02:36:36,190 --> 02:36:37,023
Brothers.

5619
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:38,561
I thought I was going to die.

5620
02:36:38,561 --> 02:36:40,990
I do the a abbreviated version where I'm,

5621
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:43,900
I'll allow myself to have
like some desserts and shit,

5622
02:36:43,901 --> 02:36:46,030
but I don't go fuck and full hog.

5623
02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:49,630
I just want to understand
is what's bad for it now.

5624
02:36:49,690 --> 02:36:51,070
It doesn't feel good anymore,

5625
02:36:51,071 --> 02:36:54,580
but if like I make a grilled
cheese sandwich for my kids.

5626
02:36:54,581 --> 02:36:54,811
God,

5627
02:36:54,811 --> 02:36:55,540
do you have a film?

5628
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:57,460
I love a grilled cheese
sandwich with butter to butter.

5629
02:36:57,461 --> 02:36:58,151
The bread I do.

5630
02:36:58,151 --> 02:36:58,481
I bought it.

5631
02:36:58,481 --> 02:36:58,960
The bread,

5632
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:00,520
of course she bought her
that kind of chatter.

5633
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:01,091
Do you use,

5634
02:37:01,091 --> 02:37:02,220
do you use cheddar cheese?

5635
02:37:02,221 --> 02:37:06,040
Cheddar sharp cheddar cheese?

5636
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:08,740
I'll put a tomato slice in
the tube it out like that.

5637
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:12,970
Joe Runs like the tomato slice
slice really should be standard.

5638
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:13,481
I agree.

5639
02:37:13,481 --> 02:37:17,090
Calfresh is a BLT get tomato
and that's a cheese sandwich.

5640
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,240
It really should be standard
because it makes it juicy.

5641
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:22,610
You got to use white bread because
you're not eating anything nutritious.

5642
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:27,940
Don't fucking give me weed or multigrain
fucking me that all fashion wonder

5643
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:28,511
bread.

5644
02:37:28,511 --> 02:37:28,970
White boy.

5645
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:32,960
But I wouldn't be mad at you if you
made me a grilled cheese sandwich with a

5646
02:37:32,961 --> 02:37:33,291
Zeke.

5647
02:37:33,291 --> 02:37:36,380
You'll bread but sprouts and Gouda.

5648
02:37:36,610 --> 02:37:37,600
Oh and long.

5649
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:41,090
Raw milk could again heirloom tomatoes,

5650
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:44,500
a little tomato soup on fuck.

5651
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:49,290
Take grass fed butter on the outside of
these feel better when you fucking fry.

5652
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:50,690
He frightened a cast iron pan.

5653
02:37:50,691 --> 02:37:51,170
Correct.

5654
02:37:51,170 --> 02:37:52,030
She's not a criminal.

5655
02:37:52,590 --> 02:37:55,720
You have to have a food.

5656
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:58,520
Not a bad person.

5657
02:37:59,530 --> 02:38:02,090
You're not doing this in a
fucking George Foreman grill.

5658
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:07,210
He used damn cast iron frying
pan like a fucking pipe.

5659
02:38:07,610 --> 02:38:11,330
Do you make a grilled cheese or
anything towards foreman chicken?

5660
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:16,700
Fuck you gestured it really made a
hundred chicken meals on a George Foreman

5661
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,000
grill.

5662
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,410
My life in college.

5663
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,090
I would grill the fuck out of them.

5664
02:38:20,390 --> 02:38:21,223
Those things,

5665
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:22,250
honestly,

5666
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:23,480
it's a good way to do it.

5667
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,550
You grill the top and the
bottom at the same time.

5668
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:26,001
He's like,

5669
02:38:26,001 --> 02:38:26,834
Shit.

5670
02:38:27,410 --> 02:38:28,041
The grill,

5671
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:30,170
most of the people eat
on George Foreman grills.

5672
02:38:30,171 --> 02:38:31,420
You not eating filet Mignon.

5673
02:38:31,630 --> 02:38:33,540
You getting shit cuts
anyway cause you pour it.

5674
02:38:33,541 --> 02:38:33,921
Fuck.

5675
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:34,310
That's true.

5676
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:38,480
I've grilling like skirt steak and
shit and my God and meanwhile Mexicans

5677
02:38:38,481 --> 02:38:39,770
figured out how to make skirt steak.

5678
02:38:40,070 --> 02:38:41,210
One of my favorite steaks,

5679
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:41,930
the best.

5680
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,240
They started fucking Marigny

5681
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:45,920
skirt steak is a shit.

5682
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:46,783
It really is.

5683
02:38:47,550 --> 02:38:49,390
You guys ever have a uh,

5684
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:53,690
era in like your twenties where you're
not living at home and you're fucking

5685
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:54,440

5686
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:59,120

somehow make that last a week and you're

5687
02:38:59,121 --> 02:38:59,330

5688
02:38:59,330 --> 02:38:59,541
okay,

5689
02:38:59,541 --> 02:39:00,980
I got top Ramen,

5690
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,730
I've go low loaf of bread,

5691
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:04,610
macaroni and cheese.

5692
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:06,860
I just call my daddy to
call it that secretary.

5693
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:10,190
I need some fucking money
and my dad would go,

5694
02:39:10,191 --> 02:39:11,024
how much do you need?

5695
02:39:11,870 --> 02:39:12,291
Well,

5696
02:39:12,291 --> 02:39:12,711
I don't know,

5697
02:39:12,711 --> 02:39:16,130
$500 or 1,002 class news.

5698
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,313
Cause

5699
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:22,900
you guys how you guys were ultimately
never be in my inner circle because you're

5700
02:39:22,910 --> 02:39:24,400
bored for sure.

5701
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:25,343
Like,

5702
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:25,940
okay,

5703
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:30,170
$23 I had one of the market at all.

5704
02:39:30,410 --> 02:39:32,270
I got a calculator at the fuck.

5705
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:34,160
I'm 22 years old and I'm like,

5706
02:39:34,190 --> 02:39:34,580
I gotta.

5707
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:34,851
Okay.

5708
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:36,800
Three boxes of macaroni and cheese,

5709
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:38,750
a jar of peanut butter,

5710
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:40,393
loaf of bread.

5711
02:39:40,430 --> 02:39:41,720
They get created milk,

5712
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:43,670
four cans of tuna.

5713
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:44,601
Damn,

5714
02:39:44,601 --> 02:39:45,434
I can take that.

5715
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:46,800
That could take that for four days.

5716
02:39:49,490 --> 02:39:50,323
Burritos,

5717
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:51,980
revival mode,

5718
02:39:51,981 --> 02:39:52,431
man.

5719
02:39:52,431 --> 02:39:55,130
I grew up with a shelf
arrival when I was a kid.

5720
02:39:55,220 --> 02:39:55,940
It really was.

5721
02:39:55,940 --> 02:39:58,460
When I left my parents' house of Raman.

5722
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:59,690
Raman was big,

5723
02:39:59,691 --> 02:40:00,261
what age?

5724
02:40:00,261 --> 02:40:01,490
Two top ramen.

5725
02:40:02,290 --> 02:40:04,630
But I was real pro at my brokest.

5726
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:07,960
I was like 1920 was my
brokest like those college.

5727
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:08,740
Yeah,

5728
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,970
well I was going to college,

5729
02:40:10,971 --> 02:40:12,100
but it was when I,

5730
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:13,500
even when I say I'm going to college,

5731
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:14,010
they should be

5732
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,750
like an asterisk next to that statement,

5733
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:16,230
please.

5734
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:17,370
I was taking classes,

5735
02:40:17,371 --> 02:40:19,800
but I wasn't even ever thinking
I was getting to get a job.

5736
02:40:19,980 --> 02:40:22,950
I just didn't want anybody thinking I
was a loser and I'd run into people in my

5737
02:40:22,951 --> 02:40:23,311
town.

5738
02:40:23,311 --> 02:40:23,611
They'd be like,

5739
02:40:23,611 --> 02:40:24,031
what are you doing?

5740
02:40:24,031 --> 02:40:24,240
I'm like,

5741
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:24,361
Oh,

5742
02:40:24,361 --> 02:40:25,190
I'm taking a year off.

5743
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:25,471
They'd be like,

5744
02:40:25,471 --> 02:40:25,651
Oh,

5745
02:40:25,651 --> 02:40:26,484
I'm fucking loser.

5746
02:40:26,510 --> 02:40:27,480
So after a year I'm like,

5747
02:40:27,481 --> 02:40:29,700
I can't keep feeling that every
time I talked to somebody,

5748
02:40:29,701 --> 02:40:30,570
I got to go to school.

5749
02:40:31,230 --> 02:40:32,520
So I started going to college,

5750
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:35,250
but it was barely paying
attention and it was just,

5751
02:40:35,550 --> 02:40:37,110
I was paying more attention to like,

5752
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:40,770
because that was at the time that I
was considering doing standup comedy.

5753
02:40:40,771 --> 02:40:41,610
I hadn't done it yet.

5754
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,320
Like and when I started doing it,

5755
02:40:43,321 --> 02:40:44,160
that's when I quit college,

5756
02:40:44,460 --> 02:40:48,090
but I was considering doing it so it was
really more paying attention to people

5757
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:53,240
and how weird we all are in this struggle
between being child and being an adult

5758
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:56,490
is this weird transitionary period
where people are feeling their oats and

5759
02:40:56,491 --> 02:41:00,900
flexing their intellectual muscles in
front of a teacher and trying to catch the

5760
02:41:00,901 --> 02:41:04,050
teacher what's wrong and
trying to debate the teacher.

5761
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:05,910
I was fascinated by that man.

5762
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:07,680
I was fascinated by that because I was,

5763
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:10,500
when I was fighting especially that
was all when I was still competing.

5764
02:41:10,770 --> 02:41:11,940
I was always really,

5765
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:14,370
really interested in conflict.

5766
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,510
Any kind of conflict,

5767
02:41:15,511 --> 02:41:16,440
verbal conflicts,

5768
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:18,840
physical conflict games and braced it.

5769
02:41:18,841 --> 02:41:20,370
You're saying I'm interested in it.

5770
02:41:20,371 --> 02:41:22,320
I'm curious as to what's going on here,

5771
02:41:22,321 --> 02:41:25,470
like why is this kid protesting
what the teacher's saying?

5772
02:41:25,471 --> 02:41:29,520
Is he protesting because he's made a
really solid assessment of the facts at

5773
02:41:29,521 --> 02:41:29,821
hand.

5774
02:41:29,821 --> 02:41:33,030
He finds a flaw in the logic or
as you trying to get attention,

5775
02:41:33,150 --> 02:41:34,140
has he looked at it from,

5776
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:38,730
if he's has step one through 10 to really
verify what your thoughts are really.

5777
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:43,020
Have you looked at one through 10 or
did you go up to like three and you feel

5778
02:41:43,021 --> 02:41:45,210
your oats and you think you're
smart as fuck and you dive in?

5779
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:45,820
So I,

5780
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:48,300
when I was more interested
in when I was in college,

5781
02:41:48,330 --> 02:41:50,760
honestly it was just people
interacting with each other.

5782
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:55,320
My favorite moment from college had to
do with his Puerto Rican girl that I was

5783
02:41:55,321 --> 02:41:56,010
trying to fuck.

5784
02:41:56,010 --> 02:41:56,401
Good for you.

5785
02:41:56,401 --> 02:41:57,091
And I was in the,

5786
02:41:57,091 --> 02:41:57,924
I was in the,

5787
02:41:57,940 --> 02:41:58,640
um,

5788
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:00,270
that was in the lunch room with this girl.

5789
02:42:00,271 --> 02:42:04,050
This girl kept inviting me to
go to these things with her.

5790
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:04,290
What?

5791
02:42:04,290 --> 02:42:05,280
She was like these,

5792
02:42:05,281 --> 02:42:05,580
uh,

5793
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:05,940
these,

5794
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:07,380
these fucking retreats.

5795
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:08,700
She's like me and my friends.

5796
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:11,760
She was in my Italian
trying to fuck some dude.

5797
02:42:11,761 --> 02:42:12,640
She was so hot.

5798
02:42:12,650 --> 02:42:13,510
I know that name.

5799
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:17,040
She was so hot to conclude
she was the inclusion.

5800
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:18,030
Let me please tell me.

5801
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:18,810
Let me tell the story.

5802
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:22,350
She was thick and she was juicy and
she had glasses and I knew she spoke

5803
02:42:22,351 --> 02:42:22,801
Spanish.

5804
02:42:22,801 --> 02:42:23,670
I couldn't wait to hear it.

5805
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:24,421
And I was like,

5806
02:42:24,421 --> 02:42:27,960
it's just a matter of time as this
girl's giving me all kinds of vibe.

5807
02:42:27,961 --> 02:42:28,131
Right.

5808
02:42:28,131 --> 02:42:28,890
I can our walls down.

5809
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:29,281
She was like,

5810
02:42:29,281 --> 02:42:30,114
got to break the walls down.

5811
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:31,230
We're going down in the Cape.

5812
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:32,730
I would love if you'd come,

5813
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:34,110
and I felt bad.

5814
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:34,771
I didn't want,

5815
02:42:34,771 --> 02:42:37,080
I didn't want to tell her that it
was going to fight in a tournament.

5816
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:38,153
I started,

5817
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:38,580
no,

5818
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:38,731
no,

5819
02:42:38,731 --> 02:42:38,821
no.

5820
02:42:38,821 --> 02:42:40,290
I was just super insecure about it.

5821
02:42:40,291 --> 02:42:41,310
I thought it was an idiot.

5822
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:43,640
I thought I had brain
damage was in college.

5823
02:42:43,641 --> 02:42:45,420
I was Jack you off in history now.

5824
02:42:45,421 --> 02:42:46,254
It probably not,

5825
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:47,213
you know,

5826
02:42:47,390 --> 02:42:48,223
probably wouldn't,

5827
02:42:48,330 --> 02:42:49,163
you know,

5828
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:51,330
it didn't sound even real to say,

5829
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:51,721
you know,

5830
02:42:51,721 --> 02:42:51,991
like,

5831
02:42:51,991 --> 02:42:52,824
yeah,

5832
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:53,131
you know,

5833
02:42:53,131 --> 02:42:53,964
I go home,

5834
02:42:54,510 --> 02:42:55,650
I'm going to go kick some dudes.

5835
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:55,921
You know,

5836
02:42:55,921 --> 02:42:57,210
it just sounded like anyway,

5837
02:42:57,750 --> 02:42:58,710
I couldn't make it.

5838
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:00,180
So she's like,

5839
02:43:00,210 --> 02:43:01,500
we do them all the time.

5840
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:02,640
I would love to have you come again.

5841
02:43:02,641 --> 02:43:02,980
I would like,

5842
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:03,820
I would love to come again.

5843
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:04,863
And I'm like,

5844
02:43:05,170 --> 02:43:06,003
yeah,

5845
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:06,841
I left dad.

5846
02:43:06,841 --> 02:43:07,674
It was like,

5847
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:09,131
no,

5848
02:43:09,131 --> 02:43:09,351
no,

5849
02:43:09,351 --> 02:43:09,531
no,

5850
02:43:09,531 --> 02:43:09,741
no,

5851
02:43:09,741 --> 02:43:09,881
no,

5852
02:43:09,881 --> 02:43:10,211
no,

5853
02:43:10,211 --> 02:43:11,044
no.

5854
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:11,831
I was like pumped.

5855
02:43:11,831 --> 02:43:12,131
I was like,

5856
02:43:12,131 --> 02:43:12,491
damn,

5857
02:43:12,491 --> 02:43:13,270
we're in.

5858
02:43:13,270 --> 02:43:16,150
So then I went back to
school after the tournament.

5859
02:43:16,151 --> 02:43:18,820
I'm sitting in the lunch
room and ironically enough,

5860
02:43:18,850 --> 02:43:20,470
it was a Trump airplane.

5861
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,810
It was one of those Trump airlines.

5862
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,351
Trump,

5863
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:24,101
Eric Trump.

5864
02:43:24,101 --> 02:43:24,311
No,

5865
02:43:24,311 --> 02:43:24,910
listen to me.

5866
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:29,410
I was at the lunch room and we were about
to eat and the Trump airline that day,

5867
02:43:29,411 --> 02:43:31,840
the fucking landing gear didn't come down,

5868
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:33,550
but the Jed skid,

5869
02:43:33,551 --> 02:43:38,080
the jet skid into the runway and sparks
and they put fucking flame retardant

5870
02:43:38,081 --> 02:43:39,220
foam over the runway.

5871
02:43:39,221 --> 02:43:40,054
It was crazy.

5872
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:41,140
I went down,

5873
02:43:41,141 --> 02:43:45,310
I sat down with these kids was this Puerto
Rican girl was so hot and all of her

5874
02:43:45,311 --> 02:43:45,850
friends,

5875
02:43:45,850 --> 02:43:47,590
and I sat down with them
at lunch and I said,

5876
02:43:47,591 --> 02:43:50,110
did you guys hear about the jet that a,

5877
02:43:50,111 --> 02:43:51,550
that just crashed landed?

5878
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:52,960
It had this run and they were like,

5879
02:43:52,961 --> 02:43:53,794
what happened?

5880
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:54,131
And I said,

5881
02:43:54,131 --> 02:43:57,700
apparently the front
landing gear didn't engage,

5882
02:43:57,701 --> 02:43:59,440
didn't lock down Trump airlines,

5883
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:01,150
but everybody's fine.

5884
02:44:01,151 --> 02:44:01,750
And everybody,

5885
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,500
nobody got hurt.

5886
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:02,950
They go,

5887
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:03,251
oh,

5888
02:44:03,251 --> 02:44:04,084
praise God.

5889
02:44:04,210 --> 02:44:05,080
Praise God.

5890
02:44:05,290 --> 02:44:06,011
Praise God.

5891
02:44:06,011 --> 02:44:06,670
I went,

5892
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:07,503
Oh

5893
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:11,950
and then I realized I was standing there
over the table cause they're all going,

5894
02:44:11,951 --> 02:44:12,910
praise God.

5895
02:44:12,911 --> 02:44:14,080
Praise God Mike,

5896
02:44:14,081 --> 02:44:15,860
she and getting so

5897
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:18,320
bad.

5898
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:19,240
I sat down

5899
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:25,150
with so much sadness but also
happy because I love conflict,

5900
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:25,631
right?

5901
02:44:25,631 --> 02:44:26,500
So I'm sitting here,

5902
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,110
I'm like this little demon.

5903
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:29,310
This is to have the tape

5904
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:31,880
back then.

5905
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:33,580
No diplomacy back then.

5906
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:36,070
I'm fucking laser beam back then.

5907
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:36,431
No,

5908
02:44:36,431 --> 02:44:37,840
then not a diplomat.

5909
02:44:37,900 --> 02:44:38,733
Keep calling.

5910
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,330
You didn't even know me then.

5911
02:44:40,331 --> 02:44:41,440
This is when I was 19

5912
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:45,200
I was 19 I was straight feral home.

5913
02:44:45,660 --> 02:44:47,140
I sat down at this table,

5914
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:50,080
they're going like praise God wild.

5915
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:55,210
My mother is a beautiful person
and my Stepdad's a beautiful man.

5916
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:56,230
I love them to death.

5917
02:44:56,231 --> 02:44:58,690
But they worked and when people work,

5918
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:03,280
the kids are gone from whatever time
to whatever they get out of school.

5919
02:45:03,281 --> 02:45:03,800
Shit.

5920
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:04,630
Fucking wild.

5921
02:45:04,630 --> 02:45:06,670
Wild in the streets.

5922
02:45:06,671 --> 02:45:11,671
And that's how I grew up as was a latchkey
kid from a divorced family and I grew

5923
02:45:12,071 --> 02:45:15,700
up hanging out with other kids and you
develop these crazy and then I started

5924
02:45:15,701 --> 02:45:16,031
fighting.

5925
02:45:16,031 --> 02:45:18,220
So no juicy Puerto Rican ass for you.

5926
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:22,120
So I was fighting so I had a very
distorted version of things as it is.

5927
02:45:22,350 --> 02:45:24,490
So then I sat down and I said,

5928
02:45:24,491 --> 02:45:29,491
so this thing that you wanted me to do
when you were asking me to go hang out

5929
02:45:29,531 --> 02:45:33,280
with your friends and the Cape and
have like a big smile on my face,

5930
02:45:33,281 --> 02:45:33,641
I'm like,

5931
02:45:33,641 --> 02:45:35,080
that was about Jesus.

5932
02:45:35,081 --> 02:45:35,914
Right?

5933
02:45:36,130 --> 02:45:36,671
And they were like,

5934
02:45:36,671 --> 02:45:38,160
it's really important that you know Jesus.

5935
02:45:38,161 --> 02:45:38,380
I go,

5936
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:39,250
you know Jesus.

5937
02:45:39,790 --> 02:45:40,001
I go,

5938
02:45:40,001 --> 02:45:40,900
you know Jesus.

5939
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:41,350
Oh,

5940
02:45:41,350 --> 02:45:42,270
now she had this weird,

5941
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:43,310
bizarre conversation.

5942
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:43,740
She's like,

5943
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:43,880
I,

5944
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:45,040
Jesus is in my heart.

5945
02:45:45,310 --> 02:45:45,611
I go,

5946
02:45:45,611 --> 02:45:46,360
you did you.

5947
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:47,890
Did he tell you that's his name?

5948
02:45:48,130 --> 02:45:49,150
Did you get to know him?

5949
02:45:49,151 --> 02:45:50,170
Like what are you talking about?

5950
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:52,510
And then she starts
talking about the Bible,

5951
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:54,040
which Bible we're talking about.

5952
02:45:54,041 --> 02:45:56,560
We're talking about the old testament
talking about the new testament.

5953
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:00,670
And we had this creepy fucking Weirdo
conversation when it was just such an,

5954
02:46:00,671 --> 02:46:02,350
you knew you were never
going to be game over.

5955
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:03,490
You're never seen those cheeks.

5956
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:03,760
Oops.

5957
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:04,311
I did.

5958
02:46:04,311 --> 02:46:04,750
It wasn't.

5959
02:46:04,750 --> 02:46:06,130
I was at at the time,

5960
02:46:06,131 --> 02:46:06,850
like for me,

5961
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:10,370
I was as nice as I could
have been while I was feral.

5962
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:12,950
I'm sure she didn't
talk to you after that.

5963
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:13,151
No,

5964
02:46:13,151 --> 02:46:13,280
no.

5965
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:13,911
I was done.

5966
02:46:13,911 --> 02:46:14,320
I was like,

5967
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:14,870
okay.

5968
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:16,250
I grew up around,

5969
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:18,470
I was in Catholic school
in the first grade.

5970
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:20,510
I grew up around crazy religious people.

5971
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:22,700
By the time I was like in,

5972
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:23,360
you know,

5973
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:25,520
my high school days and
pass my high school days.

5974
02:46:25,521 --> 02:46:26,240
I was like,

5975
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,500
I see what the fuck's going on.

5976
02:46:27,501 --> 02:46:28,191
Like you're crazy.

5977
02:46:28,191 --> 02:46:29,330
You're not talking to me in this.

5978
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:30,800
So I was just confused.

5979
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:32,210
Here's my question to
everybody at the table.

5980
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:32,801
She was so,

5981
02:46:32,801 --> 02:46:33,100
ah,

5982
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:37,960
have you had my experience has colt
like I was ready and really religious,

5983
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:39,440
really religious girls.

5984
02:46:39,441 --> 02:46:39,980
Fuck.

5985
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:41,690
Immediately in my,

5986
02:46:41,691 --> 02:46:45,530
in my dating history at the girl has
talked about the warmth to the way they

5987
02:46:45,531 --> 02:46:46,030
approach.

5988
02:46:46,030 --> 02:46:46,863
Yes.

5989
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:52,540
When they loved the Lord
will be sucking your cock.

5990
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:53,780
That guy behind him,

5991
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:55,250
Matt motherfucking Hume,

5992
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:58,180
that guy knows as much about Jay.

5993
02:46:58,420 --> 02:46:58,680
Yeah.

5994
02:46:58,680 --> 02:46:59,570
Might be the best.

5995
02:46:59,571 --> 02:47:02,330
He him and for us a hobby
and there's like him,

5996
02:47:02,331 --> 02:47:02,601
Duke,

5997
02:47:02,601 --> 02:47:03,111
Roufus,

5998
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:04,460
Surat for us a hobby.

5999
02:47:04,580 --> 02:47:05,121
There's a,

6000
02:47:05,121 --> 02:47:07,550
there's a few get bang
for striking for sure,

6001
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:10,490
but as far as like overall MMA coaches,

6002
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:11,421
man,

6003
02:47:11,421 --> 02:47:13,300
it's tough to not give the nod to Matt.

6004
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:13,620
Matt,

6005
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:15,110
you more for us are my number one.

6006
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:16,040
They're number one.

6007
02:47:16,040 --> 02:47:16,550
They're there.

6008
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:19,910
It's like the pound for pound tongue and
can really rotate them out and got like

6009
02:47:19,970 --> 02:47:20,570
GSP.

6010
02:47:20,570 --> 02:47:21,403
Obviously he,

6011
02:47:21,590 --> 02:47:24,680
he developed under the
tutelage of for us a hobby,

6012
02:47:24,681 --> 02:47:27,970
but he would have developed under
the tutelage of Matt Hume to maybe,

6013
02:47:28,490 --> 02:47:28,911
I don't know.

6014
02:47:28,911 --> 02:47:29,720
I think you would have,

6015
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:31,040
if he could learn French

6016
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:33,411
for Austin.

6017
02:47:33,411 --> 02:47:34,320
GSP were boys,

6018
02:47:34,321 --> 02:47:38,330
so they get his bond and connection
is a big fighting for each other.

6019
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:39,770
Now if you're Tim Elliot,

6020
02:47:39,771 --> 02:47:41,300
it's guns bombs away,

6021
02:47:41,301 --> 02:47:42,134
right?

6022
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:43,521
What do you do?

6023
02:47:43,521 --> 02:47:44,241
It's bombs away.

6024
02:47:44,241 --> 02:47:45,200
You've got to go bombs away.

6025
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:46,850
You think you just got
to go balls to the wall.

6026
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:47,933
What's in style?

6027
02:47:47,950 --> 02:47:48,480
Yeah,

6028
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:49,131
almost.

6029
02:47:49,131 --> 02:47:49,371
Yeah.

6030
02:47:49,371 --> 02:47:52,430
I mean almost like the only way
you didn't get to how technique.

6031
02:47:52,431 --> 02:47:52,881
This guy.

6032
02:47:52,881 --> 02:47:53,550
He's like,

6033
02:47:53,550 --> 02:47:57,010
who did it well and do
the high level guy though.

6034
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:57,561
It's lost.

6035
02:47:57,561 --> 02:48:00,150
It is like Geo beaten coming.

6036
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:00,740
You know what I mean?

6037
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:01,221
In a way.

6038
02:48:01,221 --> 02:48:01,431
Yeah,

6039
02:48:01,431 --> 02:48:02,000
you're right.

6040
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,790
Most people thought Cummings was an,

6041
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,650
you know and rightfully so.

6042
02:48:06,651 --> 02:48:08,420
He's mulling through
everybody with this heel hook.

6043
02:48:08,450 --> 02:48:08,931
Hey Man,

6044
02:48:08,931 --> 02:48:12,330
Geo hang with that and he
did her Daniel Exporters.

6045
02:48:12,350 --> 02:48:15,830
MMA is like Wednesday on
the Mickey Mouse Club.

6046
02:48:16,250 --> 02:48:18,230
Wednesday is anything can happen day.

6047
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:18,651
Oh yeah,

6048
02:48:18,651 --> 02:48:20,360
Wednesday that's an MMA is,

6049
02:48:20,600 --> 02:48:22,280
that's what MMA is as a sport.

6050
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:23,211
MMA is,

6051
02:48:23,211 --> 02:48:24,350
anything can happen day.

6052
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:25,370
Not at this weight class.

6053
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:26,420
Disagree with that.

6054
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:27,253
I disagree.

6055
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:28,873
Disagree.

6056
02:48:31,290 --> 02:48:32,360
Those are little human being.

6057
02:48:32,361 --> 02:48:34,100
What do you mean anything can happen.

6058
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:36,770
Can't happen because of the way.

6059
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:38,030
Explain that.

6060
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:42,350
He'd just said anything good happening
inside disagreed because of the ways the

6061
02:48:42,351 --> 02:48:42,980
weight class.

6062
02:48:42,980 --> 02:48:47,980
What can't happen because of the weight
guys can get k cause they're so wise

6063
02:48:49,221 --> 02:48:51,060
we'll get Kayo they do get care at all.

6064
02:48:51,170 --> 02:48:54,530
Like not maybe as often odds,

6065
02:48:55,850 --> 02:49:00,350
odds of statistics sizeist
anything but anything can happen.

6066
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:05,360
It can happen and I want butter.

6067
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:08,370
Stock

6068
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:09,390
out can happen.

6069
02:49:09,630 --> 02:49:10,463
And

6070
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:16,050
the opposite end of the spectrum
is the cad decision can happen.

6071
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:17,131
Yes.

6072
02:49:17,131 --> 02:49:17,964
So

6073
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:19,953
one,

6074
02:49:23,360 --> 02:49:25,950
can I just stop this before this fight
and say this is my favorite thing to do

6075
02:49:25,951 --> 02:49:26,784
and my whole life,

6076
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:30,570
the best thing in up this morning,

6077
02:49:31,170 --> 02:49:32,370
I woke up this morning,

6078
02:49:32,371 --> 02:49:33,950
crunk is fucked about it.

6079
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:40,831
So stupid.

6080
02:49:40,831 --> 02:49:41,840
Fuck I fucking love.

6081
02:49:41,841 --> 02:49:43,860
We must watch this because he's ready.

6082
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:44,940
And again,

6083
02:49:44,941 --> 02:49:46,300
here's the thing I'm saying I'm,

6084
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:47,850
I've been singing this
dude's praises forever.

6085
02:49:47,851 --> 02:49:48,071
I thought,

6086
02:49:48,071 --> 02:49:49,740
I don't think mighty
mouse gets enough respect.

6087
02:49:50,490 --> 02:49:53,850
I don't think he gets the respect that
he deserves that first phase of he's,

6088
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:54,650
he's,

6089
02:49:54,650 --> 02:49:55,411
he said your name,

6090
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:55,621
right?

6091
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:56,460
So you say his name.

6092
02:49:56,461 --> 02:49:57,181
I love mighty mouse.

6093
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:57,870
He's going to put,

6094
02:49:57,870 --> 02:49:58,531
this is what I think.

6095
02:49:58,531 --> 02:50:00,870
Forget about all the weight and
all that stuff that you write.

6096
02:50:00,871 --> 02:50:01,980
You make some really good points.

6097
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:05,040
But as far as an expression
of martial arts talent,

6098
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:07,260
that's the finest I've
ever seen in my life.

6099
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:11,040
I don't give a fuck what he ways as far
as expression of martial arts talent,

6100
02:50:11,070 --> 02:50:12,270
that's the finest I've ever seen.

6101
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:14,730
So if Tim Elliot can beat him,

6102
02:50:14,731 --> 02:50:18,100
which he absolutely can because
it's Wednesday and Wednesdays,

6103
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,960
anything can happen.

6104
02:50:18,961 --> 02:50:20,250
Not In the little boy's club.

6105
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:21,510
Never know bro.

6106
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:22,600
You most likely right?

6107
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:25,560
Slapping people get injured.

6108
02:50:25,561 --> 02:50:26,400
Weird Shit happens.

6109
02:50:26,401 --> 02:50:27,390
Hands break,

6110
02:50:27,391 --> 02:50:27,781
knees,

6111
02:50:27,781 --> 02:50:29,240
pop backs go.

6112
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:31,000
Mighty mouse does this for my mass.

6113
02:50:31,001 --> 02:50:34,110
Com Guy Zigs when he
should exact changes it up.

6114
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:34,560
Oh,

6115
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:35,430
blocking plot.

6116
02:50:35,440 --> 02:50:36,330
Oh listen man.

6117
02:50:36,331 --> 02:50:36,900
Blocking.

6118
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:38,370
But you never know man.

6119
02:50:38,450 --> 02:50:38,830
Damn.

6120
02:50:38,830 --> 02:50:41,100
I was doing some funky shit and loose.

6121
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:42,120
You never know.

6122
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:43,110
You never know dude.

6123
02:50:43,111 --> 02:50:44,250
Weird Shit happens.

6124
02:50:44,251 --> 02:50:46,230
The world is strange and moves so quickly.

6125
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:49,650
It's because they're small.

6126
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:51,510
Look at this Tim Elliot.

6127
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:53,760
Good fucking shots from the bottom.

6128
02:50:54,490 --> 02:50:54,931
Who's good?

6129
02:50:54,931 --> 02:50:55,764
Scramble,

6130
02:50:55,790 --> 02:50:56,240
scramble.

6131
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:57,073
Mighty mouse.

6132
02:50:57,450 --> 02:50:58,800
Barlow spinning.

6133
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:01,440
Oh look at his left knee's
got to get into play.

6134
02:51:01,441 --> 02:51:03,030
Can't do it just to try and go.

6135
02:51:03,031 --> 02:51:03,864
Can't do that.

6136
02:51:04,070 --> 02:51:06,210
You got some side controls.

6137
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:08,370
Fuck yeah.

6138
02:51:08,370 --> 02:51:09,203
High level.

6139
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:10,950
Cause if you just did that to Demetrius,

6140
02:51:10,951 --> 02:51:11,980
just get site control.

6141
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:12,873
Top Position.

6142
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:13,770
Your high level.

6143
02:51:13,770 --> 02:51:13,921
Yeah,

6144
02:51:13,921 --> 02:51:15,340
look at this all ready.

6145
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:17,940
Let's go level right there.

6146
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:18,121
Look,

6147
02:51:18,121 --> 02:51:19,130
he's on top

6148
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:24,100
garden near holding onto the neg.

6149
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:27,220
Good wrestlers base.

6150
02:51:27,660 --> 02:51:29,370
Mighty mouse is thrown those legs up,

6151
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:32,250
but it's kind of look at
the space and look at this.

6152
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:34,060
Look at this base and balance.

6153
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:36,390
This is why am is beautiful.

6154
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:38,970
This is why MMA is beautiful.

6155
02:51:38,971 --> 02:51:40,380
Look at this Elliot with a good grip.

6156
02:51:40,410 --> 02:51:40,681
Oh,

6157
02:51:40,681 --> 02:51:41,670
nice knee to the head.

6158
02:51:41,820 --> 02:51:42,360
Elliot.

6159
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:44,280
Look at this high level grappler.

6160
02:51:44,970 --> 02:51:45,890
Alien is highlights.

6161
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:46,590
Don't get submitted.

6162
02:51:46,590 --> 02:51:46,771
Oh no,

6163
02:51:46,771 --> 02:51:47,604
he's passing.

6164
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:48,650
Oh Yo dude.

6165
02:51:48,651 --> 02:51:48,741
No,

6166
02:51:48,741 --> 02:51:48,960
no,

6167
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:49,990
he's not necessarily.

6168
02:51:49,991 --> 02:51:50,610
He's dancing.

6169
02:51:50,610 --> 02:51:51,360
It could be over.

6170
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:51,751
Okay.

6171
02:51:51,751 --> 02:51:52,410
It could.

6172
02:51:52,410 --> 02:51:52,940
Oh,

6173
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:54,090
if he doesn't shit.

6174
02:51:54,120 --> 02:51:54,953
Holy Shit.

6175
02:51:55,820 --> 02:51:56,653
Oh Shit.

6176
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:01,780
Oh Shit.

6177
02:52:05,400 --> 02:52:10,400
The reason I was talking all that shit
tell you I was trying to tell you,

6178
02:52:10,511 --> 02:52:10,870
it's over.

6179
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:11,703
He's going to sleep.

6180
02:52:11,770 --> 02:52:12,520
He's going to sleep.

6181
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:12,971
It's over.

6182
02:52:12,971 --> 02:52:13,700
He's going to talk.

6183
02:52:13,700 --> 02:52:15,280
Talking all hundred percent

6184
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:18,510
djs holding that thought.

6185
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:19,750
Goddamn.

6186
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:20,660
Demetrius Johnson,

6187
02:52:20,661 --> 02:52:21,640
he's got a little space.

6188
02:52:21,641 --> 02:52:24,190
There is a little space you
see where he's using his time

6189
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:28,610
and very deep,

6190
02:52:28,611 --> 02:52:29,480
but DJ

6191
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:36,600
deep so quick means that he knows it
takes a while sometimes feel like Phil

6192
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:37,820
knows it takes a while.

6193
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:41,490
He knows that's good.

6194
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:42,373
Who knows

6195
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:45,133
right

6196
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:48,690
shots and saw amazing

6197
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:52,680
holy Shit.

6198
02:52:56,300 --> 02:52:57,610
He's going to try

6199
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:01,720
the neck.

6200
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:06,070
He's going to try to go
to the back and on top.

6201
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:06,740
You know what?

6202
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:09,070
Cast is a fight.

6203
02:53:09,071 --> 02:53:09,821
That's holy shit.

6204
02:53:09,821 --> 02:53:11,390
What if he gets him with
the exact same ticket?

6205
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:12,670
Raymark oh,

6206
02:53:12,671 --> 02:53:13,121
look at this.

6207
02:53:13,121 --> 02:53:14,710
He's got that are run under the neck.

6208
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:18,280
Shafi float around with the same shit.

6209
02:53:18,370 --> 02:53:18,860
He might.

6210
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:20,050
He looks like he's moving there.

6211
02:53:20,170 --> 02:53:21,003
He's moving there.

6212
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:23,050
He's baiting him for the
under hook on the left side.

6213
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:24,790
Left under hook.

6214
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:26,510
You're just sprawled out and
you've got to hit her norm.

6215
02:53:26,530 --> 02:53:26,780
Dude.

6216
02:53:26,780 --> 02:53:29,110
You know about the amount of gold.

6217
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:31,833
How dare you.

6218
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:34,173
Oh,

6219
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:39,250
he can get in with the exact
same technique and he's
punches that fucking right

6220
02:53:39,251 --> 02:53:39,910
arm under.

6221
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:41,020
Let's see if he punches that right.

6222
02:53:41,021 --> 02:53:41,710
Aren't editor?

6223
02:53:41,710 --> 02:53:41,980
Nope.

6224
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:42,813
He didn't even have it.

6225
02:53:43,950 --> 02:53:45,050
This Elliot back up.

6226
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:48,780
Very nice.

6227
02:53:50,350 --> 02:53:50,700
Joe.

6228
02:53:50,700 --> 02:53:51,460
Say this with,

6229
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:52,293
with the,

6230
02:53:52,570 --> 02:53:53,440
with the OSP.

6231
02:53:53,441 --> 02:53:53,701
John.

6232
02:53:53,701 --> 02:53:54,090
Joe,

6233
02:53:54,090 --> 02:53:54,360
give me,

6234
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:54,730
Oh,

6235
02:53:54,730 --> 02:53:56,110
good fucking movement there.

6236
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:56,981
Good movement.

6237
02:53:56,981 --> 02:53:58,210
Avoiding all those punches.

6238
02:53:58,480 --> 02:53:59,620
Even if he's tired.

6239
02:53:59,830 --> 02:54:00,910
That was good head movement.

6240
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:01,320
Oh,

6241
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:01,950
don't do this.

6242
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:02,490
Fine,

6243
02:54:02,490 --> 02:54:03,100
man.

6244
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:03,670
Fine.

6245
02:54:03,670 --> 02:54:04,150
No,

6246
02:54:04,150 --> 02:54:04,781
no dude.

6247
02:54:04,781 --> 02:54:05,740
Don't put hands on.

6248
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:08,220
That's fine.

6249
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:09,120
That's not fine.

6250
02:54:09,121 --> 02:54:09,730
Less.

6251
02:54:09,730 --> 02:54:11,170
You're fucking around.

6252
02:54:11,450 --> 02:54:12,490
Wants to do.

6253
02:54:12,491 --> 02:54:12,881
Thank you.

6254
02:54:12,881 --> 02:54:13,570
Tired.

6255
02:54:13,570 --> 02:54:15,500
Tell me who's fucked
around with this thing.

6256
02:54:16,170 --> 02:54:18,160
Elliot's fuck around and it's worth

6257
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:25,943
playing.

6258
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:29,380
Fuck,

6259
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:30,213
you're right.

6260
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:32,060
Let's not 12 now.

6261
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:33,130
He just knocked mighty mouse.

6262
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:34,500
Oh,

6263
02:54:34,510 --> 02:54:35,343
beautiful.

6264
02:54:37,090 --> 02:54:42,090
What is going on top of the
world that this holds this round?

6265
02:54:42,131 --> 02:54:46,210
He's looking at the guy
said anything can happen.

6266
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:50,890
[inaudible]

6267
02:54:50,890 --> 02:54:52,870
is Wednesday on the Mickey Mouse Club.

6268
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:54,370
Even in little boy's club.

6269
02:54:54,420 --> 02:54:54,790
Yep.

6270
02:54:54,790 --> 02:54:56,000
You run what's called

6271
02:54:57,670 --> 02:54:58,503
crazy

6272
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:01,720
Johnson.

6273
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:02,620
He's hurting here.

6274
02:55:02,770 --> 02:55:04,190
He just woke up to meters.

6275
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:06,920
Just woke up and said
what the fuck his feet.

6276
02:55:06,921 --> 02:55:08,180
But he's getting good teamed here.

6277
02:55:08,181 --> 02:55:09,890
He's gotta be real careful
with that left arm.

6278
02:55:10,130 --> 02:55:11,570
This is Elliot Shit Man.

6279
02:55:11,660 --> 02:55:14,090
He's really good at closing
the show for 10 seconds.

6280
02:55:14,210 --> 02:55:14,391
Oh,

6281
02:55:14,391 --> 02:55:16,040
he's pushed it off.

6282
02:55:16,041 --> 02:55:16,760
Good defray.

6283
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:20,200
Nice cross to number one that Joe oil.

6284
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:21,193
You got him let it.

6285
02:55:21,770 --> 02:55:22,220
Well,

6286
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:23,630
it depends on how this plays out.

6287
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,010
Sharepoint now never seen John in trouble.

6288
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:26,810
Like,

6289
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:28,340
oh you have in the gloves and fight.

6290
02:55:28,520 --> 02:55:32,260
He was in trouble and the Gustafson fight
and you're not this bigger truck knock

6291
02:55:32,450 --> 02:55:34,640
the speaking side rocks.

6292
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:34,941
No.

6293
02:55:34,941 --> 02:55:38,450
But Vito Belfort did catch him
in an arm bar fully extended.

6294
02:55:38,451 --> 02:55:38,780
He said,

6295
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:40,910
oh cool dude.

6296
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:42,230
Here's the thing he didn't do.

6297
02:55:42,231 --> 02:55:42,830
He didn't have,

6298
02:55:42,830 --> 02:55:44,090
which was fucking substantial.

6299
02:55:46,050 --> 02:55:46,883
Second on your list,

6300
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:48,020
I know you like John Jones.

6301
02:55:48,021 --> 02:55:48,854
We know this.

6302
02:55:48,890 --> 02:55:49,340
Okay.

6303
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:51,230
Second is Connor mighty mouse.

6304
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:54,830
Mighty mouse is probably like
five for makers weight class.

6305
02:55:55,220 --> 02:56:00,220
He rose on your shit fro seven or eight
last time we did never seven or duty

6306
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:05,400
froze like a motherfucker fucker.

6307
02:56:05,890 --> 02:56:06,380
Hell yeah.

6308
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:08,240
What those fucking counter labs.

6309
02:56:08,270 --> 02:56:12,740
Here's what I think about 10 pound
for pound bricks weighs just like,

6310
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:14,460
it's just like he's just waiting for him.

6311
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:16,040
Who's going to take that shit?

6312
02:56:16,041 --> 02:56:16,521
He let me,

6313
02:56:16,521 --> 02:56:18,020
let me ask you if you guys agree with me.

6314
02:56:18,021 --> 02:56:21,710
This is how I feel about when you start
talking about top 10 pound for pound.

6315
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:24,140
My feeling is that it's a fun debate.

6316
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:24,591
Correct.

6317
02:56:24,591 --> 02:56:28,760
I let the reality is you don't really
know whether it's number one or number two

6318
02:56:28,761 --> 02:56:31,980
or number three cause there's
an argument to the gross cyborg.

6319
02:56:32,300 --> 02:56:33,410
Yeah,

6320
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:34,580
it's fine.

6321
02:56:34,580 --> 02:56:35,060
Yeah.

6322
02:56:35,060 --> 02:56:35,290
Yeah.

6323
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:39,050
It's [inaudible] look at their stuff,

6324
02:56:39,051 --> 02:56:40,270
but you got to look at longevity.

6325
02:56:40,271 --> 02:56:41,800
You're looking at somebody who's beat up,

6326
02:56:42,190 --> 02:56:45,920
beat up silver did this man look at this.

6327
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:46,280
Tim.

6328
02:56:46,280 --> 02:56:47,450
Tim Elliot went karate.

6329
02:56:47,730 --> 02:56:48,563
I look at this.

6330
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:50,540
He went full side was so relaxed.

6331
02:56:50,541 --> 02:56:51,410
It's impressive.

6332
02:56:51,530 --> 02:56:51,771
Well,

6333
02:56:51,771 --> 02:56:55,030
he has dominated in several
moments of that ranch.

6334
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,500
He was doing it in the first round
of jail before he was really,

6335
02:56:57,700 --> 02:56:59,240
that's race 10 tires.

6336
02:56:59,330 --> 02:57:00,170
Oh man,

6337
02:57:00,171 --> 02:57:00,441
man,

6338
02:57:00,441 --> 02:57:00,710
man,

6339
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:01,190
look at this.

6340
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:02,023
Oh

6341
02:57:03,170 --> 02:57:03,471
Damn.

6342
02:57:03,471 --> 02:57:06,500
He stand in front of them while the
more relaxed he can stay like that.

6343
02:57:06,530 --> 02:57:10,030
How you can wide shots and
turn things into a grappling.

6344
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:11,960
Ever relax was racist.

6345
02:57:12,140 --> 02:57:12,973
Get Out.

6346
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:24,650
You see Henry pseudo like he's so relaxed.

6347
02:57:24,930 --> 02:57:25,763
That's,

6348
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:26,973
what did he say?

6349
02:57:27,030 --> 02:57:27,863
He's lazy.

6350
02:57:28,210 --> 02:57:28,470
Yo.

6351
02:57:28,470 --> 02:57:31,180
Do people say that about
me all the time I left.

6352
02:57:31,270 --> 02:57:32,240
I called Tyron Woodley.

6353
02:57:32,241 --> 02:57:33,074
Explosive.

6354
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:37,100
What the fuck am I
supposed to look at him?

6355
02:57:38,710 --> 02:57:40,160
Can you imagine when smooth,

6356
02:57:40,310 --> 02:57:41,900
smooth becomes racist?

6357
02:57:42,170 --> 02:57:43,070
Like duty smooth.

6358
02:57:43,071 --> 02:57:44,110
Like fuck yeah,

6359
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:44,993
look at him

6360
02:57:46,750 --> 02:57:47,491
fucking smooth.

6361
02:57:47,491 --> 02:57:47,881
Fuck you.

6362
02:57:47,881 --> 02:57:48,714
I'm not smooth.

6363
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:48,991
What?

6364
02:57:48,991 --> 02:57:50,130
I was born smooth.

6365
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:51,930
You never know man.

6366
02:57:51,931 --> 02:57:53,280
He's his elbow.

6367
02:57:53,281 --> 02:57:55,440
You look at where his
bicep is and the ear,

6368
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:56,760
it's not going up.

6369
02:57:56,761 --> 02:57:57,594
It's going down.

6370
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:58,553
You're not going to,

6371
02:57:58,980 --> 02:57:59,731
you might not,

6372
02:57:59,731 --> 02:58:00,720
but look at it with CEO's.

6373
02:58:00,721 --> 02:58:02,040
His like

6374
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:05,700
Ula tore his bicep placement is his
bicep is getting closer and closer to the

6375
02:58:05,701 --> 02:58:05,910
other.

6376
02:58:05,910 --> 02:58:07,730
It doesn't matter because
he's on the opposite side.

6377
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:08,873
He's in the wrong side,

6378
02:58:09,030 --> 02:58:12,330
but if a guy's really good at
that empty half of physicians

6379
02:58:14,730 --> 02:58:16,590
can take a back like a motherfucker.

6380
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:17,760
Oh Shit.

6381
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:18,833
Mighty mouse.

6382
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,440
Mighty mouse for technical shit.

6383
02:58:23,370 --> 02:58:26,410
This is defensively and I'll

6384
02:58:28,170 --> 02:58:28,590
say,

6385
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:29,423
let's see

6386
02:58:30,610 --> 02:58:35,610
my mouse mighty mouse arm triangle.

6387
02:58:36,151 --> 02:58:37,660
That's a chopping block.

6388
02:58:38,940 --> 02:58:40,020
That's a chopping block,

6389
02:58:40,021 --> 02:58:40,854
right?

6390
02:58:41,050 --> 02:58:42,030
Elliot Simon ranked.

6391
02:58:42,031 --> 02:58:42,721
Where do you rank?

6392
02:58:42,721 --> 02:58:43,770
That's a good move right there.

6393
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,353
Good

6394
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:48,670
traps it position.

6395
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:53,610
It keeps him from getting in that
crucifix fucking striking crucifixions

6396
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:57,930
because he needs his arm on
the other side of the forearm.

6397
02:58:57,931 --> 02:59:00,990
The smashed him down with those
and now let's see if he can pat.

6398
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:01,261
Oh,

6399
02:59:01,261 --> 02:59:05,280
nice left arm was on the
other side of his head.

6400
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:06,773
That's all

6401
02:59:08,500 --> 02:59:09,150
he's looking for.

6402
02:59:09,150 --> 02:59:10,650
That salivary shit.

6403
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:14,250
You can't put your arm on the other side
because you're going to get fucked on

6404
02:59:14,251 --> 02:59:15,390
the right capital right there.

6405
02:59:15,391 --> 02:59:17,730
I'd go inverted arm bar right away

6406
02:59:20,990 --> 02:59:23,430
or something at that Nice,

6407
02:59:23,431 --> 02:59:24,810
neat play by Elliot.

6408
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:26,850
He got that knee into position.

6409
02:59:27,150 --> 02:59:28,440
Is it high level grappler?

6410
02:59:28,441 --> 02:59:28,711
Man,

6411
02:59:28,711 --> 02:59:30,690
if he's super high level,

6412
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:31,980
he's right there.

6413
02:59:32,480 --> 02:59:33,990
All the shit that's going on right here.

6414
02:59:33,991 --> 02:59:34,860
This is like real.

6415
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:36,060
It's not about the submission,

6416
02:59:36,061 --> 02:59:37,800
it's about the wars.

6417
02:59:37,801 --> 02:59:38,610
Elliot beach.

6418
02:59:38,610 --> 02:59:40,920
Every champion in every
weight class in his division,

6419
02:59:40,921 --> 02:59:45,090
it makes you a path of wars before
the submission even comes up.

6420
02:59:46,070 --> 02:59:49,340
Not every so many wars go.

6421
02:59:49,360 --> 02:59:51,050
Oh,

6422
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:53,040
it's not a good look at
there's arms on the other side.

6423
02:59:53,041 --> 02:59:53,730
That's a crucifix.

6424
02:59:53,730 --> 02:59:54,630
It's going to get out of that.

6425
02:59:55,560 --> 02:59:56,860
But his left arms fuck.

6426
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,460
He needs to get his left hand on the
other side of his head right there.

6427
02:59:59,730 --> 03:00:00,361
Once he's there,

6428
03:00:00,361 --> 03:00:00,751
he's good.

6429
03:00:00,751 --> 03:00:02,430
He's getting easy to keep it over there,

6430
03:00:02,610 --> 03:00:04,320
but not that much over there.

6431
03:00:04,321 --> 03:00:07,890
Cause then you'd give up a Saturday
one we gotta you gotta you gotta be the

6432
03:00:07,891 --> 03:00:08,724
master of,

6433
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:10,620
he's going to go for the neck.

6434
03:00:10,890 --> 03:00:13,830
He's trying to turn her down
bar from the half guard.

6435
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:16,921
Oh Shit.

6436
03:00:16,921 --> 03:00:18,080
He's got a good camera.

6437
03:00:18,350 --> 03:00:19,183
It's a killer man.

6438
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:20,041
That's,

6439
03:00:20,041 --> 03:00:20,280
you know,

6440
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:22,350
that's one movie you really
can get from the half card,

6441
03:00:22,351 --> 03:00:22,910
right?

6442
03:00:22,910 --> 03:00:26,670
I remember Matt Hughes Versus Joe Rigs.

6443
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:28,710
It all depends on which camera you want.

6444
03:00:28,711 --> 03:00:30,060
If you want an inverted Kamora,

6445
03:00:30,061 --> 03:00:31,860
you have to be in an half guard.

6446
03:00:31,950 --> 03:00:33,200
If you want the regular Kamora,

6447
03:00:33,201 --> 03:00:34,740
you could pass me inside control,

6448
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,840
but if you're going to
do that inverted one,

6449
03:00:37,170 --> 03:00:38,550
you can't do it from side control.

6450
03:00:38,551 --> 03:00:39,820
You have to jump into half.

6451
03:00:44,300 --> 03:00:45,390
You have to hold him.

6452
03:00:45,450 --> 03:00:46,050
You hold,

6453
03:00:46,050 --> 03:00:47,460
you're holding him in half cock.

6454
03:00:47,730 --> 03:00:48,570
That's really interesting.

6455
03:00:48,930 --> 03:00:50,190
First Time I've ever thought about that.

6456
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:52,950
No more challenge.

6457
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:54,680
Japanese act the same thing.

6458
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:57,420
Japanese neck dial in
the exact same thing.

6459
03:00:57,630 --> 03:00:58,920
You want to stay there,

6460
03:00:59,000 --> 03:00:59,261
right?

6461
03:00:59,261 --> 03:00:59,740
You need to lose.

6462
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:00,190
It locks

6463
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:00,551
them down,

6464
03:01:00,551 --> 03:01:01,020
right at,

6465
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:01,550
yeah.

6466
03:01:01,550 --> 03:01:03,400
Mayer and the inverted arm bar.

6467
03:01:03,430 --> 03:01:04,540
It's all about the angle.

6468
03:01:04,541 --> 03:01:05,200
So you know what?

6469
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:06,790
I don't want to pass after all,

6470
03:01:06,791 --> 03:01:07,241
you know what?

6471
03:01:07,241 --> 03:01:10,540
We're going to stay in Africa and I
don't even want to band and even if I was

6472
03:01:10,541 --> 03:01:11,100
passed,

6473
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:13,620
if I went for the inverted
bard inverted arm bar,

6474
03:01:13,630 --> 03:01:16,180
I would jump in a health card
just to control the hips.

6475
03:01:17,560 --> 03:01:17,801
No,

6476
03:01:17,801 --> 03:01:18,670
he's not taking his back.

6477
03:01:18,671 --> 03:01:18,821
Dude.

6478
03:01:18,821 --> 03:01:20,350
This Elliot wins a position.

6479
03:01:20,351 --> 03:01:24,610
War II DJ cover the head kick
when he had his back on top here.

6480
03:01:24,670 --> 03:01:26,800
Dj Show position.

6481
03:01:26,890 --> 03:01:28,020
It's one to one by.

6482
03:01:28,021 --> 03:01:28,211
Wow.

6483
03:01:28,211 --> 03:01:29,110
This is crazy.

6484
03:01:29,111 --> 03:01:30,430
Eliot on top again.

6485
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:31,720
That's crazy.

6486
03:01:32,860 --> 03:01:33,870
The wrap up

6487
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:41,590
high level with the grease and the sweat,

6488
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:44,500
that makes it even harder to
stay tight and stay controlled.

6489
03:01:44,501 --> 03:01:48,850
Shit to keep position and keep dominant
position was and all that greets and

6490
03:01:48,851 --> 03:01:49,820
sweat and all that.

6491
03:01:49,821 --> 03:01:51,570
Vaseline all over your fucking eyes.

6492
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,850
All over your back and
all over my pants off.

6493
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:07,290
Impose your will on me.

6494
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:08,133
Impose your will on here.

6495
03:02:08,860 --> 03:02:09,693
Give me

6496
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:14,400
some always talking about sex story

6497
03:02:17,710 --> 03:02:18,543
volume.

6498
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:22,540
First time he's lost around you.

6499
03:02:22,541 --> 03:02:23,530
Don't shoot me and said,

6500
03:02:23,590 --> 03:02:24,341
I want to hear what he's saying.

6501
03:02:24,341 --> 03:02:25,080
The heart of it.

6502
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:25,640
I wouldn't miss.

6503
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:26,410
Dammit.

6504
03:02:26,410 --> 03:02:27,243
Fuck.

6505
03:02:27,400 --> 03:02:28,151
I want to hear man.

6506
03:02:28,151 --> 03:02:28,984
Human advice.

6507
03:02:29,020 --> 03:02:29,351
Damn.

6508
03:02:29,351 --> 03:02:29,681
Look at him.

6509
03:02:29,681 --> 03:02:33,130
Jumping around cardio that Dee did.

6510
03:02:33,131 --> 03:02:33,700
Sprints.

6511
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:35,560
It's all about you guys
talking about Randall's.

6512
03:02:35,561 --> 03:02:36,530
I did my rounds.

6513
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:38,561
I did eight rounds.

6514
03:02:38,561 --> 03:02:39,394
I didn't nine rounds.

6515
03:02:39,400 --> 03:02:40,240
I did 10 rounds.

6516
03:02:40,241 --> 03:02:44,150
I train six rounds and
it's about fucking sprints.

6517
03:02:46,090 --> 03:02:48,340
Are you doing your spray?

6518
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:50,420
That's where the cardio
is coming at the round.

6519
03:02:50,421 --> 03:02:51,880
You're sparring and Brown three.

6520
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:53,860
That's not realistic.

6521
03:02:54,130 --> 03:02:56,430
It's the fucking springs
up from South Portland.

6522
03:02:56,431 --> 03:02:56,620
Right?

6523
03:02:56,620 --> 03:02:57,100
Look at that.

6524
03:02:57,100 --> 03:02:58,300
If this guy wins,

6525
03:02:58,930 --> 03:03:00,070
Trump is president.

6526
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:00,790
It's the biggest.

6527
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:02,520
Is it their biggest upset in history?

6528
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:02,981
Listen,

6529
03:03:02,981 --> 03:03:03,830
America's gun crazy.

6530
03:03:03,831 --> 03:03:05,310
Did you vote for Hillary Callin?

6531
03:03:06,910 --> 03:03:07,743
No,

6532
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:11,050
not during this fight.

6533
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:12,513
No fight.

6534
03:03:13,810 --> 03:03:14,870
Stop it.

6535
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:18,000
Come back to it.

6536
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:19,390
We'll come back to tell me the truth.

6537
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:23,533
I begged

6538
03:03:32,390 --> 03:03:33,210
God.

6539
03:03:33,210 --> 03:03:34,043
Please,

6540
03:03:35,620 --> 03:03:36,390
please.

6541
03:03:36,390 --> 03:03:36,660
Dot.

6542
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:37,780
Eddie please.

6543
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:38,230
Andy.

6544
03:03:38,230 --> 03:03:38,621
I'm joking.

6545
03:03:38,621 --> 03:03:39,454
I'm messing with you.

6546
03:03:39,750 --> 03:03:40,121
Okay,

6547
03:03:40,121 --> 03:03:42,120
because she got to trap the arm son.

6548
03:03:42,370 --> 03:03:43,203
Oh,

6549
03:03:43,270 --> 03:03:44,460
he's covering his nose.

6550
03:03:44,620 --> 03:03:45,550
He's not allowed to do that.

6551
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:46,393
Are you?

6552
03:03:47,890 --> 03:03:48,491
Oh my God.

6553
03:03:48,491 --> 03:03:49,324
That was a close.

6554
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:50,433
Oh Shit.

6555
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:51,350
Oh No.

6556
03:03:51,350 --> 03:03:52,183
Neck.

6557
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:58,123
I did watch one.

6558
03:03:58,210 --> 03:03:59,850
Tough guys pick.

6559
03:03:59,851 --> 03:04:00,780
They're all juiciness,

6560
03:04:00,830 --> 03:04:01,700
takedown man.

6561
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:02,271
Very nice.

6562
03:04:02,271 --> 03:04:03,950
Take Down Jesus Christ.

6563
03:04:05,450 --> 03:04:06,290
Look at this.

6564
03:04:06,530 --> 03:04:09,950
These guys are going to attorney and
into a grappling match and he looks like

6565
03:04:09,951 --> 03:04:11,600
he's getting the better
of these positions.

6566
03:04:11,780 --> 03:04:13,190
He's a honing yum grappling.

6567
03:04:13,930 --> 03:04:14,540
Juliet,

6568
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:15,590
this is incredible.

6569
03:04:15,620 --> 03:04:16,453
Amazing.

6570
03:04:18,330 --> 03:04:20,120
Liquidus Elliot hangs on.

6571
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:23,930
That's some Jujitsu and rolled him and
Elliot stayed on top of the entire time.

6572
03:04:23,931 --> 03:04:24,681
This is incredible.

6573
03:04:24,681 --> 03:04:24,800
Look,

6574
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:25,633
he's got the leg

6575
03:04:27,580 --> 03:04:28,320
desolate.

6576
03:04:28,320 --> 03:04:29,160
Temelia wrestling.

6577
03:04:29,420 --> 03:04:31,670
100% this is incredible.

6578
03:04:31,730 --> 03:04:32,150
Oh,

6579
03:04:32,150 --> 03:04:32,870
look at this shit.

6580
03:04:32,870 --> 03:04:33,621
Oh,

6581
03:04:33,621 --> 03:04:34,510
he's getting lit up,

6582
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:34,881
man.

6583
03:04:34,881 --> 03:04:36,080
He's getting lit up.

6584
03:04:36,081 --> 03:04:38,870
This is third round and kind of like,

6585
03:04:38,871 --> 03:04:39,081
God,

6586
03:04:39,081 --> 03:04:40,340
what the hell do I do here?

6587
03:04:40,430 --> 03:04:41,181
Damn.

6588
03:04:41,181 --> 03:04:42,740
He must have been tired.

6589
03:04:42,741 --> 03:04:43,574
And he says,

6590
03:04:45,230 --> 03:04:45,951
he's a champ.

6591
03:04:45,951 --> 03:04:46,880
He's so strong.

6592
03:04:47,060 --> 03:04:47,620
That's race.

6593
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:50,770
Really good race old guys.

6594
03:04:50,840 --> 03:04:51,231
Oh look,

6595
03:04:51,231 --> 03:04:53,780
he's white as as he's got Simeon's.

6596
03:04:53,990 --> 03:04:55,220
I didn't say swim sprint.

6597
03:04:55,221 --> 03:04:56,160
I said regular sprints.

6598
03:04:56,161 --> 03:04:56,700
Well that's what I'm saying.

6599
03:04:56,700 --> 03:04:57,830
It's racism.

6600
03:04:57,831 --> 03:04:58,520
Work on Elliot.

6601
03:04:58,520 --> 03:04:58,720
Look.

6602
03:04:58,720 --> 03:04:58,971
Okay,

6603
03:04:58,971 --> 03:04:59,804
but look at this.

6604
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:00,890
Dimitri is on top.

6605
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:05,260
He's got that right arm trapped
looking for that head out,

6606
03:05:05,370 --> 03:05:06,920
but not so not totally

6607
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:11,210
capture fueled on math.

6608
03:05:11,211 --> 03:05:11,391
No,

6609
03:05:11,391 --> 03:05:12,224
really pat,

6610
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:13,213
because he's white,

6611
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:15,490
white trash people.

6612
03:05:15,490 --> 03:05:16,610
Stats are off trucks.

6613
03:05:18,140 --> 03:05:18,973
The stereotype.

6614
03:05:19,070 --> 03:05:20,930
White people get in the guard spouse.

6615
03:05:20,931 --> 03:05:24,950
I'm sick of it and I'm going to fucking
stand up and right here on the Joe Rogan

6616
03:05:24,951 --> 03:05:25,784
experience,

6617
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:27,170
I am not going to Sam for it.

6618
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:27,561
Okay.

6619
03:05:27,561 --> 03:05:28,570
And I love Hillary.

6620
03:05:28,940 --> 03:05:31,340
We are not in this fight,

6621
03:05:31,341 --> 03:05:31,830
man.

6622
03:05:31,830 --> 03:05:33,780
People get shots.

6623
03:05:34,050 --> 03:05:36,260
What about that black people get past.

6624
03:05:36,261 --> 03:05:37,370
What about that political.

6625
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:38,650
I didn't like either one of those cans,

6626
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:40,880
right?

6627
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:41,930
Coun Brian,

6628
03:05:41,931 --> 03:05:42,764
don't engage.

6629
03:05:43,410 --> 03:05:44,380
I'm watching a fight.

6630
03:05:45,650 --> 03:05:47,180
This is artist as your protocol.

6631
03:05:47,181 --> 03:05:47,991
You're a Cyborg.

6632
03:05:47,991 --> 03:05:48,950
Does Battlestar Galactica.

6633
03:05:50,150 --> 03:05:50,983
Hi Artists.

6634
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:52,970
The CIA is not real.

6635
03:05:52,971 --> 03:05:53,804
I was playing.

6636
03:05:53,990 --> 03:05:54,823
I was playing.

6637
03:05:54,860 --> 03:05:55,760
I was playing.

6638
03:05:55,761 --> 03:05:59,150
I was playing squash to fight
mighty mouse on top of your folks.

6639
03:05:59,210 --> 03:06:00,800
Round three of five terror.

6640
03:06:00,830 --> 03:06:02,420
Mighty mouse will get past that guard.

6641
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:03,690
No,

6642
03:06:03,690 --> 03:06:04,523
he does.

6643
03:06:04,820 --> 03:06:07,300
Hell you drags them right back in strong.

6644
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:09,320
It was wind earlier this round.

6645
03:06:09,321 --> 03:06:10,770
Now he's probably lose the race.

6646
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:11,780
All look at this.

6647
03:06:11,780 --> 03:06:12,890
He keeps throwing those legs up,

6648
03:06:12,891 --> 03:06:13,490
man.

6649
03:06:13,490 --> 03:06:13,851
Elliot,

6650
03:06:13,851 --> 03:06:14,750
stop playing games.

6651
03:06:15,010 --> 03:06:16,220
The mighty mouse takes him back.

6652
03:06:16,580 --> 03:06:18,350
Rolls right back into half guard again.

6653
03:06:18,351 --> 03:06:19,184
Nice.

6654
03:06:19,550 --> 03:06:22,070
He might [inaudible] smart he is.

6655
03:06:22,071 --> 03:06:23,010
He's just thrown elbow.

6656
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:24,640
Why not just do this shit.

6657
03:06:25,020 --> 03:06:25,711
Look at this.

6658
03:06:25,711 --> 03:06:26,560
Look at this.

6659
03:06:26,930 --> 03:06:28,430
Look at this garden with patch.

6660
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:30,200
Elliott.

6661
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:32,830
Got Some batteries with,

6662
03:06:32,900 --> 03:06:33,733
Dang.

6663
03:06:34,520 --> 03:06:36,260
He's very good off of his back.

6664
03:06:36,261 --> 03:06:37,094
I'll tell you that he's too,

6665
03:06:37,130 --> 03:06:38,750
because he can guard pass

6666
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:43,760
mighty mouse for a second truck.

6667
03:06:43,880 --> 03:06:45,170
He did this before.

6668
03:06:45,230 --> 03:06:46,280
He just grabbed some up.

6669
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:49,500
Ellie's my new training arm triangles,

6670
03:06:49,501 --> 03:06:50,840
his own arm traps.

6671
03:06:50,841 --> 03:06:54,440
Mighty mouse makes it somebody mouse
can't do shit and mighty mouse was almost

6672
03:06:54,470 --> 03:06:55,380
kinda complaining.

6673
03:06:55,750 --> 03:06:56,490
Expect.

6674
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:58,140
I'm going to let you
loose so you can hit me.

6675
03:06:58,790 --> 03:07:01,760
It's great if they stand them back
up because I can't stand me back up.

6676
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:04,560
This is a beautiful position position too.

6677
03:07:04,680 --> 03:07:05,820
This is a good position,

6678
03:07:05,821 --> 03:07:06,120
man.

6679
03:07:06,120 --> 03:07:06,331
Yeah,

6680
03:07:06,331 --> 03:07:07,164
great position.

6681
03:07:07,230 --> 03:07:08,190
That's very interesting.

6682
03:07:08,191 --> 03:07:11,730
I haven't seen someone do that
effectively in a world championship fight.

6683
03:07:11,731 --> 03:07:11,821
Oh,

6684
03:07:11,821 --> 03:07:12,361
he lost it,

6685
03:07:12,361 --> 03:07:12,571
man.

6686
03:07:12,571 --> 03:07:13,081
He lost it.

6687
03:07:13,081 --> 03:07:13,914
Let's see here.

6688
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:14,960
Look at this.

6689
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:19,120
That's a kid doesn't have an armed man.

6690
03:07:19,140 --> 03:07:20,490
That grease on the ball head.

6691
03:07:20,491 --> 03:07:24,120
Forget about how many
steps ahead to the factor.

6692
03:07:24,170 --> 03:07:25,230
The bullheaded,

6693
03:07:25,250 --> 03:07:26,083
the grease

6694
03:07:27,330 --> 03:07:28,360
and the banner.

6695
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:33,540
If he would've just had a nice fucking
horrendous Shraub little fucking

6696
03:07:35,150 --> 03:07:35,630
Klieg.

6697
03:07:35,630 --> 03:07:38,160
Weda a little Brian Cowen,

6698
03:07:39,260 --> 03:07:41,370
he would have been fucked constantly.

6699
03:07:41,570 --> 03:07:42,091
Third round,

6700
03:07:42,091 --> 03:07:42,630
right?

6701
03:07:42,630 --> 03:07:43,230
Yes.

6702
03:07:43,230 --> 03:07:45,510
That's a great fight boys.

6703
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:47,880
Delea Elliot's winning by the way.

6704
03:07:48,030 --> 03:07:48,421
Okay.

6705
03:07:48,421 --> 03:07:49,600
That's the nice crying.

6706
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:50,351
Jesus Christ.

6707
03:07:50,351 --> 03:07:51,390
You gotta Rub it in my face.

6708
03:07:57,330 --> 03:07:58,170
It's two one.

6709
03:07:58,190 --> 03:07:59,023
This is a great fight.

6710
03:07:59,200 --> 03:07:59,780
Great.

6711
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:00,271
But here's the,

6712
03:08:00,271 --> 03:08:00,990
here's a good thing.

6713
03:08:00,990 --> 03:08:02,490
A lot of people thought this is a wash.

6714
03:08:02,491 --> 03:08:04,980
They thought that Tim Elliot
was out of his league,

6715
03:08:04,981 --> 03:08:07,120
this guy and a for submitted.

6716
03:08:07,890 --> 03:08:09,210
We're looking at a great fight.

6717
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:11,040
So all bullshit aside.

6718
03:08:11,041 --> 03:08:14,340
We're joking around here and if you
listen to anything you say tonight and you

6719
03:08:14,341 --> 03:08:14,581
think,

6720
03:08:14,581 --> 03:08:15,181
oh my God,

6721
03:08:15,181 --> 03:08:16,410
they're opinions are so fucked up,

6722
03:08:16,770 --> 03:08:19,320
we're were intoxicated
and we're not serious.

6723
03:08:19,450 --> 03:08:20,490
So we need to know,

6724
03:08:20,491 --> 03:08:22,980
like if you looking at
the actual fight itself,

6725
03:08:23,010 --> 03:08:24,390
if this is a great,

6726
03:08:24,391 --> 03:08:25,224
great fight,

6727
03:08:25,230 --> 03:08:27,450
and Tim Elliot deserves
all the respect in,

6728
03:08:27,451 --> 03:08:28,800
the world should be ranked the top five.

6729
03:08:28,801 --> 03:08:29,910
Even when he loses his fight.

6730
03:08:29,911 --> 03:08:30,870
I'm not saying he's going to lose,

6731
03:08:30,871 --> 03:08:31,531
but if he does,

6732
03:08:31,531 --> 03:08:34,470
you have to rank them in the
top five amazing performance.

6733
03:08:34,471 --> 03:08:35,221
Change your stance.

6734
03:08:35,221 --> 03:08:36,054
Now it's too late.

6735
03:08:36,810 --> 03:08:38,670
You can't change your stance
in the middle of a fight.

6736
03:08:38,700 --> 03:08:41,360
It's amazing performance masses
and pound per person or one anyway.

6737
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:42,181
Well,

6738
03:08:42,181 --> 03:08:44,640
it's you are based on your,

6739
03:08:45,210 --> 03:08:45,991
what you've seen,

6740
03:08:45,991 --> 03:08:46,824
like the results,

6741
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:47,610
John.

6742
03:08:47,610 --> 03:08:49,680
That's who you are and
you got to add this in.

6743
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:53,480
You have to add this in and in this
fight he's getting dominated on in Granix

6744
03:08:53,481 --> 03:08:55,380
changes by 10 million by
a guy who's not right.

6745
03:08:55,381 --> 03:08:56,840
The top 15 right.

6746
03:08:56,850 --> 03:08:58,080
You have to add that in.

6747
03:08:58,110 --> 03:08:59,070
If you want to be objective,

6748
03:08:59,071 --> 03:08:59,940
you have to add that in.

6749
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:01,620
So then you'd have to look at him.

6750
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:02,341
You'd have to like,

6751
03:09:02,341 --> 03:09:04,950
who are the other guys besides
Dominick Cruz and Dominick Cruz.

6752
03:09:04,951 --> 03:09:08,160
Of course you really only doing
it based on his past record,

6753
03:09:08,161 --> 03:09:10,860
the TJ victory and then the
domination over your RHY favorite,

6754
03:09:10,861 --> 03:09:11,210
right?

6755
03:09:11,210 --> 03:09:11,341
Yeah.

6756
03:09:11,341 --> 03:09:12,410
You'd want them to enough.

6757
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:14,610
You'd want to wait until
Cody and him fight.

6758
03:09:15,010 --> 03:09:15,400
Damn.

6759
03:09:15,400 --> 03:09:16,480
But fourth round man.

6760
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:17,550
Other than them.

6761
03:09:17,660 --> 03:09:17,940
Who?

6762
03:09:17,940 --> 03:09:20,550
Who else is in the running
other than John Damn.

6763
03:09:20,551 --> 03:09:21,120
Look at Elliot.

6764
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:21,691
The way he like,

6765
03:09:21,691 --> 03:09:22,740
he's holding his hands.

6766
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:25,050
There's a help right there.

6767
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:26,573
Who else?

6768
03:09:28,140 --> 03:09:29,440
He's doing some fucking Carolyn,

6769
03:09:29,441 --> 03:09:30,860
you know karate shit.

6770
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:31,330
My guys,

6771
03:09:31,330 --> 03:09:32,163
Joe,

6772
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:35,940
the highest white guys in MMA,

6773
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:36,953
micro Brisbane,

6774
03:09:37,230 --> 03:09:40,830
the highest ranked white guys in the UFC.

6775
03:09:41,860 --> 03:09:45,000
I take the big guys,

6776
03:09:45,001 --> 03:09:46,500
we can't talk over each other.

6777
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:47,971
White Guy,

6778
03:09:47,971 --> 03:09:50,620
Connor Mcgregor done and
there was discussions.

6779
03:09:50,660 --> 03:09:51,493
Why is

6780
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:54,380
my number one white guy in the US?

6781
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:55,390
American white guy.

6782
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:57,670
Well,

6783
03:09:57,670 --> 03:09:58,480
no one.

6784
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:01,990
Why you fucked Russia?

6785
03:10:02,070 --> 03:10:02,903
That's a Russian

6786
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:05,710
Cleveland.

6787
03:10:05,710 --> 03:10:06,570
He's Croatian.

6788
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:07,600
He's from,

6789
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:08,433
what's his name?

6790
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:08,780
Steve.

6791
03:10:08,780 --> 03:10:09,613
Amy.

6792
03:10:13,270 --> 03:10:14,470
He's from Cleveland.

6793
03:10:14,471 --> 03:10:15,071
Born and raised.

6794
03:10:15,071 --> 03:10:15,671
Okay.

6795
03:10:15,671 --> 03:10:16,600
He was born there,

6796
03:10:16,601 --> 03:10:17,450
but what's does nanny?

6797
03:10:17,460 --> 03:10:18,400
We're all immigrants.

6798
03:10:18,430 --> 03:10:18,551
Hey,

6799
03:10:18,551 --> 03:10:19,970
you fucking drunk drunk.

6800
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:21,013
You're racist.

6801
03:10:22,390 --> 03:10:24,220
White guy in the UFC.

6802
03:10:25,890 --> 03:10:27,290
He's not the highest weekend.

6803
03:10:27,310 --> 03:10:28,061
What are you talking about?

6804
03:10:28,061 --> 03:10:29,120
He's the heavyweight champ of the world.

6805
03:10:29,130 --> 03:10:29,963
They can kill all of them.

6806
03:10:30,670 --> 03:10:30,881
Look,

6807
03:10:30,881 --> 03:10:31,661
classically,

6808
03:10:31,661 --> 03:10:34,600
the heavyweight has always been the
guy who could beat everybody below him.

6809
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:35,810
That's what

6810
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:39,820
Eddie Bravo please.

6811
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,390
They don't have white weight
classes because the small
guys too fast for the big

6812
03:10:43,391 --> 03:10:43,790
guy.

6813
03:10:43,790 --> 03:10:46,600
They have weight class because the
big guys too big for the small guy.

6814
03:10:46,780 --> 03:10:51,730
That's why the white guy that holds
a belt in the UFC and answer me that

6815
03:10:52,270 --> 03:10:54,370
American American white cow.

6816
03:10:54,460 --> 03:10:55,293
Oh man,

6817
03:10:56,890 --> 03:10:57,730
he's got his back.

6818
03:10:57,790 --> 03:10:58,690
It's over son.

6819
03:10:58,780 --> 03:10:59,321
Oh Man.

6820
03:10:59,321 --> 03:10:59,930
Good fight.

6821
03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:00,780
The game's over

6822
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:05,773
over.

6823
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:10,913
Look,

6824
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:12,130
he doesn't even have that load,

6825
03:11:12,170 --> 03:11:13,003
right hook.

6826
03:11:13,650 --> 03:11:14,930
God dammit.

6827
03:11:16,220 --> 03:11:17,770
He's my fucking hero.

6828
03:11:17,900 --> 03:11:20,800
He didn't even have the right
hook and what a bad ass.

6829
03:11:20,890 --> 03:11:21,701
Oh my God.

6830
03:11:21,701 --> 03:11:25,630
Human will he see tick good knees to
the shoulders in the batch I liked.

6831
03:11:26,170 --> 03:11:29,530
I liked how you guys went silent when
you couldn't name another American white

6832
03:11:29,531 --> 03:11:30,410
guy with a belt.

6833
03:11:32,990 --> 03:11:34,110
Some saying,

6834
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:34,811
hey listen,

6835
03:11:34,811 --> 03:11:35,590
Eddie Mexican.

6836
03:11:35,590 --> 03:11:35,741
No,

6837
03:11:35,741 --> 03:11:36,670
he's born in America.

6838
03:11:36,700 --> 03:11:38,350
He's Mexican.

6839
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:39,270
Yes,

6840
03:11:39,550 --> 03:11:40,383
but he's American.

6841
03:11:40,690 --> 03:11:41,710
What is his last house?

6842
03:11:41,740 --> 03:11:42,400
What's his last name?

6843
03:11:42,400 --> 03:11:43,233
My Italian.

6844
03:11:44,750 --> 03:11:45,670
White as fuck.

6845
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:47,630
My German shop shop.

6846
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:51,070
German DJ on top.

6847
03:11:51,900 --> 03:11:52,720
Jay on top.

6848
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:53,553
Crucifix.

6849
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:57,670
It's on the wrong side of that head.

6850
03:11:58,250 --> 03:11:59,320
Goddamn crucifix.

6851
03:11:59,740 --> 03:12:00,271
Right arm.

6852
03:12:00,271 --> 03:12:01,720
It's in the wrong side of the head.

6853
03:12:01,721 --> 03:12:03,910
You can't have it on that sunlight ever.

6854
03:12:04,150 --> 03:12:05,380
It's always got a frame.

6855
03:12:05,381 --> 03:12:06,070
God dammit.

6856
03:12:06,070 --> 03:12:07,270
You got to have that frame.

6857
03:12:08,850 --> 03:12:10,090
Are we talking about Eddie?

6858
03:12:10,380 --> 03:12:10,730
Well,

6859
03:12:10,730 --> 03:12:11,650
he's good now.

6860
03:12:12,080 --> 03:12:13,240
What are we talking about?

6861
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:13,631
Like,

6862
03:12:13,631 --> 03:12:14,530
if you could describe it,

6863
03:12:14,531 --> 03:12:15,700
if you could break down that position.

6864
03:12:15,701 --> 03:12:18,510
His left arm needs to be in front on,

6865
03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:19,720
on uh,

6866
03:12:20,470 --> 03:12:23,830
Demetrius Johnson's left shoulder
on the left side of his neck.

6867
03:12:23,970 --> 03:12:24,380
Right.

6868
03:12:24,380 --> 03:12:25,213
You should come away.

6869
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:26,560
Oh Shit.

6870
03:12:26,560 --> 03:12:27,550
I'm fucked up right now.

6871
03:12:27,551 --> 03:12:28,384
I'm sorry.

6872
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:30,260
Wrong sign Elliot.

6873
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:32,610
So it's like he's in the store.

6874
03:12:32,611 --> 03:12:32,981
You met,

6875
03:12:32,981 --> 03:12:33,814
right.

6876
03:12:34,900 --> 03:12:35,230
Okay.

6877
03:12:35,230 --> 03:12:38,050
Now we're going to know when I just
said now it's totally different because

6878
03:12:38,051 --> 03:12:38,801
they're inside control.

6879
03:12:38,801 --> 03:12:41,830
How is this idea just trying
to set up right there.

6880
03:12:42,030 --> 03:12:42,460
You know,

6881
03:12:42,460 --> 03:12:44,970
he's got old now.

6882
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:46,170
His left arm was in a good spot.

6883
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:46,961
Fights with his eyes.

6884
03:12:46,961 --> 03:12:48,190
His left arm was in a good spot.

6885
03:12:50,110 --> 03:12:50,943
Good spot.

6886
03:12:51,220 --> 03:12:52,340
If his left arm is on,

6887
03:12:52,341 --> 03:12:54,530
the other side of Demeter
has had as a basketball,

6888
03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:55,393
that's where he,

6889
03:12:55,690 --> 03:12:56,220
right?

6890
03:12:56,220 --> 03:12:58,570
So he's got to keep it on this
side of it was framing loss.

6891
03:12:58,660 --> 03:13:00,210
Always frame with that frame.

6892
03:13:00,530 --> 03:13:03,680
That's the frame that's didn't want
to go on the other side like this.

6893
03:13:03,681 --> 03:13:04,371
Doris from,

6894
03:13:04,371 --> 03:13:07,850
do you ever hit that Doris from one
guys pass into your side control?

6895
03:13:08,030 --> 03:13:08,191
Like,

6896
03:13:08,191 --> 03:13:12,310
do you ever let guys out of half guard
inside control to catch that in this

6897
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:13,161
situation?

6898
03:13:13,161 --> 03:13:14,070
It's super technical.

6899
03:13:14,071 --> 03:13:14,571
What I would do,

6900
03:13:14,571 --> 03:13:15,404
I can't just say,

6901
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:18,500
I'm not asking right here,

6902
03:13:18,501 --> 03:13:20,210
but I'm asking do you guys,

6903
03:13:20,300 --> 03:13:21,350
do you know that Jeff Glover,

6904
03:13:21,351 --> 03:13:22,040
he loves that.

6905
03:13:22,040 --> 03:13:23,360
That position where

6906
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:28,600
he's got his arms straight offending.

6907
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:30,740
He's okay if he bends down.

6908
03:13:32,250 --> 03:13:32,600
Oh,

6909
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:33,433
it doesn't look good.

6910
03:13:33,720 --> 03:13:36,520
It doesn't look good door shit.

6911
03:13:36,820 --> 03:13:38,240
He says to go arm bar.

6912
03:13:38,430 --> 03:13:39,570
I don't know.

6913
03:13:40,620 --> 03:13:45,470
She's got the president by power.

6914
03:13:45,560 --> 03:13:46,393
White power.

6915
03:13:48,140 --> 03:13:48,973
Say Chubb.

6916
03:13:49,260 --> 03:13:54,260
You're saying the Toby is based
on all the Nazis they invented

6917
03:13:57,890 --> 03:13:58,340
guys.

6918
03:13:58,340 --> 03:13:59,690
This fucking fights crazy,

6919
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:00,311
crazy.

6920
03:14:00,311 --> 03:14:01,400
Just cartwheeled kicked him.

6921
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:02,211
It's crazy.

6922
03:14:02,211 --> 03:14:03,380
Callen like the Nazis.

6923
03:14:03,381 --> 03:14:04,790
Remember you did Joe.

6924
03:14:04,791 --> 03:14:05,700
Here's serious question.

6925
03:14:07,160 --> 03:14:07,781
Joe Sears.

6926
03:14:07,781 --> 03:14:09,240
Kellen like shoes.

6927
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:10,760
Here's the kitchen for you.

6928
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:16,300
That's a fight.

6929
03:14:16,310 --> 03:14:16,940
Politics.

6930
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:20,090
Now here's one that no one
talks about what they should.

6931
03:14:20,210 --> 03:14:23,140
Michael Bisbing pound for pound
top thinking like the ics lost.

6932
03:14:23,150 --> 03:14:23,721
Do you think guys,

6933
03:14:23,721 --> 03:14:24,410
he's beat.

6934
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:25,340
He's champ now.

6935
03:14:25,730 --> 03:14:26,960
He's one that he's dope.

6936
03:14:27,320 --> 03:14:27,531
Oh,

6937
03:14:27,531 --> 03:14:28,364
he's

6938
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:30,210
in the UFC.

6939
03:14:30,210 --> 03:14:30,921
He's great,

6940
03:14:30,921 --> 03:14:32,480
but he's also been fighting a long time,

6941
03:14:32,481 --> 03:14:35,960
but he's also lost handedly where
Anderson Silva is lost once.

6942
03:14:35,961 --> 03:14:36,530
Who's,

6943
03:14:36,530 --> 03:14:36,681
well,

6944
03:14:36,681 --> 03:14:40,760
he beat him up because he was manner.

6945
03:14:41,270 --> 03:14:42,350
He wouldn't have had a chance.

6946
03:14:42,351 --> 03:14:43,490
Who has Bisbing lost two?

6947
03:14:43,700 --> 03:14:46,910
Are you telling me that business
is more winter Anderson Silva?

6948
03:14:47,330 --> 03:14:47,840
It doesn't,

6949
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:49,570
but that that's champ right now.

6950
03:14:49,610 --> 03:14:50,443
Barometer.

6951
03:14:50,790 --> 03:14:52,220
It's not a bad barometer.

6952
03:14:52,221 --> 03:14:53,180
He's a champ right now.

6953
03:14:53,390 --> 03:14:54,560
He's got a makes a good point.

6954
03:14:55,450 --> 03:14:56,520
People deny it.

6955
03:14:56,590 --> 03:15:00,320
People deny it based on bad experiences
that he had inside the octagon,

6956
03:15:00,580 --> 03:15:03,590
but his best experience inside the
octagon was a Luke Rockhold fight,

6957
03:15:03,770 --> 03:15:04,900
which has got dance practice,

6958
03:15:04,930 --> 03:15:05,510
knocked him out,

6959
03:15:05,510 --> 03:15:06,490
knocked him out in one round.

6960
03:15:06,500 --> 03:15:11,100
He also fought Dan Henderson demolish
the first fight couch account by chance

6961
03:15:11,110 --> 03:15:11,410
on,

6962
03:15:11,410 --> 03:15:12,330
and he got beat the challenge.

6963
03:15:12,390 --> 03:15:12,820
Pete,

6964
03:15:12,820 --> 03:15:13,653
Amy Boys,

6965
03:15:13,680 --> 03:15:14,513
PDS,

6966
03:15:14,620 --> 03:15:17,660
Callan and your boys the fence.

6967
03:15:17,750 --> 03:15:20,420
He just said the most
brilliant thing ever.

6968
03:15:20,600 --> 03:15:21,070
He said,

6969
03:15:21,070 --> 03:15:23,300
who is the champ right now?

6970
03:15:23,780 --> 03:15:28,780
Can you imagine how hard it would be to
be the channel right now at one fucking

6971
03:15:29,331 --> 03:15:30,164
Eddie fight?

6972
03:15:30,170 --> 03:15:32,290
This fight is going on with all,

6973
03:15:33,230 --> 03:15:35,270
he's the fucking champ right now.

6974
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,380
Guys is fights going on.

6975
03:15:36,381 --> 03:15:37,970
It's really good and it's the last round.

6976
03:15:38,360 --> 03:15:39,193
It's good.

6977
03:15:40,410 --> 03:15:41,243
Oh

6978
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:44,480
God damn.

6979
03:15:44,570 --> 03:15:45,021
Dude.

6980
03:15:45,021 --> 03:15:45,920
Elliott's a beast.

6981
03:15:45,950 --> 03:15:46,880
Are you kidding me?

6982
03:15:46,881 --> 03:15:47,691
This is incredible.

6983
03:15:47,691 --> 03:15:49,860
This is around five son
and Elliot's on top.

6984
03:15:49,890 --> 03:15:50,723
That's crazy.

6985
03:15:50,820 --> 03:15:51,301
Mighty mouse.

6986
03:15:51,301 --> 03:15:53,830
Trying to roll to an armbar denied is that

6987
03:15:55,540 --> 03:15:59,120
it's kind of rooting for them
because you're all white powered up.

6988
03:16:00,050 --> 03:16:00,590
You know what?

6989
03:16:00,590 --> 03:16:01,920
I was hoping I was wrong.

6990
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:04,070
I only see color.

6991
03:16:04,080 --> 03:16:04,861
I don't see color.

6992
03:16:04,861 --> 03:16:06,840
I didn't even know who he's looking at.

6993
03:16:06,841 --> 03:16:07,760
He's got it took an army.

6994
03:16:07,761 --> 03:16:08,320
Is that Hitler?

6995
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,360
Shit Bro.

6996
03:16:11,250 --> 03:16:13,760
Literally so unprejudiced
I can't tell you new.

6997
03:16:14,050 --> 03:16:15,150
If you're in a red state,

6998
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:16,513
you know me.

6999
03:16:16,590 --> 03:16:19,860
I don't care if no one's
green or purple or orange.

7000
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:24,420
I fucking don't care if
they're fucking beige.

7001
03:16:24,740 --> 03:16:27,360
Beige on top or fucking or Magento.

7002
03:16:27,361 --> 03:16:27,930
Guys,

7003
03:16:27,930 --> 03:16:29,190
give us a couple minutes left.

7004
03:16:29,191 --> 03:16:30,024
I don't care.

7005
03:16:30,460 --> 03:16:31,110
Care abouts.

7006
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:31,943
Watched the fun.

7007
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:32,700
Bravo.

7008
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,570
Three minutes left.

7009
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:34,500
Let's watch this fight.

7010
03:16:35,740 --> 03:16:36,910
You just thought about that for you.

7011
03:16:36,911 --> 03:16:37,520
Give Him Malcolm,

7012
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:41,880
Demetrius Dylan eight Denise decided
control total shows on TV right now.

7013
03:16:41,881 --> 03:16:42,200
Right?

7014
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:44,070
It doesn't look like he
wants to watch Netflix.

7015
03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:48,810
Demetrius Demetrius has as
dominated has controlled his him.

7016
03:16:49,090 --> 03:16:50,220
Elliot Elliot's been,

7017
03:16:50,280 --> 03:16:51,720
I don't think it's more of a control.

7018
03:16:51,721 --> 03:16:54,240
I think it's more of like he's just
trying to be who he wants to be

7019
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:59,280
caught it and oh my God,

7020
03:16:59,610 --> 03:17:04,610
we get to find out what the amount that
turns you into a Gremlin was a matter of

7021
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:13,300
I'm being fucking Tame,

7022
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:14,353
right?

7023
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:18,540
I want you don't release
the birds released

7024
03:17:20,370 --> 03:17:20,720
once.

7025
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:21,630
This fights over.

7026
03:17:21,770 --> 03:17:22,603
I think

7027
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:24,460
to all of the,

7028
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:25,410
keep my mouth shut.

7029
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:26,460
I want to keep my mouth shut.

7030
03:17:26,610 --> 03:17:27,800
I think to all of us.

7031
03:17:27,840 --> 03:17:28,673
We don't want to go there.

7032
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:31,290
It seems like all of us
are talking over everybody.

7033
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:32,150
We need to stop.

7034
03:17:32,150 --> 03:17:33,600
Just think I got what
you're talking about.

7035
03:17:33,601 --> 03:17:34,351
Anything in the moment.

7036
03:17:34,351 --> 03:17:36,600
Let's just watch the last two
and a half minutes each price.

7037
03:17:36,680 --> 03:17:38,160
Try that two and a half speed.

7038
03:17:38,170 --> 03:17:39,360
Simple up the fuck up.

7039
03:17:40,790 --> 03:17:41,970
I'm with Joe.

7040
03:17:42,210 --> 03:17:43,080
I'm a judge.

7041
03:17:43,260 --> 03:17:47,190
You guys on some other shit once he
spouse when you should shut the fuck.

7042
03:17:48,030 --> 03:17:52,380
Got what the fuck is this
is like Duran vs Aaron.

7043
03:17:52,381 --> 03:17:53,220
Bryce Shit.

7044
03:17:54,060 --> 03:17:55,380
Look at his passing on the left.

7045
03:17:55,381 --> 03:17:57,120
Hops over mighty mouse.

7046
03:17:57,300 --> 03:17:58,500
This is some Dak,

7047
03:18:00,250 --> 03:18:02,420
she gets that knee back and play again.

7048
03:18:02,490 --> 03:18:05,930
That's how this shit going on right here.

7049
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:09,150
But fuck each other.

7050
03:18:09,390 --> 03:18:09,990
No,

7051
03:18:09,990 --> 03:18:12,210
they're trying to grapple each other.

7052
03:18:12,211 --> 03:18:14,300
It has nothing to do with uh,

7053
03:18:14,570 --> 03:18:15,403
feed production.

7054
03:18:15,850 --> 03:18:17,160
It has nothing to do with that.

7055
03:18:17,190 --> 03:18:18,960
It's going to be interesting
cause from mighty mouse,

7056
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:24,020
you know he was putting Elliot and danger
more than Elliot was putting him in

7057
03:18:24,271 --> 03:18:24,651
danger.

7058
03:18:24,651 --> 03:18:25,530
Then that one time.

7059
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:26,993
One time.

7060
03:18:27,370 --> 03:18:29,020
One time when this fight,

7061
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:31,680
that's racist.

7062
03:18:31,681 --> 03:18:32,520
Come on man,

7063
03:18:32,670 --> 03:18:33,570
that's real burst.

7064
03:18:33,571 --> 03:18:35,580
That's a reverse racist
is going forward again.

7065
03:18:36,110 --> 03:18:36,721
Eddie Bravo.

7066
03:18:36,721 --> 03:18:37,740
What's he doing wrong here?

7067
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:38,610
Right?

7068
03:18:38,610 --> 03:18:39,361
Oh Shit.

7069
03:18:39,361 --> 03:18:40,790
He's not doing anything wrong right here.

7070
03:18:40,840 --> 03:18:42,480
Look how he's got control of that risk.

7071
03:18:42,610 --> 03:18:42,970
If he,

7072
03:18:42,970 --> 03:18:43,350
if he,

7073
03:18:43,350 --> 03:18:46,020
if he just really puts all his weight
on his hand instead of the risk,

7074
03:18:46,021 --> 03:18:46,854
that's even better.

7075
03:18:46,930 --> 03:18:48,010
But he lost control.

7076
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:50,320
He tried to switch hands it looks like,

7077
03:18:50,380 --> 03:18:51,310
like in that position,

7078
03:18:51,311 --> 03:18:52,300
when you pin that hand down,

7079
03:18:52,690 --> 03:18:54,550
a lot of people like
to pin that wrist down.

7080
03:18:54,670 --> 03:18:58,090
It's better to fucking grab that hand
because when you grab that hand and you

7081
03:18:58,091 --> 03:18:58,924
pin it down,

7082
03:18:58,990 --> 03:19:00,670
they can't move that arm at all.

7083
03:19:00,671 --> 03:19:02,820
It's a like a tremendous difference.

7084
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:04,530
Although shit,

7085
03:19:04,531 --> 03:19:05,364
I can

7086
03:19:07,030 --> 03:19:07,391
look at that.

7087
03:19:07,391 --> 03:19:08,560
Elliot going towards the Camorra.

7088
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:09,630
Oh Shit.

7089
03:19:09,631 --> 03:19:10,464
Look at those.

7090
03:19:10,520 --> 03:19:12,820
She's got some serious garage.

7091
03:19:12,910 --> 03:19:13,990
Happily.

7092
03:19:14,020 --> 03:19:14,240
Dude.

7093
03:19:14,240 --> 03:19:15,530
How about defined mighty masters?

7094
03:19:15,540 --> 03:19:17,550
Ponant they had to do
the ultimate fighter.

7095
03:19:17,820 --> 03:19:18,653
He turns to her.

7096
03:19:19,510 --> 03:19:20,510
Oh,

7097
03:19:23,260 --> 03:19:23,801
look at this.

7098
03:19:23,801 --> 03:19:24,634
This incredible

7099
03:19:27,130 --> 03:19:27,963
look.

7100
03:19:28,900 --> 03:19:30,850
It's where's it gonna go?

7101
03:19:31,020 --> 03:19:32,170
It's gonna go full guard from here.

7102
03:19:32,171 --> 03:19:33,050
He's going to keep those under.

7103
03:19:33,880 --> 03:19:35,200
What is he going to do from,

7104
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:35,391
oh,

7105
03:19:35,391 --> 03:19:36,700
he's going to go to full guard for bear.

7106
03:19:36,701 --> 03:19:36,851
Look,

7107
03:19:36,851 --> 03:19:38,070
he's got the feet up on the hips,

7108
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:39,590
but he's letting another,

7109
03:19:40,330 --> 03:19:41,950
we'll see what he wants to.

7110
03:19:41,950 --> 03:19:42,411
Okay.

7111
03:19:42,411 --> 03:19:43,244
He changed everything.

7112
03:19:43,250 --> 03:19:44,080
Awesome.

7113
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:44,471
Okay,

7114
03:19:44,471 --> 03:19:45,520
so now he's got,

7115
03:19:45,640 --> 03:19:46,473
okay.

7116
03:19:46,660 --> 03:19:47,493
These points,

7117
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:49,090
there's so much gain from there.

7118
03:19:49,091 --> 03:19:49,610
I mean there's,

7119
03:19:49,610 --> 03:19:50,830
how hard are you going?

7120
03:19:51,080 --> 03:19:52,570
It's a whole different game from here.

7121
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:55,050
Energy when you know there's
only a minute left though.

7122
03:19:55,210 --> 03:19:58,450
This is all I get a few
seconds for grueling fight.

7123
03:19:59,230 --> 03:20:00,190
They got to wonder.

7124
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:03,820
This is so technical to
keeping that top half position.

7125
03:20:03,870 --> 03:20:04,703
Damn.

7126
03:20:05,230 --> 03:20:07,190
It's going to go over with him with Aa.

7127
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:12,190
Slash he would his hand if he
would've went to Maya strategy.

7128
03:20:12,191 --> 03:20:13,030
Just straight up.

7129
03:20:13,240 --> 03:20:14,260
Forget the Camorra.

7130
03:20:14,430 --> 03:20:15,580
I forgot the arm bar.

7131
03:20:15,830 --> 03:20:18,070
Let's get the top half and then get,

7132
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:20,720
get me free and then go to three winter.

7133
03:20:20,810 --> 03:20:23,230
Lose win is a win in that
fight because now fans like,

7134
03:20:23,231 --> 03:20:23,950
Holy Shit,

7135
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:24,701
this guy's legit.

7136
03:20:24,701 --> 03:20:25,810
100% agree.

7137
03:20:25,870 --> 03:20:26,660
Yeah,

7138
03:20:26,660 --> 03:20:27,100
he's a,

7139
03:20:27,100 --> 03:20:28,030
it's a win win for him.

7140
03:20:28,031 --> 03:20:30,070
You got to make a top five cheeto fingers.

7141
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:31,060
Don't lose my number.

7142
03:20:31,061 --> 03:20:31,894
That's my new thing.

7143
03:20:31,970 --> 03:20:32,580
Positive.

7144
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:32,761
Yeah,

7145
03:20:32,761 --> 03:20:33,594
me too.

7146
03:20:34,570 --> 03:20:35,770
I want to be positive too.

7147
03:20:35,771 --> 03:20:36,940
Now that's a stupid,

7148
03:20:36,941 --> 03:20:37,840
I'm a positive guy.

7149
03:20:37,850 --> 03:20:38,683
Joe.

7150
03:20:40,900 --> 03:20:41,950
Here's my number.

7151
03:20:42,230 --> 03:20:43,070
Here's my number.

7152
03:20:44,130 --> 03:20:45,490
Let's stay friends.

7153
03:20:45,491 --> 03:20:47,680
Don't lose my friends.

7154
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:48,970
Don't lose my number.

7155
03:20:48,971 --> 03:20:51,850
Let's stay friends to call me.

7156
03:20:53,060 --> 03:20:53,893
Call me.

7157
03:20:56,500 --> 03:20:57,460
I gotta be honest with you.

7158
03:20:57,461 --> 03:21:00,920
I was talking to a lot of shit in that
fight and barely paying a hundred percent

7159
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:01,350
control.

7160
03:21:01,350 --> 03:21:02,440
The control doc.

7161
03:21:03,340 --> 03:21:04,600
He was in trouble in the early rounds,

7162
03:21:04,601 --> 03:21:05,940
but he definitely controlled trotting off.

7163
03:21:06,380 --> 03:21:10,030
Well if I looked at moments where it
looked like he was getting the better of

7164
03:21:10,031 --> 03:21:10,240
it,

7165
03:21:10,240 --> 03:21:11,500
I would give him the advantage.

7166
03:21:11,530 --> 03:21:13,300
But there was definitely a few moments.

7167
03:21:13,330 --> 03:21:14,470
It was a competitive fight.

7168
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:16,363
No,

7169
03:21:16,550 --> 03:21:17,021
seriously,

7170
03:21:17,021 --> 03:21:18,600
whether he won or loss.

7171
03:21:18,620 --> 03:21:18,860
Okay.

7172
03:21:18,860 --> 03:21:19,421
Whoever,

7173
03:21:19,421 --> 03:21:20,254
whatever.

7174
03:21:20,410 --> 03:21:24,550
Was that the toughest challenge
for Demetrius Johnson so far?

7175
03:21:24,610 --> 03:21:27,640
First champion or the second or third?

7176
03:21:27,641 --> 03:21:28,600
John Uranga.

7177
03:21:28,601 --> 03:21:29,380
Kraemer two.

7178
03:21:29,380 --> 03:21:31,480
Number three was the number
one thing submitted them.

7179
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:33,190
Who was number one was this number one.

7180
03:21:33,670 --> 03:21:34,690
Number one challenge.

7181
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:35,830
Right?

7182
03:21:35,830 --> 03:21:38,110
Morocco put him in the worst dish rematch.

7183
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:39,610
Rematch on this right away.

7184
03:21:39,611 --> 03:21:41,950
That'll be a fucking nice
papers to one though.

7185
03:21:41,951 --> 03:21:42,520
In this fight.

7186
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:43,720
Ultimately he won.

7187
03:21:43,850 --> 03:21:44,591
I still won.

7188
03:21:44,591 --> 03:21:45,560
He won the round.

7189
03:21:46,370 --> 03:21:47,440
He wins.

7190
03:21:47,750 --> 03:21:52,750
But it just like rocky one
Monday at one 25 but rocky,

7191
03:21:53,061 --> 03:21:54,650
but we put on a 35.

7192
03:21:55,150 --> 03:21:56,030
There's no fights for him.

7193
03:21:56,031 --> 03:21:57,950
He needs to go up and fight.

7194
03:21:57,951 --> 03:21:58,491
Fight Cruise.

7195
03:21:58,491 --> 03:21:58,770
Cruise.

7196
03:21:58,770 --> 03:21:59,210
Yes.

7197
03:21:59,210 --> 03:22:00,170
And they fought before.

7198
03:22:01,100 --> 03:22:02,750
And one that you got to wonder,

7199
03:22:03,650 --> 03:22:04,280
you know,

7200
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:06,170
at this stage in the guy's career,

7201
03:22:06,650 --> 03:22:06,951
you know,

7202
03:22:06,951 --> 03:22:07,491
how many,

7203
03:22:07,491 --> 03:22:08,060
um,

7204
03:22:08,060 --> 03:22:10,490
how many challenges does
he have other than Elliot?

7205
03:22:12,500 --> 03:22:13,333
That'd be Xero.

7206
03:22:13,520 --> 03:22:13,671
Well,

7207
03:22:13,671 --> 03:22:16,160
he's got Benevidez now beat us beat.

7208
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:19,960
So who'd I think he was trying to see
the only be different the second time I

7209
03:22:19,961 --> 03:22:20,794
meet them again.

7210
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:21,633
I'm doing it again.

7211
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:25,100
We can't do sudo now
because Benevidez just one.

7212
03:22:25,410 --> 03:22:26,243
So you'd have to have,

7213
03:22:26,630 --> 03:22:27,463
so who does,

7214
03:22:28,690 --> 03:22:30,590
cause that was a close file if your mind,

7215
03:22:31,820 --> 03:22:31,940
oh,

7216
03:22:31,940 --> 03:22:36,020
domination with Benevidez and
so Huda pseudos in the mix.

7217
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:36,690
His rice,

7218
03:22:36,690 --> 03:22:37,523
not the top.

7219
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:38,690
He's going to improve.

7220
03:22:38,870 --> 03:22:40,100
It's two losses and I know,

7221
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:40,641
I know,

7222
03:22:40,641 --> 03:22:45,641
but I know for a fact 100% Hutto
he is improving on a daily basis.

7223
03:22:47,120 --> 03:22:49,260
Let's check this out is about it goes.

7224
03:22:49,660 --> 03:22:50,020
Yeah,

7225
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:50,853
but

7226
03:22:51,640 --> 03:22:52,270
Bravo,

7227
03:22:52,270 --> 03:22:53,240
Eddie Bravo who won.

7228
03:22:53,690 --> 03:22:56,960
I'm going to say though the
African e nine 46 right?

7229
03:22:56,961 --> 03:22:58,670
Callan mighty mouse,

7230
03:22:59,260 --> 03:22:59,810
of course.

7231
03:22:59,810 --> 03:23:02,480
100% I'm noncommittal still.

7232
03:23:02,510 --> 03:23:03,020
Of course.

7233
03:23:03,020 --> 03:23:03,321
Of course.

7234
03:23:03,321 --> 03:23:04,280
He wasn't even a question.

7235
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:04,910
Yeah,

7236
03:23:04,910 --> 03:23:05,091
no,

7237
03:23:05,091 --> 03:23:05,730
I'm not sure.

7238
03:23:05,730 --> 03:23:06,563
Price fine.

7239
03:23:06,650 --> 03:23:07,131
However,

7240
03:23:07,131 --> 03:23:10,730
I did not want to speak because I know I
wasn't paying attention to at least 30%

7241
03:23:10,731 --> 03:23:11,564
of that fight

7242
03:23:13,010 --> 03:23:13,371
he won.

7243
03:23:13,371 --> 03:23:14,204
But Elliot

7244
03:23:15,470 --> 03:23:18,320
hell of a fight and Elliot is
as tough as a human being gets.

7245
03:23:18,321 --> 03:23:20,690
I want to hear what Jon Anik asks him.

7246
03:23:21,500 --> 03:23:22,333
Was it your job?

7247
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:23,680
Look how good he cranked.

7248
03:23:23,681 --> 03:23:25,760
This was going to ask you to just listen.

7249
03:23:26,270 --> 03:23:26,600
Listen,

7250
03:23:26,600 --> 03:23:27,170
sure.

7251
03:23:27,170 --> 03:23:31,930
The that belt nods off the victory
of Johnson and I congratulate you

7252
03:23:32,350 --> 03:23:33,183

7253
03:23:33,220 --> 03:23:34,053
So good.

7254
03:23:34,760 --> 03:23:35,490
My sponsors.

7255
03:23:35,490 --> 03:23:36,330
Metro pcs.

7256
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:39,210
Harmful sponsors.

7257
03:23:39,850 --> 03:23:40,480
Yeah.

7258
03:23:40,480 --> 03:23:40,891
Get your butt.

7259
03:23:40,891 --> 03:23:41,110
Look at,

7260
03:23:41,110 --> 03:23:41,610
look out.

7261
03:23:41,610 --> 03:23:43,150
Professionalists there's no waivers.

7262
03:23:43,210 --> 03:23:44,380
There's no stutters.

7263
03:23:44,381 --> 03:23:44,840
Watch

7264
03:23:44,840 --> 03:23:45,640

7265
03:23:45,640 --> 03:23:46,730
Is that breast side down?

7266
03:23:46,820 --> 03:23:48,330
Muskrat chapter neutral.

7267
03:23:48,331 --> 03:23:49,164
I A man.

7268
03:23:49,470 --> 03:23:51,210
Well you certainly see that top position.

7269
03:23:51,211 --> 03:23:52,170
Almost 20 minutes.

7270
03:23:52,171 --> 03:23:54,030
You dominated with your
grappling over the final pool.

7271
03:23:54,060 --> 03:23:54,440
Raul.

7272
03:23:54,440 --> 03:23:55,141
Raul one though.

7273
03:23:55,141 --> 03:23:56,100
Let's go back to it.

7274
03:23:56,310 --> 03:23:57,960
Medicaid fee and how close were you

7275
03:23:58,290 --> 03:23:58,610
dude?

7276
03:23:58,610 --> 03:23:59,990
That's fucking perfect.

7277
03:24:00,340 --> 03:24:01,250
He's so good.

7278
03:24:02,050 --> 03:24:02,883
He's like,

7279
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:03,611
it's killer.

7280
03:24:03,611 --> 03:24:04,760
But does that mean
what's that got your dog.

7281
03:24:04,790 --> 03:24:05,750
So it was tough.

7282
03:24:05,751 --> 03:24:08,240
First round when you know
[inaudible] getting up siblings.

7283
03:24:08,300 --> 03:24:09,140
Get all over yourself.

7284
03:24:09,440 --> 03:24:10,760
I stayed like a champion.

7285
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:11,460
Yeah,

7286
03:24:11,460 --> 03:24:11,940
me and him.

7287
03:24:11,940 --> 03:24:14,250
Enough fucking harsh doors.

7288
03:24:14,280 --> 03:24:15,320
Any gay teen writing?

7289
03:24:16,440 --> 03:24:16,750
What?

7290
03:24:16,750 --> 03:24:17,583
A champ.

7291
03:24:17,620 --> 03:24:18,453
Ngo.

7292
03:24:18,930 --> 03:24:19,350
Shit,

7293
03:24:19,350 --> 03:24:19,641
jail.

7294
03:24:19,641 --> 03:24:20,020
Put that.

7295
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:20,853
What's next?

7296
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:22,510
What's next number coming out?

7297
03:24:22,630 --> 03:24:23,020
Good man.

7298
03:24:23,020 --> 03:24:23,240
You back.

7299
03:24:23,240 --> 03:24:23,620

You squad back at home.

7303
03:24:28,211 --> 03:24:28,571

7304
03:24:28,571 --> 03:24:29,440
take shine.

7305
03:24:29,670 --> 03:24:30,503
You guys are amazing.

7306
03:24:30,970 --> 03:24:31,803
[inaudible]

7307
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:32,791
Jon.

7308
03:24:32,791 --> 03:24:34,650
Anik is very smooth at this job.

7309
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:35,311
Yeah,

7310
03:24:35,311 --> 03:24:36,144
he's a beast.

7311
03:24:36,270 --> 03:24:36,841
He's a pro.

7312
03:24:36,841 --> 03:24:37,674
He's like

7313
03:24:41,410 --> 03:24:42,243
no big deal.

7314
03:24:42,340 --> 03:24:42,900
Back to you.

7315
03:24:42,900 --> 03:24:43,733
No deal.

7316
03:24:43,820 --> 03:24:44,160
The same

7317
03:24:44,160 --> 03:24:44,521
shit.

7318
03:24:44,521 --> 03:24:46,470
What do you guys want to
see what Tim Elliot says?

7319
03:24:46,471 --> 03:24:47,430
Listen to the crowd.

7320
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:48,533
They love him.

7321
03:24:49,420 --> 03:24:49,721
I can.

7322
03:24:49,721 --> 03:24:52,590
You know I liked John
and see what he's saying.

7323
03:24:52,650 --> 03:24:53,720
Look at this guy with the pool.

7324
03:24:53,721 --> 03:24:54,341
The fuck is that?

7325
03:24:54,341 --> 03:24:55,440
Is that this?

7326
03:24:55,590 --> 03:24:56,250
His Dad.

7327
03:24:56,250 --> 03:24:56,791
Oh Shit.

7328
03:24:56,791 --> 03:24:57,260
Oh,

7329
03:24:57,260 --> 03:24:57,920
okay.

7330
03:24:57,920 --> 03:24:59,080
I'm just trying to get back from Mexico.

7331
03:24:59,550 --> 03:25:00,231
That floats around.

7332
03:25:00,231 --> 03:25:02,420
How close do you think you
would have realized that

7333
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:06,880
even this,

7334
03:25:06,910 --> 03:25:07,350
why are you,

7335
03:25:07,350 --> 03:25:09,330
even though I was down
in the winter time or now

7336
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:12,640
Jesus Christ,

7337
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:15,160
if it's a fight to the death,

7338
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:15,990
you're 14 it's got,

7339
03:25:15,990 --> 03:25:16,661
it's ready to go.

7340
03:25:16,661 --> 03:25:17,590
He's not even tired.

7341
03:25:17,620 --> 03:25:20,110
He can go another five brown guys.

7342
03:25:20,111 --> 03:25:21,080
I think he's serious.

7343
03:25:21,340 --> 03:25:22,370
He's 100% serious.

7344
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:24,750
I was on board till you said that.

7345
03:25:24,860 --> 03:25:25,020
I'm just,

7346
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:25,853
I'm pretty sure

7347
03:25:26,500 --> 03:25:28,640
that's a very humble
way of approaching it,

7348
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:29,520
ladies and gentlemen.

7349
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:29,780
Yeah.

7350
03:25:29,780 --> 03:25:31,570
John Anik is a great fucking job man.

7351
03:25:31,590 --> 03:25:36,490
The play by play Guy John
always would do overall rush.

7352
03:25:36,520 --> 03:25:36,970
Can you have,

7353
03:25:36,970 --> 03:25:39,880
there was a competition who's going
to do a post fight interviews?

7354
03:25:40,210 --> 03:25:40,660
Uh,

7355
03:25:40,660 --> 03:25:44,290
paypal pay by play by
play guys or color guys.

7356
03:25:44,500 --> 03:25:49,380
The play by play guys would crash
the color guys when it comes to La,

7357
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:52,330
like thinking on your goddamn
fee play by play guys.

7358
03:25:52,450 --> 03:25:55,420
You need those guys because
the post fight interviews,

7359
03:25:56,290 --> 03:25:59,440
it got all fucked up because of
you because you were so good at,

7360
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:00,490
you were the color guy.

7361
03:26:00,580 --> 03:26:00,911
Ed.

7362
03:26:00,911 --> 03:26:02,350
You could do the play by play shit.

7363
03:26:02,590 --> 03:26:04,510
You were just fucking slaying dragons.

7364
03:26:04,720 --> 03:26:09,720
So other promoters thought get the color
guy to go in to the the cage and do the

7365
03:26:11,411 --> 03:26:12,244
post fire buddies.

7366
03:26:12,340 --> 03:26:15,910
And they all are terrible because that's
the hardest thing they do that post

7367
03:26:15,911 --> 03:26:16,744
fight interviews.

7368
03:26:16,750 --> 03:26:20,140
You got 30 seconds to come up with a
question that it's going to be on TV and

7369
03:26:20,150 --> 03:26:20,740
everyone,

7370
03:26:20,740 --> 03:26:22,420
it's gotta be the best question ever.

7371
03:26:22,720 --> 03:26:25,090
The play by play guys always
going to crush the color of God.

7372
03:26:25,330 --> 03:26:28,690
Those dudes are professional broadcasters.

7373
03:26:28,691 --> 03:26:30,250
Try traffic cops,

7374
03:26:30,460 --> 03:26:31,570
boom and just lay down.

7375
03:26:31,571 --> 03:26:32,110
You just,

7376
03:26:32,110 --> 03:26:32,590
you just,

7377
03:26:32,590 --> 03:26:33,371
you know what I mean?

7378
03:26:33,371 --> 03:26:34,600
Like my guy for Ebi,

7379
03:26:34,601 --> 03:26:37,510
Tj Desantis Holy Shit.

7380
03:26:37,511 --> 03:26:38,020
When I,

7381
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:38,640
I did,

7382
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:39,190
uh,

7383
03:26:39,190 --> 03:26:41,680
I was like a guest commentator
and he was a play by play guy.

7384
03:26:41,890 --> 03:26:42,900
I looked over at Tj,

7385
03:26:42,901 --> 03:26:43,590
I'm like,

7386
03:26:43,590 --> 03:26:43,870
uh,

7387
03:26:43,870 --> 03:26:46,630
you want to do fucking work for Ebi?

7388
03:26:46,631 --> 03:26:47,770
Holy Shit.

7389
03:26:48,010 --> 03:26:49,060
He was like Mike Goldberg.

7390
03:26:49,061 --> 03:26:49,451
You know what I mean?

7391
03:26:49,451 --> 03:26:51,610
She's just swaying TJ decisions.

7392
03:26:52,180 --> 03:26:53,013
Are you kidding?

7393
03:26:53,110 --> 03:26:55,480
He goes up there like a cool dude.

7394
03:26:55,710 --> 03:26:56,500
Coral Belle.

7395
03:26:56,500 --> 03:26:57,460
He's always been nice to me.

7396
03:26:57,461 --> 03:26:58,031
It just grab a,

7397
03:26:58,031 --> 03:26:59,650
Mike goes to a piece right now.

7398
03:26:59,651 --> 03:27:01,440
Let me ask you a couple of punches.

7399
03:27:01,441 --> 03:27:01,750
Guy.

7400
03:27:01,750 --> 03:27:05,110
He goes out of his way to do
pieces in front of the camera.

7401
03:27:05,260 --> 03:27:06,130
He's so confident.

7402
03:27:06,131 --> 03:27:07,310
He's like putting shit together.

7403
03:27:07,600 --> 03:27:08,590
Let's do it on a piece of what?

7404
03:27:08,591 --> 03:27:08,981
This guy,

7405
03:27:08,981 --> 03:27:10,470
he's a podcast too,

7406
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:11,021
dude,

7407
03:27:11,021 --> 03:27:11,854
are you kidding me?

7408
03:27:12,010 --> 03:27:13,990
That guy is fucking incredible.

7409
03:27:13,991 --> 03:27:15,580
Eilat shut up TJ like Tj.

7410
03:27:16,420 --> 03:27:17,770
We'll shout outs it podcast is,

7411
03:27:17,780 --> 03:27:18,541
Phil was shout outs.

7412
03:27:18,541 --> 03:27:19,740
Old wrestling coaches,

7413
03:27:20,310 --> 03:27:23,220
high school coaches from Brian.

7414
03:27:23,480 --> 03:27:25,450
