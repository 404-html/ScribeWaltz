1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,350
And when you structure your stories,

3
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:06,840
do you use a software program
to use index cards on a,

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,150
a bulletin board?

5
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:12,770
Like how do you set up where you're moving
all your pieces in your tetris game?

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,450
I used to things we do use,

7
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,284
I got a,

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,950
uh,

9
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,660
magnetic whiteboard in the office and
write on the index cards and put them all

10
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:21,261
up with that.

11
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:21,921
And sometimes,

12
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,071
you know,

13
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,150
strings between the cards,

14
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:23,781
that kind of thing.

15
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,020
That's the general getting
it all down the flow.

16
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,360
And then I use a program called scrivener,

17
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,460
which people can use for Mac or PC.

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,470
And it's basically the same thing.

19
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:36,740
It's little index cards in the
computer and there's an index card that

20
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,450
represents a document,

21
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,890
each document as a chapter.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,911
But it's great.

23
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,500
It's better than Microsoft
word because Microsoft word,

24
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,760
once you get a bit pass a hundred pages,

25
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:47,331
200 pages,

26
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:50,510
you're copping big chunks and moving
around and it becomes a nightmare cause

27
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,530
you're gonna screw something up.

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,271
But Scribner,

29
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,640
he's grabbed this icon and
drag it before this icon.

30
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,690
It rearranges everything.

31
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,310
So I've gotten pretty adept at using that.

32
00:00:58,311 --> 00:00:59,300
A highly recommend it.

33
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,910
It's great for scatterbrain
to keep everything flowing.

34
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,710
And then a lot of times it'll just be,

35
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,430
you know,

36
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,310
I get overwhelmed with the screen and
everything going on and I'll just pull out

37
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,220
the three by five index cards and
start writing everything down again,

38
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,580
bullet points and those put them up on
the board and go through it that way.

39
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,050
So you like to do it digitally,

40
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,570
you like to do it manually,

41
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:21,560
you like to just mix it up and constantly
keep doing it in a different way that

42
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:22,850
keeps your brain moving?

43
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,590
Yeah.

44
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,210
What I find is when you get stuck,

45
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,500
there's a couple of different things.

46
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:26,861
Number one,

47
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:27,900
if you just staring at that screen,

48
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,743
you're stuck.

49
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,060
Just getting your hands
involved and a pen and I,

50
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:31,221
you know,

51
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,170
like just an ink pen and paper
is a tactile experiences,

52
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,901
different experience.

53
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,150
It activates different parts of
your brain sometimes can like,

54
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,140
oh now I get it,

55
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,310
now I see what I was stuck on.

56
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,630
So that's part of it.

57
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,060
And other parts of it is either,

58
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,470
there's only so much screen real estate,

59
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,330
so you can only see so
many things at one time.

60
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,591
If you're really stuck,

61
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,190
you pull back,

62
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,461
right?

63
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,241
All these index cards,

64
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:49,841
you put it up in this,

65
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:50,260
you know,

66
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,550
four foot by five foot whiteboard and
you kind of look at everything that can

67
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,410
spring your brain free at times too.

68
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,120
So it's largely,

69
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,230
it's grabbing whatever's,

70
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,670
if I get stuck in one area,

71
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,690
I'll start going to other areas and um,

72
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,190
when I get really
overwhelmed and frustrated,

73
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,710
I am more comfortable slipping back into,

74
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:08,951
you know,

75
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:10,300
the eight year old version of me,

76
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,320
which is a little piece of paper and some
notes or an index card and go back and

77
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,090
just ride it out until it
all kind of flows out of it.

78
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,950
So as long as the process is just
continuing over and over and over again,

79
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,280
yeah,

80
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
that's a scrivener.

81
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,720
Yup.

82
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:21,901
Yeah,

83
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,540
I use that for jokes I used.

84
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,593
Yeah.

85
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,533
Yeah,

86
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,310
I use it.

87
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,160
I use a,

88
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:28,100
a couple of different things.

89
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,620
One,

90
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,350
I use a real chalkboard or
real a corkboard rather.

91
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,010
And I have index cards and I put
'em up with pins and I have bits.

92
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,110
I have a one star,

93
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:38,400
two star and three star.

94
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,230
One star is a completely new bit,

95
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,071
two stars a bit.

96
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,030
That's still improving.

97
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,140
Three stars is a bit,

98
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,880
that's pretty close to being done.

99
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,160
They always grow and change and get weird.

100
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,100
And there's always like new
directions they take on certain shows.

101
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,570
And because I mixed them up too,

102
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,400
I'll mix up the order of like the
different pieces inside the bit to try to

103
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,810
figure out which way works.

104
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,150
And I liked scrivener because could take
those cards and just move them around.

105
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,670
And sometimes when I'm just studying,

106
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,930
just thinking about my act,

107
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,760
maybe I'll listen to recordings.

108
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,820
It's one of the most
uncomfortable parts of standup.

109
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,630
But I think one of the most important,

110
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,700
you got to listen and see yourself,

111
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,520
um,

112
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,890
and,

113
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,723
and listened to like,

114
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:14,921
Ooh,

115
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,850
I don't like how I did that.

116
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,541
Like there's too much,

117
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,380
too much bullshit and that joke and
that this joke is Kinda clunky and the

118
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:24,640
wording's not good or the inflection
is too fake or what have you.

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,450
You know,

120
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:25,811
so,

121
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,380
uh,

122
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,900
that process is aided by that.

123
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,300
And one of the things that I really
love was going to ask you about is right

124
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:31,680
room ever.

125
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,500
He's right room.

126
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,600
I've used it just to
look on the phone now.

127
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,990
Right room is the one that takes your
entire screen and makes it black and gives

128
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,310
you that green tag that to you.

129
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,400
Oh does it really?

130
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,720
It's,

131
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,300
he's got a white out or
a blackout feature on,

132
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,550
I can get rid of everything on the
screen except what you're reading.

133
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,420
So kind of the same thing.

134
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:46,721
Oh,

135
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:46,961
okay,

136
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,410
cool.

137
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:47,710
Yeah.

138
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,090
Well that's a right room.

139
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,500
Doesn't give you access to anything.

140
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,760
You can't go to the tool bar.

141
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,870
You can say what time it is.

142
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,704
You don't get shit.

143
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,060
Yeah,

144
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,551
that's right.

145
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:54,761
Room.

146
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,594
That's what it looks like.

147
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,321
I really,

148
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:56,891
really like it.

149
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
It's my favorite.

150
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,580
I,

151
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,390
it's something I probably need to start
using more in scrivener because I get

152
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,300
distracted and trying to stay in touch
with social media and everything else.

153
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:06,550
And if you're on the computer
and a fan is asking a question,

154
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,280
the natural impulses to
go answer that question.

155
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,000
So,

156
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,330
you know,

157
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,950
getting to a point where I
can just ignore all that.

158
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,970
But um,

159
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,970
I was just in Vegas for the new media
expo and when I really get into it and I

160
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,300
was under deadline,

161
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
so I started writing at noon.

162
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,360
We were staying at the Rio,

163
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,310
don't have the seafood buffet at the rail.

164
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,060
I will tell you that.

165
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,893
How dare you.

166
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,733
Oh my God.

167
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,690
Oh my God.

168
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,110
I said that the top,

169
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,470
the best vomit of my whole life
and has been a lot of vomiting,

170
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,740
clams and a musket.

171
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,130
Oh,

172
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,963
I don't even know.

173
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,141
I don't know what it was,

174
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,800
but it was,

175
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,910
it was Linda Blair shit.

176
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,870
It was crazy.

177
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,890
But I'm,

178
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,340
I'm writing and it's like noon out and
like there's the window and the window is

179
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,670
open and by the time I got finished
it looked out and it was pitch black

180
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,151
outside.

181
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,500
So sometimes I can't imagine it's the
same thing when you're writing more of the

182
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,420
short form jokes and moving
around from the jokes.

183
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,790
But for this long form
things like 50 page story,

184
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,160
I had my own screen came up and I,

185
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,200
that's all I was working on.

186
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,140
I didn't look at anything else.

187
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,130
Just wrote the whole thing through.

188
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,551
Yeah,

189
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,690
you can get in those zones.

190
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,510
I don't write jokes like joke jokes.

191
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,230
What I do is I write about subjects and
I find the jokes in what I write about

192
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,190
it when he went.

193
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,890
What I find is that when
I'm writing about things,

194
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,330
it takes longer for me to write the word
history then for me to think of it or

195
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:17,164
know it exists.

196
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
If I'm thinking about
history I can think about it.

197
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,870
But I have to say his tier.

198
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,790
I mean I have to actually individually
type all the letters and in that you,

199
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,180
you have much more consideration to
every sentence that you write every,

200
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,440
every chapter,

201
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,670
every concept.

202
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,960
Cause you're,

203
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,420
you're thinking a lot
quicker than your writing.

204
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,700
So as you're writing it down,

205
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,280
you're considering deeply each indivi.

206
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,110
It's like its forces you to pause
and consider each individual word.

207
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,210
Consider the,

208
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:48,481
the,

209
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:48,760
the,

210
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,060
the concept of you're actually talking
about far more than if you were just

211
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,260
having a conversation.

212
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,610
You're having a conversation.

213
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,120
It takes more,

214
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,511
it takes,

215
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,530
it's much quicker to get the words right.

216
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,200
I think in that slowing you down,

217
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,860
it makes you consider things more and
then sometimes you'll just miss like

218
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:04,820
really obvious shit.

219
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,400
You would have missed
it if you were talking,

220
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,420
but when you're riding like,

221
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,870
oh,

222
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,220
and what about this?

223
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,580
And then you'll go off
in some other directions.

224
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,570
Like you give your brain
like a different rhythm.

225
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,920
The rhythm of writing.

226
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,940
No talking,

227
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,241
no,

228
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:17,750
no,

229
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,620
no distractions,

230
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,520
no fucking music.

231
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,570
Stop all the nonsense.

232
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,404
Locked the door,

233
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,750
hit the right room and just go.

234
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,200
Yeah.

235
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,950
Do you find,

236
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,010
do you find you have to go for a certain
amount of time before all of a sudden

237
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,060
shit starts to take off?

238
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,590
I'm useless for the first half hour.

239
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeah.

240
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,460
Yeah.

241
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,540
So let's ask some harder.

242
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,650
It was full of the word.

243
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,800
Sometimes I,

244
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,020
I don't even take credit for the things
I write because it's not me writing

245
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:39,550
them.

246
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,070
You know?

247
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,551
It's your inner,

248
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,450
your inner muse.

249
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,343
We'd wrote it.

250
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
We wrote that one.

251
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,061
No,

252
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,320
I don't know how that one in me,

253
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm like,

254
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,740
the first 30 minutes
are usually just trash,

255
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,760
absolute trash work,

256
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,670
and then at some point something just
takes over and you're making really good

257
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,060
stuff.

258
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,661
It's interesting,

259
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,021
isn't it,

260
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:58,400
that that weird switch that goes off
where you find yourself really zen in what

261
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,234
you're doing?

262
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,201
For me,

263
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,640
it is probably around the same time,

264
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,920
about 30 minutes in 2030 minutes.

265
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,850
The first 20 minutes just,

266
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,631
I don't even think,

267
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:10,631
I'm just trying to smash keys and
write things down and just thinking,

268
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,830
but just kind of getting
into it and trying to,

269
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,990
and then somewhere along
the line he catch traction.

270
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,550
My add so bad.

271
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:20,780
Now I've got a technique like I'll just
set the alarm on the phone instead of 30

272
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,070
minutes and then I'm like,

273
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:22,311
okay,

274
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm just not going to
look at anything else.

275
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,280
I can do this for 30 minutes.

276
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,040
It's just 30 minutes that bad.

277
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,211
Yeah,

278
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:27,800
it's bad.

279
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Force yourself to write for 30 minutes.

280
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,350
Doesn't matter what you write.

281
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,560
And then almost invariably by
the time the buzzer goes off,

282
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,000
you're just like turn it
off and you're just like,

283
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,361
cause you're,

284
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,350
you're rolling at that point.

285
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:39,170
But you have to force yourself to be
like a half to get into the groove.

286
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,260
My groove is usually also
to move around the house.

287
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,620
I like to pick up my laptop
and go sit somewhere else,

288
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,090
go sit in my uh,

289
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,420
you know,

290
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,290
sit in my living room,

291
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,790
go sit upstairs,

292
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,990
go sit in front of the TV.

293
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,830
You don't even watch TV.

294
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:52,670
Just sit on the couch.

295
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,121
You know?

296
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,320
I think that when I do that,

297
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,780
instead of just being in my office and
stare at the screen and sometimes just

298
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,830
being in a different space,

299
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,910
sitting in a different place to go,

300
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:00,111
oh,

301
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:05,000
we're here now and that just
that changing of your routine,

302
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,900
just a little variation on it
sometimes can spark the mind.

303
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,790
An interesting new direction you get.

304
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,210
You get down these wormholes and just
getting any other kind of sensory input,

305
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,610
which goes back to now I'm going to write
things down and said a type them out

306
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,190
or anything like that can
cause it's all in there.

307
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,900
All that stuff you want to
come up with is in there.

308
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,590
It's not like you're,

309
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:21,921
you know,

310
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,530
it's not like you have a factory
where you have to make all this crap.

311
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,550
It's all already in there.

312
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,660
You just kind of getting,

313
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,750
figuring out how to mine it out of your
own brain and put it onto the page.

314
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,820
You know what I also
find super beneficial.

315
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,773
A Walk,

316
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,500
a walk.

317
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,960
Yeah.

318
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Walk,

319
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,120
you know,

320
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,530
and uh,

321
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,090
used to bring a recorder but
now with these new cell phones,

322
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:42,020
you don't have to use your phone can
record amazing notes and I just go for a

323
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,291
walk,

324
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,610
walk my dogs or something like that,

325
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,390
go down the street.

326
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,590
And just when I'm thinking about something
and I've got something in my head and

327
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm done writing and then I'm reviewing
the things that I wrote and like how

328
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,754
would I,

329
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,560
how would I view this if I
was a person who reading it?

330
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,100
Like how would I,

331
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
how would I take this?

332
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,721
Like I'll,

333
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,060
I'll take it into
consideration as I'm walking.

334
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:00,894
It's like the fat,

335
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,171
you know,

336
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,380
there's something about forcing
yourself to do a mundane,

337
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:05,610
very obvious task,

338
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,061
left foot,

339
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:06,511
right foot,

340
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:06,901
left foot,

341
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,291
right foot,

342
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,010
and then you can get into that
groove of introspective thought.

343
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,680
Yeah.

344
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:10,841
Yeah.

345
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,461
And it does,

346
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,360
some of that to me is like,

347
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:12,630
I've,

348
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,950
I've got this little tiny office,

349
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,850
but there's like a loop.

350
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,960
There's like four rooms and you actually
go from kitchen to this room to the

351
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,490
entryway to the writing room.

352
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,324
And I just,

353
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,460
I just start doing labs.

354
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,460
And it usually doesn't take very long
because you're turning right all the time,

355
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,631
every two steps.

356
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:27,961
And it's,

357
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,960
there's something about your brain has
to put some level of attention on it,

358
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,130
not walking into things.

359
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,430
And that usually comes from
the part that's blocking you.

360
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,360
The part that stopped me.

361
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:37,650
Like you're convincing yourself,

362
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,390
you can't get this shit out and now.

363
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,720
Okay.

364
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,901
Oh,

365
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:40,141
all right.

366
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,600
Boom that run back to the desk and
start writing similar things down really

367
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:42,930
quick.

368
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,230
Have you ever tried using speech
recognition software for writing

369
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,390
wouldn't work for me only because I'm,

370
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,270
by the time I block a sentence down,

371
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,250
it's probably already be written.

372
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,490
Been rewritten three times.

373
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,301
Start a sentence,

374
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:54,631
go back,

375
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,081
start sentence,

376
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:55,471
go back.

377
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,020
And unfortunately a pretty fast typer.

378
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,490
I learned that a long time ago is
I knew I wanted to write and yeah,

379
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,271
I just changed things.

380
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:03,841
Sell fast.

381
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:04,920
Like it's all muscle memory now.

382
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,581
It's like copy this,

383
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:05,971
paste this,

384
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,804
move this around.

385
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,390
I,

386
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,750
I cannot imagine speech
recognition would ever work for me.

387
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,000
The um,

388
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,460
uh,

389
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,220
Mavis Bacon teaches typing.

390
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:14,054
That's the one I owe.

391
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,760
I owe that Mavis Bacon.

392
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,643
She looked me up.

393
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:17,721
Yeah,

394
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,160
that was a for me man.

395
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,780
I was the poker guy.

396
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,420
Yeah.

397
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,150
This looking right at them.

398
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,410
It took a long time.

399
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:25,191
Genius product.

400
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:25,370
Like,

401
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:25,551
no,

402
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,620
just play video games pitch and like what?

403
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,540
I'm just playing video games
and all of a sudden I can type.

404
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,301
It was amazing.

405
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,470
It's amazing and it's their fun games
like you're racing and share what you're

406
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:33,621
doing.

407
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:36,650
All kinds of different stuff and
figuring out where the little keys are.

408
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,520
That's,

409
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,420
that's so important,

410
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:38,960
man.

411
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,660
I used to have one of
those goofy keyboards.

412
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,210
It was like separated split ones.

413
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,490
Yeah,

414
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,310
and your hands rest on it
and ship those tied off.

415
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,740
What happened is supposed to be working on

416
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,220
work for crap.

417
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,180
They're supposed to be good for you.

418
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,100
I had the one that actually
was like a transformer.

419
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,850
It actually had a hinge
when this thing was bad ass.

420
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,480
Did you ever get the
one where you sink in?

421
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,890
You sink your fingers in.

422
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,370
There was a weird one like this or
your fingers like sit in a cradle.

423
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,390
I still have to look

424
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,260
like every now and then I'm still
glancing down to get some kind of tracking

425
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,094
going on,

426
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,390
which I don't need to do any more,

427
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,400
but I can't break myself
of the habit like I can.

428
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,593
I can.

429
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,351
I do this.

430
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:16,540
Sometimes when I'm
overwhelmed with an idea,

431
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,980
I'll just close my eyes and just start
typing so I don't need to do it anymore,

432
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,800
but I'm still,

433
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,780
I can't break that habit of
looking down at the screen.

434
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,141
That's the thing.

435
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,441
Look at that.

436
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:24,790
Yeah.

437
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,011
Yeah.

438
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,000
I had one of those.

439
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,690
Yeah,

440
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,620
there was those and then there was the
Microsoft ones are a little bit more

441
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,410
curly and they had like an
actual space in between.

442
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:34,244
It didn't separate.

443
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,851
They're just,

444
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:35,900
it's more like lumpy.

445
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:39,680
They called them ergonomic
keyboards things anymore.

446
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:40,490
I don't think,

447
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,230
I don't know.

448
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,200
You know what the problem is?

449
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,280
You get used to those,

450
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,640
then you go to a laptop and it's,

451
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,474
it feels weird,

452
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,980
you know a lot of people are
typing their stuff on laptops now,

453
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,190
so like the way you learn how to type
on a laptop is you want your to be right

454
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,850
in that position of j and f the fingers
across the board and then from there you

455
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,600
go.

456
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,480
If you go back and forth
from laptop to keyboard,

457
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,310
this is like a thinking part where you
have to like a quarterback changing.

458
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,951
You're throwing lotion,

459
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,540
it's to change everything around.

460
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:07,811
Yeah.

461
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,644
It fucks with you.

462
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,190
Yeah.

463
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,910
But the speech recognition software is
fascinating to me because I wonder if

464
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:15,480
that I'll ever be something
that I'm interested in because,

465
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,343
uh,

466
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,331
for the walks,

467
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,410
I have to imagine,

468
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,491
you know,

469
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:19,701
right.

470
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:20,181
You're walking,

471
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:21,590
you still speak everything down.

472
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,041
No,

473
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,940
I just record it.

474
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,270
Right.

475
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,991
And Go back and listen to,

476
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:24,111
yeah.

477
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,190
I go back and listen to it.

478
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I really find that there's a
completely different state of mind,

479
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,410
the actual writing state of mind,

480
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:35,411
and I find that I'm way more creative
when I could just sit in total silence,

481
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,240
not hear my voice or
anybody's voice and for right.

482
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,841
I allow,

483
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,050
allow my brain to go in all sorts of
weird directions when they're not,

484
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,940
it's not attached to flowing,

485
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:44,900
moving language.

486
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:49,100
Ideas can serve a merge instantaneously
and I just try to follow them and

487
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,240
capture them in writing.

488
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,261
I think a,

489
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,240
I limit myself when I'm actually talking.

490
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,170
Hmm.

491
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,980
Yeah.

492
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,280
You know,

493
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,420
it comes to writing things.

494
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,910
Yeah.

495
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,350
It,

496
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,490
it's for me,

497
00:12:58,491 --> 00:12:59,810
but at this point it's just down to,

498
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,790
it's a process.

499
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,340
Now I've got the process going and
getting more and more comfort with the

500
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:04,761
process.

501
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,680
So hopefully I'm growing towards that.

502
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:06,980
You know,

503
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,810
Stephen King's process is just so fast
that your process is also very creative.

504
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:12,021
I mean,

505
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,340
you have to have this idea,

506
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,850
you have to have the story of to create
this story after that part's never

507
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,171
people.

508
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,400
Some people talking about writer's block,

509
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,360
I've never had that.

510
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,200
I've had the opposite,

511
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,770
which is just this on slot of cool ideas.

512
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,290
Like this would be a good book and this
be a good book and trying to try and

513
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,280
keep track of everything.

514
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,081
So the,

515
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,050
the creative part,

516
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,740
um,

517
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,573
being scatterbrained,

518
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,340
middle kid fortunately just
has never been an issue for me.

519
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:34,911
It's all it with me.

520
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:39,320
It's always been the discipline of being
able to write it down and trying to

521
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:41,150
fight the add and you know,

522
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,800
and like I have to keep working on
this to make it the best it can be.

523
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,180
When after the first draft,

524
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:48,260
I'm kind of already done with it.

525
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,590
I'm like,

526
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:48,741
ah,

527
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:49,030
I want to,

528
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,910
I want to go do something else.

529
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:50,331
But you can't,

530
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,130
you gotta go back and keep
hammering on that sword,

531
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,520
make it,

532
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,353
make it a good weapon.

533
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,291
Yeah,

534
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:54,621
that's,

535
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:58,980
that's really interesting that it's
the different types of creative

536
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,530
processes that all try to
achieve the same thing,

537
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,600
whether it's a song or
a movie or a book or,

538
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,673
or a joke.

539
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,540
It's this completely fascinating to me.

540
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,670
The different ways that people
approach it and different,

541
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,180
the different mindsets they
have in approaching it too.

542
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:12,780
Do

543
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,280
you know that there's,

544
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,530
there's no one pattern,

545
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,420
which is what's fascinating
about the human brain.

546
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,900
Everybody's got a different way of doing
it and just keep working at it till you

547
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:25,890
get to that end product and where you
can hopefully look at what you finished

548
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:28,770
with and I think all creative
people kind of have the same thing.

549
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,491
You probably have it too,

550
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,050
like that's a pretty good joke.

551
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,790
That's not the best it could possibly be,

552
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,900
but I think that's pretty good.

553
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,780
That's going to go in the arsenal
for the next stand up and with me,

554
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,550
it's like that book is pretty good.

555
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,410
I would work on that book
for the next 10 years.

556
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,450
Every day to try and
make everything perfect.

557
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,580
But you know,

558
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,131
at least for me,

559
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:44,361
there,

560
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,260
there is no perfection like,

561
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,190
and you hear some others go,

562
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,110
I keep working on until
I've absolutely the perfect,

563
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
the perfect phrase and a
perfect sentence in a perfect,

564
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,153
in the perfect page,

565
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,000
that's great.

566
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,720
But you know,

567
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,380
we got to put a book out and sell some
books so I can't work on a book for 10

568
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:58,214
years.

569
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:07,790
Okay.
