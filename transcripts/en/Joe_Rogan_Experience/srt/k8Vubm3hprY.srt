1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,900
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,590
You know what is true,

3
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:04,801
right.

4
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,380
You could guess based on their,

5
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,920
their past and the precedents.

6
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,754
Yeah,

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,890
man.

8
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,723
Yeah.

9
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,810
It's very fluid.

10
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,770
Yeah.

11
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,500
Geez Tom.

12
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,111
She's doing all right.

13
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:17,010
I mean freaking us out by train.

14
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:17,820
That's so quick.

15
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,780
I drink a lot of water.

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,210
Sorry.

17
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:19,471
No,

18
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,131
no you don't.

19
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,510
That's the first time you've cracked it.

20
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:21,831
Open.

21
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,350
What?

22
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:22,890
Jesus.

23
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,310
Yeah.

24
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,143
You guys fighting?

25
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,490
I hydrate a lot more than he does.

26
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,230
Oh,

27
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,063
is this an issue?

28
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,670
But it's not close.

29
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
You hydrate more than of course not.

30
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,080
I've been hydrating this whole time.

31
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,973
Interesting.

32
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,181
But,

33
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,270
but he has that drink too.

34
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,313
That's

35
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,653
smaller.

36
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,701
Smaller being,

37
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,750
I weigh like a fraction of what
he was very tiny and petite.

38
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,481
Oh Geez.

39
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,500
Look at my uh,

40
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,090
moniker on dad mouth.

41
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,260
But look at water.

42
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,030
The water champion.

43
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,870
Is that what you tell people?

44
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,913
Yeah,

45
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm clearly the water champion.

46
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,140
We've decided this.

47
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,330
I got to do a,

48
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,860
I got to do a full new
show a lot of times,

49
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,011
you know,

50
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,700
they go,

51
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,780
you're doing like eight minutes.

52
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
I did the entire Brock.

53
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,360
I did the weather and everything.

54
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:09,991
All his Dj,

55
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,824
dad mouth.

56
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,130
What city was this in?

57
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,490
Demoine really happy were there.

58
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,950
They were just,

59
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,783
Oh my God,

60
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,030
what are you doing in De Moines?

61
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,600
I was,

62
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,260
I was there.

63
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,130
I did two nights.

64
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,000
Just had the funny bone.

65
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,193
Is it fun?

66
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,560
Yeah,

67
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,393
I had a really good time.

68
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,300
A really good time.

69
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,480
Did you come up with this Dj
dad mouth thing just like it?

70
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:31,740
Was it a specific like like a
plan or did you do it for fun?

71
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,753
For Fun?

72
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,511
Totally for fun.

73
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,050
Just to shoot one day
and then we just did.

74
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,860
What happened was tell Joe the whole
story when I was eight months pregnant and

75
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,490
he's like,

76
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm going to buy like a
ton of deejaying equipment.

77
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,131
I'm like,

78
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,610
wait,

79
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,480
what are you doing?

80
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,051
He's like,

81
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,970
I'm by like $10,000 worth
of Shit in her house.

82
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,380
And I was like,

83
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,720
all right,

84
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,290
this is your,

85
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,650
I clearly knew this was his
last Hurrah as a free person.

86
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,660
So I try not to give him too much static
and then sure enough all his DJ stuff

87
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,231
shows up,

88
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,660
not 10 grand.

89
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,661
And you've got decks and fucking lights
and lasers and the real Russell Peters,

90
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,113
he's got a lot,

91
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,800
well he's a real Dj.

92
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,550
He does.

93
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,340
He goes to clubs.

94
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,820
Yeah,

95
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,653
he can do it.

96
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,110
He doesn't make it a face.

97
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,390
She was making a face because I was
like I'll get good enough at this to do

98
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,330
after parties after my shows.

99
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,350
I was half serious cause I was like,

100
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:28,950
you know what,

101
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,580
cause I,

102
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,910
you know,

103
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,420
I've,

104
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,290
I love hip hop.

105
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,180
I've always grown up and
I've always wanted to do it.

106
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,440
So I got the,

107
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:34,860
I got like,

108
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,200
you know,

109
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,521
introduced.

110
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,670
I'm not 10,000,

111
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,670
not even 5,000,

112
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
like not even close to that.

113
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,690
I just bought turntables and got um,

114
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,640
for jackets.

115
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,441
Gold chains.

116
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:43,831
No,

117
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,311
but come on,

118
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,570
that shit was just silly to get,

119
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:45,890
you know,

120
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,920
you were a DJ today and you
were trying to spin turntables.

121
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,660
Don't you think people would be asking
to take selfies in the middle of it and

122
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:55,130
it would fuck up your
flow if I was deejaying.

123
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:57,630
And if you were like doing an after party
and people have tried to take selfies

124
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,464
with you,

125
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,960
you just take a selfie.

126
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,140
It'd be I'd be up there,

127
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,330
but on my Facebook,

128
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,080
yeah,

129
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,913
you're probably right.

130
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,370
Yeah,

131
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,791
for sure.

132
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,624
They would.

133
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,623
Yeah.

134
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,661
I have to be honest,

135
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,570
who really gave me the
idea idea where I was like,

136
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,931
oh,

137
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,990
like this is actually
possible was Hannibal,

138
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,410
because I was in Cleveland earlier this
year and I saw him tweet that he was in

139
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,830
Cleveland doing a pop up show.

140
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,401
Right.

141
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,950
He just tweeted out and
doing like a whatever,

142
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,540
like a rock club pop up show,

143
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,950
no advanced notice.

144
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,240
So I texted him,

145
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,140
I was like,

146
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm over at Hilarides that
great club in Cleveland.

147
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,760
Uh,

148
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,571
when is your show?

149
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,010
And he said like nine
and go minds at eight.

150
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,970
You want to do a guest spot?

151
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:40,781
And he goes,

152
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,440
yeah.

153
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,620
So then afterwards he had
an after party at the,

154
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,310
uh,

155
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,581
and I,

156
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,190
and that's me basically
geeking out on the decks.

157
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,710
Yeah.

158
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,140
So,

159
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,250
and then Tony Trim,

160
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,851
which is,

161
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:52,090
uh,

162
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,460
the Dj that travels with him was like,

163
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:54,611
oh,

164
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,220
did you can just get this and like
you can just buy this stuff and,

165
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,560
and,

166
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,260
and that's what really got me to do it.

167
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,190
Throw one up.

168
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,870
Let's look at that white guy dance.

169
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,704
Move

170
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,031
that move.

171
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:07,864
You're doing there.

172
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,040
You're doing this.

173
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,400
Yeah.

174
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,620
Yeah,

175
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,453
that's true.

176
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,410
That's what really geeked me out.

177
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,273
Was that

178
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,351
the name?

179
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,880
Dj Dad math came because he was becoming
a father at the time and I was like,

180
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,190
you're like wait lane Browley or me a dad.

181
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,900
And then it kind of morphed into Dj Dan.

182
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,700
That's true.

183
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,241
All that's true.

184
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:33,241
But taking it onto morning news was like
a one time ago that was like so funny.

185
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,810
I was like all the time,

186
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,560
you know?

187
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,290
So when you went on as a onetime goof,

188
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,760
did you have a plan or
did you just not really,

189
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,603
I was just like,

190
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,060
the fun thing was to go was because I,

191
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,310
the thing that I hate
the most when you do,

192
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,711
they're like,

193
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,330
what can audiences expect this weekend?

194
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,321
They always say that,

195
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:50,470
oh,

196
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,070
I hate that.

197
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,540
And I'm like,

198
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,910
oh,

199
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,410
fucking show jokes.

200
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,333
Um,

201
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,390
what are you talk about?

202
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,553
Yeah.

203
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,010
What's,

204
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,150
what's bothering you right now,

205
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:58,630
Tom?

206
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,020
Yeah,

207
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,711
that's the setup.

208
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:02,200
Tell what's going on in your life and
they think just your there and then they

209
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:02,351
go,

210
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,184
just do whatever you want.

211
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Like,

212
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,450
just have fun with it.

213
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,860
So when they do that,

214
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,694
I was just like,

215
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,571
it's not really,

216
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,040
I don't really give a fuck about comedy.

217
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,143
And then they were like,

218
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,193
what?

219
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,561
I'm like,

220
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,640
it's about the after party,

221
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,090
you know,

222
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,090
I'm gonna be DJ here just to goof on them
because it was fun to have around and

223
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,480
be like,

224
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,313
all right,

225
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,400
you are at the funny bone,

226
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:21,700
right?

227
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:21,941
I'm like,

228
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,181
I mean,

229
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,014
for a minute

230
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,750
Mike,

231
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,710
I don't really care about it.

232
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,553
Funny Bone.

233
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,190
And then you have the funny bone
sitting right there off camera like

234
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,190
carrots.

235
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,190
Like the best part is when he sets up
like the really cheesy anchors to ask him

236
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,100
stupid questions like,

237
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,461
did you,

238
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:39,581
oh,

239
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,290
you had someone do the bird is fat thing.

240
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,490
That was the best one.

241
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,910
Because you know,

242
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,690
if you ever add,

243
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,890
sometimes when you go,

244
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,551
hey,

245
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,180
um,

246
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,750
you know,

247
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,580
ask me about farts or something,

248
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,450
they'll be like,

249
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,120
eh.

250
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,650
So they,

251
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,910
they know not to,

252
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,140
they check themselves on asking something
provocative or that's not a hundred

253
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:57,974
percent PG.

254
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,960
So I didn't know how it would go,

255
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,500
but I go,

256
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,890
oh,

257
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,561
ask me my bird.

258
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,900
So fat and the lady goes,

259
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
okay.

260
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,730
And then,

261
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,730
so we just are in the
middle of this interview

262
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,521
and she goes,

263
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,040
White Bird,

264
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,590
so fat.

265
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,830
And I was asking a good question.

266
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,131
I'm like,

267
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,420
I just rolled with it,

268
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:14,870
you know,

269
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,920
and then it grew.

270
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,780
And then a hot dog eating champion,

271
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,980
a guy that was in thing,

272
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,500
Scott Shalon she placed to any place.

273
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,131
Yeah,

274
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,964
he's like one of the,

275
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,340
he was like a super competitive eater.

276
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,390
Like a Kobiashi dude.

277
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

278
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,700
This guy.

279
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:27,851
Oh,

280
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:30,770
this guy who assigned you
play the audio on this.

281
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,260
That's incredible.

282
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,600
Life changing stuff.

283
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,890
Um,

284
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,920
I've dropped about a hundred
pounds in eight months off.

285
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,040
He dropped her hundred pounds.

286
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,100
My cheat day for the here,

287
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,950
but wow.

288
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,260
Prepping just this amazing water and
I have two giant inspirations first,

289
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,094
my wife.

290
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,810
All right.

291
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,740
Second anniversary today.

292
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,260
I want to say hi to her and um,

293
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,830
there's a comedian I love,

294
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,930
he's a big giant fat guy just like me,

295
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:58,250
Bert Chrysler Tom.

296
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,290
He's still way bigger than I am.

297
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,600
Maybe I can inspire him.

298
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,673
There you go.

299
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,480
Now for people who are wise is funny.

300
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,380
This is why it's funny,

301
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,480
Tom and Burt had been doing this thing
for a fucking year now where Tom will

302
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,930
write out the Hashtag burn is
fat and then Bert were right.

303
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,760
Tom Is fat and then they'll argue,

304
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,230
they make videos with their shirts off,

305
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,550
arguing who's fatter.

306
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,210
Yeah.

307
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,631
It was fun.

308
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,111
It's actually,

309
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,944
you know,

310
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,120
it's died down a lot,

311
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,430
but like the fact that that guy did,

312
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,950
he did it on his own to
put a picture of you up.

313
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,400
Yeah,

314
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,731
I see.

315
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,830
Hashtag burn as fast as I talk about you.

316
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,990
If I tweet about you hashtag burns fat.

317
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Oh yeah.

318
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,830
I really took off mean that we didn't
like we talked about on your mom's house,

319
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:41,110
but we never thought we do
all kinds of silly stuff,

320
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,570
but this one really
resonated with the audience.

321
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,310
Why did that one really resonates?

322
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,180
Um,

323
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,350
uh,

324
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,900
you know what?

325
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,350
There was,

326
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,290
there was great theories about this and I,

327
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,260
and I think it was this,

328
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,740
I think Matt full Trump pointed
out to me the full charge said,

329
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,370
um,

330
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,480
you gave him the formula,

331
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,180
you gave audiences a joke formula.

332
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,470
Here's a person,

333
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,000
it's a fat joke.

334
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,870
Go,

335
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,470
go ahead.

336
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,251
And I think that was what,

337
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,240
what was fun for people
was to say like something,

338
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,300
just to jump in on something that it's
all like the formula is there and you can

339
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,560
just to pick a side.

340
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,370
Yes.

341
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,870
That's the competitive nature of it.

342
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,723
Yeah.

343
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,020
Yeah.

344
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,240
And they know that you guys
really are good friends.

345
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,050
Some did,

346
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,980
some did not.

347
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,940
I would say most,

348
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:22,774
most people did.

349
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,620
Most people did.

350
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
Some people get mad.

351
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,301
Oh yeah.

352
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:29,620
So people were like really fucking
really harsh and really like,

353
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:30,130
fuck,

354
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,930
I've always fucking hated
Barry's a piece of shit.

355
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,321
Like you're like,

356
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:33,071
Whoa,

357
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,060
like shit like that.

358
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,500
But it wasn't the majority.

359
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,060
Some people were like that though.

360
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,690
Yeah.

361
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,441
Same thing to me.

362
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:38,840
Some people,

363
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,673
some people were like,

364
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,790
you know,

365
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,610
it's one of my theories
about this Trump thing.

366
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,150
I think people just pick off.

367
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,253
Okay,

368
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:55,430
okay.
