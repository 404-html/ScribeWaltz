It's you beat off into it.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,710
Brendan Walsh is scared of it.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,723
I offered it.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,363
Think about it.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,280
It was like,

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,113
oh man.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,091
Well,

13
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,880
I might not be within my best
interest to introduce to my life.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,651
Yeah.

15
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:34,011
You know,

16
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,240
I don't need to get any more in the like
fucking jerk and off than I am already.

17
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:38,511
Like,

18
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,080
it's like,

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,790
it's a fucking waste of time.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,870
You know what's funny too?

21
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:46,280
I had a dream last night that like I had
a dream about like I was going to get a

22
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,560
fleshlight like I had
decided I was ready to do it.

23
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,130
Yeah.

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,110
And you just called me today about this,

25
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,490
that you're going to buy it.

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,421
Well,

27
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,570
it was like I want it to fuck a rubber
pussy and I dream like it was just a

28
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:01,571
weird dream and like just specifically
this dream about a sex toy.

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,481
Yeah.

30
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,710
I mean it wasn't about like,

31
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:06,951
yeah,

32
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:11,000
my friend was in it and he had like
this fucking thing like that was like

33
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:11,930
sucking his dick.

34
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:13,490
That looked pretty complicated.

35
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,071
I don't know man.

36
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:16,910
It's a weird dream.

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,140
It was pretty complicated.

38
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,310
Like a mechanical thing?

39
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,031
Yeah,

40
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:20,930
like it was a two part.

41
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:24,950
Like it had like a almost
like a little gas tank,

42
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,260
you know like that you would
use for like helium balloons.

43
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,810
Like it was a fucking weird contract.

44
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,510
Did you eat before you went to
bed before you had this dream?

45
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,370
I Hate Pink Berry last night.

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,280
Was that you think that was a,

47
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,950
I don't know who would really give you
a weird dream did you put on there?

48
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,270
I put Mochi.

49
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:45,770
I mean I usually don't eat late at night
and I never like last time I pink was

50
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,170
probably like four months ago,

51
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,250
maybe more.

52
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,060
We know that certain

53
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,290
compounds in food definitely affect like
Melatonin definitely affects the way

54
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,124
you dream,

55
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,641
you know,

56
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,474
and yeah.

57
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,360
A lot of people say these Alpha brain
pills and we've been saying they

58
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,400
definitely affected.

59
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,550
We've just been hearing about that.

60
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,870
Took tressel told him,

61
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,501
I'll give you a bottle.

62
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:04,334
Tell me what you're thinking.

63
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,630
They suck.

64
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,463
Please tell me.

65
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,430
No I don't.

66
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,540
I don't want to believe
it's just a placebo effect.

67
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,701
I don't want to believe it.

68
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,450
Just we'll see about that
because of the dreams,

69
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:18,110
the dreams that the number one reason
why I'm pretty convinced it's not a

70
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,770
placebo effect is because I
have these fucking weird dreams,

71
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:22,280
man.

72
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
They're like super potent dreams where a
lot of times during them I'm aware that

73
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:28,364
I'm in a dream,

74
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,830
but the dream is so strong.

75
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,360
There's like no getting that on it.

76
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,500
It's like I'm always like,

77
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:33,621
well,

78
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,460
this is a dream,

79
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:34,880
right?

80
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,200
Yup.

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,991
This is just a dream.

82
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:36,824
Let's keep going.

83
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,140
Do you have ever have
a lucid dream before?

84
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,410
I like this now.

85
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,450
I never had any,

86
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,280
like I've,

87
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,150
I've had moments,

88
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,910
but I've always in the middle of
the moment freaked out and realize,

89
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:47,721
oh my God,

90
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:48,650
I am flying.

91
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,050
I'm controlling my fly.

92
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:50,990
This amazing.

93
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,681
Yeah.

94
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:54,950
But it felt so fucking real
right before I woke up,

95
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,660
but I was only able to hold onto it.

96
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,150
Slippery for a few seconds.

97
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,860
Hmm.

98
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,360
Now since taking these fucking pills,

99
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,660
I hold onto it for like a half an
hour sometimes and you do crazy shit.

100
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,620
Oh my God

101
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:07,801
talk.

102
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:11,500
Is that like the guy who like when
you're playing grand theft auto,

103
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,500
when you get the baseball bat and just
walk around and beat the shit out of

104
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:14,831
people,

105
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,790
you don't even play the game.

106
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,060
Mine was super bizarre
and I've told the story.

107
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,650
So in the interest of brevity,

108
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,580
it was a werewolf and a
gorilla were 69 in each other.

109
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,414
And my dream,

110
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
it was a big,

111
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,130
big fucking Brown Werewolf and a big
gray gorilla and there were 69 each other

112
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:37,521
and I was trying to walk really quietly
because I didn't want them to wake up

113
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,450
and I didn't want him to come after it.

114
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,130
It was so vivid.

115
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,850
It was the most ridiculous
fucking vivid dream I've ever had.

116
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,700
I can remember the texture on the wall.

117
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,240
I could remember what the table looked
like where there was 69 and each other,

118
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,530
I think worst turbo itching at the
worst Joe Rogan during the other day.

119
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:57,230
And I was in it.

120
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,670
Yeah,

121
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,670
it was all about you.

122
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,530
And it was gang raped by a mummy.

123
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:00,951
No,

124
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,101
it was,

125
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:01,934
it was worse.

126
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,570
I did Alpha brain and,

127
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:07,160
and it was very creepy and I like almost
don't even want to say it cause it was,

128
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,740
but I woke up and I told
my girlfriend gay shit,

129
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,131
son,

130
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,570
I woke up and they will go time
to devote to my European cues.

131
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,380
Sometimes it's best to
keep you seeking support.

132
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,791
Yeah,

133
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,221
it does.

134
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:16,750
That mean.

135
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,061
All right.

136
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:19,620
So what happened is he
had a fighter on you.

137
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,630
We're doing a podcast and we had to get
a fighter on and then he like leaned

138
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,620
over and kissed you.

139
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,180
And I'm like,

140
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,380
well,

141
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,420
did that just happen?

142
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:26,961
And I'm like,

143
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:27,171
Joe,

144
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,280
the camera's on right now.

145
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:28,760
And he goes,

146
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,180
oh,

147
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,510
well,

148
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,320
I guess,

149
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,890
I guess there's nothing to say
then or something like that.

150
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,520
You've like really intense and then
the whole installs between them.

151
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,590
Then it was like a mitre too.

152
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,390
I think it was like GSP or something.

153
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,890
So weird.

154
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,221
Yeah.

155
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:45,200
You've got a very weird
way or looking at men.

156
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,034
Brian.

157
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,470
I was creeped out by it.

158
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,941
Yeah,

159
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:50,774
me too.

160
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,310
I'm creeped out by the fact that you
fucking thought that fucking Weirdo.

161
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,190
And then it was like
the whole camera thing.

162
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:02,870
It was like you got really mad after the
show about the camera being on and read

163
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,100
it.

164
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,680
Bring you ruined me.

165
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm kissing dude's and I'm worried
about you taking pictures of me.

166
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,800
