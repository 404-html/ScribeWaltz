1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,610
Boom,
and we're live back from Hawaii right

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,310
before it fucking blows up and sinks
into the ocean.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,390
Just in time.
Woo.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,160
We barely made it when we were flying
above the big island as we were flying

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,420
above.
What's a matter?

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,140
Okay.
As we were flying above the big island,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,770
a 6.9 earthquake blew up.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,300
That's not good.
No.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,440
Shane Dorian fucking lives there.
We looked out the window and saw the

10
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,190
island like explode in sync.
I remember that Ad.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,030
That was so sad,
but at least,

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,040
I mean we had a good hunt.
People were surfing though.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,070
They caught those waves.
If you're worried about a tsunami,

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,950
it's not going to sink,
but it's going to get bigger.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,060
That's what it is.
I mean,

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,340
the whole thing is a fucking volcano.
People are shocked.

17
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,360
Weight.
The volcanoes.

18
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,340
Volcano.
Yeah.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,170
Yeah.
You live on a Goddamn volcano.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,273
Oh crap.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,380
I wish it would have been out of fly
over it though.

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,770
Yeah.
I was looking at the like the map of

23
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,850
what?
The way we fly.

24
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,280
We fly so we can't see it the entire
way.

25
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,010
Yeah.
Which is bullshit because it was cloudy.

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,040
Which is also bullshit.
That would have been cool.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,010
I even asked the guy like,
which way do we go?

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,650
Yeah,
that would be fucking awesome if we flew

29
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,840
over that thing.
Yeah.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
Ooh,
fuck.

31
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,800
Living on a volcano though,
man.

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,330
Good place to visit though is beautiful.
Oh,

33
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,420
stunning.
Yeah.

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,360
Great.
And where we were,

35
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:25,620
we were on Lanai and alumni is an
interesting place.

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,160
3000 people,
20,000 deer,

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,020
right?
And,

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,710
and so you do the math,
you think,

39
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,450
hey,
this is going to be gravy.

40
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,310
There is way more deer than people.
But God it was,

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,930
it's tough.
It's tough hunting.

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,273
Hunting for sure.

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,760
Well this is one of the best examples,
um,

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,760
of if you want to make an argument for
hunting like this in certain situations,

45
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:54,270
this is probably the best example.
You must control the population in these

46
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,590
animals.
They don't have any predators.

47
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:59,070
And they evolved around tigers.
They come from India.

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,480
So these axis deer,
they were a gift from a Hong Kong to

49
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,460
King Kamehameha the fifth.
I saw your history lesson in 1860 and I

50
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,750
was getting it all into it today because
I want to make my post about it as

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,690
awesome.
Um,

52
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,410
so they,
what did,

53
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,080
how,
what is the number that they shoot?

54
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,210
How many did they shoot a week?
Just to,

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,650
just to people and control.
The population said 1500 but not a week

56
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,280
was it?
No,

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
I think it was 30 a day.
Oh,

58
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,000
okay.
And they were saying the shoot 30 a day,

59
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,340
right,
because they have to go at night.

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,220
Yup.
What's night night vision scopes and

61
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,360
shoot dose.
Yeah.

62
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,010
Just to take them out,
just to take them out.

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,770
Does that so many deer when we were
there at night,

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,880
um,
we got,

65
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,460
first of all we got,
I got super lucky.

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,331
Thanks to you.
You,

67
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,790
you let me take that deer.
Well,

68
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,330
when white one,
we landed,

69
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,940
we went to Scout,
we got out of the car,

70
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,941
we went and looked around and within
five minutes we saw a buck feeding in a

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,620
doable spot.
I creeped in.

72
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,160
It was total it w it just gives you a
distorted perception of your

73
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
chances of success because for the next
five days I got nothing until the last

74
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,230
day,
but in 15 minutes I got the first deer.

75
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,610
But when you get there,
you realize how switched on these

76
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,940
things.
Like there's,

77
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,330
there's nothing like these things.
It's a,

78
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,090
you know,
I've hunted in Africa,

79
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,190
in the antelope there are pretty quick
also just like that just because of

80
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:25,310
lions and hyenas and yeah,
just,

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,430
just super jumpy,
twitchy.

82
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,650
But in these deers,
very similar,

83
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,350
just quick,
when we were leaving that night when

84
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,840
you,
and me and Adam were in the truck and we

85
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:38,200
were leaving and we turned the lights on
the truck and you could see hundreds of

86
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,530
deer in front of us.
Yeah.

87
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,510
It was the craziest,
like it was like a crowd being led out

88
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,910
of a concert or something like that or
basketball game,

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,390
basketball games over,
cause it is just that they're coming out

90
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,930
of the trees,
um,

91
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,670
crossing the road into the open field
where we'd been hunting and it's just

92
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,540
hundreds.

93
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,750
You can't imagine if you haven't been
there.

94
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,210
You can't imagine if you,
if you move there or if you just went

95
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,040
there for a few days,
you'd kind of get it.

96
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,761
You'd be like,
okay,

97
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:05,710
what do you do about these things?
Well,

98
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,400
you can't give them birth control.
I mean they eat grass.

99
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,800
So like how are you going to stop them
from breeding?

100
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,130
You're not so what are you gonna do?
You're gonna introduce tigers to Lanai.

101
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,740
That would be cool.
That may be the only way to do it other

102
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,930
than hunters.
And they're going to start eating people

103
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,470
just hunting.
And it's such a destination for just

104
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,000
getting good deer meat.
And I was thinking about it too,

105
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,370
that stretch or are those hundreds of
deer cross the highway?

106
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:30,910
You know,
that's,

107
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,370
I mean it's a straight as can be.
You can see,

108
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,110
I mean great visibility,
but the speed limit is 35 I think it's

109
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,260
because deer are always jumped out in
front of cars there.

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,020
People would be dying.
So it's,

111
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,960
it seems like,
why is it 35 this is like you should be

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,680
70 but so many deer.
I think it's also because they're like,

113
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,940
where are you going?
Yeah.

114
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,910
Slow down.
You know,

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,630
there's no hurry.
What's the hurry man?

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,490
Relax.
I mean,

117
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,710
3000 people on the island.
Maybe that,

118
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,910
yeah,
that's part of it too.

119
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,460
That islands so relaxed and the people
are so friendly.

120
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,740
I was an awesome,
awesome place.

121
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,890
It was a,
um,

122
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,730
anytime I go on a hunt,
I mean,

123
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm thankful for the experience and for
seeing the animals,

124
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,850
but also meeting the people,
you know,

125
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,170
Alec,
Bob,

126
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,730
the butcher.
Um,

127
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,360
they're just like these people that are
ingrained in your,

128
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,160
in your memory and you know,
that's it.

129
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,960
That's such a special part of the trip
also.

130
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,600
Yeah,
the experience is very,

131
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,610
very unusual because there's really not
a place like that that I know of

132
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:38,611
anywhere on the planet that's just a
small island with a small population of

133
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:42,940
people and a massive population of the
most delicious animals in the world.

134
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,290
And even though there's so many of them,
good fucking luck getting one.

135
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,040
Then we had our friend Ben O'brian,
he went home empty handed.

136
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,620
So one of us in a group of very
experienced hunters.

137
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,040
I mean other than me,
everybody in that group

138
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,530
is super,
super experienced.

139
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,380
Yeah.
You know,

140
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,890
and still is no cake walk.
These things are switched on and they

141
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,270
dodge arrows like during the matrix.
I mean,

142
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,080
it's crazy.

143
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,550
It's a,
there's no gimmie's.

144
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,720
No,
I mean it's a,

145
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,030
you can do everything right.
You can,

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,760
you can think in your head.
While I travel all the way here,

147
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm,
I'm here to hunt.

148
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,030
I,
I need to take me home.

149
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,690
It doesn't matter those deer,
there's no gimmie's.

150
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:27,080
They're trying to stay alive and they
know what's up.

151
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,440
They get hunted.
I don't know if it's every day because

152
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,300
when their,
when their antlers fall off,

153
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,860
you know,
the bucks probably are hunted.

154
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,930
But because they're killing doe is at
night.

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,870
They're hunted most days out of the
year.

156
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,960
So they are as,
as wired as it can be.

157
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,110
I mean,
because they're,

158
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,390
they're used to being pursued.

159
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,470
Yeah.
It's different than say like whitetail

160
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,400
deer,
like whitetail deer seem to kind of know

161
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,310
when hunting season comes around.
Yeah.

162
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,760
Like when they're velvet drops off and
they rubbed their velvet off and then

163
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,950
the,
the females start coming into season.

164
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,460
That's when they get fucking sketchy and
nervous because they know that guns are

165
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,520
going to be going off.
Yeah,

166
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,270
arrows are going to be flying their way.
Right,

167
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,400
but you catch them during the summer and
then just kind of chilling.

168
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah.
These things are never challenged

169
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,580
polar in the winter after season.
They're just,

170
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,790
they're a more focused on food and
putting on some weight to to make it

171
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:20,590
through the winter.
So other than hunting season,

172
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,300
they are more chill.
But these things,

173
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,620
I don't think they ever get a day off.

174
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,830
They don't get a day off and they can't
give him a day off because if they just,

175
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,810
if everybody said,
hey man,

176
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,450
let's just need these animals,
and then man,

177
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,780
if they did,
they would all die either of starvation

178
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,570
or they would die.
Like they had to eradicate the goat

179
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:41,110
population on the island because people
brought goats there and the goats

180
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,320
literally had decimated the vegetation
to the point where the island started

181
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,200
going into a drought.
I don't understand this,

182
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,130
but somehow or another,
if you eat all of the vegetation,

183
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,100
the,
the rain stops falling in certain areas

184
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,720
where there's a lack of participation,
reputation or condensation doesn't

185
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:02,620
gather because there's no,
no leaves to catch capture it.

186
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:06,340
Or one of the ladies who lived there was
explaining it to me why they had to kill

187
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:07,160
all the goats.
Oh,

188
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,020
I see.
And she was like,

189
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,970
trees were dying,
everything was dying.

190
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,450
And they're in the process right now of
a,

191
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,120
in Maui,
they have this gigantic area that they

192
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,800
are trying to eradicate deer from and
they want to fence it in to let the

193
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:25,240
forest regrow because the forest doesn't
have a chance to regrow with again,

194
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:28,960
same animal access deer because they
just eat all the little baby trees as a

195
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,480
little trees are coming up,
they just chew those fuckers up and

196
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:33,850
that's what they eat.
They shoots and they want the new

197
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:34,600
browse.
Yeah,

198
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,433
yeah.
New Growth.

199
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,970
Yeah.
Well,

200
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,670
it's uh,
I mean as far as our trip goes.

201
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:40,930
And that was another thing I wanted to
mention too,

202
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,730
is the,
you said the group of people,

203
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,990
Ben was one of them,
but,

204
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:44,521
uh,
we,

205
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:49,360
we had just an awesome group of hunters
that are all our friends.

206
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,233
Yeah,
exactly.

207
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,360
And some of the best bell hunters in the
world.

208
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,920
And it was a man.
It a good time

209
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,210
hearing the stories from everybody was.
Yeah.

210
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,010
Uh,
then John Dudley made an amazing meal,

211
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:06,490
cooked up some meat one night and it's,
is his cooking good man.

212
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,870
Good access dear.
So delicious.

213
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,220
It's incredible.
Yeah.

214
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,820
It goes with my theory that the fastest
things are the most delicious because

215
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,680
they're trying to get away cause they
know they taste good.

216
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,390
Yeah.
Maybe hey,

217
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,790
it might be something to that salmon.
How good is salmon?

218
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,990
They're like,
get me the fuck out of here.

219
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't like fish.
But you don't like fish at all?

220
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,280
I like halibut.
I like white white fish.

221
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,050
Interesting.
Yeah.

222
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh yeah.
Um,

223
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,780
Shane,
Shane Dorian,

224
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,910
big wave surfer slash awesome bow
hunter,

225
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,510
Remy Warren,
our buddy Adam Green tree,

226
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,150
uh,
Sam Solo Hall.

227
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,310
Ben O'brien.
Yeah.

228
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,450
Uh,
I don't know.

229
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,040
Will's last name.
We'll from Yeti.

230
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,150
Yeah.
I don't know either.

231
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,811
I don't know.
Yeah,

232
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:46,660
Nice Guy.
Yeah.

233
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,700
Great Guy.
But I mean,

234
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,020
what a fucking crew.

235
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,490
Yeah.
So awesome.

236
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,140
It was great.
It was a,

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
and just so much respect for guys like
those guys who are at the top of their

238
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,700
game,
you know what I mean?

239
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,550
But learning,
I don't think people realize how hard it

240
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,660
is.
No.

241
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,690
So when I see these guys go out and
they're successful with basically a

242
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,530
sharp stick,
you know,

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,230
it's on,
especially on an animal like that.

244
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,330
So a lot of these people,
it's new country.

245
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,920
Like Adam hadn't been there.
I hadn't,

246
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,020
I had never been there.
Um,

247
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,530
when you see guys go out there and do
that on a new hunt in new country for

248
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:23,850
new animals,
it's a,

249
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,160
it's impressive.
Well that we really did like,

250
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,870
look at that.
That's the goddamn 18 taken me and kimmy

251
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,790
out of the mix and we'll,
let's be honest,

252
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,960
he got a deer though.
He'd take kit at the,

253
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,710
I'm just fucking with him.

254
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,670
He's a good dude.
Dies.

255
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,090
I mean,
what I'm saying is like you and Dudley

256
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:45,510
and Adam and remy,
I mean fucking straight assassins and

257
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,610
Shane,
I mean shame and he lives out there,

258
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:51,510
but people don't know Shane is world
renowned as a big wave surfer,

259
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,370
but he's an awesome bow hunter.
I mean,

260
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:56,970
he's really excellent and does it all
the time out there.

261
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,150
Spot and stalk,
crawling around the bushes and crawled.

262
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,460
I mean,
you were there the last day when I shot

263
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,240
my last dear,
I crawled a quarter of a mile to get to

264
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,074
these fuckers.
Yeah,

265
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,860
they were up on the hill.
I always watching you guys from an

266
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,650
elevated spot up on top of the hill.
And I was,

267
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,130
I,
when you guys were up walking from a

268
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,180
mile,
I could see you easy,

269
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,410
you know,
I mean binoculars,

270
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,420
no problem.
And then all of a sudden you're gone.

271
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,640
And so I sit Alica Tech.
So I'm like,

272
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,530
why are you guys hiding from me?
Cause I was just like,

273
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,100
you have to really glass really gas and
that'd be like there was a head okay

274
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,690
there head.
Okay now I see you guys.

275
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,780
But it was yeah,
crawling for a long time.

276
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,700
Um,
let me think how long,

277
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,050
I would say an hour almost.
We crawled for an hour,

278
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,310
an hour to get a quarter mile and it,
that is a lot of work.

279
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,500
You know,
you got a bow so you had a bow in your

280
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:50,250
hand and I didn't have anything.
But you're moving that bow with each.

281
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,310
Yeah.
Whatever you crawling step and in

282
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,180
as basically doing a plank for an hour.
Yeah,

283
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,700
I was,
I was winded by the time we got to where

284
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,470
the deer were and now it's like take a
deep breath,

285
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,680
take a deep breath because we got within
55 yards and I'm like,

286
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,690
we're good right here and this is a good
spot.

287
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:12,490
We're behind a Bush but it like my
shoulders are sore as I was doing

288
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,300
pushups.
Yeah.

289
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,630
Cause like you're,
you're crawling like a cat,

290
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,900
so you're just,
and you try to be super quiet.

291
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,290
So like if you saw us do it,
people that are listening,

292
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
you're crawling but you're not just kind
of crawling along.

293
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,130
You're crawling as quietly as you can.
And Kimmy,

294
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,990
a deep respect for camouflage too.
Like I was wearing a camouflage face

295
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:40,991
mask and that hat and I had a camouflage
backpack by the final day I had gloves

296
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,030
on,
I was fucking fully cam mode.

297
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,890
We went,
took the shoes off,

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,920
we were crawling.
A lot of it was in wool socks just so he

299
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,450
could be even more quiet.
Yeah.

300
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,710
Yeah.
There's,

301
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,280
there's no,
you can't take to greater measures on

302
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,890
being more stealthier quiet on these
animals.

303
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,180
Yeah.
And uh,

304
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,400
immediately I put up the post and,
uh,

305
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,770
I saw one negative comment.
I'm like,

306
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,060
I'm not an,
I'm reading this shit.

307
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,710
One of the things that happened while I
was there,

308
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:10,100
it was my phone fucked up.
I dropped my phone on the first day and

309
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,470
when I dropped my phone in the first
day,

310
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,420
it just went haywire.
It wouldn't work anymore.

311
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,750
And so I had to get a new phone so I
ordered a new phone and had it shipped

312
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,580
to the island.
And when I was doing that,

313
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:21,520
I didn't use anything.
I didn't use any APPS.

314
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,660
I didn't check my email,
I didn't check twitter and I felt

315
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,494
better.

316
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,480
I felt better.
He went cold Turkey.

317
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,650
I went cold Turkey for three days and
while I was out there going cold Turkey,

318
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,390
I was like,
I feel better.

319
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,600
Like this is better.
Like checking all that stuff all the

320
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,381
time.
Like,

321
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:42,350
do I need to know about the Mueller
probe 24 seven do I,

322
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,870
do I need to?
I don't.

323
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,560
What about stormy Daniels?
Do I need to know what the latest stormy

324
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:52,240
Daniels lawsuit is?
If I was a super billionaire character,

325
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:54,460
I'd give stormy Daniels money and go,
please stop.

326
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,780
No,
but everybody,

327
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,340
I don't,
I don't want him to hear it.

328
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,380
What do you mean you want money?
You want money?

329
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm not even saying that he's not guilty
or that she's,

330
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,450
you know,
she's in the wrong,

331
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,310
I don't think she is.
But what are you looking for?

332
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,900
Let's can we get this out of the news.

333
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,120
I don't need to hear this anymore.
He fucked you.

334
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,350
I get it.
Yeah.

335
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,230
How do people fucked a lot of people
since that time?

336
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,830
You know it's irritating.
What you pay $135,000 like,

337
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,750
okay,
so you're going to just keep it on the

338
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:20,441
DL,
right?

339
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,080
We're good hundred 35 and then get the
money.

340
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,490
Now she's talking well deals that I
don't think she has that money anymore.

341
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,250
I think she spent it.
Oh,

342
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,130
she needs more money.
I'm like,

343
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:35,440
she needs more money and I think she
realizes this is an opportunity for,

344
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,110
you know,
I don't know how to look at it because

345
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,920
on one hand I'm like,
well,

346
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,500
I think we should hold the president up
to higher standards and you,

347
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:49,720
you shouldn't be able to just lie all
the time and be the president because

348
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,670
how could we trust you if it comes to
something serious,

349
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,990
like a warm war with China or some
something crazy or invading Iran.

350
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,090
Let's just go off the charts with
craziness.

351
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah.
I gotta be able to trust you with

352
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,720
everything.
If I can't trust you that you,

353
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,410
you don't want to tell everybody that
you banged a porn star.

354
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,460
Wouldn't it be great if he just had a a
press conference in Ladies Gentlemen?

355
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,620
Who Cares?
Who Cares?

356
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,340
Yeah.
I,

357
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,350
I enjoy sex.
I enjoy sex.

358
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,760
I'm a heterosexual man.
Millennia,

359
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,210
10 years before he was elected or
whatever,

360
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,400
it was like,
I shouldn't have fucked this porn star,

361
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,050
but I couldn't help myself.
I'm a pig,

362
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,140
but I'm doing a good job as a president.
The economy is up.

363
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,510
Unemployment the town.
Thank you.

364
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:29,960
Good night.

365
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,120
Support the troops,
troops,

366
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,770
port,
the NRA.

367
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,820
Hey,
here's the,

368
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm paying.
So you say you can't trust them because

369
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,870
if you lie about this stuff,
but,

370
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,010
okay,
so you say another president,

371
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,750
how do you know they're not lying?
They are lying.

372
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,673
Yeah.
So

373
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,370
I think deval lied.
I think,

374
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,140
look,
one of the things that,

375
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,970
you know,
I had a conversation with a friend of

376
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:55,050
mine about a Hillary Clinton and he's a,
he's a big Hillary Clinton supporter to

377
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:59,040
the point where it's like,
he like Jamie with the cavaliers hat on,

378
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,750
he might as well have a Hillary Clinton
hat on.

379
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,600
He's like a Hillary Clinton says,
I'm sure they do.

380
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,430
I'm sure they had them right.
I'm with her.

381
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,940
This guy is a,
him and his wife are both like Super

382
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,270
Hillary supporters and I'm like,
it doesn't bother you at all that she

383
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,850
deleted 30,000 emails.
So it doesn't bother you at all.

384
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,510
Like they told her there's a probe,
we need to see all your emails,

385
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,280
just deleted them all.
That doesn't bother you.

386
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,680
Like that doesn't seem like maybe she's
a liar.

387
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,010
And then when you hear,
call me his account of what happened

388
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,130
versus her account of what happened.
She's clearly not being honest.

389
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,990
That doesn't bother you.
And he's like,

390
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,940
well,
I think in comparison she doesn't apply

391
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:33,451
as much.
I'm like,

392
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,460
what are you talking about?
Like these are lies.

393
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,200
It doesn't matter in comparison.
Right.

394
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,100
So my point is,
I think anybody who gets to that level

395
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,210
of that business is slimy and one way or
another,

396
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,800
everyone's slimy

397
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,860
maybe.
But we would like you to not be,

398
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,300
yeah,
it'd be great.

399
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,180
We'd like everybody to not be,
yeah,

400
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,660
he,
I dunno.

401
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,120
I think the only way to get to the
bottom of it is get him on the podcast.

402
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,690
I would love to get him on the podcast.
I'll have to get them drunk.

403
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
He doesn't drink.
That's,

404
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,050
oh,
that's what I was wondering.

405
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,440
So you know,
most people have podcasts that aren't

406
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,020
the,
almost the Joe Rogan,

407
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,160
but that's almost true right now.
Like most people do have podcasts and

408
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,710
no,
I know,

409
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,060
but,
well,

410
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,940
okay,
now let me finish.

411
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,590
So most people that do,
they'd be like,

412
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,490
they got this,
get this a dream guest list.

413
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:24,901
You know,
the,

414
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:27,640
the wishlist and these are my,
I'd love to have these people.

415
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,300
And I was thinking about you,
it's like it seems like,

416
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,320
and I don't know,
I'm not you,

417
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,350
but like the Courtney to Walter,
the people you're interested in are more

418
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,000
important to you than say like the Ala,
the like uh,

419
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,650
the president United States.
I mean,

420
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,660
so how do you,
do you have a wishlist of I don't have

421
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,280
a wishlist.
No,

422
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,040
no.
We were talking about this on the plane

423
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,210
ride.
I don't,

424
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,450
I like talking to my friends.
Yeah,

425
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,780
I like talking to you.
Yeah.

426
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,350
I like talking to interesting people
like the sleep expert hat on the all the

427
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,990
day Matthew Walker or pete you didn't
like,

428
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,470
and he's telling me he sleeps three
hours a night,

429
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,330
so I didn't like that.
So I'm going to ignore him that you said

430
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,290
that.
That guy,

431
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,420
oh,
you Monday we have Michael Chandler.

432
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,270
I'm looking forward to that.
I like,

433
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,090
I like talking to interesting people and
they don't have to be famous to me at

434
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,490
all right now.
Some of my favorite podcasts for people

435
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,670
that aren't famous at all.
Yeah.

436
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,790
Just like people that are interesting.
I mean that's obviously a pretty blanket

437
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,470
statement,
but I like people that are doing things

438
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,690
that are unique,
people that are,

439
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,770
that are like masters at a craft.

440
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,130
People that are working hard,
people that inspire me.

441
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:45,700
I like to be inspired,
you know,

442
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,070
like I like talking to people who are
curious and who've studied things,

443
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,350
you know,
whether it's Sean Carroll or Neil

444
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:57,240
degrasse Tyson or people that understand
things that I don't understand so I can

445
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,220
pick their brain and ask them questions
about stuff.

446
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,820
That to me is interesting,
but trump habits sitting down with

447
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:06,390
trump.
But B to me like a lot like sitting down

448
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,300
with my friend Alex Jones,
like it's,

449
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,360
it'd be like,
okay,

450
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,480
like it would be the best I would be
like if you talked to him for three

451
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,860
hours,
what kind of crazy stuff would come out?

452
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,260
It'd be awesome.
I really think that if he wasn't

453
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,400
president,
I would like him.

454
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,530
I would really,
I would like him,

455
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,120
I would think.
I would think he's a character if I

456
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,910
didn't have business to do with him
where I was worried about like,

457
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,860
you know,
getting screwed over in some sort of a

458
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:29,820
deal or something like that.

459
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,270
I would like him cause I would think
he's a wild man and he's a character.

460
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,260
He's a fucking seven year old dude with
the crazy fucking hair.

461
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,460
He wears a red bat baseball hat
everywhere that says make America great

462
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,450
again.
That's awesome.

463
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,310
You can't even wear that hat in the
bars.

464
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,220
Could you imagine that?
He is so divisive.

465
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,610
Like he's so the people are so
conflicted.

466
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:54,060
One side of the other against him that
if you wear that hat they will kick you

467
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,120
out of places.
Yeah.

468
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,710
What world do we live in?
Yeah,

469
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,010
well you can't wear something that says
make America great again.

470
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,790
Yeah.
How,

471
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,800
how could that be considered?
Anything but positive.

472
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,510
How's,
I don't understand.

473
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,050
But he's,
people hate him so much and that's,

474
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,063
so,
that's,

475
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,860
to me even a great accomplishment from
what he's done is like,

476
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,290
he's got so much hate and he's still
look at all the positives that happen.

477
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,630
Well,
most people don't think any positives

478
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,510
that happened because if most people in
my most people,

479
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,160
I think there has been,
well,

480
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,790
I think most people live in an echo
chamber and if you're like my friend

481
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,840
who's a giant Hillary Clinton supporter,
all you hear is trust the devil.

482
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,780
And you know,
he was like completely convinced that it

483
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:40,620
was going down and trump's going to be
kicked out of office in the first 60

484
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,970
days and he's like,
trust me,

485
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,140
it's not going to last a year.
I'm like,

486
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,290
it's not going to last a year.
A year later he's crying and he's

487
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,000
fucking pulling his hair out.
It's

488
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,360
going crazy.
You know,

489
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,150
like Marie Keith Olbermann?
Yeah,

490
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,380
he's open and he,
he retired that show.

491
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,510
He's like,
yeah,

492
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,490
I don't need to do this anymore.
It's just a matter of days.

493
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,430
That was fucking six months ago I think.
When did he,

494
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,600
when did he quit the resistance?
It was,

495
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,920
it wasn't soon enough.
I think he just had to fucking take a

496
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,870
break.
I think he was losing his marbles,

497
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,580
but they're so interested in the
negative narrative that they're not,

498
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,410
they won't even promote anything
positive.

499
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:18,760
So it's like when he was saying all the
rocket man stuff,

500
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:19,330
it's like,
oh,

501
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,550
trump's going to cause a nuclear war.
Okay,

502
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:26,350
now he's talking and now they're in
negotiations with North Korea and south,

503
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,990
north and south are talking and he's
like,

504
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,730
ah,
trump had nothing to do with it.

505
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,390
It's like,
well,

506
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,630
how could he almost our nuclear war and
then have nothing to do with what's

507
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,170
going on?

508
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,180
It's like it can't be both.
Right?

509
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,670
Well I guess it probably could if they
were like,

510
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,290
listen,
let's not start a nuclear war.

511
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,820
How about what you and I talk like north
and South Korea,

512
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,310
so let's get together and figure this
out.

513
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,450
This crazy ass hole on the other side of
the country or the world rather than,

514
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,390
okay,
so he's,

515
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,060
he deserves credit for that sense of
respect.

516
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,200
He's very,
he's a very interesting guy and the fact

517
00:21:56,201 --> 00:22:01,201
that his methods are so outrageous and
outside the norm,

518
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,760
then I don't think these world leaders
know what the fuck to do with him when

519
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,370
he gets calling him rocket man.
I know my buttons bigger than yours.

520
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,300
What?
Yeah,

521
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,830
what's,
he says crazy shit.

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,110
He says crazy shit,
but that's what he's always done.

523
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:18,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

524
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,330
So it's,
he's consistent.

525
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,120
We just expect them to do something
different because he's the president

526
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,350
right now your working,
we were talking about this on the plane

527
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,300
too,
that you're working with.

528
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,610
What is your,
your position in the administration

529
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:35,560
because you actually have a wildlife
conservation position now in the

530
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,490
government.
Right.

531
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,410
Did you ever fucking thing that was
going to happen?

532
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,250
No.
No,

533
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,960
I didn't know.
How the hell did this even come up?

534
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,270
Oh God.
Um,

535
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,230
I dunno.
I'm on the International Wildlife

536
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,063
Conservation Council.
Whoa.

537
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,250
Yeah,
that's legit.

538
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,640
It's a hell of,
I got a business and I don't have a

539
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:52,890
business card,
but if I did,

540
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:54,640
did you get a belt buckle for that?
I should.

541
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,920
Oh,
I was thinking about the belt buckle.

542
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,110
So I then I was like,
I was like,

543
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,000
he said,
you said you wanted a belt buckle.

544
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,430
And I'm like,
oh maybe I'll give them my belt buckle

545
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,530
that I wore on the hunt.
But then I'm thinking,

546
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
so,
so I gave you the belt buckle,

547
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,560
but then I'm like,
shit,

548
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,850
maybe he wants a new belt buckle.

549
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh No.
In the box with the sweet custom box.

550
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,121
No,
no,

551
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,100
no.
I didn't want it to be disrespectful on

552
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,950
Tryna say here's a huge belt.
You know the,

553
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:19,600
we'll use one was blood on it.
Yeah,

554
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,320
it does.
Perfect.

555
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,741
Yeah.
Yeah.

556
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:21,341
Look it.
Okay.

557
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,500
I just want her,
I want her to make sure you're good with

558
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,370
that.
Cause I wasn't,

559
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,940
I just want,
I want you to want or get what you want

560
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,280
basically.
Um,

561
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,360
so international law of Conservation
Council,

562
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,640
so I,
I dunno how it started cause I'm like,

563
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,090
man,
there are some powerful people on their

564
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,130
safari club,
international people,

565
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,190
a super successful business people in
and a political campaign type

566
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,530
contributors.
And then,

567
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,940
you know,
we go to this meeting,

568
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:54,530
there's 16 of us on the couch and just
like this cowboy boots,

569
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,960
flannel shirt,
just like this dude,

570
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,900
this and everybody else is wearing a
suit and dies.

571
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,300
And I'm like,
do they give you grief for dressing like

572
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,490
that?
Not to my face,

573
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:07,340
but maybe later fucking Oregon
Hillbilly.

574
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,320
That's probably,
and uh,

575
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,910
so yeah,
I don't know.

576
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,820
I don't know why I'm on there.
I don't who contacted you?

577
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,380
Um,
or the interior department.

578
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,260
So like you're in the middle of a run
running a mount.

579
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,000
Pisgah yeah,
no,

580
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,280
I got to call Washington DC.
She,

581
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm fuck up.
Swear to God.

582
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,480
And I'm like,
oh my God,

583
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,960
this the be good.
Cause it was after.

584
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,240
Okay,
so trump put out the tweet and he said

585
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:39,500
something like,
he doesn't see how hunting for elephants

586
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,040
is conservation or,
or helps wildlife.

587
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,810
It's a,
it's a horror show.

588
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,830
Doesn't know elephants or any other
animal,

589
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,230
something like that.
And I was like,

590
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,870
what in the hell is that?
What are we talking about?

591
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,820
You know,
elephants talk about elephants,

592
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,570
that's fine.

593
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,250
Whatever.
But he said,

594
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,070
or any other animal.
So I took that tweet,

595
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,430
I posted it and addressed it.
And I don't know if he saw it,

596
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:06,320
I don't really know.
But soon after that I got a call for

597
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,880
this thing.
And so,

598
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,100
cause I was,
you know,

599
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:13,040
I know just from had in Africa and how
it works.

600
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,290
And,
um,

601
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,170
the hunting is necessary over there if
the animals are going to survive,

602
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,570
if,
if that's a complicated story.

603
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,400
It's a complicated situation,
but people,

604
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:25,600
uh,
people don't want to hear that now.

605
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,960
So here's an example of in Tanzania
there was a,

606
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,640
the largest hunting concession,
and I'm trying to think how big it was.

607
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,370
I,
I can't put the number on how big it

608
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,900
was,
but they'd been in business for 40

609
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,550
years.
So a hunting concession is,

610
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,720
is they have,
you know,

611
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:46,190
hunters from,
usually America go over there.

612
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,760
They pay for the,
for the access to the land and they pay

613
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,240
for the right to hunt these animals.
So this place had been in business for

614
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,980
40 years.
Um,

615
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,890
they went out of business because of
this import ban.

616
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Obama put an import ban on the ivory of
elephants coming back as trophies,

617
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,110
but also bottom lines,
the line thing was right after cecil the

618
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,960
lion and it was done as a political
measure,

619
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,820
right?
So he put a ban on,

620
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,000
you can go over there and hunt him.
Still it cause you know,

621
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,670
we're from America,
we can't say what's legal in Africa,

622
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,530
but he can say what he did was say we
can hunt them whatever because they

623
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:26,330
can't control that,
but you can't bring them home.

624
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,280
So nobody's going to go and spend 75,000
kill an elephant or 50,000 to kill a

625
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:32,660
lion if they can't bring it home.

626
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,843
Right.
Right.

627
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,920
So that basically shut down hunting and
um,

628
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,760
um,
this outfit in Tanzania that had

629
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,160
business business for 40 years,
they,

630
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,350
cause they went out of business about,
I think it's about two months ago now.

631
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,360
And what happens is when they don't have
the,

632
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,940
the concession,
they can't pay for that land.

633
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,380
It is given back to the people.
And for us here,

634
00:26:58,381 --> 00:26:58,951
there'll be like,
oh,

635
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,140
that's great you gave the land back to
the people.

636
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,150
No,
it's not good to give the land back to

637
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,740
the people there because if people can't
do anything,

638
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:06,900
you don't have any money there.
They don't just like,

639
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,440
so what happens is a poacher is as soon
as the hunting concession moves out,

640
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:15,441
poachers move in and kill every animal.
The only reason the animals that were

641
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,800
being protected in that hunting
concession was because there was hunting

642
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,634
in there.
These,

643
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,380
this outfit would spin,
I think in the last three years they

644
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:29,010
spent over $2 million on anti poaching
efforts.

645
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,610
So $2 million to protect basically their
investment,

646
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,230
which is those animals that were in
there.

647
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,200
Yeah,
they'd kill a couple because,

648
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,230
because,
um,

649
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,440
elephants were haunted and they ran the
Ha's and probably lions.

650
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,130
But by and large,
they're protecting the majority of the

651
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:44,570
herd.

652
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,171
Well,
give me,

653
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,350
give me those numbers again because you
were,

654
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,920
you were giving me the numbers on
elephants legally and illegally.

655
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,860
Right.
So,

656
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,870
so,
and I asked this back at our first

657
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,110
international wildlife conservation
council meeting and this,

658
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,930
you know,
Peter was there and all these animal

659
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:59,790
rights activists,
um,

660
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,850
I don't want to say psychos that could
be disrespectful,

661
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:05,820
but anyway,
these extremists were there and so it

662
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,820
was kind of heated in some point,
some cases.

663
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,170
But I did ask this question,
how many elephants are killed legally in

664
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:17,220
Africa each year?
And the number is about 400,

665
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,780
400 a kid legally.

666
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,300
The entire continent.
Yeah.

667
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,510
So g area so big that you can get
America,

668
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,480
the United States of America,
you can also get all the European

669
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:29,640
countries.
You could fit a lot of shit in Africa.

670
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,450
Africa is huge,
huge place.

671
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,530
Yeah.
And so there's some,

672
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,500
there's some areas where you're not
going to hunt elephants because there's

673
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,940
not,
there's not enough or um,

674
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,450
they don't live there.
But there are some areas where there's

675
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,110
too many elephant.

676
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,900
It's,
it's just,

677
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,260
yeah,
that's what's confusing to be where

678
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,770
people here,
elephants are going extinct.

679
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:46,251
Well,
yeah,

680
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,620
they are in some places.
And then another places.

681
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,480
The problem is with local farmers,
they have these plots of land and the

682
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,870
elephants come in and eat everything and
destroy their land and they can't do

683
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,250
anything about it.
And what are you going to do this?

684
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,660
How the,
how big is an elephant?

685
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,970
How many thousands of pounds?
10,000 pounds or some shit.

686
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,250
I don't even know.
They're huge.

687
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:05,080
They're huge,
but they don't do a goddamn thing about

688
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,730
care about elephants.
They don't.

689
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,050
They're like,
the elephant is ruining my crop.

690
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,820
Yeah.
That's what I need to eat.

691
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,210
Yeah.
I'm going to kill the elephant.

692
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,490
It's going to lay there and rot.
Yeah.

693
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:15,860
There's these,
these people are starving.

694
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,760
I mean there,
there's a food chain going on there and

695
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,730
humans here where we are,
we're,

696
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,600
we're so far above the food chain that
we're like sitting in a platform looking

697
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,620
down,
watching it.

698
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,570
They're,
they're embedded in it.

699
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,170
There on

700
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,100
level.
They'll in there,

701
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,360
it's,
it's the whole,

702
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,930
it's a whole analogy of you can't have
first world world people solving third

703
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:41,380
world problems and it's just,
we,

704
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,180
we,
people here have all the answers.

705
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,850
It's like you have everything you want.
You have,

706
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,130
you live in excess,
you're fat,

707
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,900
you have,
you throw food away.

708
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,840
What are you talking about?
Do you have no idea what it's like in

709
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:56,380
Africa?
So they're 400 elephants are killed

710
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,780
legally.
30,000 are poached a year,

711
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,350
30,000 and the reason that's happening
is because the hunting had to move out.

712
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:08,950
The hunting closed down or hunting is
what pays for the anti poaching efforts,

713
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,020
but when hunting money isn't there,
the poachers run rampant 30,000

714
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,210
elephants.
That's why they are devastated.

715
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,230
It's such a not hunting.
It's such a hard thing for people to

716
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:23,040
swallow because what this is from the
point of view of someone who loves

717
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,990
wildlife,
I think this is what people want.

718
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,910
What they want is the humans to leave
the animals alone and the animals to

719
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,470
live in this state of bliss where they
exist perfectly,

720
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:39,120
and the balance of nature of Predator
and prey all plays out in a natural way

721
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,990
without people going over there and
shooting elephants than sticking their

722
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,450
tusks on their wall.
Yeah.

723
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,080
I mean we've all seen those pictures of
these giant fat fucks holding a rifle

724
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,650
standing over a lie and you're like,
this just looks wrong.

725
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,530
Yeah.
It looks like American gluttony makes

726
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:59,690
its way over to Africa and some guy
shoots a line with a rifle.

727
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,630
Now he's standing on its head and he's
going to put it on his wall and it's fat

728
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,510
fucking house somewhere that bothers
people.

729
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,950
I get,
I get it too.

730
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,140
I mean,
I'm not arguing that,

731
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,020
but,
but you got to fix Africa first and you,

732
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:16,650
you're not trying.
So this idea that if you just leave all

733
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,330
those animals alone and stop hunting
them,

734
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,560
everything's going to be fine.
No,

735
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,330
they're going to be wiped out.
You got to,

736
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,620
people have to look at it pragmatically
first and then idealistically.

737
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,250
Cause pragmatically you have to
understand that these animals,

738
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,100
20 years ago,
we're on the verge of extinction.

739
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:35,910
So many different antelopes,
so many different what we'd call game

740
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,380
animals,
animals that people eat.

741
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,940
We're on the verge of extinction until
they started instituting these big

742
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:46,290
hunting concessions and having people
come in from Europe and America and

743
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,980
hunting in Africa.
Then the community started to prosper

744
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:52,140
because if someone's paying,
you know,

745
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:54,040
I don't know how much is it to shoot
like a,

746
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,130
uh,
a neil guy or something like that,

747
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,700
maybe 1500.
So think of how many of those things get

748
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,980
shot.
And some of that money goes to the

749
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,690
ranch.
Some of that money goes to the

750
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,600
professional hunting guys,
anti poaching conservation efforts,

751
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,610
and then you have unprecedented numbers.
There's more of those animals today than

752
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:15,930
there have been in decades.
And it's all because people put value on

753
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:16,120
them.

754
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,190
Yeah.
It's all about the animals have to have

755
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,200
value and people will say,
no will,

756
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,420
the animal has value being alive.
It's like,

757
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:22,970
okay,

758
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,590
well it does to you.
It starts to you.

759
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,210
If you don't live over there,
if you're not pouring,

760
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,500
your children aren't starving to death.

761
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,300
A picture of an of a line is amazing.
Okay.

762
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,780
And that animal is beautiful.
There's value in being alive,

763
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,860
but he got to understand those people
need to eat,

764
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,220
they need to work.
So if they're not,

765
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:42,380
we're working for the hunting
concession.

766
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,150
If the Huntington session goes out of
business,

767
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:46,760
like the largest one in Tanzania did
after 40 years,

768
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,030
what are they going to do?
They can't go get a job at the mill,

769
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,230
you know what I mean?
There's no,

770
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,030
there's not industry over there.
So what happens is as they would,

771
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,680
some of those people,
and I don't know for a fact,

772
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,690
but I would,
I'm going to make an educated guess if

773
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:04,691
they would go from working as anti
poetry and officers are or are helping

774
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,850
keep the animals alive is as part of the
anti poaching program.

775
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,530
Straight to poaching.

776
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,623
Yeah.
Well that,

777
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,940
that's happened back and forth both
ways,

778
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:13,600
right?
Yeah.

779
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,720
Former poachers became anti poaching
officers when the opportunity.

780
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,870
Right.
And they were great ones because they

781
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,760
knew how,
how it worked and they knew where the

782
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:23,310
weaknesses were were and that saved
animals.

783
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,900
But it's just like,
it's,

784
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,650
it's sad because that,
you know,

785
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,580
that last two months without that
hunting concession there without the

786
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,440
anti-poaching,
um,

787
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,920
program in place,
I guarantee it's been a slaughter.

788
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,120
The animals that were being protected
are now just being slaughtered by

789
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:42,740
poachers.

790
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,080
And again,
the difference between looking at things

791
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:47,270
pragmatically and looking at things
idealistically,

792
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,060
idealistically,
we would like all those people in Africa

793
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:54,260
to have plenty of food and plenty of
opportunity for employment and plenty of

794
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,180
things to do with their life,
but they don't.

795
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,171
Yeah.
You know,

796
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:01,370
and the,
the situation that had emerged with

797
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:05,060
these hunting sessions is superior to
the situation that's in place now.

798
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,120
And it's also superior for the animals
themselves,

799
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:11,690
including the lions in Zimbabwe.
They had to kill,

800
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,310
look this up Jamie,
see if you could,

801
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:17,270
cause they had to call,
I think it was something along the lines

802
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:22,271
of 200 lions recently because they had
decimated the undulate population

803
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,130
because there weren't kept in check
because the,

804
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,750
Angela,
the way these,

805
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,460
the balance of nature works out is you
have to have a balance between Predator

806
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,890
and prey.
The only way to keep the balance of

807
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,090
Predator as humans.

808
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,980
That's it.
It's the only thing that exists unless

809
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:37,814
they keep,
yeah.

810
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,840
Zimbabwe,
loud,

811
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:41,930
rive reserve.
We'll call 200 lines to control a

812
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:45,140
population explosion.
Claiming hunters have been scared off by

813
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:49,130
the outcry over seas of the line.
The whole thing is so weird because what

814
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:52,670
people just jump on it.
You know that you watched the lion king.

815
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,870
Oh Simba.
No,

816
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:57,650
don't kill Simba and oh see,
so he's got a name and all this

817
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:01,310
craziness.
It got to such a weird point where there

818
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:06,311
was this discussion about Cecil's
brother that Cecil's brother got killed

819
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,750
Jericho and they were like,
oh my God,

820
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:12,410
they killed Jericho.
And then people were relieved because

821
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,810
they found it.
It was a different line and it wasn't

822
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,790
Cecil's brother Jericho.
So this is like,

823
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,530
they're watching it goddamn reality
show.

824
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:21,200
It's like keeping up with the
Kardashians in Africa.

825
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,500
Like will you give a shit?
What the fucking name of the APP the

826
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:28,250
African lion is?
You're crazy.

827
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,690
It's not Jericho.
Oh,

828
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:30,140
it's,
it's,

829
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,910
it's Michael the lion.
So it's okay.

830
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,040
That's crazy.
Still a fucking lion.

831
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,780
But this shows you this first world view
of

832
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,050
this wildlife situation that is not
ideal by any stretch of the imagination.

833
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,510
I think part of it,
like with that the whole Cecil lion

834
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,510
thing,
it gave people a purpose as like,

835
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,020
oh,
I have something to stand for.

836
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,950
I have a purpose now.
And that's where I know people are

837
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,260
struggling out there finding what's my
purpose,

838
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
what am I doing?
You know,

839
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,560
and they're spinning their wheels.
They don't,

840
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,070
I dunno what they do,
but that gave them something to fight

841
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,950
for and it wasn't right.
It didn't help anything.

842
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,951
It hurt those 200 lions could have been
$50,000 each to a hunter.

843
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,560
$10 million or two went to Zimbabwe,
stayed there or,

844
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,590
or at least employed people.
But no,

845
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,200
they were killed in,
there was no game.

846
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,050
Yeah,
it still sucks all across the board.

847
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:26,940
It's sucks.
The whole situation sucks.

848
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,360
These weird high fence operations where
they let lions loose and then they let

849
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:35,850
him out of the cage and then people show
up that day and the lines on what the

850
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,740
fuck's going on and they shoot this
line.

851
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,570
And then stand up.
That sucks too.

852
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,650
Yeah,
I don't like that.

853
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,180
The whole thing is weird.
It's not look wildlife in Africa and the

854
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:48,330
high fence wildlife,
it's not ideal by any stretch of the

855
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:53,331
imagination and these animals that were
going extinct and now aren't because

856
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:56,310
people were hunting them.
It's fucking strange.

857
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,600
That's a strange balance that the only
reason they exist is so people can come

858
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,460
over there and shoot him.
Like we don't,

859
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,630
I don't,
I don't want that.

860
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,510
I mean I would like them to just exist.
Well the thing,

861
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,120
yeah,
but people aren't going to contribute

862
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:12,720
that money to pay for the anti poaching
just to go take a picture.

863
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,810
It's like if you go to happen,
if you go to the Missouri breaks or

864
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:19,080
something like that and you go hunting
mule deer like those,

865
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,460
that's what I like.
I like animals that exist because they,

866
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,300
their,
they're their,

867
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,320
this is their spot.

868
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,010
This is where they are.
Like if you go to the Missouri breaks

869
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,660
and you go up into those those hills and
look for for mule deer,

870
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,240
those fuckers have been there for
thousands of years.

871
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:40,230
I mean,
they have found skulls of deer of

872
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,890
whitetail deer in Florida that are 2
million years old,

873
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,650
right?
They're the exact same animal 2 million

874
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:49,560
years ago,
so for millions of years longer than

875
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:54,450
there have been human beings,
those things have been in that form

876
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,240
running around North America and
wherever the fuck they can.

877
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,280
That's what I like.
I like that too,

878
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,300
but don't forget that hunting has played
a part in keeping those numbers healthy.

879
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,860
Joe,
the deer and the elk,

880
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,870
there's more deer.
There's no big game animal in north.

881
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:11,580
The big game animals in North American
now than there were a hundred years ago,

882
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,610
and that's through hunting and
conservation.

883
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,390
That is true,
but it's also because 150 years ago,

884
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,850
people went,
fucking ham wiped out.

885
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,480
Most of them.
It was real bad when the market hunting

886
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,950
before refrigeration.
Exactly.

887
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,480
Yeah.
But we've learned from that.

888
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,171
We learn,
okay,

889
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,940
this is how,
this is how we need to do it.

890
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,160
This is how hunting fits in this
equation.

891
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,200
And that's where,
you know,

892
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,030
we talked about the intro National
Wildlife Conservation Council.

893
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,680
That's given me a a way in to talk about
a bunch of other things too.

894
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,650
So one of those,
and we talk about animals in North

895
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:47,980
America is a Ryan Zinky who is the
secretary of Interior.

896
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,550
He created this new,
I guess it's a bill.

897
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:54,660
I'm not like this political expert.
I'm about hunger,

898
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,270
right?
I wear a flannel shirt and baseball hat,

899
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,400
but he did create this,
uh,

900
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,800
um,
I'm going to call it a bill,

901
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:08,070
but that protects the,
the winter that we call them wildlife

902
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:11,200
corridor.
So it's where the animals can go from

903
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,990
December,
some arrange to winter range where

904
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:15,850
there's not going to be development
there.

905
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,940
So He created that because that's how
those animals like in Montana,

906
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,810
make it through the winter if they're up
in the summer.

907
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,970
Um,
they make it through,

908
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,150
um,
getting in the fall and then all of a

909
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,360
sudden winter hits,
they have to have a way down into the

910
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:35,260
low country to where they can their
winter migration to where they can

911
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,440
survive the snow and,
and where they can make down.

912
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:43,390
And there's good feed down there.
If there's gas rigs or mineral mineral

913
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:46,480
extraction efforts going on that impede
that,

914
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,450
then they might get hung up up there and
get stuck in the snow and die.

915
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:53,800
So he realizes that he realized the need
for that and he created this,

916
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,340
this new program that's going to make
sure that there's no development in

917
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,350
there.
It keeps those corridors open and

918
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:02,260
that's,
that's why our numbers do so well is

919
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:05,500
because there's people like that with
the vision on keeping our animals

920
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,120
healthy.

921
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,260
Well,
this is another thing that we talked

922
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,110
about,
uh,

923
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,770
on the flight that I think is important
to bring up.

924
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,820
Remember when there was this talk about
the state monument or the National

925
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:18,210
Monument in Utah and a Patagonia put
that thing on their page.

926
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:20,010
The president stole your land.
Yeah.

927
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Explain what actually happened because
it's not what everybody thinks it is.

928
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:28,500
And,
and Rinella said it best if you say the

929
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,070
president stole your land,
you're not being accurate with your

930
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,570
words.
That's not what happened.

931
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,463
It was

932
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,070
Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I
made and that there was efforts by

933
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,200
saying the present sold your land form.
What I've heard,

934
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,010
it resulted in a 15% increase in
business for them.

935
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:47,920
So it worked great.
But with the truth is,

936
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,920
is a lot of people felt like Obama when
he,

937
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:55,921
before he left office did um,
and overreach on the national monument

938
00:40:56,351 --> 00:41:00,010
protection.
And so there's protecting the national

939
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:04,750
monument and then which has a certain
area he protected,

940
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,990
he wanted,
it encompassed 2 million acres in that

941
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,560
national monument designation,
which seems excessive.

942
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,590
What Zinky says,
the secretary of Interior,

943
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,780
he went in there and he said,
that's an excessive,

944
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,570
that's an overreach.
I want to scale it back to what it was

945
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:20,380
before Obama did and

946
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,570
did that.
Now why is it excessive though?

947
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,840
This is what gets confusing to people.
People think that protecting land is

948
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:26,920
never accessive,
right?

949
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:29,950
What he wants to do is make sure people
have access and what,

950
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,250
and it's like,
okay,

951
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,310
so what's the difference between the Wa
the way it is

952
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,040
under Obama and the way it is under
Zinky?

953
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,460
It'll be Zinky scale it back to what it
was before,

954
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,880
which that would be,
it's still national forest still federal

955
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:46,760
land.
But you'd be able to,

956
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,050
and I'm not sure if it,
if it was wilderness or how the access

957
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,740
would be w,
but what Zinky would say is that like I

958
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,540
would be able to go into the land all
the time,

959
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,690
that 2 million acres,
because I might be considered by some to

960
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:00,890
be elite,
you know,

961
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:04,820
because I can walk for 20 miles.
Not Everybody in the United States can

962
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:07,580
walk 20 miles to get somewhere.
So they want to put road systems.

963
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,100
There's road systems already,
systems already,

964
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,440
but wants to maintain the roads.
So,

965
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:17,060
but if it was a national monument,
right then no road system.

966
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,270
It's like what is the difference that I
think the road systems would be gated

967
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,770
off and it'd be walking,
walking on foot track traffic only

968
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,650
instead of access through the roads.

969
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,630
Now why did Obama make it 2 million
acres and close off the roads?

970
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:34,350
I'm not sure.
So it's still federal land.

971
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:39,230
So it's not like the government sold the
land off now and no mining permits have

972
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,650
been issued and there's no plans to
drill or anything like that?

973
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,280
No.
When I,

974
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,340
when I looked that up because I was
unsure about it and I talked with Zinky

975
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,960
about it just because it's like,
you know,

976
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,990
I'm learning all this as we go also.
And I was concerned when when I read the

977
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,400
president's told your Atlanta,
I'm like,

978
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,380
what's this about?
Um,

979
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,880
and so,
uh,

980
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,600
what,
what it is is what he,

981
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,690
what zinc he wants to do is he wants to
just make sure people have not all

982
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,760
abilities.
Cause it's not like we want roads on

983
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,990
every mountain but have access to two
national forests.

984
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,810
So people that can drive in four by
fours,

985
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,060
you know,
those little off unexisting.

986
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,290
Yeah,
on existing roads and it's just like

987
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,570
national forest now,
national force now has roads,

988
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,620
right,
right.

989
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,770
Designated wilderness areas.
Because then I talked about that too.

990
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,851
I'm like,
well,

991
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,860
okay,
I understand.

992
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,990
I understand access.
I said,

993
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,820
that's great.
I want people to be able to enjoy the

994
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:38,540
great outdoors also.
But I also grew up hunting the Eagle cap

995
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:41,900
wilderness,
which is Oregon's largest wilderness

996
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:44,630
area,
356,000 acres of no roads.

997
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,790
And I don't want roads in there.
I don't want access in the middle of the

998
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,910
heart of that wilderness because some of
the most pristine,

999
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:55,730
beautiful country in the lower 48 I like
it like that.

1000
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:59,570
So we still need to build to protect
those areas.

1001
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,960
But this wasn't in this one.
This is bears ears and,

1002
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,480
and Utah.
This wasn't changing anything,

1003
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:08,560
opening up anything or this big
nefarious plan of,

1004
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,950
of mining and stripping everything out.
Right,

1005
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,860
right.
They were.

1006
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,320
But all I did is they went back to what
it was before.

1007
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,920
And at that time when our research that
there had been no mining permits,

1008
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:21,420
that from what I understand is there is
no mineral,

1009
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,060
there's not an,
there's minerals in there,

1010
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:28,061
but not enough to warrant going in there
and setting up a full mural extraction

1011
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,350
mine.
So the building,

1012
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:32,070
the reason that they changed

1013
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,670
the distinction is to allow people to
have more access to that wilderness

1014
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,620
through roads that already exists.
It wouldn't be wilderness.

1015
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,910
It'd be national forest.
Okay.

1016
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:39,840
The federal lands.
Yeah.

1017
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,510
So why,
why the uproar then?

1018
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,870
Like why is everybody so confused?
Is it a lack of communication?

1019
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,680
Is it a lack of understanding about what
the difference in the distinctions of

1020
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:50,520
the two things are?

1021
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,340
Uh,
it,

1022
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,390
it's just creating a,
you know,

1023
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:56,040
a negative narrative.
It's sane.

1024
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,100
It's something changed,
you know,

1025
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,340
Obama had at this way,
uh,

1026
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,500
Zinky scaled it back,
that right there.

1027
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,460
It's like,
why?

1028
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,190
What's going on?
Not really doing the research about,

1029
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,560
he's not,
he's just putting it back to what it was

1030
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:12,350
because he thought that it was an
overreach by Obama.

1031
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,430
So it's just,
you know,

1032
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,950
these,
these outfits,

1033
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,260
they're in business.
Um,

1034
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,960
you know,
if everything's going good,

1035
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,360
there's really no reason for people to
get fired up and contribute money.

1036
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,740
You know,
some of these,

1037
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,230
some of these it's political in some
respects,

1038
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:31,400
businesses,
political.

1039
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,190
Um,
it's

1040
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,100
very cynical though.
I,

1041
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,270
I see what you're saying,
but I think that really what's going on

1042
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,480
is people are very concerned and they
see any movement check,

1043
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,660
concern.
Yeah.

1044
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:46,140
But even the businesses like Patagonia's
businesses about the outdoors,

1045
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:49,370
that's their whole business.
So they see anything that's changed in

1046
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,030
the trump administration,
especially in,

1047
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:54,600
in the beginning when it came in,
people were really worried about them in

1048
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,560
terms of environmental concerns,
right?

1049
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,440
Because they had opened up offshore
drilling.

1050
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:00,870
They had done a lot of things that
people were really freaked out about.

1051
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,910
They had opened up,
what was the area,

1052
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Jamie in Alaska where they were going to
open up drilling that was near a salmon

1053
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:11,730
runs that people were very,
very concerned about.

1054
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:17,270
They're were concerned about the idea of
money above nature like and then me to

1055
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,840
right.
And who's making that money?

1056
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:19,710
You're not making money.

1057
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,250
I'm not making any of that money.
So someone else is going to make money

1058
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:27,480
off of what's supposed to be our land
and our public land,

1059
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,450
which you and I could maybe go,
even though you don't like salmon,

1060
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,760
we could go salmon fishing in this land.
Well,

1061
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:37,620
it could get fucked up by someone else
making billions of dollars in oil or

1062
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,440
natural gas or whatever the fuck we do.
If they contaminate that.

1063
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,430
I don't want that.
No,

1064
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,450
I don't want,
you don't want that either.

1065
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,370
And the people from Patagonia,
you don't want that either.

1066
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,950
So when they see something like this
come up there,

1067
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:49,050
red flags go up.
They want to get people outraged.

1068
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:51,750
They want to get people activated
because they think that they might be a

1069
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:54,480
chance that if you protest enough,
you can stop something like this

1070
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,410
happening before it does.
Because if you do look at like what

1071
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:02,520
happened in Alaska with that big oil
spill in the 80s or what happened with

1072
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:05,970
the BP oil spill in the Gulf coast,
like that shit's devastating.

1073
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,950
Yeah.
When something like that does happen,

1074
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,020
someone else is profiting making fucking
billions of dollars while our,

1075
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,500
our planet that we all share is getting
fucked up.

1076
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,620
You're not making a nickel off of it.
I'm not making a nickel off of it.

1077
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,510
They're making billions of dollars and
they're fucking up the land and by the

1078
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,430
government,
by trump or anybody else,

1079
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:29,680
whoever's opening it up,
giving them access to drill,

1080
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:29,980
right

1081
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,770
to do all this thing,
you open up the possibility of ruining

1082
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,760
something.
That's amazing.

1083
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,370
Well.
So there's always going to be a balance

1084
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:37,030
though.
There's,

1085
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,890
you can't just say,
okay,

1086
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:41,170
nobody can drive past this point
forever.

1087
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,660
You know what I mean?
There's always so,

1088
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,670
but you're saying that about the Eagle
cap wilderness,

1089
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,070
you don't want them,
there's gotta be areas,

1090
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,620
there's gotta be areas we have to
protect wilderness areas.

1091
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:54,190
But for example,
where we've elk hunting in Colorado,

1092
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,050
right?
Big Bowls,

1093
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:59,740
awesome elk hunting.
There's natural gas wells all over,

1094
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,120
right?
That's great.

1095
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:01,990
Elk Hunting.
Yeah,

1096
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:03,130
they've got,
there's a bowel.

1097
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,761
They're not,
yeah,

1098
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,660
they're not fucking it up.
So yeah,

1099
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,810
I don't want things wiped out in a,
in a huge mineral extraction mine where

1100
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,810
there's used to be beautiful,
whatever,

1101
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,670
right.
Don't want that.

1102
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,320
But ever is it a polluted right now?
But you can't just say,

1103
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:19,090
we're not doing anything anywhere.

1104
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,000
It doesn't work.
So there can be a balance just like

1105
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,190
where are we have hunted in Colorado.
There can be a balance,

1106
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:26,890
but the real concern that the average
person has,

1107
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:29,530
me included is that someone is going to
profit.

1108
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,820
And by doing that we're where it's not
going to benefit you or anybody.

1109
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:36,610
We know it's going to fuck it up for
everybody else.

1110
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,070
Yeah.
That's the real concern.

1111
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,041
For sure.
I know.

1112
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,680
That's why I've tried to,
you know,

1113
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,520
that's what I've wanted to be involved.
Like I'm on that council,

1114
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:48,670
which has nothing to do with public
lands in North America,

1115
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,340
but it's given me a way to get in there
and try to learn more.

1116
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,520
That's all I'm trying to do.
But you also were involved with it when

1117
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:59,521
Jason Chaffetz had that proposal in Utah
to sell off public land,

1118
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,250
public land.
You were one of the people that sat down

1119
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:05,200
with him and got his take on it.

1120
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,150
And ultimately because the outcry from
people who love the outdoors and hunters

1121
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:11,770
and fishermen,
that was stopped.

1122
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,510
Yeah,
it was very interesting.

1123
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,820
And that Jason,
he took a lot of shit,

1124
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,910
but he seems like a very reasonable guy.
I think so too.

1125
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:20,440
It's um,
you know,

1126
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:22,720
he's out of politics now.
What is he doing?

1127
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,400
He's on Fox News.
Oh,

1128
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,900
he's a correspondent.
Yeah.

1129
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,801
Yeah.
He's so,

1130
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:30,070
he's completely,
he was a congressman out of Utah and I

1131
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:33,130
went back to DC and talk to talk to him.
That was hr six,

1132
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:38,131
22 and that was,
they wanted to sell what they determined

1133
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:40,660
disposable public land.
And I'm like,

1134
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:41,530
okay,
wait a second.

1135
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,790
Who says what's disposable?
Cause what's disposable to you?

1136
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:48,430
Might not be to me.
Maybe it's a great hunting area.

1137
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,810
So I didn't really,
like,

1138
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,410
there wasn't really a way to determine
what was disposable.

1139
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,120
That's what caught my attention and
other,

1140
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,630
not just mine,
but even people like Steve Rinella in a

1141
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:02,800
lot of people in a loop and in the know.
And I got advice from,

1142
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,750
um,
let's see,

1143
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,120
Randy Nuber,
stever Nela,

1144
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,000
Joel Webster at the,
uh,

1145
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,241
uh,
Theater,

1146
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,590
Roosevelt concert,
uh,

1147
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,790
conservation conservation program.
All those guys are really experts in the

1148
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,890
field.
Back country hunters and anglers.

1149
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,280
I didn't talk to them.
I did was people were super active,

1150
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,490
right?
Getting people to complain and protest

1151
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,830
this.
And so that one that I did get a chance

1152
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,430
to go back there and I did a podcast

1153
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,640
with a [inaudible] and yeah,
he pulled it.

1154
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,050
It was gone.
Never happen.

1155
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,950
But yes,
that's,

1156
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,250
I mean we just need to be educated on it
and I just don't like the,

1157
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,800
the,
I dunno without that education jumping,

1158
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,200
jumping in on the bandwagon and saying,
yeah,

1159
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:47,870
the president stole my land.
It's like what is that even true?

1160
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,691
Well,
you know,

1161
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:52,020
I always defer to Rinella when it comes
to things like this because he's so well

1162
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:54,210
versed in it.
So when he said that you're not being

1163
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:56,640
accurate with your words,
I had to look into it deeper,

1164
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:58,920
but I didn't really understand it
totally until I was talking to you and

1165
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:02,730
you were explaining to me the
distinction between how it was before

1166
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:07,731
Obama was in office at Obama changed and
then bringing it back to how it was

1167
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:09,570
before.
So it's still federal land.

1168
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,230
No one's sold it off and it's not,
it's just giving people more access to

1169
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,450
roads,
but amazing how when something like that

1170
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:18,810
happens,
this is gigantic outcry and everybody

1171
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:19,660
freaks out.
Yeah.

1172
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,030
It's uh,
it's confusing.

1173
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,200
It can be confusing cause I'll read two
different things and I'll be like,

1174
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,880
God,
what is it this or is it that's going

1175
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:28,750
on?
I don't know.

1176
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,860
Yeah.
So that's where I,

1177
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,813
you know,
when people say,

1178
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,370
oh well Zinky he was lying to your face.
I'm like,

1179
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:34,570
ah,
I don't know,

1180
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,433
maybe

1181
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,480
on video.
You had doubt it.

1182
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,960
I don't,
he doesn't seem like that guy.

1183
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,330
He,
he seems like he's a straight shooter.

1184
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,730
You know,
I asked him about,

1185
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:49,210
he was getting beat up because the
national parks advisory board wouldn't,

1186
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,690
he wouldn't meet with them.
That's what it was.

1187
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,100
And so he got said,
you know,

1188
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,710
Zeke,
he doesn't care about national parks and

1189
00:51:57,711 --> 00:51:59,420
he won't meet with the advisory board.
And,

1190
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,900
and so I asked him about that because
that was in the news and that was just

1191
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:03,351
like,
man,

1192
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,480
he,
maybe he doesn't care about public land,

1193
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:05,991
you know,
I mean,

1194
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:09,340
I didn't know what was going on,
so I wanted to ask them about that.

1195
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,183
I'm like,
well,

1196
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,830
they resigned in protest because you
wouldn't meet with him.

1197
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:13,940
What was that?
And he goes,

1198
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:15,260
well yeah,
you're right.

1199
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,550
I wouldn't meet with them.
He goes,

1200
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,870
here's how it went.
I came in as secretary of interior and

1201
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,580
in charge of,
I don't know how many different

1202
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:24,560
councils,
just like the international one I'm on

1203
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,170
in this park advisory board,
that what we're talking about.

1204
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,300
And there's I think 200 and some that
he's,

1205
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,180
he really,
I think he over,

1206
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,380
I don't even thousands of employees,
billions of dollars.

1207
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,530
And all he asked was for these advisory
boards.

1208
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,420
He wanted,
um,

1209
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,170
a report written up that said,
what have you done in the last two

1210
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:47,480
years?
What are you working on now and what's

1211
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:51,380
your goals for the next two years?
Once you provide me with that report,

1212
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,480
then I'll get up to speed and I'll meet
with you.

1213
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,920
They never did it.
So he didn't meet with them and that was

1214
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:58,601
it.
That said,

1215
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,130
the story was he,
he wouldn't meet with them and they

1216
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:04,850
resigned in protest,
but the other half of the story was he

1217
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:08,480
asked him to do something so he could
get up to speed and be educated on

1218
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:10,930
what's going on.
And he never supplied it.

1219
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:16,350
Well if they are the typical government
employees and what is the typical

1220
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,420
government employee?
Incompetent.

1221
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,280
Lazy.
I'm a government,

1222
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,200
but what are we typical?
Oh,

1223
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,560
what do people think of,
what do people think of,

1224
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,480
they think of incompetent,
lazy,

1225
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,700
entitled bureaucrats and they've got
this job and like all of a sudden he's

1226
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:39,750
asking them to provide,
not just tell them what they've done,

1227
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:44,430
but tell them what they're going to do
and provide like a framework for the

1228
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:45,600
future.
That makes,

1229
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,710
that's a lot of work.
Yeah.

1230
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,570
When someone's a lazy fuck if he was
just kind of half ass in your job,

1231
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,460
it's just showing up.
And I'm not saying they are.

1232
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,330
Yeah.
I don't know.

1233
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,950
I didn't know him.
Also,

1234
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:59,700
they might have resented him for
whatever their preconceived notions of

1235
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,820
who he is coming into this job.
And they were,

1236
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,110
I don't know if all 12 of them,
I think there's 12 I don't,

1237
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,530
but I think they were all democrat.
Oh son of a bitches.

1238
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,630
So I mean obviously he's a Republican.

1239
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,110
He's,
he's gone unpaid volunteers also unpaid

1240
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:17,530
run paid volunteers.
Yeah.

1241
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,140
And that's,
I'm,

1242
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,150
I'm an unpaid volunteer on that council.
It's like you don't do this for money.

1243
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:23,040
You do it to make a difference.
Yeah.

1244
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,740
But if they're going to be a volunteer,
even if there are unpaid volunteer and

1245
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,470
if he asks you to have a plan,
you should probably have a plan.

1246
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,460
Yeah.
Otherwise,

1247
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:30,780
why have,
why are you doing it?

1248
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:34,230
Because I guarantee you there's someone
out there that would have a plan.

1249
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,420
Yeah.
And especially when it comes to

1250
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:40,350
something that's important as national
parks and public land,

1251
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,240
things that are like really dear and
important to people is this,

1252
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,440
this is something that you,
you know,

1253
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,570
you want to have whoever these
volunteers are,

1254
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:50,970
if you're going to appoint them,
you want to have the best ones for the

1255
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:51,810
job.
Right.

1256
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,750
So it's asking someone to write a plan
up and that's,

1257
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,830
if that's the only reason.

1258
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,500
See it's tough because we don't have
their take on it.

1259
00:54:58,830 --> 00:54:59,250
Well,
I've,

1260
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,120
I read what they wrote and what did they
write?

1261
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:04,160
You just said that he wouldn't meet with
him and whatever.

1262
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,690
So he wouldn't read,
meet with them until they did what he

1263
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,040
asked.
They didn't say that.

1264
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,900
He told me that,
but that's what he says.

1265
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,610
Yeah.
Well that makes sense.

1266
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,050
Yeah.
I mean,

1267
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,450
I'm kind of in his camp,
that's a,

1268
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:18,180
if we're looking at it 100% accurately.
Yeah,

1269
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,860
no.
And he told me face to face,

1270
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:21,000
that's what happened.
So I mean,

1271
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,991
you know,
you can say,

1272
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:23,100
well,
I don't believe anybody,

1273
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,020
I don't believe,
I don't believe what you just told me.

1274
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,150
I don't believe that at some point you
have to be like,

1275
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,490
man,
it seemed like he was telling me the

1276
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:31,530
truth and I believe it.
And that makes sense.

1277
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,130
Yeah.

1278
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,860
It does make sense that they would not
want to do that,

1279
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,300
you know?
Yeah.

1280
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,540
What have you been working on?
Well,

1281
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,630
chuck,
my living room going for his book.

1282
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:43,710
When I'm at work,
sometimes we get pine cones.

1283
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah.
So I mean,

1284
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,700
to me he seems like hardworking,
pretty demanding.

1285
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,310
Um,
but he cares.

1286
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,380
I mean,
he's in there trying to,

1287
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,430
so the secretary of interior before the
St key,

1288
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,900
I had no w I'm like,
what?

1289
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,310
I don't even know what that is.
You know,

1290
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:05,070
so that's what,
that's what kind of involvement that

1291
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:09,150
person had in hunter,
in the lives of hunting.

1292
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,540
People like me are fishermen.
And so when I didn't even know who it

1293
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,670
wasn't,
come to find out her name was sally

1294
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,270
jewel,
who was Obama's appointee before trump

1295
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:19,990
appointed zinky.
Um,

1296
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,040
so I like the fact that zinc,
he's at shot show.

1297
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,130
He's had me out

1298
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,950
there.
I'm on this council is at least I have a

1299
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,470
seat at the table to say,
and I don't know,

1300
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:32,890
I might get kicked off this council.
I might never get invited back because

1301
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,960
I'll ask him,
so what's going on with this?

1302
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,150
But right now I have a seat at the
table.

1303
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,320
So whatever it's,
it's,

1304
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,290
I,
I consider that a win.

1305
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,300
At least I can try to find out and
learn.

1306
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,583
Yeah.
It's,

1307
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,690
it's,
it's an interesting thing because

1308
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:50,740
everything that I've heard about him
that I've read in the media,

1309
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,380
uh,
unless I'm reading like a hunting

1310
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,760
website or something like that.
Yeah.

1311
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,270
Everything I've heard is like that it's
a horror show that he's bringing on all

1312
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:03,271
these trophy hunters and there was an
article equating you would being a,

1313
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,620
a trophy hunter and that this council
that he's put together is just this

1314
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,960
disgusting sort of justification for
trophy hunting and that they're only

1315
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,880
putting it together so that wealthy
people can bring back their elephants

1316
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:16,780
that they shoot in Africa.

1317
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,620
Yeah.
Yup.

1318
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,150
I've read that too.
I mean,

1319
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,500
for me,
and I'm not,

1320
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,240
you know,
I've never killed an elephant.

1321
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:24,380
I've never killed a lion,
um,

1322
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,340
in every purse.
So even the people on the council that

1323
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:29,800
have,
they do care about animals,

1324
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,050
they care.
They're volunteers just like on the

1325
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,790
parks advisory board and there they want
to make a positive difference.

1326
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,830
You know,
I know every person on that.

1327
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,880
I don't know every person personally,
but I know they care about the people of

1328
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:46,600
Africa and that's why they understand
how it works.

1329
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,550
They've been there,
they've seen it.

1330
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,370
Um,
the guys who I've hunted with,

1331
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:55,600
their personally awesome people,
hardworking people.

1332
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,480
Um,
the,

1333
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,620
the one guy on my last trip there to
Tanzania,

1334
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,580
his daughter was in college and he'd
been a professional hunter over there

1335
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:08,170
for over 20 or 30 years and she was
going to college now getting their

1336
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:08,890
degree.

1337
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,960
I mean it's,
explain with a professional hunter over

1338
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:12,550
there is not what we think about it over
here.

1339
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,540
When we think of overhear a professional
hunter be a guy hunts.

1340
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,030
Oh that's right.
Essentially a guide,

1341
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,700
a guide.
They call them Ph is or professional

1342
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:24,970
hunters.
So I mean because of hunting,

1343
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:29,050
he's able to send his,
his daughter to college and I mean,

1344
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,200
and now that's gone.
Yeah.

1345
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,510
I mean I'm not saying every person,
a lot of them,

1346
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,510
a lot of them and they're not getting
any better because right now,

1347
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,360
so that policy,
trump said,

1348
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,600
well where are we going to review it on
a case by case basis?

1349
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,120
So he didn't say,
he didn't say,

1350
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,850
okay,
it's legal now everybody can hunt and go

1351
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:51,280
and bring their trophies back.
He said we'll review each one on a case

1352
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:54,580
by case basis.
So that still doesn't make it that good

1353
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,990
for hunter because they say,
well,

1354
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,180
I'm not going to book a hunt if I don't
know for a fact.

1355
00:58:58,181 --> 00:58:59,830
I can bring my trophy back.
Yeah.

1356
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,020
So it's not really that much better.
Well,

1357
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,420
what you just saying,
that freaks people out.

1358
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,550
Like trophy,
like you saying trophy.

1359
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,670
It's an animal.
It's an animal's life and you got to

1360
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,640
bring it back.
Yeah,

1361
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:13,630
it's that that does,
that distinction is one of the things

1362
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,700
that triggers people well,
trophy.

1363
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,200
So I mean,
I see heads on your wall right here.

1364
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,150
Yeah,
that's a trophy.

1365
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,040
But also you ate the meat of that elk.
Oh

1366
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,220
yeah.
So I mean it's not like you can't be

1367
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:28,880
both a trophy hunter and hunt for meat
that understand that,

1368
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:31,970
but most people are not blink bringing
back lion meat.

1369
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,680
No,
they're not.

1370
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,220
Right.
But it's also not mutually exclusive to

1371
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:40,340
be a trophy hunter and eat the meat or
on the elephants.

1372
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,710
Those,
none of that meat is going to waste on

1373
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:43,080
an l.

1374
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,390
That's true.
That's what it was.

1375
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,950
Don't understand their orphans are
actually,

1376
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:47,970
they actually tastes good.

1377
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,250
There was a documentary just,
yeah,

1378
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,110
I haven't had elephant.
I mean I've had,

1379
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,830
I've had crocodile and I've haven't had
lion over there,

1380
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,540
but uh,
um,

1381
00:59:58,810 --> 00:59:59,740
I had,
um,

1382
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,240
that meat is me and the villagers that
live there,

1383
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,320
man,
it's,

1384
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,790
they,
they need it.

1385
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:11,560
And there was a documentary on CNN
recently called trophy and I remember

1386
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:15,220
there's a scene in there where the
hunter shot an elephant and it wasn't a

1387
01:00:15,221 --> 01:00:18,610
big one.
And the people were making fun of him

1388
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:19,870
for shooting.
They're like,

1389
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,660
he's this small,
they wanted a big elephant with lots of

1390
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:23,494
meat,
you know?

1391
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,370
Okay.
So he,

1392
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:28,120
he got his quote trophy.
They wanted more meat.

1393
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,570
So it was like you can have both and
that,

1394
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:33,490
that's,
I'll say trophy hunting because guys

1395
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:35,320
aren't going over there for the meat.
I get it.

1396
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,240
I mean,
that's not why you go to Africa,

1397
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,050
you're going for the trophy,
but also that the meat isn't going to

1398
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:41,580
waste.

1399
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,800
Yeah.
The meat is going to the villagers.

1400
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:45,030
It's not like they're going to let it
rot.

1401
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,040
And these people,
I've seen it,

1402
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,720
I've seen videos of it.
It's crazy.

1403
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:52,470
They show up with baskets on their head
filled with elephant meet and they're

1404
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:55,140
carrying around like 150 pounds of meat
on their head.

1405
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,480
Yeah.
I mean it's really nuts when you've

1406
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:02,481
watched these people just run in and get
chunks of this elephant and they need

1407
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:03,851
it.
It's,

1408
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:06,100
it's really important protein for them.
Yeah.

1409
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,050
The solution is very,
very complicated.

1410
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:15,270
Africa is such an enormous place and the
poverty is so intense and the options

1411
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,460
are so limited for these people.
There's,

1412
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,860
this is not like a simple like ban the
trophy hunting and the animals will live

1413
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:24,930
peacefully in the forest to tweet,
tweet,

1414
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,764
bird,
bird.

1415
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,450
That's not what's going to happen.
Dies.

1416
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,300
Yeah.
It's not just that everything over there

1417
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:31,710
is really complicated.

1418
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:35,130
And I always tell people to watch the
Louis through documentary.

1419
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:38,970
He did a thing on this hunting thing in
Africa and he was over there for a long

1420
01:01:38,971 --> 01:01:43,770
time and when he was over there you got
a sense cause he's Louis through is a

1421
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,590
really fascinating,
uh,

1422
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,640
British documentary guy and you know,
he,

1423
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,740
he asked fantastic questions and he's,
he's really polite and he like kind of

1424
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:55,380
pastors them over and over and over
again until it gets to the heart of the

1425
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:57,720
matter.
But at the end of the documentary you

1426
01:01:57,721 --> 01:02:02,340
realize like this is complex.
This is not as simple as hey,

1427
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,550
these mean people want to go over there
and kill animals and treat them as

1428
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:08,370
objects.
The whole place is kind of,

1429
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:11,790
it's very,
very confused.

1430
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,530
Like it's a,
it's a mess.

1431
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,080
There's

1432
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,260
a,
there's a video right now,

1433
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,580
Jamie could probably find it,
but so I think there's three hunters and

1434
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:21,930
they're over there and I can't remember
if they're,

1435
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:25,320
they have bows and arrows or spears,
but what they do,

1436
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:30,000
this lion kills an animal for them to
get meat.

1437
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,400
They run in there and chase off the loan
and chase off the lion and steal the

1438
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:37,950
meat.
I seen the cut cut the leg off the,

1439
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,390
I can't remember,
it was a will to be as a,

1440
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:42,210
can't remember what it was,
cut the leg off of it and get it out of

1441
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:46,860
there before the lions because lions,
if you run out of lion sometimes they'll

1442
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:47,694
be like,
whoa,

1443
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,730
that's weird and I'll back off.
And then before they figured out

1444
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:51,810
there'll be like,
wait a second,

1445
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,540
I can kill you.
Then they'll go in that,

1446
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,840
in that hesitation time they tried to
cut off that link and get out of there.

1447
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:03,110
So you know when you're here in America
making decisions for people like that,

1448
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,430
it's like,
ah,

1449
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,590
I got a problem with that.
Yeah.

1450
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,640
Yeah.
You will,

1451
01:03:09,641 --> 01:03:13,620
you said makes a lot of sense that it's
a first world perspective on a third

1452
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:17,400
world problem where people are literally
starving to death.

1453
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:17,700
Yeah.
They're,

1454
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,820
they're trying to figure out how to get,
they need to survive.

1455
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,570
They need protein.
That protein is like gold back there.

1456
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,700
Yeah.
It's um,

1457
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,290
yeah,
this is it.

1458
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,360
This is the video and this is on the
discovery channel.

1459
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,860
We can't show it,
but these people are running in the

1460
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,260
human planet.
If you want to watch it,

1461
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,770
I think it's on Netflix or,
okay.

1462
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:37,830
A couple of places.
Yeah,

1463
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,940
it's pretty intense.
So the lions,

1464
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:41,820
the lions basically covered with blood.

1465
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,480
It's crazy.
I mean they,

1466
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:49,170
the lions just don't know what to do.
They see these people walking out them

1467
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:52,440
with look like weapons and they just
take a chance and bolt.

1468
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:55,140
But what a fucking chance that is.
Yeah.

1469
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,070
Yeah.
So they got,

1470
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:59,550
those are bows and arrows.
It looks like these things I know

1471
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:02,190
staring at them and they're super
intense.

1472
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,930
What's that video?
It's a title Jamie.

1473
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,350
Oh,
stealing.

1474
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,980
Stealing meat from lions.
Yeah.

1475
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,090
Check it out.
So I mean,

1476
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,050
until I,
I don't,

1477
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:14,430
I'm obviously,
not everybody's going to go do this,

1478
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,840
but you need to watch us just to get an
idea of how rough it is.

1479
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,040
It just,
you know,

1480
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,110
the,
the measures I'll take to get some

1481
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:23,670
protein.
Yeah.

1482
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,980
I mean,
that whole Cecil,

1483
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:30,981
the lion thing just created this uproar.
If you steal to kill and nobody is hurt,

1484
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,130
that's when you can relax.

1485
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,750
She says,
Christ.

1486
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:37,501
Yeah.
There,

1487
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:40,440
it goes to feel happy.
He goes with the hindquarter slung over

1488
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:41,420
their shoulders.
Yeah.

1489
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,100
And he's carried his family.
And so to me,

1490
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:48,510
you know,
hunters are vilified by a large majority

1491
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:53,511
of the population here was we've said
before nineties 96% of America eats meat

1492
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,080
and hunters are the ones out there
getting to themselves.

1493
01:04:58,081 --> 01:05:00,480
And like I remember that last buck I
killed,

1494
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,660
um,
and Lanai to care.

1495
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,360
I was like meticulous on taking care of
that meat.

1496
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,740
And as I,
I got it,

1497
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:10,200
the animal,
as I took the bladder out,

1498
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:15,260
I can't remember how what happened,
but like a drop of urine dropped on a

1499
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,160
tiny little piece of the Bacchae Ham.
And I was just like,

1500
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,890
what?
I was not happy.

1501
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,290
And because that meat is,
to me,

1502
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,660
it's everything.
It's everything for the hunt.

1503
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:29,350
And I was so disappointed in myself,
but I mean obviously the meat's still

1504
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:30,970
good,
but that I,

1505
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,610
I want to be perfect when I'm,
when I'm taking care of it.

1506
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,200
Meanwhile,
there's people that eat 96% of people

1507
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:42,970
eat meat and we throw away what's been,
what's been figured.

1508
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,240
40% of our food goes in the trash

1509
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,800
waste is insane.
This country.

1510
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:50,290
And I think Anthony Bordain just did a
documentary on it,

1511
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:51,940
right?
I don't think it's out yet,

1512
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:54,720
but he did a documentary on food waste.
So

1513
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,850
I'm worried about one little tiny piece
of me on an animal I killed and people

1514
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:05,500
who throw away 40% of of what they buy
into the garbage,

1515
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,120
they're judging me.

1516
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,690
Yeah,
well there's a lot of that out there,

1517
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:08,991
man.
It's,

1518
01:06:08,991 --> 01:06:11,210
it's real easy to be negative,
you know?

1519
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:12,180
And that's one thing,
like,

1520
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,050
like I said about put up my post about
Lanai.

1521
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,360
I just,
the solid or a couple of negative

1522
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:17,960
comments,
I'm like,

1523
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,540
am I even reading this stuff?
Like go have at it folks.

1524
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,040
Wait,
just walk away.

1525
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,810
How did you,
how did you know what they said?

1526
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:26,030
If he didn't read them?
Because I put it up and I saw it

1527
01:06:26,031 --> 01:06:27,980
immediately afterwards.
So you read it.

1528
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:33,030
I read like a half a second of it.
But my point is that people will be

1529
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:38,420
negative because it's easy to do.
Cause there are douchebags well they

1530
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:41,900
don't even look,
they're not even thinking it through.

1531
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,330
It's like you're fucking just like
killing animals.

1532
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:49,540
People like to just make a statement or
get a reaction or push a button or fuck

1533
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:51,440
with you.
They want,

1534
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:52,930
they want a reaction.
That's all it is.

1535
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:54,890
So you can do one of two things so you
could ignore it.

1536
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,250
You can interact with them and argue
with him back and forth.

1537
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,460
You could block the comments and all
those things are kind of fucked.

1538
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,830
Yeah,
just sucks.

1539
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,790
It's uh,
I've,

1540
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,850
I've got,
I've been pretty frustrated.

1541
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:10,570
I've whatever,
I'm not going to say I don't read them

1542
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:13,420
cause obviously I read them,
but I get frustrated.

1543
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,380
Man.
It's just hunting.

1544
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,300
I don't,
people just don't understand hunting

1545
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,800
because even hunters will say,
I'll say I don't enjoy the kill and I

1546
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:25,930
don't enjoy the kill.
I enjoy,

1547
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,100
um,
getting meat that I can feed my family

1548
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:30,620
myself.

1549
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,910
You don't enjoy the kill in that.
It's actually care.

1550
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,080
This is awesome.
But it is like,

1551
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,790
ah,
it's a relief.

1552
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,220
It feels good that your hard work paid
off.

1553
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:45,250
It feels good that all the ethical
consideration that you put into making a

1554
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:50,371
perfect shot is all worked out in the
amount of work that's involved in

1555
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:52,070
making,
you know,

1556
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:54,710
a 70 yard shot,
70 yards,

1557
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:57,470
a long fucking way to hit an animal
perfectly.

1558
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,920
And then to have it die in seconds and
then to get that meat,

1559
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,340
there's an enjoyment that comes out of,
there's a good feeling,

1560
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,970
but it's not like a,
it's not shooting a three pointer at the

1561
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:11,050
buzzer to win the championships and
everybody's jumping up in the air.

1562
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,110
It's not,
it's not fun.

1563
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:13,100
People will say,
well,

1564
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:14,990
hunting is killing is fun.
It's like,

1565
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,610
it's not fun.
It's not for me.

1566
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:18,620
It's not fun at all.
I,

1567
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:21,830
I killed two bucks,
made two perfect shots.

1568
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,370
They went,
um,

1569
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,090
not far.
We're down in seconds.

1570
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,810
And that was a huge relief to me.
That's why I do what I do every single

1571
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:31,040
day.
And like I said,

1572
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:36,460
I posted on it to be merciful and I
don't enjoy when I'm not as perfect as I

1573
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:40,760
want to be.
And I killed a bull last year in

1574
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:43,730
Colorado.
I was with Johnnie Hamilton,

1575
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:46,190
which,
you know johnny and he was back cow cone

1576
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:47,690
here at this bull,
comes up the hill,

1577
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:53,260
he stops at 15 yards and I hit him
perfect right behind the shoulder.

1578
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:55,250
It perfect.
He ran down,

1579
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,080
stopped at 30,
hesitated again.

1580
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,610
I already had another arrow on,
boom,

1581
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:01,280
hit him right beside the first show,
first hole.

1582
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:06,590
And I'm like that bull.
I was so convinced he was down and I was

1583
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:07,680
just like,
oh man,

1584
01:09:07,681 --> 01:09:08,750
not that.
Felt good.

1585
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:11,570
Got to in him,
perfect through the lungs.

1586
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,080
He's going to be done in seconds.
He wasn't done in seconds.

1587
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,270
And I have,
I don't know what happened,

1588
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,230
um,
it,

1589
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,890
whether it was testosterone because he's
coming off the hill,

1590
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,490
he's bugling.
He was super fired up so I don't know

1591
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:27,860
what was going on,
but I ended up,

1592
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:32,180
um,
it wasn't as quick and kill is what I

1593
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:35,750
have in my mind.
What a prepare for what I'm happy

1594
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:39,800
accepting.
And that in Johnny knows I wasn't happy.

1595
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,990
I was just like,
I was so disappointed.

1596
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,980
Um,
I dunno.

1597
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,700
Maybe,
maybe 20 minutes,

1598
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,440
20 minutes,
something like that.

1599
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,400
Wow.
That's crazy.

1600
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

1601
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,260
How's that possible?
I don't know.

1602
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,420
I have no idea.
So tough.

1603
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:01,460
And that's incredible.
Now I w it really bothered me.

1604
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:02,743
It,
it,

1605
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:03,860
it,
uh,

1606
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,020
it upset me.
I wasn't,

1607
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:06,390
I was

1608
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:08,220
disappointed with myself.
I was disowned.

1609
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:09,570
There's nothing you could've done
better.

1610
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,010
Right.
I don't know.

1611
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,840
I don't think you've made a perfect
shot.

1612
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,560
I felt like it was perfect,
but you know,

1613
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,040
if it's perfect to animals dead and in
10 seconds,

1614
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,220
so I don't know.
But when I watched it,

1615
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:25,190
I've killed a lot of bowls.
I've went through the process a lot.

1616
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,310
I would take those two shots on any
animal,

1617
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:32,240
any time and feel a hundred percent
confident he was going to go 50 yards.

1618
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,710
Um,

1619
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:38,240
this was something that I was really
concerned about when we filmed that

1620
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,040
underarmor hunt in,
uh,

1621
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:40,870
Utah.
Yeah.

1622
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,511
Cause I was like,
man,

1623
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:43,790
this is going to be on video.
This is,

1624
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,080
you know,
it's a,

1625
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,970
yeah.
Big Animal.

1626
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,900
You know,
it's,

1627
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,430
it's a,
it's a big deal.

1628
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,180
I want to make sure that this thing that
it's a perfect hit.

1629
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,961
Yeah.
You know,

1630
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:58,961
and so the feeling of relief that I got
when I saw that it was a perfect pass

1631
01:10:59,361 --> 01:11:03,020
through and that the era that he was
bleeding and po both sides in the exact

1632
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:06,020
spot I wanted to hit and to watch him
wobble way,

1633
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:09,350
like an very unsteady legs walked to
about 20,

1634
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:11,570
30 yards and then tipped over.
Yeah.

1635
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,980
That's an amazing of relief.
But

1636
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,210
it doesn't feel good.
It doesn't feel good.

1637
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:17,220
It's like,
no,

1638
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:20,250
it's not fun.
Now there's a feeling of like

1639
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:24,930
accomplishment but also of remorse and
they're tied in together.

1640
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,160
Yeah.
It's uh,

1641
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,700
um,
and for the animal,

1642
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:33,090
like with a bow with a perfect shot,
you know,

1643
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,190
on,
on these bucks that I killed,

1644
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:37,200
they didn't know I was there.
So it was just,

1645
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,670
I know they didn't feel,
it wasn't like there's a,

1646
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,030
a rifle report and bone shattering and
they're dying from trauma.

1647
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:47,310
They're dying from hemorrhage,
like your bowl that in Utah,

1648
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:51,120
that took off his legs were wobbly
because of blood pressure.

1649
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,220
He had a blood pressure loss because of
hemorrhage.

1650
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,290
That's not painful,
you know?

1651
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,540
Um,
and so that's,

1652
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,980
that was a perfect scenario.
That's what we prepare for and that's,

1653
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:05,760
that's our goal.
And when it doesn't work like that,

1654
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:06,570
that bothers me.

1655
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:11,570
And so when people chime in on your page
or on my page and these uneducated

1656
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,841
comments trying to turn to tell me how I
feel or why I do what I do,

1657
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,980
man,
that does not make me happy.

1658
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,250
No.
But I understand it's the ability to

1659
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:27,420
comment on things is a very strange
thing because the ability to talk to

1660
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:31,020
people is very different.
It's very difficult to have an audience

1661
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,870
to sit in front of someone that,
uh,

1662
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,450
you know,
pick a person,

1663
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:39,300
a famous like Morgan Freeman to sit down
across running.

1664
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,790
And why pick Morgan Freeman?
It's very hard to,

1665
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,910
it's very hard to be in front of him.
Yeah.

1666
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,610
To be able to sit down and talk to
someone and to look them in the eyes.

1667
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:50,430
You would choose your words properly and
you'd have a conversation.

1668
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,710
But if you just like,
what's on your face,

1669
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:54,050
bro,
like you just,

1670
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,770
what's all those black spots on your
face?

1671
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,890
You dumb fuck,
you can just put that on twitter and

1672
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,570
it's easy.
It's easy.

1673
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:04,230
And that's so it's a human being
communicating with another human being

1674
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:07,020
at saying something insulting and it's
so incredibly easy to do.

1675
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,340
It's too,
it's too easy.

1676
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:10,920
We think.
So we don't really understand what we're

1677
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:12,900
doing with that.
And when it comes to hunting,

1678
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:19,070
there's something about the fact that 90
I think it's 97% actually eat,

1679
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:24,441
meet somewhere in the range and maybe 3%
do it themselves.

1680
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,770
3% like what do you think it is
nationwide?

1681
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,290
If you had to pick nationwide,
like how many people nationwide,

1682
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,060
uh,
killed their own food?

1683
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,950
Is it even 5%?
Uh,

1684
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,110
okay.
Well there's,

1685
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,060
I know,
because I looked this up because I was

1686
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,130
curious how,
how many people I'm reaching on

1687
01:13:41,131 --> 01:13:45,480
instagram?
So there's 13 million licensed hunters.

1688
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:47,860
13 million.
How?

1689
01:13:47,861 --> 01:13:49,640
13 million.
How many isn't there?

1690
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,230
300 and some how many people are in
America?

1691
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:55,200
I think it's three 20 is it three 20
somewhere in the range.

1692
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:56,370
320 million.
Yeah.

1693
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:59,280
So what does that under 5%?
Yeah.

1694
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:00,780
Yeah.
It's not a lot.

1695
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:05,700
It's a very small amount.
And how many of them are only eating

1696
01:14:05,701 --> 01:14:07,220
that?
How many of them are,

1697
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,040
are are spending so much time hunting
that they can live off of the

1698
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,570
meat that they kill themselves?
Yeah.

1699
01:14:13,571 --> 01:14:15,540
Only now it's one,

1700
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,510
maybe 1%.
That's why even I saw people,

1701
01:14:18,511 --> 01:14:22,950
like we had the picture of your freezer
back here fold filled with meat and

1702
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:23,910
they're like,
you know,

1703
01:14:23,911 --> 01:14:26,490
saying you couldn't eat that.
And I thought you,

1704
01:14:26,491 --> 01:14:28,140
you know,
you're just killing what you need to

1705
01:14:28,141 --> 01:14:30,820
eat.
But so that's just some big,

1706
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,080
those people don't know what the fuck
they're talking about.

1707
01:14:33,081 --> 01:14:35,540
I do eat it,
I eat all of it and I'll go through that

1708
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:37,630
whole freezer and a few months and I get
him.

1709
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:38,480
I do a lot of my friends.

1710
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,510
That was the key is that I was going to
say is every guest that comes,

1711
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,840
you ask if they want game meat and they
take it on the fucking Mooch.

1712
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,640
He comes over here constantly is like,
okay,

1713
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:50,010
I need more steak meat.
Well,

1714
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,380
have you seen a lot of my friends?
Have you seen his body?

1715
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,330
He's neat.
She act monster spot.

1716
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,243
Right,
right.

1717
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,640
He's a beast.
So I was,

1718
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,140
I thought he ate steaks like all day
everyday.

1719
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,490
If you ask him,
he'll say he does.

1720
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,790
I eat elk quads,
all the,

1721
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,713
everything

1722
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,430
top to bottom.
But,

1723
01:15:08,431 --> 01:15:09,450
uh,
I mean I've,

1724
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:11,940
I give me to wait a lot of my friends
and they love it.

1725
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,920
It's like,
it's fucking hard to get off meat.

1726
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,813
Where are you going to get it?

1727
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:20,240
I see a lot of people send me messages
that they want to know what this whole

1728
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:22,780
elk meat things about,
so they want to be involved.

1729
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:25,990
They want to know where can I buy elk
because they don't hunt or they want to

1730
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:27,610
start hunting.
But uh,

1731
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,510
yeah,
one does.

1732
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:33,511
What we talked about when we loaded up
my dear in your freezer to phrase it is

1733
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,720
that,
you know,

1734
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:36,040
hunters,
our providers,

1735
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,530
it's a big,
uh,

1736
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,930
it feels good to be able to give people
that food.

1737
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,940
To me it's,
it's everything.

1738
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:48,330
It's either to feed my family or to give
my friends or not my extended family

1739
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,400
meet that I've harvested.
That is,

1740
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,280
that's,
to me,

1741
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:55,300
that's as good as it gets.

1742
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,050
Yeah.
I had a Michael Hunter in the podcast

1743
01:15:58,051 --> 01:16:00,210
recently.
He's the chef that runs that restaurant,

1744
01:16:00,211 --> 01:16:03,900
antelope antler in Toronto and they're
getting protested by vegans.

1745
01:16:03,901 --> 01:16:06,690
I gave him a bunch of meat and he cooked
it and put it up on instagram.

1746
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,880
And then he was like,
this is so awesome.

1747
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,300
And it made me feel so good to like look
at these delicious meals with this guy

1748
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,500
prepared who's a professional chef with
meat from an animal that I killed.

1749
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,980
I give away a lot of that meat,
but I eat it every day.

1750
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:24,030
I eat almost every day.
I eat some sort of game meat.

1751
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,170
Yeah.
If I'm home,

1752
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,000
that's what I eat.
Yeah.

1753
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,850
Well,
you know,

1754
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,270
we ate,
we ate a bunch in Lanai that as,

1755
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,560
what are those sticks call?

1756
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,323
Oh,
the uh,

1757
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:34,900
what,
uh,

1758
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,750
bob the butcher makes,
he calls him acts as Jax.

1759
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:40,570
Jax.
He makes like a pepperoni.

1760
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,220
Yeah.
Like a pepperoni out of a axis.

1761
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:44,530
Deer.
Sensational,

1762
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:48,340
sensational.
He's a really good butcher to like what

1763
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,590
he's done with all the cuts and labeled
them all.

1764
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:54,460
And it gives you an envelope that has
all of the recipes of how you should

1765
01:16:54,461 --> 01:16:56,340
cook each individual cut.
Yeah.

1766
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,590
That's awesome man.
Yeah,

1767
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:01,870
it makes me feel like I never saw any of
this when I was a kid.

1768
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:03,550
I grew up in the city.
I never,

1769
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,370
I used to fish,
I used to eat fish that I caught,

1770
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:10,160
but I never was involved in hunting at
all until I was in my forties so when

1771
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,420
I,
you know,

1772
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:16,100
I see comments from people that probably
grew up the way I grew up and they don't

1773
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:17,290
get it.
They never,

1774
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,040
they're never involved in it,
but yet they're eating meat.

1775
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,500
And it's just,
it's because no one's holding them

1776
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,190
accountable for what they're saying.
And it,

1777
01:17:24,191 --> 01:17:25,550
cause it's easy to say,
oh,

1778
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:27,270
you got a little dirt.
You want it to load.

1779
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,350
The animal got a little bit.
It's so common.

1780
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,990
So Domino's,
imagine if that's what it meant.

1781
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,700
Like if you have a little,
if you have a little deck,

1782
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:37,760
you just want to go out and kill,
it would be a lot of death out there.

1783
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,750
It's a lot of the little dicks and
Shell.

1784
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,470
I'm just to prove her wrong.

1785
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,800
Hey,
let's look at that.

1786
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,670
A bear attack.
The poor bastard.

1787
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,610
I forgot to do that.
Well,

1788
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:51,590
that was one of the weird things that we
were talking about.

1789
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:56,270
How warning graphic content man mauled
by a bear while taking a selfie with it.

1790
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,610
Go full screaming this please.
God is stupid.

1791
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:03,350
Fuck.
So this bear apparently was injured and

1792
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:07,910
this dumb ass in India decided he was
going to go and take a selfie with it.

1793
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:09,150
Oh,
in hitting it.

1794
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,371
Oh,
you stupid.

1795
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:12,380
Fuck.
I don't know.

1796
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,580
Oh No,
it's got the guy.

1797
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:14,900
That's why.
Oh it does.

1798
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,520
Yeah.
They're hitting it because it's got the

1799
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:18,890
guy.
He's already fucking this guy up.

1800
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,510
So that's a bear in India.
Yeah,

1801
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,670
they have barris.
Oh,

1802
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:24,650
look at it.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1803
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,740
That's not good.
No,

1804
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,860
that's,
he's almost free.

1805
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,760
Look that guys get Shitty Jujitsu.
We'll just got to do.

1806
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,321
Oh,
see,

1807
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:37,480
look at that right there.

1808
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:38,323
You're free,
Bro.

1809
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,920
You're free.
Oh,

1810
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:43,820
it's tearing his hand depart as you got
to shut this off at dogs.

1811
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,440
Dogs like work,
bark,

1812
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,993
bark,
bark.

1813
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,350
Oh man,
that's,

1814
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,270
yeah.
It's a shit way to go,

1815
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:51,470
folks.
God,

1816
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:56,471
that looks terrible.
Why did no one have a fucking gun?

1817
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:59,530
Does no one have a knife?
Does no one have a baseball bat and go

1818
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:00,740
clunk,
that fucking thing.

1819
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,450
And the head.
Nobody's doing anything.

1820
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
Yeah.
They're like,

1821
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,150
it's over.
We've lost him.

1822
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,420
Wow.
Yeah.

1823
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:10,460
Is that the bear
or the bear?

1824
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,700
Is that what it says?
I don't know why they would show it

1825
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:16,040
afterwards.
Just as water burger looks like.

1826
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,090
Yeah.
That's what,

1827
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,100
just some stupid video of a bear in a
zoo.

1828
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,370
Yeah.
Um,

1829
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,610
bad,
bad to take pictures of bears.

1830
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,400
It's a real common thing in yellowstone.
They have real issue with that.

1831
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:27,140
But people would try and get real close
to bears,

1832
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:28,130
take selfies with them.

1833
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,530
I've done that before.
Well,

1834
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,020
I think it's different.
You've done it.

1835
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:34,430
Why?
While bear hunting.

1836
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,310
Yeah.
But you've only done it with black

1837
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:38,060
bears.
Yeah.

1838
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,140
Like you'd never turn your back on
grizzly like down.

1839
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:40,420
No,
no,

1840
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:40,880
no,
no.

1841
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,800
But in black bear it's still still not
saved.

1842
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,160
I can say a smart at all.
It's definitely not.

1843
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,900
Um,
yeah,

1844
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,330
but it's,
uh,

1845
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,580
you know,
you can read bears.

1846
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,360
Bears have a personality or attitude
just like dogs.

1847
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,010
Yeah.
And so it's a,

1848
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,700
if there's an aggressive bear coming in,
probably not going to turn my back and

1849
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,850
yeah.
I have one dog that I will let my kids

1850
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,530
do.
My massive,

1851
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,980
my kids could ride that dog.

1852
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,110
They can do anything.
That dog is a loving dog.

1853
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,550
He loves everybody.
Yeah.

1854
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,650
You know,
and then I have another dog that's a

1855
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:16,790
Shibu Ino bulldog.
I don't let anybody fuck with him.

1856
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,060
Yeah.
He's the littlest dog too.

1857
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:20,730
He's an asshole.
Like if you like try to get them to get

1858
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:22,320
up and get out of the house in the
morning,

1859
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,370
he'll growl at you.
You're like,

1860
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,080
listen motherfucker,
come on.

1861
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:26,250
We'll go outside.
Yeah.

1862
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,800
It's taught her well.
Are you ground bitch?

1863
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:29,700
I'm like,
come on man.

1864
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,890
Fatty for 14 years.
Get up,

1865
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,730
go out.
He's just old and it's,

1866
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,470
he's in pain a lot is,
um,

1867
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,590
it's really hard for him to get up.
But the point is,

1868
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:39,840
the other dog,
I'm sure he's old too,

1869
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,540
but he just,
he's a sweetheart.

1870
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,070
He's got no aggression in him towards
people.

1871
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:45,300
He's just a sweet,
sweet dog.

1872
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,490
That's just personalities.

1873
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,190
Bears are just like,
that is some bears that are cunts.

1874
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,360
Yeah.
There's actually,

1875
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:53,700
there's a petition out there about,
um,

1876
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,200
band or,
I don't know,

1877
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:58,260
something about me,
but it says I took a Selfie of a bear

1878
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:00,060
then killed it,
which is false.

1879
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,650
The bearer took a selfie of I did not
kill because it wasn't old enough.

1880
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:08,100
Yeah.
So just to dispel any rumors,

1881
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:10,350
those petitions are fascinating.
You know,

1882
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,920
I mean,
people don't want you to kill bears.

1883
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,890
Here's the thing,
people don't,

1884
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:20,060
they don't want animals to die.
They don't want you to kill animals.

1885
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,410
How do you feel about animals killing
animals?

1886
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:24,210
Because if you don't want animals to
die,

1887
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,610
one of the best ways to stop that is to
kill bears.

1888
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,380
Yeah.
But if you kill bears,

1889
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,720
they get more angry at you for killing
bears,

1890
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,380
mountain lions and lions than anything
else.

1891
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,360
Maybe elephants,
which don't kill anything.

1892
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,490
Total herb herbivores.
They kill people.

1893
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,420
Elephants do occasionally.
Mostly when people do something stupid

1894
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,440
like fuck with them.
It's not,

1895
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:44,880
they don't go out of their way to kill
people.

1896
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:47,160
I think they do.
I doubt it.

1897
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,410
I changed me this,
I think they kill people if people are

1898
01:21:49,411 --> 01:21:51,870
just where they want to go and like,
hey asshole,

1899
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:54,660
that's killing them.
How about you get away from the

1900
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:56,790
elephant,
but you know the,

1901
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:59,250
the problem with that is like if you
grow in crops,

1902
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:00,990
like we were saying,
and then the elephant starts eating your

1903
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:01,950
crops,
you like get Outta here.

1904
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:02,761
And the elephants like,
oh,

1905
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:03,770
excuse me.
Yeah.

1906
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,860
Stomp.
Yeah,

1907
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,000
that's,
that's a wrap kid.

1908
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:08,010
Elephants can be aggressive.
They can,

1909
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:10,980
but they're also fucked with constantly.
And you know,

1910
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:14,340
there's just something to me,
I like elephants.

1911
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,690
Yeah.
I think they'll ever,

1912
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,830
they look awesome.

1913
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,140
They're cool.
I'm glad they're,

1914
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,220
they're real.
I know they're smart.

1915
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,550
I know they have like tight bonds in
their community and you don't have to

1916
01:22:23,551 --> 01:22:25,200
kill one of those to eat it.
I mean,

1917
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:29,010
it's like there's plenty of other
animals to eat is I just,

1918
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,910
but if I was starving to death and I was
living in a place that only had

1919
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,650
elephants,
for sure I'd kill an elephant.

1920
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,161
Yeah.
I mean,

1921
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:38,400
if that was all I had to eat,
our friend Brian Stevens said it tasted

1922
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:40,410
delicious.
He said he ate one in Africa,

1923
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,550
did it,
and he said it was a,

1924
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,220
is one of the most delicious steaks he's
ever had in his life.

1925
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,750
And I was like,
what?

1926
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:50,810
Like how is that possible?
Endangered Elephants and tigers kill a

1927
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:53,340
human.
One human a day in India is growing

1928
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:55,500
population squeezes habitat.
Yeah.

1929
01:22:55,501 --> 01:22:58,140
But this is a crazy situation,
man.

1930
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:02,040
India's fucking so overpopulated.
It is a very,

1931
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:05,230
very small place.
What is he doing trying to get over that

1932
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:06,120
fence?
So

1933
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,690
that tearing apart that car,
like any human deaths since 2014 wow.

1934
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:13,900
So they kill people.
1,000 human deaths in four years,

1935
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,380
whilst tigers have killed 92 people in
the same period.

1936
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,730
So elephants kill Weymar.
Whoa.

1937
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:24,520
That's nuts.
At the end of that bear selfie thing,

1938
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:27,160
it said to other people were killed in
that state in India,

1939
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,410
and they were both trying to take
selfies with elephants.

1940
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:31,870
Fucking dip shits.
One was a kid.

1941
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,850
There's too many people in India.
I mean,

1942
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:37,240
India is grossly overpopulated.
India,

1943
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:39,610
I think is smarter than the United
States.

1944
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:40,660
Right?
Isn't it?

1945
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,630
Like what size is India?
I Dunno.

1946
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,510
I think it's smaller than the contiguous
United States,

1947
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:49,100
but it has a billion people in it.
Yeah.

1948
01:23:49,101 --> 01:23:51,370
It's slightly more than one third.
The size.

1949
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,750
Oh,
more than one third.

1950
01:23:52,751 --> 01:23:53,584
The size.
Okay.

1951
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,350
1 billion is a lot.
Yeah.

1952
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,040
That's a lot of fucking people.
Yeah.

1953
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,580
Triple a we have.
And the third the size.

1954
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:03,160
Yeah.
No third larger.

1955
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,810
Oh,
that's what you're saying,

1956
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:06,610
right?
It says it's slightly more than one

1957
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:07,810
third.
The size of the USO

1958
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,710
third our size.
I thought you were saying a third

1959
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,270
larger.
What I thought I was saying too,

1960
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:14,810
but I just,
I reread it and it,

1961
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,330
oh,
that makes sense.

1962
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:20,100
A third of us,
but has three times of people foc.

1963
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:22,360
It's half the size of Russia.
Oh my God.

1964
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,760
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

1965
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:26,970
Yeah,
I killed.

1966
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,980
That's crazy.
How do you fix appellees?

1967
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,670
You know?
Yeah.

1968
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:32,400
That's the best part of,
um,

1969
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,400
I don't know.
There's Africa is some places in Africa

1970
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:37,070
also.
They,

1971
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:42,070
I know that because uh,
malaria medicine is good.

1972
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,430
People aren't dying from AIDS.
There's a lot of pee.

1973
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,700
Oh,
that's how big is India compared to the

1974
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,450
USA?
Look at this.

1975
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,650
India fits right in there.

1976
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:55,030
My favorite is how big is Africa go to?
How big is Africa?

1977
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,980
Because Africa is hilarious.
Like that.

1978
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:58,750
USA,
India,

1979
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,170
China,
Eastern Europe,

1980
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:03,790
Germany,
France,

1981
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,230
Spain,
Italy,

1982
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,420
Switzerland,
Netherlands,

1983
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:12,660
Belgium,
Portugal and Japan and Great Britain all

1984
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:16,150
fit inside of Africa.
Fuck,

1985
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:17,320
that's big.
Yeah,

1986
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:20,020
it's big area.
Fuck yeah.

1987
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,990
That is crazy.
Africa is amazing though,

1988
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,120
man.
That's crazy.

1989
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,270
When you look at that on a map,
you can be like,

1990
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:30,280
oh wow.
Yeah.

1991
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:34,060
The Congo is as wide as America is.
Just the Congo,

1992
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,290
the true size of Africa,
man.

1993
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:42,460
So when out and someone says like
elephants are endangered in Africa in

1994
01:25:42,461 --> 01:25:43,810
some spots,
some spots,

1995
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:45,670
some spots they're overrun.
It's just like,

1996
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,740
yeah,
grizzlies are endangered in La.

1997
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,430
They are really endangered in La.
Unless you go to these certain bars in

1998
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:54,130
Santa Monica Boulevard,
there's for days.

1999
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,390
Um,
now I,

2000
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:57,460
you know,
I didn't know that was a gay reference

2001
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:01,240
until recently.
We've been hanging out with not gay

2002
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,160
people.
I guess you don't hang around.

2003
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,390
You just,
you got to have this read.

2004
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,920
Oh,
read on these.

2005
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:08,870
You don't have to hang out.
You don't have to hang out with them.

2006
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,430
You don't have to actually go there.
Like,

2007
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,090
I need to know guys about k.
Well,

2008
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:14,460
take your pants down first.
You want to get shot?

2009
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,530
Uh,
Hey,

2010
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,380
speaking of,
I dunno what we're speaking of,

2011
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:24,500
but we need to talk about Kanye.
Just oh,

2012
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:27,950
Jamie's got crazy.
Kanye conspiracy theories.

2013
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,330
Slash.
Theories.

2014
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,650
Well,
first,

2015
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,180
so first of all,
he's like,

2016
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,990
he came out for trump recently,
sort of,

2017
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,290
he wore a make America great again hat
on,

2018
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,340
but he also called trump a bald thief.
Why suddenly too?

2019
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:45,530
He did.
Yeah.

2020
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:46,521
Well,
yeah,

2021
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:48,780
he called them balled.
Crooker appalled.

2022
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:51,770
Connie Aa is a lunatic.
Yeah.

2023
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,720
So I could care less what he says about
him.

2024
01:26:54,721 --> 01:26:57,180
He loves saying,
Jamie Sleeps with a picture of Cognac.

2025
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:03,380
I'll stop if you believe that shit to
believe that people believe everything

2026
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,740
you saying about me.
It's not a,

2027
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:08,690
it's a,
it's a pendant with a picture with his

2028
01:27:08,691 --> 01:27:11,270
picture on in it.
Jamie's is a big fan of two things.

2029
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,840
Nuclear Weapons and trump.
He's,

2030
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,780
yeah,
he loves nuclear bombs and he loves

2031
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:21,680
physics class.

2032
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:22,920
Yeah,
so trump,

2033
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:25,723
here's,
here's,

2034
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,430
here's what I like.
I,

2035
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,640
well Connie is a lunatic,
but I do like candace owens who was also

2036
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:34,790
new on the scene in my Fox News world.
You love that.

2037
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:38,210
I Love,
love conservatives and candice is just

2038
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,550
like,
she walked in from work the other day

2039
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,320
and I was like,
I started listening to Fox News is I

2040
01:27:43,321 --> 01:27:44,420
don't,
of course I'm watching.

2041
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,520
I'm like,
who the hell is this?

2042
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:50,990
You Say Fox News is on of course,
because Fox News just blaring propaganda

2043
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:53,660
through your house all the time.
Do you ever switch it up?

2044
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:57,080
Like have like CNN on the back,
nine Fox News on in the living room.

2045
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,420
I watch it all.
I do watch CNN.

2046
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:03,470
Alex Jones says 200 1:30 PM to watch him
for wars exclusive on Canyon.

2047
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,260
Candice and Kanye got exclusive.
I don't,

2048
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,810
it doesn't happen every year.
It's like alive.

2049
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,270
What is he going to say?
Featuring candice and Kanye.

2050
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:15,180
So you get a lump them in together,
but he talking about them,

2051
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:17,560
everyone thought they weren't going to
be on this show today.

2052
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:20,250
Oh,
it didn't happen for wars exclusive.

2053
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,410
He probably called them Kanye.
It's Alex Jones.

2054
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:25,710
I could care less that Connie says.
I like what canvas says.

2055
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:31,160
Well Jamie thinks that all this
wackiness with candace owens and Kanye

2056
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:34,830
is really Kanye just getting people
hyped up about the release of his new

2057
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:36,270
album,
which will be out in a few months.

2058
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:39,360
So he's getting people fired up.
You think that's what's happening Jamie?

2059
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,780
Yeah,
there's a internet conspiracy that's

2060
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,940
been like,
not proven because it can't be proven

2061
01:28:44,941 --> 01:28:45,660
yet,
but uh,

2062
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:49,680
there's a long twitter thread and a few
like reports now blogs or magazines if

2063
01:28:49,681 --> 01:28:52,380
you will,
that sort of lead to like an Andy

2064
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:54,560
Kaufman esque type performance art piece
that he's doing.

2065
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:59,100
Maybe bring up a conversation about some
of these topics he's actually talking

2066
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:01,650
about.
Or maybe we'll find out when his album

2067
01:29:01,651 --> 01:29:02,190
comes out.

2068
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,220
It's Kanye is doing performance art.
Then what's the point?

2069
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:08,520
Here's the Po,
here's the problem is there's a certain

2070
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:12,340
amount of him that is undeniably insane
and um,

2071
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:15,480
you've seen that,
like that thing that Jimmy Kimmel mocked

2072
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,200
where you had that little kid.
He used to do little kids saying things

2073
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:22,170
that Kanye said and like he would have
like,

2074
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,010
yeah,
like he would have little kids say it

2075
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,070
exactly.
By the way,

2076
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,660
hate him.
He's a nice guy.

2077
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:28,681
No,
you met her.

2078
01:29:28,681 --> 01:29:29,790
Be like him.
I like it a lot.

2079
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,601
I wouldn't,
he's like,

2080
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:33,930
why he cries about hunting.
What did he cry about?

2081
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:35,220
Lions.
Sea Salt.

2082
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,140
Yeah.
I don't know why.

2083
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:41,860
Maybe some medication.
Sometimes guys take things and it ups

2084
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:43,830
their estrogen and they just get real
watery.

2085
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,890
Yeah.
That cry went to be able to do really

2086
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:51,480
well that I feel like a bitch sometimes.
I cried when conor mcgregor was talking

2087
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:52,920
about the support he gets from Ireland.

2088
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,770
I had to hold back the tears.
Did you being honest?

2089
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,050
I was paying honest.
I was interviewing him and he started

2090
01:29:58,051 --> 01:30:00,360
talking about the love I get from these
people from Ireland.

2091
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:00,751
Like,
God,

2092
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,430
that must be amazing.
That actually,

2093
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:03,901
yeah,
no,

2094
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,310
I get that.
I get that.

2095
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,710
That's different than Jimmy though.
Crying like drumming up stupid stuff for

2096
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:14,550
Cecil the lion.
The lion thing is weird.

2097
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:16,850
Why don't think it's weird?
You know,

2098
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:20,190
there was a great article that was in
the New York Times in Zimbabwe.

2099
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:21,670
We don't cry for lions,
right?

2100
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,070
It happened right after that.
Yeah.

2101
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,860
This guy was talking about his family
members that were killed by lions.

2102
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:29,190
We have a very idealistic view of what a
lion is,

2103
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,500
and I'm a big fan of lions.
I'd love that.

2104
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:33,540
They're real.
I love that they exist.

2105
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,100
I love that you can see videos of them.

2106
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:39,780
One of my favorite documentaries of all
time is it documented called relentless

2107
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:44,781
enemies and it's about these,
this one pack of lions that got a river

2108
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:51,231
changed its path and they got stranded
on an island and there's one pack of,

2109
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:56,541
I of lions grew enormous because all
they have to hunt is water buffalo.

2110
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,610
So instead of this variety of different
game animals,

2111
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:02,580
all they have to hunt as these huge 2000
pound animals.

2112
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:07,820
So they grew jacked like hulk size lines
where the female lions or as big as a

2113
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:10,140
regular mail.
Really,

2114
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,550
it's all fucking amazing document.
See if he could find some images from

2115
01:31:14,551 --> 01:31:17,730
it.
The way they look is just tracked.

2116
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:20,640
There's so muscular,
they're fucking huge.

2117
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,860
Like female lions,
600 lbs.

2118
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:24,480
Wow.
Fucking amazing.

2119
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:28,890
But the documentary is incredible
because these water buffalo are so big

2120
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:31,110
and so hard to take out.
They need like,

2121
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:32,203
oh,
it's Cape Buffalo,

2122
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:37,230
so they need like six or seven of them
just jump Oh fucking buffalo and drag

2123
01:31:37,231 --> 01:31:39,720
him to the ground.
Those things are solid muscle too.

2124
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,570
Yeah.
Buffalo.

2125
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,210
Yeah,
they're giant.

2126
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,010
But because of,
and this,

2127
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:48,360
I believe this is over the period,
I think it's a short amount of time.

2128
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,330
Yes.
And short amount of time that these

2129
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:53,930
lions have lived on this one island,
but they did it.

2130
01:31:53,931 --> 01:31:55,420
A whole documentary about it.
Well,

2131
01:31:55,421 --> 01:32:00,160
as all this on this island or hyenas,
Cape Buffalo

2132
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:02,990
and lions and a few birds and
[inaudible].

2133
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,360
There's nothing else.
When they're neat,

2134
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:05,890
they don't want to eat hyenas.
Yeah.

2135
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,590
Mad.
You want a hyena steak tastes like awful

2136
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,310
one or would it taste like awful?
Today's great.

2137
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,400
Imagine pigs.
You look at a pig,

2138
01:32:15,401 --> 01:32:16,960
like how could that tastes good?
Yeah,

2139
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,943
I guess,
I don't know.

2140
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:22,300
Wild pig is fucking delicious.
And they looked disgusting in Africa.

2141
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:27,301
They say hyenas are a witches witches.
Let's see.

2142
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,190
Margaret,
they're laughing at you.

2143
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:30,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2144
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,680
And then that was a,
that was a whole thing.

2145
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:37,330
It's like a,
an Alpha female has a Dick Remember

2146
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:39,070
that?
It's not cool.

2147
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:40,840
No,
it's bigger than anything else.

2148
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,080
So Jimmy Kimmel also made the small
penis reference about hunters.

2149
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:51,010
What does this Okavango Delta Lions from
planet Earth to?

2150
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:53,350
Yeah.
You can't really tell him that picture.

2151
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,000
See,
go do,

2152
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,830
um,
Google,

2153
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,750
uh,
enormous lions.

2154
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:01,360
Relentless enemies.
Closest I could get,

2155
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:05,860
I know there's video on it.
You can get some planet or two or that

2156
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,750
its enemies doc,
I can't show that.

2157
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,471
Right,
right,

2158
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:10,540
right.
But this is planet earth too,

2159
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,300
but the,
the documentary is just,

2160
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,980
just google,
relentless enemies.

2161
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:15,910
Documentary.

2162
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,493
Wait.

2163
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:22,830
So this is this area where the lions are
stranded in this one particular,

2164
01:33:22,831 --> 01:33:26,670
and it's not a very large spot,
but in this one place.

2165
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,930
Yeah,
there it is.

2166
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,370
It's really fucking awesome now.
Oh yeah.

2167
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,041
Don't,
don't,

2168
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:38,690
don't see if they get some good images
of how big these things are.

2169
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:39,820
You can't really tell.
They just looked very,

2170
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:42,920
oh,
ela and watching sex while watching a

2171
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:45,440
bank go to the second one.
Not that one,

2172
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,690
but go back to the,
uh,

2173
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,200
that page.
They go to the second one.

2174
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:51,080
Relentless enemy's lines in buffalo.
This is the one.

2175
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,600
So this is,
so this is the,

2176
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:55,970
the actual documentary.
And there's also a pride of lions that

2177
01:33:55,971 --> 01:34:00,100
are regular size on this island too,
which is really confusing to biologists.

2178
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,471
They're like,
well,

2179
01:34:00,471 --> 01:34:04,390
what the fuck?
Can't really tell here.

2180
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,380
Yeah.
But see how jack these females are.

2181
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,493
Yeah.

2182
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,900
It's tough to tell here,
but here they're trying to take out this

2183
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:14,561
Cape Buffalo out.
Look at this.

2184
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:17,080
This is crazy.
They're all piling on it.

2185
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:19,480
Yeah.
The females are much,

2186
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:22,630
much larger than a regular female.
Pretty brutal.

2187
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,520
Amen.
Evolution.

2188
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:27,790
It's fascinating.
Shed watching things struggled to

2189
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:31,360
survive
hard out there for a pimp.

2190
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,190
Death has never pretty.
No,

2191
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,460
but it being the thing is people would
have a really hard time if a person was

2192
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:42,700
doing any of the things that lions too.
I mean,

2193
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:45,910
you would think that would be awful,
but do you have a hard time with lions

2194
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:47,350
doing the things at lines,
do you say?

2195
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:49,060
No,
because that's natural.

2196
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,710
Okay.
Well do you realize that the only reason

2197
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:53,530
why people even exist is because people
did.

2198
01:34:53,531 --> 01:34:57,130
When lions do the differences,
humans have compassion.

2199
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,123
So I mean,

2200
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:00,590
um,
animals,

2201
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,590
there's no,
they don't have time for compassion out

2202
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:04,580
there.
You know what I mean?

2203
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:06,710
It's a nonexistent,
the concept,

2204
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:10,580
I put up this video on my instagram,
the zebra had just,

2205
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:13,910
the zebra full had just been dropped.
Um,

2206
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:18,560
it was just barely standing wobbly legs.
This lion,

2207
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:21,230
big male lion walks up to it.
Kills it.

2208
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:24,770
Like it had been alive minutes.
I saw that video.

2209
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,090
That's life.
That bum.

2210
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:27,750
Yeah,
but not as much as the one where you,

2211
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,500
you had,
was it a moose calf or an elk cap?

2212
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:31,343
Kath.
Yeah,

2213
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:35,030
eating it alive and it's screaming out
and it's mother's just a few feet away

2214
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,910
trying to figure out what to do.
And that grizzlies just tearing it

2215
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:39,020
apart.
That sucked.

2216
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,680
But that's what they do.
If you don't control the populations of

2217
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:45,050
grizzlies,
that happens all the time.

2218
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,400
And even today,
right now with the,

2219
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,140
just the populations as they exist right
now in places like Alberta,

2220
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:56,410
they estimate that 50% of all moose,
elk and deer calves are killed or fonts

2221
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,380
or killed by bears.

2222
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,940
They just,
they just tear them apart.

2223
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,913
Yeah.
Half of them.

2224
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,360
And that's,
that's what happened up in British

2225
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,810
Columbia because they did that.
They did a vote in Vancouver essentially

2226
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,500
to vote on whether grizzly hunting
should be allowed.

2227
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,570
Of course,
people in the city,

2228
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,010
you know,
just like here,

2229
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:18,080
don't think there are hardly any
grizzlies left.

2230
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,360
So they said no.
And so the,

2231
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:21,500
the new,
um,

2232
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,500
I can't remember what the political
parties called,

2233
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:29,150
but the one in control now said grizzly
hunting is no longer socially

2234
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:31,880
acceptable.
And so they can't hunt them.

2235
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,950
And you'll see what's going to happen
with the,

2236
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,810
with the other animals.
They're going to have to hunt them,

2237
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,130
but they're gonna hire people to hunt
them.

2238
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,690
What happens in those situations is what
happens in California when it comes to

2239
01:36:41,691 --> 01:36:43,370
mountain lions and they still get
hunted,

2240
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:48,290
but they get hunted in a very hush,
hush way higher assassins to go after

2241
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:48,830
these lines.

2242
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:53,270
It kill dogs and cats and you know,
scare the shit out of joggers and that's

2243
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:54,590
what they're going to have to do to
bears.

2244
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:59,950
The problem with that hunt vote was the
way it was explained,

2245
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:04,940
Gritty Bowman did a podcast about it and
what they were explaining was that it

2246
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:08,900
was a very small percentage of people
that even voted on this.

2247
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,820
Yeah,
I mean it was like it just a few

2248
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,030
thousand people voted on it and most
people were unaware of the consequences

2249
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,650
that there needs to be a balance of
these bears and these animals.

2250
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,400
Otherwise the animals are going to get
decimated in the bears getting

2251
01:37:21,401 --> 01:37:23,960
encroached on human populations.
And then on top of that,

2252
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:27,480
these bears like that.
The,

2253
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,520
there's been this whole business of
guiding and outfitting for these bears

2254
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:37,190
and the biologists are not talking to
the people that are actually in the

2255
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:39,740
woods on the ground,
but that the population numbers,

2256
01:37:39,741 --> 01:37:42,710
if you talk to people like my friend
Mike Cochran who lives up there,

2257
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:45,020
he's,
he'll tell you there's a lot of bears.

2258
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:49,610
There's a large population of grizzly
bears and it's very difficult to

2259
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:53,090
determine what the actual population is
if they're not listening to the people

2260
01:37:53,091 --> 01:37:54,650
that are on the ground every day.
Yeah,

2261
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:55,673
yeah.
No,

2262
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:57,340
you gotta,
you gotta listen to the people that are

2263
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:00,780
boots on the ground,
the in when you have a vote on something

2264
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:03,630
like this,
no one's taken into consideration these

2265
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:05,100
things.
Like you're just going bears,

2266
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,720
why would you kill a bear?
They're amazing.

2267
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,653
Yeah.
You know,

2268
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,583
I,
I love,

2269
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,170
I love bears.
The anthropomorphization of animals is

2270
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:16,410
one of the more dangerous things that
people have done with civilization where

2271
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:19,560
we've decided that animals are like us.
They're our friends.

2272
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,930
They have,
they wear baseball hats and fucking

2273
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,370
ties.
God.

2274
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:28,260
It's just weird and we do it from the
time kids are little,

2275
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:30,780
you know,
you give him a teddy bear and then you

2276
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:31,850
know,
you tell them,

2277
01:38:31,851 --> 01:38:33,450
oh,
you don't kill real bears.

2278
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,090
Do you like real bears are going to kill
you?

2279
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:37,600
Do you understand what a bear is?
Yeah,

2280
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,990
like a bear is that thing with that guy
in India.

2281
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:41,610
That's it there.
It's a monster.

2282
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:43,050
I mean,
it's an awesome monster.

2283
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:43,950
I'm glad they're real.
Yeah,

2284
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,160
me too.
But their meat is delicious.

2285
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,750
It is nuts.
The other thing,

2286
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,270
it's like people think that somehow now
that you can't eat bears,

2287
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,760
like people get mad at you for killing a
bear,

2288
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:58,050
but they won't get mad at you for
killing a pig because pigs are ugly.

2289
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,150
Like a wild,
like wild pigs or the one of those one

2290
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:06,780
animals were vegans and animal rights
activists don't have an answer to.

2291
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:07,890
Right.
You know,

2292
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,870
they really,
they don't like seeing people shooting

2293
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:12,240
them out of helicopters.
They don't like seeing people hunting

2294
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:14,160
them.
But if you looked at the actual numbers,

2295
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:17,460
I would love to sit down,
have someone from Peta or any animal

2296
01:39:17,461 --> 01:39:22,380
rights activist group sit down with
someone who really understands the wild

2297
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:27,180
pig infestation problem that the
invasive species that doesn't have a

2298
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:31,530
natural Predator that breeds three to
four times a year and can have as many

2299
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:36,060
as six to eight pigletts and it's the
litter and they're just s just fucking

2300
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:39,390
like there's no tomorrow and they're
having tons of them and they just

2301
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:42,330
destroyed billions of dollars in crops
every year.

2302
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,160
What do you do about that?
What are you gonna do?

2303
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:48,000
Tell me what to do animal right?
People tell him they don't think about

2304
01:39:48,001 --> 01:39:53,001
it because this is not an a balanced,
nuanced objective approach.

2305
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,430
They haven't looked at this whole thing.
What they've decided is that killing

2306
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:00,630
[inaudible] beans is bad.
Speciesism is bad.

2307
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,990
You know that one?
Speciesism here's a specie.

2308
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:07,260
I'm a speciesist God.
Everybody is.

2309
01:40:07,261 --> 01:40:11,430
When it comes to bugs,
how fact everybody is at subway.

2310
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:12,840
Hey,
you want some bacon on that?

2311
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:14,280
Yeah.
Throw some bacon on there,

2312
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,480
but if you don't,
if that's,

2313
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:16,740
if you eat at subway,
bro,

2314
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,350
these niggas don't eat.
It's everybody doesn't need it.

2315
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:22,290
Subway vegans don't eat at subway vegans
at what?

2316
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:23,670
3%?
Yeah.

2317
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,350
What is it?
The number of Vegans,

2318
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:27,760
what's the percentage?
3% what is it?

2319
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:29,350
What's the percentage of vegans that are
cont?

2320
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:34,020
Not that all of a sudden her hundred.
I said a hundred but not,

2321
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,790
not Wesley town.
No,

2322
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,000
I know a lot of cool vegans.
Yeah,

2323
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:40,800
me too.
Ian Edwards Outright Enid was just one

2324
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,150
of my best friends.
He's a big,

2325
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,860
he's a Vegan,
so there's two.

2326
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,720
Yeah,
I know.

2327
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,610
I know a lot of cool vegans,
but there's a lot of vegans that are

2328
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,540
just super self righteous.
Like once the,

2329
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:51,570
once they're on that team,
they're super self righteous.

2330
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,380
Yeah.
And ask him how much time they have in

2331
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,100
the woods.

2332
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,370
Yeah.
How much time you have around bears,

2333
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,200
how much time you have.
Yeah.

2334
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:02,500
Got a lot of time in the woods to form
that opinion.

2335
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:04,720
Oh,
do you really understand?

2336
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:06,220
Yeah.
Come across a bear.

2337
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:09,870
Tear it apart.
A P a cub or a killing?

2338
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:12,020
A calf elk.
Oh,

2339
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,480
you know,
I mean constantly.

2340
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:15,190
I don't even,
when I put that up,

2341
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,140
I don't even like to watch it.
I'm a hunter.

2342
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:20,380
I've killed a lot of animals.
I don't like to watch it,

2343
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:22,580
but we have to show it.
Yeah.

2344
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,870
How do you think they feel about animals
killing animals?

2345
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,180
Do you think they feel it's okay because
it's natural?

2346
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:33,040
I don't know what they think,
but wonder if it's just a convenient

2347
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,970
thing that they just look past la,
la,

2348
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,110
la,
la,

2349
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:37,990
la.
I think that's probably mostly what it

2350
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:38,920
is.
Yeah,

2351
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:43,600
because if they really did want to see
like what is more beautiful?

2352
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,570
Well that's objective more.
It's what's more beautiful.

2353
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:47,560
A deer.
A bear.

2354
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,900
I don't know,
but I do know that one doesn't eat the

2355
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:52,620
other deers don't eat bears,
you know?

2356
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,730
So it feels like if you,
yeah.

2357
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:57,400
If you felt like they were both equally
beautiful,

2358
01:41:57,401 --> 01:41:59,860
you'd want to protect the deer from the
bear.

2359
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:01,930
[inaudible] man,
I dunno.

2360
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,750
I know.
As a hunter I people always ask me,

2361
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:06,730
well,
what do you enjoy hunting them out?

2362
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,200
It's what our,
I'm hunting.

2363
01:42:08,201 --> 01:42:09,760
I mean I'm,
I,

2364
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:14,620
I respect and I'm drawn to all that.
I like being close to all the animals.

2365
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:15,550
So it's,
uh,

2366
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,990
it's,
I don't really,

2367
01:42:16,991 --> 01:42:19,930
I can't have a hard time writing them
personally.

2368
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:22,150
Well for me,
um,

2369
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:27,460
I just like the ones that are delicious
and they're all pretty delicious.

2370
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:30,250
They also that we hunt.
Yeah,

2371
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,830
they had the variety of it.
I just liked the fact too that I'm not

2372
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:35,020
getting meat from some fucking factory
farm.

2373
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,590
The people that are getting meat from
the store and from Burger King and then

2374
01:42:38,591 --> 01:42:40,600
are still shitting on hunters and
saying,

2375
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:42,820
you got a little Dick.
Like you're being silly.

2376
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,740
You're being silly now.
I know,

2377
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:47,920
but I'm getting,
so we've talked about this every single

2378
01:42:47,921 --> 01:42:50,950
time,
but the number of people reaching out is

2379
01:42:50,951 --> 01:42:55,951
growing exponentially daily on who wants
to be a hunter,

2380
01:42:56,681 --> 01:43:01,570
who wants to provide for themselves and
their family and really sees the draw to

2381
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:02,404
that.
And that is,

2382
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,150
it's the natural way.
It's,

2383
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:06,510
it's a every day,
every week.

2384
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:11,410
So the concern people have in the raw
real good concern for getting food that

2385
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:14,560
hasn't been tainted with antibiotics and
hormones.

2386
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,210
Yeah.
Getting natural food.

2387
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:20,500
There's no more natural organic food
than an animal that is literally living

2388
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:23,710
in the wild until you take it out.
Like they don't even know you're there

2389
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:27,700
until that Arrow hits some of the most
perfect life up until that time

2390
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,140
generally.
And it's,

2391
01:43:29,141 --> 01:43:30,430
um,
it's the,

2392
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:32,560
it's a way it's meant to be really.
It's,

2393
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:36,280
you know,
humans have hunted up until very

2394
01:43:36,281 --> 01:43:38,580
recently.
That's for,

2395
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,320
for most of our existence,
Kanye hunting,

2396
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,430
if you just,
it,

2397
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:45,250
you take anybody hunting.
What'd you take?

2398
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,400
Kanye,
what would you take him bear hunting?

2399
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,980
I'd take him.
Bear bear is good because,

2400
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,973
you know,
it's like,

2401
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,770
um,
when we bet your first bow hunt was

2402
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,840
bear,
just because it's,

2403
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,380
it's pretty controlled.
There's a lot of bear.

2404
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:02,840
Um,
you can go on some of these hunts and if

2405
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:05,420
you went on an axis,
deer hunt for your first hunt would

2406
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,900
quit.

2407
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,070
That's tough.
That's tough.

2408
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,070
So with bear,
I think it's a good first time and then

2409
01:44:10,071 --> 01:44:13,400
I can,
I like being able to explain why we're

2410
01:44:13,401 --> 01:44:17,180
bear hunting the bear we're looking for.
We're looking for the big old mail.

2411
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:19,580
Here's how you identify it.
I like being right there.

2412
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,300
So if,
if I took Kanye hunt hunting,

2413
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,810
it would be bear hunting.
Hmm.

2414
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:28,760
Um,
do you think he would be able to do it?

2415
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,460
I don't know him.
I mean he's,

2416
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:33,740
he seems crazy,
but I dunno,

2417
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,560
it's Connie out there.
Bear hunting just bought like 300 acres

2418
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:38,150
in Wyoming,
so maybe he did.

2419
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:40,220
He and Connie,
you bought 300 acres in Wyoming.

2420
01:44:40,221 --> 01:44:42,560
He's probably going to build a sneaker
factory out there.

2421
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,290
That's a good looking country right
there.

2422
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,940
That's gorgeous.
No.

2423
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,970
Why did he buy 300 acres in Wyoming?
That's where he's filming our finishing

2424
01:44:49,971 --> 01:44:50,750
his album right now.

2425
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,490
I think he filmed or recorded part of
it.

2426
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:55,360
I would go with the album again.
It's all I'm telling you,

2427
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:56,600
it's all fine.
It work for Kanye.

2428
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:59,330
Tell him the truth.
Jimmy.

2429
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:02,960
Jimmy's got a side job.
I mean,

2430
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:05,810
he's also apparently building in the
interview he talks about,

2431
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:07,670
I think he's building some houses or
something out there to,

2432
01:45:07,730 --> 01:45:10,940
wow.
You imagined Kim Kardashians wandering

2433
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:13,040
around Wyoming.
Oh,

2434
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:16,220
that's when people are going to really
want to get rid of the bear population

2435
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:17,810
cause why am he's got some fucking
grizzlies.

2436
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:21,080
Imagine it's the big grizzly bears take
out the Kardashians.

2437
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:22,350
Well I think,
you know,

2438
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,330
I think people like she's,
I laugh and Jamie,

2439
01:45:26,331 --> 01:45:28,310
that's terrible.
That would,

2440
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:31,130
hey,
thank you about Wyoming.

2441
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,510
Like goofy stupid.
Like that's good.

2442
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,740
But he's in Wyoming.
Thank you.

2443
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:36,860
About the album sales go crazy.
Yeah.

2444
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,950
So yeah,
if you like covered her would be fat and

2445
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:40,784
fun horror movie.

2446
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:45,590
Send her out there in the woods.
I think people like Kanye and I don't

2447
01:45:45,591 --> 01:45:47,520
know about Kim or,
uh,

2448
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,900
but man,
archery is a discipline people need.

2449
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:54,950
So I mean they need some discipline.
I think archery can be,

2450
01:45:55,770 --> 01:45:56,870
it can be powerful.
You know,

2451
01:45:56,871 --> 01:45:59,240
I had sent you that quote I think
yesterday about,

2452
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,940
there's like a,
there's things you do in your life or

2453
01:46:01,941 --> 01:46:04,580
theirs before you did them.
And after he did them and there was a

2454
01:46:04,581 --> 01:46:09,170
definitive line right there.
I think archery can be aligned like that

2455
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:12,680
where everything was before and now
everything after and it's that powerful.

2456
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:14,810
Well,
I think difficult things are important

2457
01:46:14,811 --> 01:46:16,040
for people to do.
You know?

2458
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:18,530
I mean,
I think challenges are extremely

2459
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:19,910
important.
If you don't have a challenge and you're

2460
01:46:19,911 --> 01:46:21,830
like the human mind,
you know,

2461
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:26,450
we were talking about idle time being
the devil's playground,

2462
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,630
right?
If the human mind needs challenges,

2463
01:46:29,631 --> 01:46:34,631
you need something that's stimulating
and intriguing to you and bow hunting is

2464
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:37,070
insanely difficult.
Archery,

2465
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:38,070
forget about bow hunting.
You've,

2466
01:46:38,071 --> 01:46:41,900
you just want to eat vegetables all day.
Archery is insanely difficult.

2467
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:44,600
It's,
and it's something that requires

2468
01:46:44,601 --> 01:46:47,090
concentration on all these different
levels,

2469
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,070
like mental concentration.
You have to focus on your

2470
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,670
posture and your form and make sure that
everything's right and timing the

2471
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,230
release of this shot is right.
All that stuff requires so much of your

2472
01:46:58,231 --> 01:47:02,070
focus and so much thought that it cleans
your mind.

2473
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,020
Yeah.
It cleans your mind of all these other

2474
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:06,240
things,
all the bullshit and the life stress

2475
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:10,230
goes away when that Arrow flies through
the air and shoot hits that Bullseye.

2476
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:12,180
Like it feels amazing.
That's,

2477
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,750
that's one I had a lot of respect for.
Uh,

2478
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,200
Ryan Zinky when I went back there to DC
because I took them with a bow back

2479
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:21,750
there and there's a huge group of people
standing around.

2480
01:47:21,751 --> 01:47:25,530
He's shooting an Arrow at a small target
in a gymnasium.

2481
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,270
And you know,
I mean,

2482
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:28,890
you're putting,
you're putting yourself out there

2483
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:31,620
because there's no guarantee you're
going to be very good with a bow.

2484
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,090
Well,
he's doesn't have experience with it,

2485
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:33,390
right?

2486
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:34,051
No,
no,

2487
01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:35,280
not,
especially now with that bow,

2488
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:37,770
I think he shot one at the western
hunting expo,

2489
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,760
but I saw him shooting in the air.
Like the,

2490
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,880
the Arrow was lined up like you're
shooting,

2491
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:43,320
you know,
down schools.

2492
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:46,650
I instead of with a site,
that's how they used to do it.

2493
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:47,461
Right.
Like a lot of,

2494
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,500
like,
I saw some old pictures of Ted nugent.

2495
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:53,940
He used to shoot a compound bow,
the release with without a release.

2496
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,250
Oh without,
well I don't know if he used a release,

2497
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:58,240
but I know that he didn't have a site.
Right.

2498
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:03,180
And he was like looking down the,
the shaft of the Arrow like a guy would

2499
01:48:03,181 --> 01:48:04,760
do with a recurve bow.
Yeah,

2500
01:48:04,761 --> 01:48:05,780
look,
well that's not,

2501
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:07,530
that's,
that's in a good position.

2502
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:09,900
Maybe that,
that one right there so that,

2503
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:11,910
that's a little more,
that's a little more,

2504
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:12,360
yeah.

2505
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,520
Well that's it.
That's a comp.

2506
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,180
Well that's a recurve I think,
isn't it?

2507
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:18,120
It's hard to tell cause you only looking
at the top of the riser.

2508
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:20,980
But what is,
is that a recurve or comp?

2509
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,840
And I can't tell,
but it says that,

2510
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:28,350
yeah,
Ted nugent is an irresponsible idiot.

2511
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:32,110
Look,
Jamie,

2512
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:36,840
why'd you hold silicone cowboys blog?
Uh,

2513
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,030
well he's also got the boat canted
sideways.

2514
01:48:39,031 --> 01:48:40,140
Too.
Scared.

2515
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,420
Yeah,
that's sorta how you do that.

2516
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,380
Yeah.
See like there,

2517
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:44,690
well that's a,
he,

2518
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:48,510
he's got no side on his boat.
He's just looking down the arrow.

2519
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:50,180
So that's how he used to hunt.
Yeah.

2520
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,190
He used to shoot with a tiny little
stabilizer,

2521
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:57,690
no site and shoot instinctive.
And they switched it up a few years back

2522
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:00,540
and started shooting with sorry sites,
but you know,

2523
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,330
but so anyway,
so uh,

2524
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,740
Zinky was there,
put himself out there and yeah,

2525
01:49:07,741 --> 01:49:10,110
if you like hit the floor and it
ricocheted off in the crowd,

2526
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:11,550
mean somebody in the eye.

2527
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,520
Right.
And so I respected that,

2528
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,390
you know,
you take,

2529
01:49:15,391 --> 01:49:19,110
you're taking a chance and I just think
that that stuff like that is good for

2530
01:49:19,111 --> 01:49:19,980
people.
So,

2531
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,170
you know,
Kanye included,

2532
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:24,840
man,
if you want to shoot a few arrows and

2533
01:49:24,841 --> 01:49:26,640
kill a bear,
I'll go.

2534
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,250
He doesn't have time for that man.
He's revolutionizing fashion.

2535
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,230
He's going to get,
you had to wear dresses.

2536
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,270
Men are going to wear dresses because of
Konya.

2537
01:49:33,271 --> 01:49:35,180
That's what Jamie was telling me.
Yeah,

2538
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,250
Connie's going to start wearing dresses
and then other people are going to join

2539
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:42,450
in and he's selling flip flops and the
bottom looked like mountain boots.

2540
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,210
Slides slide.
What is this all true?

2541
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:47,250
The dresses.

2542
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:52,420
If you want to have your finger on the
pulse of what's going on today with the

2543
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:54,730
kids,
you got to talk to young Jamie Vernon.

2544
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,340
God,
that's amazing.

2545
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,150
He's,
he's my goto liaison for what the fuck

2546
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:02,650
these kids are up to.
Yeah.

2547
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:04,900
I'm a 50 year old man.
I don't know what the fuck's happening.

2548
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,970
It's hard to pay attention to.
It's hard to pay attention to

2549
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:08,500
everything.
That's for sure.

2550
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,360
I go to young Jamie.
Yeah,

2551
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,230
that's true.
I'm busy.

2552
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,630
I can't,
I can't keep up with everything.

2553
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,550
Well at plus you're off social media
now,

2554
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:19,990
while I'm not often,
I posted twice today by bucketing the

2555
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:21,150
flip phone instead.
No,

2556
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:22,960
no.
I have discipline.

2557
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:25,060
I'm not like Ari should fear.
You heard me,

2558
01:50:25,061 --> 01:50:27,250
Ari,
he's got no fucking discipline.

2559
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:28,143
Is that right?
Yeah.

2560
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:31,300
I mean he talks about it.
He's lucky if he gets his phone in his

2561
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:32,770
hand like he's like,
I can't.

2562
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,240
He goes,
I'll be late for everything.

2563
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,920
I'll be like 20 minutes late.
I just,

2564
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:38,020
I just,
I sit down and I can't get off.

2565
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:38,950
He goes,
I'm powerless.

2566
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,031
Like,
wow,

2567
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:42,760
that's crazy.
I don't get that.

2568
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:46,120
That's not good,
but I do know that not thinking about

2569
01:50:46,121 --> 01:50:48,790
that stuff for three days made me feel
better.

2570
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:53,050
It's like a cleanse.
I think ultimately there's a,

2571
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:57,040
there's a tremendous amount of pressure
and being in the public eye,

2572
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:01,570
whether you're in the public eye,
on social media or public eye doing a

2573
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:04,330
podcast or anything like that.
So for me,

2574
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:08,860
doing nothing but bow hunting for six
days like was a,

2575
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:14,740
it was a very difficult release yeah.
In that difficult,

2576
01:51:14,741 --> 01:51:17,050
in a difficult task and not difficult.
Like,

2577
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,820
uh,
I needed to go back to it quickly.

2578
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:22,330
Difficult in that like bow hunting is
hard to do.

2579
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:25,990
So in doing that thing and concentrating
on that thing only,

2580
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:31,210
I wasn't thinking at all about like
twitter or you weren't distracted by

2581
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:32,500
stupid shit,
the news.

2582
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,340
No,
what I liked that last day,

2583
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:36,450
it was,
uh,

2584
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:39,480
um,
I loved,

2585
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:42,630
let's see.
So I killed a buck earlier in the day.

2586
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,900
Um,
you guys had been on some stocks,

2587
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:48,990
you came,
drove down,

2588
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:51,030
loaded the buck up,
took it to Bob,

2589
01:51:51,031 --> 01:51:53,120
the butcher,
and then we're,

2590
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:54,930
so it was,
I think later in the morning,

2591
01:51:54,931 --> 01:51:56,850
normally when it'd be like,
okay,

2592
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:01,140
let's go get something to eat.
We'll regroup and come back in the

2593
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,280
afternoon.
But you're like,

2594
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,170
no,
I want to keep hunting.

2595
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:07,470
You know,
you were just so tunnel vision focused

2596
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:10,260
on hunting and it was so,
I was like,

2597
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:13,530
I was so excited.
So we were out there and it was getting

2598
01:52:13,531 --> 01:52:18,531
hot by this time and we're just finding
deer glassing dear putting together

2599
01:52:18,751 --> 01:52:20,310
these stocks.
And uh,

2600
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:23,850
it was just like,
it was seriously one of

2601
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:27,360
sounds stupid,
I would say the best day of my life.

2602
01:52:27,361 --> 01:52:29,070
But I mean,
that's a perfect day for me.

2603
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,210
It was fun.
It was,

2604
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,490
it was,
you guys went down on that stock,

2605
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:37,290
you and Alec and,
and I found that that bedded buck by

2606
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:38,790
himself,
the wide bug,

2607
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:40,200
and it was just like,
man,

2608
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,153
what a great day.

2609
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:43,640
It was an awesome day and that's how I
would've done it if my family wasn't

2610
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:44,940
there.
I would have just been doing it all.

2611
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,490
Yeah.
I wanted to come back.

2612
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:48,680
I would have just brought some snacks
and water and stayed out.

2613
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

2614
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,840
I'm just one of their to do,
you know,

2615
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,120
and it's,
you know,

2616
01:52:53,121 --> 01:52:53,930
like I said,
it's,

2617
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:55,350
it's like a cleanse.
Yeah.

2618
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,770
There's something about the difficulty
of it,

2619
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:00,200
especially when I was doing it by
myself.

2620
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:05,960
There was a time for a while where I was
stocking on this buck by myself without

2621
01:53:05,961 --> 01:53:07,010
Alec,
without anybody.

2622
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:08,570
And like this is like,
it's,

2623
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:12,260
it's such a singular focus.
You thinking about one thing,

2624
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:14,810
you just checking the,
when checking your range,

2625
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:17,360
trying to close it on.
I'm putting bushes in between you and

2626
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:20,270
him so he can't see you creep in trying
to,

2627
01:53:20,271 --> 01:53:24,230
and it's,
there's something about that that's so,

2628
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,890
it's so primal.
It just resonates with your DNA.

2629
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:30,470
There's something about it where like
you get,

2630
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,980
if you get one of those animals and then
as you're eating it,

2631
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:35,990
you're going to remember that moment
forever.

2632
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,070
You gotta remember.
Yeah.

2633
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:40,250
So it's,
it's not just like getting something

2634
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,410
from a restaurant or from the grocery
store.

2635
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:44,500
It's getting,
you're eating's I've got an action.

2636
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:46,550
You have a massive connection to it.

2637
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:47,720
Yeah.
And that's,

2638
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,450
I,
I videoed a little bit on that deer I

2639
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:53,870
killed that day and I put it on my
instagram story,

2640
01:53:53,871 --> 01:53:56,640
just little clips about where I was,
where the buck was kind of the,

2641
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,910
the strategy taken off my boots and all
that.

2642
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:02,600
And so many people sent messages saying
that that was fascinating.

2643
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,520
And I'm like,
man,

2644
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:05,393
does,
I mean,

2645
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,610
how long does the instagram stories stay
up?

2646
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:11,210
No,
but I saved it on the highlights.

2647
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,830
Oh,
that when you saved.

2648
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,440
So is it listed under,
it says access stock.

2649
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,580
Oh,
that's bad house.

2650
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:17,390
Yeah.
So it's,

2651
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:19,220
it's,
people can check it out and it's just

2652
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:21,470
like,
I was reading the comments and seeing

2653
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:24,830
and reading the messages and people
saying how fascinating it was and it,

2654
01:54:24,831 --> 01:54:28,880
how educational and I'm like,
on one hand I'm like,

2655
01:54:28,881 --> 01:54:30,500
that's awesome.
On another hand,

2656
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:33,350
it made me feel bad for him because
that's just,

2657
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,600
I've done that so many times.

2658
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,570
And it is,
it's,

2659
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:40,520
it's powerful and it's,
it feels like the way it should be.

2660
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,860
But I feel bad for people who haven't
experienced that.

2661
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:46,190
So I feel good for you.
Now that you're in that and that,

2662
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:47,630
but the people sending you messages,
I,

2663
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:51,410
I'm like,
I would love to almost be able to share

2664
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:54,650
that with them somehow or,
or I mean that's as good as I can do

2665
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:56,510
right now.
That's one of the hardest things for

2666
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:59,600
people's to get in it to get started.
Yeah.

2667
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:03,410
Cause it's like the learning curve.
That's what I was gonna ask you is,

2668
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:05,960
uh,
he had been bow hunting now.

2669
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:08,780
What was that first bow hunt we went on?
What year was that?

2670
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:14,260
2013 or 1414 so four years,
something like that.

2671
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

2672
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:22,360
So for years and it's a,
I dunno,

2673
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,930
it's what,
what,

2674
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:28,190
what's changed from that first year to
this year for you?

2675
01:55:28,191 --> 01:55:29,024
I mean

2676
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:30,990
experience for sure.
Yeah.

2677
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,970
Having more hunts under my belt,
understanding how little I really know.

2678
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,320
It's like one of those things.
There's a,

2679
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:40,970
there's a great expression I think from
Dennis Mckenna that once the,

2680
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:44,790
the bonfire of understanding

2681
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:48,390
grows,
the surface area of ignorance is

2682
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:51,450
revealed is that the bigger the bonfire,
the more you realize,

2683
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:54,480
like the more you understand,
the more you realize how much there is

2684
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:57,060
to learn.
That's one of the things about hunting

2685
01:55:57,061 --> 01:56:00,300
with each experience,
especially something like Lanai,

2686
01:56:00,301 --> 01:56:05,301
which is so it's so difficult.
It's like the most difficult.

2687
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,820
But I mean at least what I've
experienced in my short amount of time

2688
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:11,880
doing it,
the most difficult kind of hunting spot

2689
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:14,700
and stocking things that are just
fucking wired,

2690
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:18,570
super pressured.
The stock is the most difficult.

2691
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:20,250
The,
I mean if you,

2692
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,020
if you have to backpack in the
mountains.

2693
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,690
Yeah.
That's a different kind of vessel.

2694
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:24,540
Different kinds.
Yeah.

2695
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:27,480
The stock of these and getting a bow
range and making the shot.

2696
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:28,081
Yeah,
that's,

2697
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:30,300
yeah.
It's almost as hard as it gets on the

2698
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:32,580
animals that I've hunted.
There's some antelope in Africa that are

2699
01:56:32,581 --> 01:56:35,370
just as quick,
but um,

2700
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,680
backpack hunting's probably the hardest
physically.

2701
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:38,340
Right,
right.

2702
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,360
Yeah.
I mean there's,

2703
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:44,570
that's a whole different challenge and a
whole different knowledge base that

2704
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:49,620
you'd have to delve into,
but as far as stocking and getting those

2705
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:51,180
killed with the bow,
these access,

2706
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:52,200
dear,
you're right.

2707
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:57,470
Also like I would imagine that backpack
hunting in the mountains is also more

2708
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:01,320
mentally taxing because you can't just
go back to the cabin.

2709
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:05,310
You can't just go back to the lodge.
You're out there in a tent and you're 20

2710
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:08,190
miles in and if you break your ankle,
you're going to die.

2711
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:09,300
Yeah,
Yup.

2712
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:10,740
Oh,
you're going to have to take that thing

2713
01:57:10,741 --> 01:57:13,710
up and crawl out of there.
It's a little better now because people

2714
01:57:13,711 --> 01:57:15,850
have way more access than when I started
when I,

2715
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:18,240
there was this,
you'd have to get to the top of the

2716
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:21,030
mountain,
even get barely cell phone service if

2717
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:23,270
that was even possible,
but now you know,

2718
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,450
there's a lot of light phones.

2719
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:25,110
Yeah,
yeah,

2720
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:26,940
yeah.
A lot of people have access to which,

2721
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:29,280
which is nice,
but still it's,

2722
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,310
it's a,
it's intimidating for a lot of people.

2723
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:34,470
Yeah.
The barrier for entry is very high.

2724
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,600
Yeah.
It's very hard to get started.

2725
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:40,290
And I'm just really lucky that I got
started because of a podcast that I got

2726
01:57:40,291 --> 01:57:44,460
to meet Rinella and got into hunting and
then got to meet you and then got into

2727
01:57:44,461 --> 01:57:46,410
archery and bow hunting and all that
stuff.

2728
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:49,470
And,
but it's for someone on the outside

2729
01:57:49,471 --> 01:57:52,740
that's looking in,
it's extremely difficult now.

2730
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:55,950
But here's what you do.
You go to a archery pro shop.

2731
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,920
Most people have those.
I know there's one down here in San

2732
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,450
Diego,
performance archery.

2733
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:03,780
Um,
I met Scott Eastwood at one in Riverside

2734
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:07,200
and I think it's called Riverside
archery back home.

2735
01:58:07,201 --> 01:58:09,660
It's a bottle rack,
but there's these pro shops if that's

2736
01:58:09,661 --> 01:58:10,890
what they do every day.

2737
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:13,920
So the key with any hunter,
any archery hunting you're going to do

2738
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:16,530
shooting that Bo and shooting it
consistently,

2739
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:19,350
getting those reps in.
And that's where,

2740
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,930
you know,
you can't control the experience you

2741
01:58:21,931 --> 01:58:22,770
get.
You know,

2742
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:27,420
that kind of comes slowly.
But like what you've taken control of is

2743
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:31,260
the repetition and the discipline was
shooting an Arrow and doing it

2744
01:58:31,261 --> 01:58:34,200
accurately.
So once you control that part of it,

2745
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:38,010
the hunting experience is going to come.
The stock experience,

2746
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:39,450
the learning,
the animals that's going to come.

2747
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,980
But at least when you get that
opportunity be able to make the shot.

2748
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,610
So for what I fought for new people who
are interested,

2749
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:48,370
get to an archer pro shop,
get set up with the good bow,

2750
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:50,890
learn how to shoot correctly and do it a
lot,

2751
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:53,410
and then you branch out and set up the
hunts.

2752
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:57,790
It's just so difficult to execute a
shot.

2753
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:58,990
An animal.
Yeah,

2754
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:03,160
it was way different.
People don't have any idea how much

2755
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:07,090
anxiety and how much adrenaline is
pumping through your system when you're

2756
01:59:07,091 --> 01:59:09,310
drawn back on an animal.
Yeah.

2757
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:14,470
I mean the consequences are so grave.
Everything is so high stakes.

2758
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,510
It's just,
it's,

2759
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:18,730
you only get this one shot like here it
is.

2760
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:21,490
And especially say if you're on a back
country hunt,

2761
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:23,880
you go 20 miles in,
there's,

2762
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:26,650
there's 190 inch mule deer just standing
there,

2763
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,340
hey feeding and you get this one shot.
This is your one shot.

2764
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:32,790
Even,
you haven't seen a deer in six days to

2765
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,670
finally see a deer and you draw back and
your arms are shaking and you just try

2766
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:41,290
and trying to go through your shot
process without flinching and fucking

2767
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:44,970
panicking and just slamming that trigger
like it's fucking door in a monster or

2768
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:45,910
something of his line of it.

2769
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:49,480
People want a shortcut.
And I was the same way.

2770
01:59:49,481 --> 01:59:51,220
I'd been on hunts like that.
I've been on,

2771
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,340
um,
nate semans me on a hunt where I was in

2772
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:57,610
the Eagle cap wilderness and I don't,
I'm trying to,

2773
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,620
or I'm trying to think if,
yeah,

2774
01:59:59,621 --> 02:00:03,470
we didn't see
God,

2775
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,380
I don't,
I want to say we didn't see an elk for

2776
02:00:05,381 --> 02:00:10,381
something like six days.
I killed a buck on day seven,

2777
02:00:10,391 --> 02:00:12,820
I think,
and a bowl on day eight.

2778
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:16,210
But there was a long time in there.
Whereas like,

2779
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:18,230
what are we doing?
Yeah.

2780
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:23,280
So it's really easy when you finally do
get that opportunity to want to shortcut

2781
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:26,140
from seeing it,
to holding the antlers in your hands and

2782
02:00:26,141 --> 02:00:28,780
being successful.
And that's where people rush it.

2783
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,740
They get back and they just want to get
that air.

2784
02:00:30,741 --> 02:00:34,090
A lot of it's way anxiety cause as
sooner an arrow can be going towards

2785
02:00:34,091 --> 02:00:37,600
that animal that feel like the closer
they are to holding that animal to make

2786
02:00:37,601 --> 02:00:38,434
it a good shot.

2787
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:40,140
But man,
you still have to go.

2788
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:42,190
If you,
you can't skip a step.

2789
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:45,370
Anxiety's a crazy thing man.
Yeah,

2790
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:49,370
it's a crazy thing.
It's like that adrenaline and that the

2791
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:53,200
feeling of discomfort.
It is like this like uncertainty

2792
02:00:53,201 --> 02:00:54,260
feeling.
Yeah.

2793
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:56,290
It's just very hard for people to
handle.

2794
02:00:56,291 --> 02:01:00,190
But that's with the case of the anything
where you have to perform anything where

2795
02:01:00,191 --> 02:01:02,440
it's difficult to do,
where you're just like,

2796
02:01:02,441 --> 02:01:03,400
oh my God,
is it happening?

2797
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,251
It's happening right now.
Well,

2798
02:01:04,251 --> 02:01:07,030
ah yeah.
The brain is so,

2799
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:10,300
it's wired with all these different
chemicals that are excreta.

2800
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:13,600
When that,
when that moment's happening,

2801
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:18,400
when when there's a this final event,
this is it.

2802
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:21,460
Here it is.
All my God ready action.

2803
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:26,520
That's where I think all the reps you've
put in paid off cause on that first

2804
02:01:26,681 --> 02:01:29,140
buck.
So it was 15 minutes into the hut.

2805
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:32,980
It was even Alec who's been doing that
for 30 years has never had a hunt that

2806
02:01:32,981 --> 02:01:35,410
played out that quickly,
that perfectly.

2807
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,900
But I think you told me,
um,

2808
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:40,220
I'm always,
I'm always trying to get into the,

2809
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,000
to the heads of other hunters and,
and just wanting to know what the

2810
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:46,640
thought process is.
But I think you told me that when you're

2811
02:01:46,641 --> 02:01:50,600
in bow range of that buck right out of
the gate on the early in the hunt,

2812
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:54,650
didn't you take a few deep breaths and
relaxed and you say that.

2813
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:55,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2814
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:59,510
And that's a lot of people,
their tents,

2815
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:01,550
their tents because there's so much
going on,

2816
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:05,030
they never relax and that shot is just
not going to be accurate.

2817
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:08,600
But when you can relax and then just
like in your backyard,

2818
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:12,170
you come and you focus,
you're just as calm as you've done a

2819
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:14,210
thousand times and you can pick that
spot,

2820
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,490
level,
that bubble and slowly squeeze that

2821
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:18,350
trigger.
That's when it works.

2822
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,330
That's super hard to do.

2823
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:24,860
Well it was,
it was happening so fast before we knew

2824
02:02:24,861 --> 02:02:27,350
it.
We kicked her shoes off and we're

2825
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:28,490
walking,
you know,

2826
02:02:28,491 --> 02:02:30,190
just with socks on.
Yeah.

2827
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:34,760
Just creeping through the grass and we
got to 45 yards and he's like,

2828
02:02:34,761 --> 02:02:35,780
do you want to get closer?
I'm like,

2829
02:02:35,781 --> 02:02:37,040
this is perfect.
Stop right here.

2830
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:38,060
Younger.
Got It.

2831
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:39,170
Yeah.
And I just went,

2832
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,490
just took a couple of deep ones.
Yeah.

2833
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:45,140
And it was feeding and then I'm like,
okay,

2834
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,030
I know what to do.
And just did it.

2835
02:02:47,031 --> 02:02:48,500
And when,
when they'll walk,

2836
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,050
when I heard the impact of the arrows
was like,

2837
02:02:51,051 --> 02:02:53,060
holy shit.
There it is.

2838
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:54,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

2839
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:56,690
That was a perfect execution.
Yeah.

2840
02:02:56,691 --> 02:02:58,670
It's a weird feeling,
man.

2841
02:02:58,671 --> 02:03:01,040
When does like did that really happen?
Did that really happen?

2842
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:03,680
Then we're standing over the the,
and then I sent you a picture of it.

2843
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:04,753
I said boom.

2844
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,650
Yeah.
And that was,

2845
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:08,240
I say,
perfect execution,

2846
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:12,290
not of killing the animal of the shot.
Is it perfect execution of the shot?

2847
02:03:12,291 --> 02:03:15,110
I'm not saying we were executing animals
that people don't understand.

2848
02:03:15,111 --> 02:03:16,820
It's hard to do.
It's not,

2849
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:23,080
there's so much physical action involved
in pulling a bow back and being in

2850
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:28,700
perfect position and making sure you're
not torquing the bow and leveling the

2851
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:32,600
bubble on the site and,
and pulling with the back muscles and

2852
02:03:32,601 --> 02:03:36,830
making sure everything's in line and
there's no flinching or extra movement

2853
02:03:36,831 --> 02:03:39,230
and you're concentrating on the exact
spot.

2854
02:03:39,231 --> 02:03:43,850
You want that Arrow to hit as the things
releasing all under extreme anxiety and

2855
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:45,560
pressure and this thing,
is it moving?

2856
02:03:45,561 --> 02:03:47,450
Is it going to keep walking?
What's going to happen?

2857
02:03:47,451 --> 02:03:50,960
And there's so much involved,
but the feeling when it's over the

2858
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:54,830
relief and then knowing that I'm going
to have this organic meat,

2859
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:57,890
it is the most delicious meat in the
world and I'm going to be cooking and I

2860
02:03:57,891 --> 02:03:58,720
can't wait to cook it.

2861
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,140
Yeah.
And I haven't cooked any of it,

2862
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:01,240
but,
um,

2863
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:02,870
I can't wait.
I'm going to cook some tonight.

2864
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,490
Yeah.
Well,

2865
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:05,421
I mean,
I think it's a,

2866
02:04:05,421 --> 02:04:09,350
it's a powerful experience for almost
anybody and it's one that I know not

2867
02:04:09,351 --> 02:04:11,620
everybody can hunt and under ray who
listens to this is,

2868
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:16,010
is probably ever going to hunt.
But those that do will understand,

2869
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:17,360
you know,
and it's not always going to be

2870
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:19,060
comfortable.
It's not always killing an animal,

2871
02:04:19,061 --> 02:04:22,550
is not,
people aren't going to have warm and

2872
02:04:22,551 --> 02:04:24,830
fuzzy feelings about seeing an animal
dead,

2873
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,980
but they are going to,
there's something about taking

2874
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:31,070
responsibility for the meat that you're
eating.

2875
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:34,880
And that's going to be,
I don't know if relief is the right

2876
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,350
word,
but it's,

2877
02:04:36,351 --> 02:04:39,660
uh,
it's just that connection that I think

2878
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,490
they're gonna it's gonna make more
sense.

2879
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:44,400
Well,
one thing that confuses people with you

2880
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:48,930
is when they find out that you run ultra
marathons and you're working out all the

2881
02:04:48,931 --> 02:04:50,580
time,
like why is he doing all that stuff?

2882
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:51,121
You're like,
well,

2883
02:04:51,121 --> 02:04:55,050
I do that to be my very best when I'm in
the mountains,

2884
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:57,150
when I'm hunting people.
I've seen people go,

2885
02:04:57,151 --> 02:04:58,260
what?
Like,

2886
02:04:58,290 --> 02:04:59,070
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2887
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:02,100
You work out every day,
you run twice a day,

2888
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:06,060
you run ultra marathons,
but to test yourself so that when you're

2889
02:05:06,061 --> 02:05:08,340
hunting,
you could be at your very best.

2890
02:05:08,341 --> 02:05:09,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

2891
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,720
That's right.
I don't think people understand how much

2892
02:05:12,721 --> 02:05:14,730
it means to me.
Uh,

2893
02:05:14,910 --> 02:05:17,820
I feel like I owe it to the animal to be
at my best.

2894
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:23,510
I feel like if the animal suffers longer
than then I believe it should.

2895
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:28,320
That's,
I don't like dealing with that.

2896
02:05:28,321 --> 02:05:30,370
I don't like that.
So I feel like I,

2897
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:34,440
there's a weight of that on my shoulder,
shoulders where I need to be at my best

2898
02:05:34,441 --> 02:05:36,960
as a hunter.
And to do that,

2899
02:05:36,961 --> 02:05:40,080
I put in work,
I prepare every day and I just want to

2900
02:05:40,081 --> 02:05:44,190
know that I'm going to be merciful when
it comes time to kill the animal.

2901
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:48,060
But you're also going to be in shape
enough to get to position to get to the

2902
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:50,460
animal and have your heart rate dropped
down.

2903
02:05:50,461 --> 02:05:52,170
And also the state calm.
Yeah.

2904
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,540
This is why you do so much cardio.
Yeah.

2905
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:55,381
Yup.
And uh,

2906
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:56,430
you know,
on this hunt,

2907
02:05:56,460 --> 02:06:00,150
I've felt all that worked out exactly
how it was supposed to.

2908
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,840
Um,
quick,

2909
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:05,370
very quick clean deaths and then,
you know,

2910
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:07,650
like in the buck that I killed just a
couple of days ago,

2911
02:06:07,651 --> 02:06:09,390
that second buck,
I was able to,

2912
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:12,120
you know,
there's something about putting the a

2913
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:14,940
dead animal on your shoulders and
packing it out that uh,

2914
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,070
you know,
it's just part of the process.

2915
02:06:17,071 --> 02:06:18,900
It just feels right.
Yeah.

2916
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:22,350
But for a lot of people that seem so
crazy,

2917
02:06:22,351 --> 02:06:23,041
like,
wait a minute,

2918
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:27,540
you run a marathon a day so that you
could be in shape to go hunting.

2919
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,190
Yeah.
Can't you just go hunting?

2920
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,080
You can.
A lot of people do.

2921
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:32,670
I'm not,
I'm not here.

2922
02:06:32,730 --> 02:06:36,180
I'm not here to judge anybody or to tell
somebody that they need to do what I do

2923
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:39,270
or they're doing it wrong.
I'm saying that's what people that,

2924
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:41,820
you know,
hunting is such a personal journey.

2925
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:45,270
You know,
when people say maybe hunting is fun for

2926
02:06:45,271 --> 02:06:49,050
some people,
maybe for some people it is fun to kill

2927
02:06:49,051 --> 02:06:49,950
an animal.
I don't know.

2928
02:06:49,951 --> 02:06:51,900
For me it's not,
and people said,

2929
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,130
Oh,
you couldn't admit it.

2930
02:06:53,131 --> 02:06:54,150
It's fun.
I'm like,

2931
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,270
it's not fun.
It's like,

2932
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,710
I know what it means to me.
What it means to me is I need to be at

2933
02:06:58,711 --> 02:07:02,130
my very best to be at my very best.
I need to run a marathon a day.

2934
02:07:02,131 --> 02:07:04,560
I need to work harder than I've ever
worked.

2935
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:07,560
So I'm at the top of my game on the
hunt.

2936
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:12,660
I don't care what you think about that.
Or I don't care about your mindset.

2937
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:14,310
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about me.

2938
02:07:14,670 --> 02:07:16,260
And that's,
people have a hard time with that.

2939
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,020
Will they have a hard time believe in
first of all that you run a marathon a

2940
02:07:19,021 --> 02:07:20,400
day.
Even you saying that,

2941
02:07:20,401 --> 02:07:21,840
I'm like,
imagine if I didn't know this guy.

2942
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:23,340
I feel like he's full of Shit.
Yeah.

2943
02:07:23,341 --> 02:07:25,140
And it's not a fucking meme on her
marathon.

2944
02:07:25,141 --> 02:07:27,000
He's supposed to take six months off and
do nothing.

2945
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:28,880
It's true.
It's true.

2946
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,581
Say,
yeah,

2947
02:07:29,581 --> 02:07:30,450
it's true.
You know,

2948
02:07:30,451 --> 02:07:33,120
it's a man,
you know,

2949
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:36,040
and it's not all at what time.
It's what I do is I get

2950
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,840
up in the morning,
I'll get six miles done faster,

2951
02:07:38,841 --> 02:07:40,050
cardio,
uh,

2952
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:42,310
and people.
Then people also like to,

2953
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:44,410
to say why they don't do it is because,
well,

2954
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:46,210
I spend time with my family.
It's like,

2955
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:48,820
shut the fuck up.
I spent time with my family too.

2956
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:50,920
So anyway,
I get up while they're still sleeping,

2957
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:52,540
they're sleeping.
What am I supposed to do?

2958
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:54,700
So let's go lay in bed by him.
Wait,

2959
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,890
come on.
I want to spend time with you.

2960
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,753
Yeah,
yeah,

2961
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,190
yeah.
So I go before anybody's up.

2962
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:03,820
The second time I run is that lunch and
I got to get out of the office.

2963
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:08,560
I got a regular nine to five job.
Drives me insane because I'm meant to be

2964
02:08:08,561 --> 02:08:09,670
in the mountains.
But Hey,

2965
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:11,770
I got a job.
It's the best job I've ever had.

2966
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:13,930
I'm,
I want to do a good job for the company

2967
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:14,510
I work for.

2968
02:08:14,510 --> 02:08:17,260
Been there 21 years,
but to be at my best there,

2969
02:08:17,261 --> 02:08:19,330
I need a break at lunch.
So I say,

2970
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:20,650
they'd said,
well,

2971
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:22,870
Hey,
do you want to be superintendent of the

2972
02:08:22,871 --> 02:08:24,010
water department?
I'm like,

2973
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:25,840
yeah,
I'll be superintendent,

2974
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:28,630
but I'm going to run every day at lunch.
And if they would've said,

2975
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:29,291
no,
you can't do that.

2976
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:29,711
I'm like,
well,

2977
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:31,360
I'm not going to be superintendent then.
But they said,

2978
02:08:31,361 --> 02:08:31,721
okay,
yeah,

2979
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:32,710
you can do that.
I'm like,

2980
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:33,670
all right,
I'll come in early,

2981
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:34,990
I'll stay late,
we'll make it work.

2982
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,420
So I,
that's my second one.

2983
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:39,400
I can't spend time with my family at
lunch.

2984
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,830
They're not going to come to my work and
sit in the lunch room with me.

2985
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,120
So I go running.
Um,

2986
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:46,660
and how far do you run at lunch?
At lunch,

2987
02:08:46,661 --> 02:08:48,310
I'll try to get,
if I,

2988
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,550
if I'm trying to get a marathon done a
day,

2989
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:53,110
I don't go to the mountain.

2990
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:55,450
I just go flat and I get at least 13
dental lunch.

2991
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:58,810
So combined 19.
Yep.

2992
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,620
Before you even get home.
So then the last run of the day,

2993
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:05,980
on my way home from work,
I'll go to the mountain and I'll get

2994
02:09:05,981 --> 02:09:10,750
that last seven or eight done.
And that's free runs a day.

2995
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:14,290
And that'll be a marathon a day.
That's a lot of fucking running now.

2996
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:18,010
It's not,
it's not for you because it was fine.

2997
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:21,010
I don't feel,
I feel 100% healthy.

2998
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:24,160
I don't feel banged up.
I don't feel anything.

2999
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:26,200
And I,
that's a question I always get.

3000
02:09:26,201 --> 02:09:27,034
Well,
how do you,

3001
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:27,963
people say,
well,

3002
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:32,020
how do you recover and how do you,
or do you have so much muscle at?

3003
02:09:32,021 --> 02:09:33,760
First of all,
I weigh 170 pounds.

3004
02:09:33,761 --> 02:09:36,040
I'm not,
I don't have like muscle everywhere.

3005
02:09:36,041 --> 02:09:39,850
So I'm not big.
But I also eat meat all the time.

3006
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:40,810
Every day.
You know,

3007
02:09:40,811 --> 02:09:44,200
you talked about the lions and wherever
with the river and they were eating just

3008
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:46,810
buffalo and they were jacked.
You got to have protein.

3009
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:51,340
So if you can run a marathon a day,
if you're eating salad,

3010
02:09:51,341 --> 02:09:53,490
you're going to wait 140 pounds.
Okay?

3011
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:57,520
If you run a marathon a day and you're
eating steak three times a day,

3012
02:09:57,521 --> 02:09:59,620
you're going to retain some muscle.
So that's what I do.

3013
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,970
I know what my body needs for calories,
and I know when I'm at my best,

3014
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:07,060
it's when I have excess calories to
burn.

3015
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:09,280
So that's what I do.
I make sure I'm eating nonstop.

3016
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,500
But you're also lifting weights.
I do.

3017
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:14,440
How do you have the time to do all this?
I'm like listening to the schedule.

3018
02:10:14,441 --> 02:10:15,580
I'm like,
this is ridiculous.

3019
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:17,140
And then you shoot your bow.
Yeah.

3020
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:18,740
And then you hang out with your family.
Yeah.

3021
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,470
What?
And so campaigns,

3022
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:24,780
the family,
the family time is about from a c I'll

3023
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:29,790
get home at about six 30 till about and
then everybody will be going to bed at

3024
02:10:31,601 --> 02:10:33,740
10 so that's Fox time.

3025
02:10:35,230 --> 02:10:37,000
You know there's duck,
oh,

3026
02:10:37,001 --> 02:10:38,890
you fucking watches Fox News.
Well,

3027
02:10:38,891 --> 02:10:41,150
in the evenings,
that's really what you watch.

3028
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:43,360
We watched the coins.
Goddamn,

3029
02:10:43,361 --> 02:10:45,350
these liberals,
we like watch the voice.

3030
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:47,620
No.
Or American Luke's on the American art

3031
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,660
or on American idol.
Luke Bryan's on there.

3032
02:10:49,661 --> 02:10:51,640
So we'll actually have a little bit
sometimes my daughter.

3033
02:10:51,850 --> 02:10:55,510
So that's what me and my daughter do.
She loves the voice and uh,

3034
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:59,230
and so it's fine.
It's fine to get into that.

3035
02:10:59,231 --> 02:11:01,570
So that's what I do.
And I can,

3036
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:04,960
if I'm just doing the close reps,
like during the workweek,

3037
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:07,450
it's generally just out of my house,
just you know,

3038
02:11:07,451 --> 02:11:10,630
20 yards shooting my bow and that's,
and it's just,

3039
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:15,160
and then when I'll lift on Monday,
Wednesday,

3040
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:20,160
Friday I lift right after work and I'll
go outlaw strength and you know,

3041
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:23,140
sometimes nick the trainer Dude hammered
out,

3042
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:27,190
I'll take it home at the same time.
So on those days I'm not going to get a

3043
02:11:27,191 --> 02:11:31,180
marathon done a day on those three days.
Do you feel like shit on those days

3044
02:11:31,181 --> 02:11:32,440
because you didn't get your marathon
then?

3045
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:35,090
No,
because lifting his heart they lifted in

3046
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:35,980
his hard.
But I,

3047
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:38,290
I in the back,
I'll be honest,

3048
02:11:38,291 --> 02:11:40,900
I'm not normal,
I get it.

3049
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:46,230
But in the back of my mind I'm thinking
I kind of suck a little bit cause I

3050
02:11:46,601 --> 02:11:47,620
didn't get a marathon done.

3051
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:51,150
That is so crazy.
Yeah.

3052
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:54,670
That's my thinking.
Like when you run an ultra and to save,

3053
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:58,940
you run a hundred miles or more.
When w w what kind of demons are going

3054
02:11:58,941 --> 02:12:01,040
through your head when you're out there
running?

3055
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:02,190
Um,
I don't,

3056
02:12:02,191 --> 02:12:03,720
I don't know if it's,
I don't know what it is.

3057
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:04,500
It's a

3058
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,310
like the Moab to 40.
You rent 238 miles in three days.

3059
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,450
What were you thinking while you were at
day two and a half?

3060
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,350
Thinking is I'm,
I'm honoring myself by getting the

3061
02:12:16,351 --> 02:12:18,540
absolute most out of my,
I don't think I've,

3062
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:23,070
I've reached my limit I think.
I think if you're not getting the most

3063
02:12:23,071 --> 02:12:24,450
out of your body,
you're not,

3064
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:26,940
you're not taking advantage of your
life,

3065
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:30,480
that you're not honoring your life.
So to me,

3066
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:36,450
I need to find what my limit is.
I can't halfway it.

3067
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,640
I can't halfway because I feel like then
I'm not,

3068
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:40,373
man,
that's not,

3069
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:43,080
I dunno,
I can't live with myself if I,

3070
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:44,690
if I don't feel like I've,
I'm giving,

3071
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:46,710
I have given everything that I have.

3072
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:50,900
The weird thing about running is like as
you run more,

3073
02:12:50,901 --> 02:12:55,190
your capacity to run more increases.
So you realize like,

3074
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:59,390
oh,
like the body has more capability than

3075
02:12:59,391 --> 02:13:03,950
you think because you just have to get
accustomed to this amount of work and

3076
02:13:03,951 --> 02:13:07,370
then you can just do it all the time and
then it gets used to it and then it

3077
02:13:07,371 --> 02:13:10,940
grows and expands.
And then your threshold and what your

3078
02:13:10,941 --> 02:13:13,100
expectations are.
They increased too.

3079
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:17,240
So in the beginning you were saying that
when you first started running,

3080
02:13:17,241 --> 02:13:19,880
like running a five k is like,
holy shit,

3081
02:13:19,881 --> 02:13:21,800
this is hard.
Or a 10 K is brutal.

3082
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:23,180
You would never think like,
man,

3083
02:13:23,181 --> 02:13:26,600
can I do a marathon now?
You're fucking doing a marathon every

3084
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:27,560
day.
Yeah.

3085
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,720
And this is the same person.
It's not like,

3086
02:13:29,721 --> 02:13:30,361
you know,
you are.

3087
02:13:30,361 --> 02:13:32,250
I've always,
first time I started running,

3088
02:13:32,251 --> 02:13:34,290
I ran a fucking ultra marathon.
You know,

3089
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:34,690
it's not,

3090
02:13:34,690 --> 02:13:35,291
no,
no,

3091
02:13:35,291 --> 02:13:35,591
no,
no.

3092
02:13:35,591 --> 02:13:36,341
And that's,
I mean,

3093
02:13:36,341 --> 02:13:38,740
that's everything.
That's everybody and everything.

3094
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:42,580
You work up to it.
And so that it's no different from me.

3095
02:13:42,581 --> 02:13:47,581
I just feel like I'm finally getting to
my potential and I wasted a lot of years

3096
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:52,240
not living up to my potential.
So I,

3097
02:13:52,810 --> 02:13:54,870
when I do the running videos and I'm
smiling,

3098
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:57,550
I'm in a good mood.
That's genuine cause I'm like,

3099
02:13:57,551 --> 02:14:00,160
this is my potential.
You know,

3100
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:03,880
I can't be happy sitting at home
watching t I'm going to do it because I

3101
02:14:03,881 --> 02:14:06,250
love my family.
I'm going to hang out and do that,

3102
02:14:06,490 --> 02:14:09,670
but I can't be,
I don't feel like that's my potential.

3103
02:14:10,730 --> 02:14:14,390
This,
this is the thing that I think is very

3104
02:14:14,391 --> 02:14:17,420
important for people like you and I
think a lot of people,

3105
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:21,470
it's that in achieving goals and in
pushing hard,

3106
02:14:21,770 --> 02:14:26,770
there's a release of anxiety that I
think overwhelmed a lot of people for

3107
02:14:28,581 --> 02:14:30,950
most of their life.
Most of,

3108
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:35,570
I know a lot of people that are
overwhelmed by anxiety and most of those

3109
02:14:35,571 --> 02:14:38,690
people that I know that are overwhelmed
by anxiety don't push themselves.

3110
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:43,730
I think there's a connection there and I
think that physically pushing yourself

3111
02:14:43,731 --> 02:14:48,290
to your limit all the time,
whether it's lifting weights or Jujitsu

3112
02:14:48,291 --> 02:14:50,960
or running or whatever,
you do that strenuous,

3113
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:55,790
I think it's a requirement for the human
body that we think of as an option.

3114
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:58,190
I don't think it's an option.
I don't think so.

3115
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:00,440
Especially not for mental health.
I think.

3116
02:15:00,441 --> 02:15:02,240
I think it's really critical.
I think.

3117
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:05,360
I think really hard exercises.
One,

3118
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:08,720
and I don't care what you do,
whether you're swimming or whatever you

3119
02:15:08,721 --> 02:15:10,880
like,
whatever you enjoy mountain biking.

3120
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:15,830
But I think really hard exercise is one
of the most important requirements for

3121
02:15:15,831 --> 02:15:17,360
like a happy,
healthy life.

3122
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:18,553
I really do.

3123
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:20,010
I think,
you know,

3124
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:25,000
man,
I could say that maybe I tried to

3125
02:15:25,001 --> 02:15:29,680
justify what I do to try to put logic to
it.

3126
02:15:29,890 --> 02:15:32,680
And maybe even what you're saying is,
is,

3127
02:15:33,730 --> 02:15:36,340
is a little bit of justification.
I don't know.

3128
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:40,390
So I dunno if what I do is right or what
we should be doing.

3129
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:43,150
I don't know.
I just know how I feel when I do it,

3130
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:46,990
but that doesn't mean I don't have
regret sometimes.

3131
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:50,080
Like even with my kids now that they're
older and,

3132
02:15:50,081 --> 02:15:51,340
uh,
you know,

3133
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,730
I,
I really struggled wondering if the

3134
02:15:54,731 --> 02:15:59,731
message I had been sending to my family
about average is a failure.

3135
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:06,030
If you're not giving your best,
you're not honoring your life basically.

3136
02:16:06,190 --> 02:16:10,270
And then I'm like,
maybe that's okay for some people.

3137
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:13,930
Maybe not everybody needs to run a
marathon a day and they're fine and

3138
02:16:13,931 --> 02:16:14,764
they're happy.
It's like,

3139
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:17,500
who am I to say what makes somebody else
happy?

3140
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:20,920
Just like I get mad when somebody tells
me how I should feel.

3141
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:23,560
I can't say why they need.
And so then I was like,

3142
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:28,680
here's my kids.
My boys who are great young men strong,

3143
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,870
um,
have all the potential in the world.

3144
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,840
Have I somehow have,
I said,

3145
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:38,140
being just a regular guy who has a job
when it comes home,

3146
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,940
there's something wrong with that.
And I'm like,

3147
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:42,130
God did I screw up?
And it's just like,

3148
02:16:42,131 --> 02:16:45,340
that's really been bothered.
Cause my son quit a good job as a

3149
02:16:45,341 --> 02:16:49,240
deputy,
my oldest and he joined the army because

3150
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:53,620
he says he has more to offer this world.
That's hard.

3151
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:58,910
Is it hard because well it's hard first
of all because your son is joining the

3152
02:16:58,911 --> 02:17:00,740
military and you're like,
wow,

3153
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:03,440
my son could go to combat and I could
lose him.

3154
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:07,010
Yeah.
But is it also hard because you feel

3155
02:17:07,011 --> 02:17:12,011
like your high expectations for yourself
might have set a bar for him then maybe

3156
02:17:14,961 --> 02:17:18,500
doesn't line up with his initial
expectations?

3157
02:17:18,501 --> 02:17:22,400
You've made him think that whatever
might have made him happy before is not

3158
02:17:22,401 --> 02:17:22,780
good.

3159
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:23,830
Right.
And that I,

3160
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:25,000
that's what I thought.
And I,

3161
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:25,960
you know,
I was like,

3162
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:29,020
it was,
uh,

3163
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:31,660
it was hard to deal with when he was
leaving.

3164
02:17:31,661 --> 02:17:33,340
And I'm like,
God,

3165
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:35,080
what did I do?
Right.

3166
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:35,973
And,
uh,

3167
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,900
so,
you know,

3168
02:17:37,901 --> 02:17:39,400
I told him,
you know,

3169
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:42,130
I,
I'm sorry if I ever made you feel that

3170
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:46,300
that being a regular average person,
there was something wrong with that.

3171
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:49,360
And he said,
you know,

3172
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:53,080
the example that I've set growing up was
that,

3173
02:17:53,081 --> 02:17:57,010
uh,
to work hard and achieve big goals and,

3174
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:59,770
and that's,
and that's what he wants to do.

3175
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,230
And so he,
he said,

3176
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:03,970
you know,
he said that was for him.

3177
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:06,280
And then my,
my younger son,

3178
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:09,640
who's in his third year of college now,
he,

3179
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,740
I had the same talk with him and I just
said,

3180
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,574
um,
you know,

3181
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:16,900
I'm sorry if if I've done something to
make it feel like,

3182
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:18,430
you know,
being,

3183
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:22,150
being average was a failure.
And he said that,

3184
02:18:22,151 --> 02:18:24,040
uh,
he wants to graduate and he wants to

3185
02:18:24,041 --> 02:18:28,150
join the service and maybe try to go to
special forces too for the same reason.

3186
02:18:28,151 --> 02:18:30,340
And so I dunno,
I dunno.

3187
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:34,090
They don't act,
they act completely fine with it and

3188
02:18:34,091 --> 02:18:34,924
they'd love,
you know,

3189
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:39,340
they love working hard and have big
goals to achieve and um,

3190
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:44,260
that part feels good.
But sometimes I wonder if,

3191
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:46,090
you know,
I dunno,

3192
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:47,650
I just second guess myself,
I guess.

3193
02:18:49,350 --> 02:18:50,290
Yeah,
it's hard,

3194
02:18:50,291 --> 02:18:51,124
high expertise

3195
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:53,940
and you put on kids,
it's very difficult.

3196
02:18:53,941 --> 02:18:56,160
Like you want to say,
I just want them to be happy.

3197
02:18:56,550 --> 02:19:00,070
I just want them to live their lives on
their path and everyone,

3198
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:03,520
like every kid has their own personality
and you know,

3199
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:06,570
your three kids are all uniquely
different in their own way.

3200
02:19:06,571 --> 02:19:09,180
And who's to say,
who's to say?

3201
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:12,510
I think all you can do is live by
example and,

3202
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:16,620
and support them and let them make the
choices that they decided to make.

3203
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:19,830
The problem is the choices that they've
made are,

3204
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:21,960
you know,
very stressful and very dangerous.

3205
02:19:21,961 --> 02:19:23,710
And you know,
I mean it might turn out to,

3206
02:19:23,711 --> 02:19:28,010
they might turn out like Tim Kennedy or
someone like Andy Stumpf be an awesome

3207
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,120
human being,
but it's for you as a parent,

3208
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:37,070
this is this incredibly stressful
pressure filled situation where you have

3209
02:19:37,071 --> 02:19:40,670
to reevaluate how you raised them.
And what I always,

3210
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,030
my,
what I told them growing up always was,

3211
02:19:44,031 --> 02:19:47,240
I don't care if you're the best at
whatever you're doing,

3212
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:50,750
but cause,
cause not everybody can be the best.

3213
02:19:50,751 --> 02:19:53,480
But I said,
just give your best just be or best.

3214
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:56,030
And so that's where I see if they're
coasting or whatever.

3215
02:19:56,031 --> 02:19:57,920
I'm like,
I think he got some more,

3216
02:19:58,010 --> 02:20:00,850
you got some more in you.
And that's all I ever wanted.

3217
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:03,140
But the things about people that coast
about stuff,

3218
02:20:03,141 --> 02:20:08,030
if they have like a thought of doing
better and they just don't put in the

3219
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:09,350
effort,
they feel like shit.

3220
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:10,190
Yeah.
You know,

3221
02:20:10,190 --> 02:20:11,900
you,
they feel like shit for you telling them

3222
02:20:11,901 --> 02:20:13,700
that,
but they feel like shit for shit,

3223
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:15,300
for not doing well to yeah.

3224
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:17,450
Yeah.
Especially if they have ambition.

3225
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:21,560
If he unrealized potential as a fairy
fucking horrible feeling,

3226
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:24,500
you know,
unrealized potential and unrealized

3227
02:20:24,501 --> 02:20:27,410
expectations are just,
it's like this feeling that you haven't

3228
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:29,000
done enough,
we'll keep you up at night.

3229
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:31,280
It will fuck with your head.
And that's,

3230
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:35,600
I just know how I felt,
not giving all I got and I,

3231
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:39,050
I don't want,
I didn't want my kids to feel like that,

3232
02:20:39,051 --> 02:20:42,230
so I was just like,
make sure you're giving your best,

3233
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:44,390
be your best.
That's it.

3234
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,610
And,
um,

3235
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:48,230
but then I,
then I was like,

3236
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:49,820
what am I done?
Yeah.

3237
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:52,190
So it's,
you know,

3238
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:54,650
I can only speak for myself.
Um,

3239
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:55,520
you know,
when I,

3240
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,310
when it,
when tanner was born,

3241
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:00,350
I was young.
Um,

3242
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,350
I don't,
you know,

3243
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:04,640
being a parent,
it's like,

3244
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:09,260
I feel like I'm better now than I was
when I was 24 years old.

3245
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,900
And um,
you know,

3246
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:14,540
hopefully I'm pretty,
maybe more,

3247
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:18,080
I'm different with my daughter.
She's also a girl.

3248
02:21:18,081 --> 02:21:19,190
So it's,
it is just,

3249
02:21:19,191 --> 02:21:20,840
that's different.
But man,

3250
02:21:20,841 --> 02:21:23,870
it's like there's no blueprint on how to
be the perfect parent,

3251
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,600
and now I'm like,
I hope I did okay.

3252
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:29,570
Yeah,
there's no blueprint.

3253
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:30,740
I mean,
what's the blueprint?

3254
02:21:30,741 --> 02:21:32,210
And be,
be honest.

3255
02:21:32,211 --> 02:21:36,800
Give them the best version of your
thoughts on life that you can give them,

3256
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:38,990
spend time with them when you can.
Yeah.

3257
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:41,150
Then what is the,
what is the blueprint?

3258
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:44,300
I mean,
just try to help them figure out their

3259
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:46,370
path in life.
And it's also hard too,

3260
02:21:46,371 --> 02:21:47,900
because you've got a full time job.
I mean,

3261
02:21:47,901 --> 02:21:51,800
how much time do you dedicate to them?
You know,

3262
02:21:51,801 --> 02:21:53,750
how much time can you have?
Yeah,

3263
02:21:53,751 --> 02:21:56,860
I mean it'd be be great if I'd be like,
Oh,

3264
02:21:56,861 --> 02:21:59,120
I'm not going to work anymore.
I'm just going to hang out with the kids

3265
02:21:59,121 --> 02:22:00,260
all day.
I mean,

3266
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:01,730
it's not realistic.
Yeah.

3267
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:06,410
And you can't do it.
And then also to be the example I felt

3268
02:22:06,411 --> 02:22:11,411
like I would need to set for the kids so
they'd believe they can achieve whatever

3269
02:22:12,291 --> 02:22:14,570
they wanted to.
I had to put in work myself.

3270
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:19,820
I can't say you can be amazing.
While I'm half asking stuff.

3271
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:23,870
When you say that you didn't reach your
full potential until like later in life,

3272
02:22:23,871 --> 02:22:25,980
like when do you feel like that was?
I

3273
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,910
haven't,
no,

3274
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:30,900
but I mean like you realize that you
like really pushing to reach your full

3275
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:31,860
potential.
Now.

3276
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:35,460
I still don't think I have,
I buy you're pushing towards it.

3277
02:22:35,570 --> 02:22:36,070
Yeah,
I'm,

3278
02:22:36,070 --> 02:22:37,170
I'm,
I'm doing more.

3279
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:38,730
And so I'm,
when did that change?

3280
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:44,790
Um,
God,

3281
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:47,610
I don't know.
Maybe,

3282
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:52,380
maybe when I did my first hundred,
so that's 2009 I felt what,

3283
02:22:53,310 --> 02:22:55,740
what sacrifice real sacrifice was.
And

3284
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:58,470
I dunno,
I,

3285
02:22:58,471 --> 02:23:02,160
you know,
hard hunts when Roy and I would do super

3286
02:23:02,161 --> 02:23:05,460
hard hunts,
I'd felt like I was given all I got

3287
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:08,130
backpack haunts into the back country.
Yeah.

3288
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:10,050
2008.
I mean,

3289
02:23:10,051 --> 02:23:12,690
I always did.
I did hard hunts by myself and Eagle

3290
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:14,550
Cap,
but there's not really a great chance of

3291
02:23:14,551 --> 02:23:16,230
dying in the Eagle Cap.
You know,

3292
02:23:16,231 --> 02:23:18,420
it's a,
you could,

3293
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:20,160
but,
um,

3294
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:23,520
you know,
that I felt like I was,

3295
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:27,900
I was given all I had on,
on the hunts that required the most of

3296
02:23:27,901 --> 02:23:30,030
me.
And then at that same time,

3297
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:33,120
so that was 2007,
2008.

3298
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:36,600
Um,
then at the same time I was also ramping

3299
02:23:36,601 --> 02:23:40,800
up what I did with running and pushing
my body 100 milers and things like that

3300
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:43,400
because you realize that you needed more
endurance.

3301
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:46,010
I just realized that I had,
I had,

3302
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:48,380
I had,
I've been doing what I've been telling

3303
02:23:48,381 --> 02:23:50,600
my kids not to do.
I've been coasting,

3304
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,440
you know,
it still was more than a lot of people

3305
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:56,510
are doing.
But to me it felt like I wasn't living

3306
02:23:56,511 --> 02:23:58,580
up to my full potential.
So I'm like,

3307
02:23:58,670 --> 02:23:59,870
you know,
I want to do more.

3308
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:03,680
And then that led to my lab and um,
and when I,

3309
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:07,940
when I meet people and see people that
are doing amazing things,

3310
02:24:07,941 --> 02:24:10,250
it's just,
it shows me what's possible.

3311
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:12,740
And so that's why I know I can,
I have more offer.

3312
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:15,570
That's a fascinating thing.
But you know,

3313
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:20,310
used to take these steps towards this
journey and then you realize as you're

3314
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:24,690
making these steps that your capacity
for work is increasing.

3315
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:27,840
So you have to push yourself further to
test your body.

3316
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:28,980
And then,
you know,

3317
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:30,840
a,
a marathon seems out of reach,

3318
02:24:30,841 --> 02:24:32,850
but then a marathon becomes a normal
thing.

3319
02:24:33,150 --> 02:24:38,150
And then a 50 miler and then a hundred
miler than the 205 mile and a 238 mile

3320
02:24:38,681 --> 02:24:40,170
hour.
And now you were talking the other day

3321
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:42,600
with,
I guess candace was considering a 500

3322
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:43,680
miler.
Yeah,

3323
02:24:43,681 --> 02:24:45,300
yeah.
She asked and I know,

3324
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:46,980
uh,
that Shit's ridiculous.

3325
02:24:48,850 --> 02:24:52,790
And I said,
both said we do it and it would just be

3326
02:24:52,791 --> 02:24:54,410
amazing.
It would be,

3327
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,120
you know,
Walter.

3328
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3329
02:24:57,501 --> 02:24:58,640
And so that's,
I mean,

3330
02:24:58,641 --> 02:25:03,641
that's what people that do those type of
races live for the next big challenge.

3331
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:05,510
And you know,
when you haven't,

3332
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:08,600
when he can cross a finish line,
like I did Moab and Courtney did she,

3333
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:09,331
you know,
dominate,

3334
02:25:09,331 --> 02:25:12,020
she had a great race and that race,
but she,

3335
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:13,700
you know,
when you can finish a finish line and

3336
02:25:13,701 --> 02:25:15,080
you're smiling,
you're like,

3337
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,360
ah.
Dot.

3338
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:17,810
A little more.
Got some more left.

3339
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,940
So,
so that's why,

3340
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:24,670
you know,
the sound of something epic 500

3341
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:28,930
nonstop is,
is so incredible.

3342
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:32,650
That sounds so insane that you'd run 238
miles.

3343
02:25:32,651 --> 02:25:34,960
It'd be basically halfway done.
Yeah,

3344
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:36,430
that sounds stupid.
I know.

3345
02:25:36,431 --> 02:25:38,950
But listen,
when we were a hundred miles in,

3346
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,440
yeah,
a hundred miles is a long way.

3347
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:43,360
And I told my brother was with me,
Taylor.

3348
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:45,370
I go,
you know,

3349
02:25:45,371 --> 02:25:46,750
it's,
it's a different thought when you're not

3350
02:25:46,751 --> 02:25:48,790
even halfway and you've just done a
hundred.

3351
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:52,090
100 is hertz.
Yeah.

3352
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:54,760
But you're not halfway.
So it's the same thing.

3353
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:55,600
It's a,
it's really not that.

3354
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:58,120
It's just a change in mindset.
How many days do you think you need to

3355
02:25:58,121 --> 02:25:58,960
run?
500.

3356
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,450
Well,
I need a year.

3357
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:03,100
Can I do that?
Yeah.

3358
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:05,110
Can I have a year?
I need 10 hours of sleep at night.

3359
02:26:05,111 --> 02:26:08,960
I was listening to the Matthew Walker
Dr. Matthew Walker said 10 hours.

3360
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:10,330
Just like God.
Yeah.

3361
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:12,600
Courtney told me she slept one minute.
Yes.

3362
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:13,853
Yeah,
I had,

3363
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:14,621
I had,
uh,

3364
02:26:14,621 --> 02:26:15,130
one,
uh,

3365
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:15,670
no,
she,

3366
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:17,170
she slept 27 minutes total.

3367
02:26:17,170 --> 02:26:19,600
She laid down for 20 minutes and she
couldn't sleep.

3368
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:21,400
Yeah.
And then the one time that she slept,

3369
02:26:21,401 --> 02:26:23,470
she slept for one minute.
I did that exact,

3370
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:28,150
Taylor was there and I did the exact
same thing for one minute because he was

3371
02:26:28,151 --> 02:26:31,690
watching the watch and I fell asleep.
There's a picture and I woke up.

3372
02:26:31,691 --> 02:26:33,400
I was like,
how long was I sleep?

3373
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:34,810
He goes a minute.
I'm like,

3374
02:26:34,811 --> 02:26:36,640
what's the go?
And for whatever reason,

3375
02:26:36,641 --> 02:26:39,970
that minute it does something,
I don't know what does it do?

3376
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:40,960
But she's,
she had,

3377
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:43,210
I don't have no idea.
Said she woke up and she was angry that

3378
02:26:43,211 --> 02:26:45,610
they let her sleep so long.
Whoever was there,

3379
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:47,950
she thought it was longer and he was
like,

3380
02:26:47,951 --> 02:26:49,060
no,
you only slept for a minute.

3381
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:50,350
Oh Shit.
Well let's go.

3382
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:51,520
Yeah,
that's,

3383
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:54,250
that's one thing I learned in that first
200 I did,

3384
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:57,760
uh,
Richard won that race and that was a

3385
02:26:57,761 --> 02:27:01,840
mistake I made is um,
I was asking how,

3386
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:03,190
how long he'd been sleeping.

3387
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:05,350
That was what you said.
He sent me a quote,

3388
02:27:05,351 --> 02:27:08,320
but you said he'd go fucking Richard.
Cause he is like,

3389
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:12,460
and he said that he says I was the
greatest day of my life and Joe Rogan

3390
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:14,440
said,
fuck Richard Kessler.

3391
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:15,603
But,
uh,

3392
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,300
but he's,
he was sleeping short durations like 15

3393
02:27:19,301 --> 02:27:22,690
minutes and I didn't realize that your
body will reset that quick.

3394
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:25,210
You thought you needed to like an hour.
Yeah,

3395
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:26,500
yeah.
Makes Sense.

3396
02:27:26,590 --> 02:27:27,760
Yeah.
And plus,

3397
02:27:27,761 --> 02:27:28,690
you know,
I'm sitting here,

3398
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:32,230
it's not like it's,
I'm God,

3399
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:37,231
it's really hard to be good at ultra
marathoning and also be able to want to

3400
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:42,330
pack an elk.
I muscle weigh what I weigh is not going

3401
02:27:42,331 --> 02:27:45,580
to,
so I kind of throwing myself in the

3402
02:27:45,581 --> 02:27:50,080
category of Richard and in Courtney as
like can't my,

3403
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:54,190
I can't do it at what I do.
So I'm trying to be beat the best of

3404
02:27:54,191 --> 02:27:54,970
both worlds.

3405
02:27:54,970 --> 02:27:57,400
And it's just,
you're going to give up in both being

3406
02:27:57,401 --> 02:28:01,360
built like Zack bitter,
who's like one 440 is use ran.

3407
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:02,650
He,
he's the one who ran the,

3408
02:28:02,651 --> 02:28:07,651
he was on the podcast last week and he
ran the US record of a hundred miles in

3409
02:28:08,081 --> 02:28:13,081
11 hours and 40 minutes averaging seven
minutes and 41 or 702 what was it?

3410
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:17,000
Yeah.
So to me,

3411
02:28:17,010 --> 02:28:19,750
11 hours and 40 minutes.
So I think he ran,

3412
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:23,060
yeah,
seven minute crazy seconds per mile,

3413
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:24,590
which is right.
Fucking madness.

3414
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:25,520
That's,
that's amazing.

3415
02:28:25,521 --> 02:28:28,160
So fast.
And he's so impressive.

3416
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:30,230
And he's a mediator.
Oh,

3417
02:28:30,231 --> 02:28:31,570
is leads meet.
Oh,

3418
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:33,300
he's like basically on a carnivore diet.
He,

3419
02:28:33,301 --> 02:28:36,230
it's like steak constantly.
He's on a very high fat diet.

3420
02:28:36,590 --> 02:28:37,840
High Fat,
high stake,

3421
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:41,360
high stake and protein diet.
Yeah.

3422
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:42,860
Well it's so,
yeah.

3423
02:28:42,861 --> 02:28:46,700
I mean to be that,
to be the optimal endurance athlete,

3424
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,710
ultra endurance athlete in the
mountains,

3425
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:49,580
you need to be lighter.

3426
02:28:49,790 --> 02:28:50,361
Yeah.
I mean,

3427
02:28:50,361 --> 02:28:53,960
I'm just way too much.
But to be able to pack out an animal,

3428
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:55,880
you need to have some weight on.
I'm doing it to,

3429
02:28:56,050 --> 02:28:59,870
to be the best at hunting.
I'm not doing it to be the best runner.

3430
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:02,630
And I'm not saying I could be,
I don't have the talent that I,

3431
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:04,280
I'm pretty tough,
but I mean,

3432
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:06,830
they,
they're super tough and super talented.

3433
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:09,290
What is a talent for running?
What's the talent?

3434
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:11,180
Left foot.
Right foot.

3435
02:29:11,181 --> 02:29:12,080
Left foot.
Right foot.

3436
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:13,160
It's not,
you know what I'm saying?

3437
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:16,100
It's not like you're painting.
There's a talent there.

3438
02:29:16,101 --> 02:29:19,370
You know there's a [inaudible] it's
endurance.

3439
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,320
Yeah.
I don't know if that's a towel,

3440
02:29:21,321 --> 02:29:25,220
but it's theirs.
It's having great endurance is a thing.

3441
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:28,400
It's certainly a thing.
Yeah.

3442
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:32,240
And managing the body to get the most
out of that endurance.

3443
02:29:32,730 --> 02:29:35,930
Most of it is,
is in,

3444
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:39,890
Courtney said this too,
she didn't realize how far she could

3445
02:29:39,891 --> 02:29:41,990
push in the paint shoes in.

3446
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:46,990
So her first hundred she quit first
hundred mile or she dropped out of,

3447
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:48,650
because she was in pain.
That was it.

3448
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:50,750
And she's like,
I can't do this.

3449
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,750
And then she quit and she's like,
wait a second.

3450
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:57,590
I equipped for no reason.
I quit just because I was in pain.

3451
02:29:57,770 --> 02:30:02,000
So then after that she realized pain is
just part of the deal and has it quit

3452
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:05,630
since.
And so she just didn't realize that the

3453
02:30:05,631 --> 02:30:08,450
pain quotient of those races,
yeah.

3454
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:11,210
It doesn't feel good.
Just cause the full,

3455
02:30:11,230 --> 02:30:12,920
it doesn't feel good.
Doesn't mean you stop.

3456
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:14,330
Right.
Yeah.

3457
02:30:14,331 --> 02:30:15,320
So,
and that's,

3458
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:18,740
that's the key.
Most people can't push that push through

3459
02:30:18,741 --> 02:30:20,720
that amount of pain.
It hurts,

3460
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:22,820
you know,
it's the worst pain I've ever felt.

3461
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:26,720
But what hurts the most?
It depends.

3462
02:30:26,721 --> 02:30:29,210
It's like I've run and my foot started
hurting.

3463
02:30:29,211 --> 02:30:29,931
I'm like,
Oh my God,

3464
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:30,290
this is it.

3465
02:30:30,290 --> 02:30:32,270
I probably broke my foot,
maybe stress fracture.

3466
02:30:32,271 --> 02:30:33,830
Then all of a sudden my other knee
hurts.

3467
02:30:33,831 --> 02:30:34,740
I'm like,
oh my,

3468
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:38,060
okay my,
my ligament is got tight cause I got

3469
02:30:38,061 --> 02:30:40,160
dehydrated as rubbing on my bone.
And it's like,

3470
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,641
oh wait,
no,

3471
02:30:40,641 --> 02:30:44,330
this other right hip hurt.
It's just like everything hurts.

3472
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,940
Different things.
Your feet get beat up,

3473
02:30:46,941 --> 02:30:49,280
you get blisters,
you're getting dried out.

3474
02:30:49,281 --> 02:30:53,750
So things are just,
things are different in your body.

3475
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:58,850
Um,
like I got a bone on top of my foot that

3476
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:03,260
rubs and if I get dried out,
that stuff's not sliding well enough.

3477
02:31:03,261 --> 02:31:05,120
So that rubs in,
it swells up more.

3478
02:31:05,121 --> 02:31:08,120
So it's just like all sorts of things
happen.

3479
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:11,240
Yeah.
People want everything to feel good

3480
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:13,460
doing it.
Felt comfortable.

3481
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:15,620
And it does.
You shouldn't push too hard for about

3482
02:31:15,621 --> 02:31:17,600
five miles.
Just be comfortable.

3483
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,040
You should just be comfortable.

3484
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:21,630
Yeah.
So that's the biggest thing as people.

3485
02:31:22,170 --> 02:31:24,750
Um,
and you know,

3486
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:27,150
there's this guy too that's,
that's been following me.

3487
02:31:27,151 --> 02:31:28,500
I love,
I love the guy.

3488
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:31,590
And he's like,
so he sees a pictures,

3489
02:31:31,591 --> 02:31:33,300
he follows along.
He's like,

3490
02:31:33,301 --> 02:31:38,280
well I want to do a hundred miler and
cause it sounds amazing.

3491
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:40,240
Right.
And uh,

3492
02:31:40,590 --> 02:31:44,370
signed up to do 101 my brother just just
did recently.

3493
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:48,660
It's called Badger Mountain and uh,
hadn't done it before.

3494
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:51,390
I think he came and ran Pisca did about
four summers,

3495
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:56,391
one's about 16 miles or whatever and
went out and he's going to do a hundred

3496
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,650
mile or after that.
And um,

3497
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:04,800
started throwing up.
But like mile 30 threw up like 13 times

3498
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:10,220
and couldn't walk,
was dehydrated throwing up and it was a

3499
02:32:10,621 --> 02:32:14,340
hardest thing to do,
but he had to drop and that,

3500
02:32:14,670 --> 02:32:19,670
so there's your getting your body to a
place where you can run that far and

3501
02:32:19,681 --> 02:32:20,830
then,
so that's part,

3502
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:21,900
he hasn't been there yet.

3503
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:24,030
And I think part of that was he wasn't
taking his salt.

3504
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:26,520
There's a lot of,
a lot of things that go on with pushing

3505
02:32:26,521 --> 02:32:30,180
your body that hard,
but he got 50 miles done for,

3506
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:32,520
for me,
I thought that was a great success

3507
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:37,820
because just people just because they
want to run a hundred doesn't mess

3508
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:40,890
necessarily mean you're going to,
there's a lot of things that have to go

3509
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:44,760
into preparation and the tactics and
fueling and everything else.

3510
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:47,580
Learning just like courtney did,
learning just like he did,

3511
02:32:47,581 --> 02:32:50,040
he got 50 in and now we signed up for
big foot,

3512
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:55,610
so he's going to do 205 miles you,
so he's going from dropping out at 5,205

3513
02:32:55,981 --> 02:32:56,814
miles.
Yep.

3514
02:32:56,910 --> 02:32:58,770
And I think he can do,
it's a sickness.

3515
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:02,430
You guys are all sick in the head.
I'd guys are all getting sick together.

3516
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:03,810
I think he can do it.

3517
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,240
But,
and that's just as part of the process

3518
02:33:06,241 --> 02:33:10,350
of learning what you're capable of and
it's not,

3519
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:13,620
it doesn't happen like that.
When you say take the salts and like

3520
02:33:13,621 --> 02:33:14,700
what are you,
what are you doing?

3521
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:16,650
Uh,
they're called s caps,

3522
02:33:16,651 --> 02:33:19,440
so it's just salt pills.
But I thought saw,

3523
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:21,180
gives you high blood pressure and it's
bad for you.

3524
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:22,540
It's,
you're,

3525
02:33:22,540 --> 02:33:24,960
you're right.
But when you're sweating nonstop,

3526
02:33:25,170 --> 02:33:26,880
it doesn't give you high blood pressure
folks.

3527
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:28,380
It's not bad for you.
Okay.

3528
02:33:28,381 --> 02:33:33,381
So it's a fucking bad study from like
the 1970s that people recite salts in a

3529
02:33:33,571 --> 02:33:34,950
central mineral.
Um,

3530
02:33:34,951 --> 02:33:37,000
so when you're,
when you're doing it,

3531
02:33:37,001 --> 02:33:38,730
how much you taken in it?
Take,

3532
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:41,010
I take salt every hour.
And how much salt?

3533
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:43,620
Couple pill.
Couple of capsules of s caps.

3534
02:33:43,650 --> 02:33:46,860
So it's a couple of capsules and if you
don't,

3535
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:49,470
you won't make it really?
No.

3536
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,870
Wow.
Nope.

3537
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:54,780
So it's just your body just gets too
dehydrated.

3538
02:33:54,970 --> 02:33:56,100
Yeah.
Two deficient.

3539
02:33:56,370 --> 02:33:58,950
And what is the water in the salt?
Like how does it,

3540
02:33:58,980 --> 02:33:59,813
what does it,
what does,

3541
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:01,350
what's happening when you're taking
salt?

3542
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:03,240
Uh,
I dunno,

3543
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:05,340
but you know,
everybody does it.

3544
02:34:05,370 --> 02:34:06,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

3545
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:08,880
I'm not sure exactly,
but all I know is like,

3546
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:13,830
I remember the first time I did,
western states had only done it once,

3547
02:34:13,831 --> 02:34:18,831
but it was a 100 miler in 2010 and I got
to mile 55 I think.

3548
02:34:19,901 --> 02:34:23,390
And I was dragging ass.
You come out of the canyons a super hot

3549
02:34:23,391 --> 02:34:24,550
and there is,
you know,

3550
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:29,580
nineties or a hundred it's in the canyon
so he can pop out on to mile 55 and I

3551
02:34:29,891 --> 02:34:34,891
was hurting and uh,
and Sean mize and her who's been a very

3552
02:34:35,621 --> 02:34:37,630
good ultra runner for a long time.
He's like,

3553
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:40,480
if you take assault on my,
no I haven't.

3554
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:42,670
So he gave me some salt right then and
it made,

3555
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:46,390
it took a little while but made the
biggest difference that just salt.

3556
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:48,640
So you had never taken salt before?
I hadn't,

3557
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:51,790
I didn't take it the first 55 miles.
Oh Wow.

3558
02:34:51,791 --> 02:34:54,730
So then you,
you just got to get in that community

3559
02:34:54,731 --> 02:34:57,730
and understand what they do and how they
survive and how they fuel.

3560
02:34:57,731 --> 02:34:59,920
How many people were doing that?
Like say if you do big foot,

3561
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:03,550
how many people were entering the race?
When I did it,

3562
02:35:03,551 --> 02:35:06,970
which was two years ago,
is I think 70 [inaudible] now I think

3563
02:35:06,971 --> 02:35:09,370
she's over over a hundred and all these
races.

3564
02:35:09,430 --> 02:35:11,770
Wow.
It's a,

3565
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:16,300
yeah.
What candice bird always says is 200 200

3566
02:35:16,301 --> 02:35:21,301
is the new 100 or one what?
What used to be a hundred it was like a

3567
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:25,420
long way.
It now is 200 200 is a new 100 and when

3568
02:35:25,421 --> 02:35:26,320
did this change?

3569
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:31,680
When did it shift over that like maybe
2016 I did big foot maybe right in

3570
02:35:34,541 --> 02:35:36,130
there.
That's really recent.

3571
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,290
Yeah.
So this whole sport,

3572
02:35:38,291 --> 02:35:40,270
it's kind of evolving right now.
Hundreds.

3573
02:35:40,310 --> 02:35:45,310
The two hundreds are and it's evolving
based on how far people can that are

3574
02:35:46,091 --> 02:35:50,410
willing to push themselves are
continuing to go past the boundaries.

3575
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:54,070
Yeah.
So when this 500 does take place,

3576
02:35:54,071 --> 02:35:56,890
when did I think that's going to happen?
She hopes to do it next year.

3577
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,440
You got to quit your job.
Quit your job.

3578
02:35:59,530 --> 02:36:01,580
That's an all day though.
I'd,

3579
02:36:01,670 --> 02:36:04,060
I'd love to hear sneaker sponsor.
Yeah.

3580
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:05,880
Oh,
I got an agent.

3581
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:06,510
I'm like,
got along.

3582
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:09,670
I had to run another one.
I'm going to be your agent taking over

3583
02:36:09,671 --> 02:36:11,050
from here.
Okay.

3584
02:36:11,051 --> 02:36:12,730
Do it.
Yeah.

3585
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:14,320
You can't sell yourself.
I'm going to sell,

3586
02:36:14,321 --> 02:36:15,580
you know,
I've,

3587
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:16,371
I've,
yeah,

3588
02:36:16,371 --> 02:36:18,520
I've terrible.
I've definitely terrible.

3589
02:36:18,521 --> 02:36:19,354
At business.

3590
02:36:20,650 --> 02:36:22,030
Well,
you can't be good at everything.

3591
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:23,350
Yeah.
That's a fact.

3592
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:27,490
It's not possible.
The number one thing I hate more than

3593
02:36:27,491 --> 02:36:30,310
anything is when business screws up my
passions.

3594
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:35,410
So when I hate the business of hunting,
it sounds weird because I'm probably

3595
02:36:35,411 --> 02:36:37,240
sitting here because of the business of
hunting,

3596
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:39,810
but I can't stand it.
I know what you're saying.

3597
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:43,660
The business of like the industry
involved in hunting gear,

3598
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:45,350
it goods and all that stuff.
Yeah.

3599
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:47,560
Yeah.
I love hunting.

3600
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:51,970
I love the connection with animals.
I love doing what I do and I know I have

3601
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:53,410
value.
I get it.

3602
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,780
I mean,
I have value because it put my name on

3603
02:36:55,781 --> 02:36:58,390
stuff and they sell it.
I hate it.

3604
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:02,080
That's probably what you're good at it.
I Dunno.

3605
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:05,050
I think those two are correlated.
You know?

3606
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:08,170
I'm fucking terrible at the business
part of comedy,

3607
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:09,670
you know?
I mean,

3608
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:11,440
I just,
I just want to do it.

3609
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:13,870
I don't,
I don't like thinking about the money

3610
02:37:13,871 --> 02:37:14,681
part.
Yeah,

3611
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:16,220
I don't,
that's why I have managers

3612
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,120
and agents,
right.

3613
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:19,400
They take care of everything so that I
can just be free.

3614
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,550
And if you're not,
I,

3615
02:37:22,551 --> 02:37:24,530
you know,
you only have certain amount of

3616
02:37:24,531 --> 02:37:28,340
resources and if you put all your
resources into the business side,

3617
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:32,000
how are you going to have the
concentration to do all the other things

3618
02:37:32,001 --> 02:37:32,930
you're doing?
Right.

3619
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:35,010
Practice shooting and running,
all the,

3620
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:38,030
all the different things all the time.
They'll fuck with your head too.

3621
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:41,270
You got to,
and this is one of the things that I was

3622
02:37:41,271 --> 02:37:44,090
thinking of when my phone didn't work
for four days or three days,

3623
02:37:44,091 --> 02:37:47,870
whatever it was,
was that how much time I'm wasting,

3624
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:50,870
how much energy I'm wasting.
Yeah.

3625
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:55,960
Like you can only interact so much with
other people's thoughts and ideas and

3626
02:37:57,741 --> 02:38:02,741
information and you,
you have a lot of things already in your

3627
02:38:03,171 --> 02:38:08,171
head that you're going over and thinking
about and managing and the more shit you

3628
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:15,380
stuff in there,
it doesn't make you better at doing

3629
02:38:15,381 --> 02:38:16,430
those original things.

3630
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,930
It dilutes it.
Yes.

3631
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:20,930
And it also diluted my,
my peace of mind.

3632
02:38:21,250 --> 02:38:24,560
Like
I think you know,

3633
02:38:24,561 --> 02:38:26,720
did you,
you only have certain amount of

3634
02:38:26,721 --> 02:38:29,660
resources in your life and you have to
choose what's important to you and

3635
02:38:29,661 --> 02:38:30,950
what's not.
You know,

3636
02:38:30,951 --> 02:38:33,320
and I think it's real easy to get
distracted.

3637
02:38:33,710 --> 02:38:37,160
It's real easy to flood your brain with
nonsense.

3638
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:38,870
I think so.
Yeah.

3639
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:40,010
I'm not,
I'm not,

3640
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:44,990
I'm good at a few things.
So I try to focus on those.

3641
02:38:45,050 --> 02:38:46,160
Yeah,
I'm not,

3642
02:38:46,161 --> 02:38:47,600
and that the business part.
Yeah.

3643
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:49,700
You can take that over for me.
Yeah,

3644
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:51,800
I'll take it over for you.
I'm not even good at it,

3645
02:38:51,801 --> 02:38:55,970
but I'm good at,
I'm good at what I'm good at is I know

3646
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,510
people that I like and what I like about
them and what's interesting about them

3647
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,920
and I like promoting people.
Like it's one of the things that I've,

3648
02:39:02,921 --> 02:39:06,350
I've gotten out of this podcast that is
a,

3649
02:39:06,351 --> 02:39:09,620
there's a lot of things that have gotten
out of this podcast that are really like

3650
02:39:09,650 --> 02:39:13,730
unexpected and peripheral,
but one of them is the ability to make

3651
02:39:13,731 --> 02:39:14,990
my friends famous.

3652
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:17,870
Yeah.
Like this podcast is made,

3653
02:39:17,871 --> 02:39:22,280
Joey Diaz famous and Ari Shaffir famous
and Duncan trussell famous.

3654
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,820
All these people that I think are
amazing that are,

3655
02:39:24,821 --> 02:39:27,680
hello,
I got a chance to let other people know

3656
02:39:27,681 --> 02:39:29,980
about them.
And that's not the only reason why that

3657
02:39:29,981 --> 02:39:31,310
became famous.
They became famous because they're

3658
02:39:31,311 --> 02:39:34,880
talented,
but it gave them this unusual platform.

3659
02:39:34,881 --> 02:39:37,130
Right.
And I,

3660
02:39:37,131 --> 02:39:39,590
that that means a lot to me to help
people.

3661
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:42,920
Like that's something that's very,
very rewarding to me.

3662
02:39:42,921 --> 02:39:47,360
And it's almost along the same lines of
being able to provide as a hunter and

3663
02:39:47,361 --> 02:39:50,480
provide food,
like to be in a provide to let people

3664
02:39:50,481 --> 02:39:53,960
know you gotta you gotta see this guy's
guy's awesome are even things people

3665
02:39:53,961 --> 02:39:56,060
that I even,
I don't even know people like their

3666
02:39:56,061 --> 02:39:57,530
documentary.
I see a documentary.

3667
02:39:57,531 --> 02:39:59,510
It's fucking amazing.
I want to tell people about it.

3668
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:04,810
I like promoting things and without any
expectation of something coming back to

3669
02:40:05,571 --> 02:40:06,740
me in return.
I like,

3670
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,200
I just like tea.
Like people,

3671
02:40:09,201 --> 02:40:10,550
um,
say like,

3672
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:11,271
oh,
you know,

3673
02:40:11,271 --> 02:40:13,770
you're doing ads for products on your
instagram.

3674
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:14,130
Never

3675
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,963
have.
Yeah.

3676
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:16,860
Everything that I've ever put up on
Instagram,

3677
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,710
unless it's my own stuff,
unless it's like my fanny packs or

3678
02:40:19,711 --> 02:40:22,890
something that I sell,
anything that I've ever put put on,

3679
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:25,590
like people's accuse me of like working
for vibe rooms,

3680
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,630
five finger shoes.
I'm like,

3681
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:27,930
no,
I liked him.

3682
02:40:28,350 --> 02:40:30,330
I liked him.
I don't want anything from them.

3683
02:40:30,970 --> 02:40:34,050
This is what I wear them all the time.
This is why I think they're good.

3684
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:36,360
I think they build your feet up.
I know my feet are stronger cause I run

3685
02:40:36,361 --> 02:40:37,630
with these things.
It go,

3686
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:38,780
you fucking,
she'll like,

3687
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:40,050
no,
that's not what I'm doing.

3688
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:43,980
And it's like that's the one thing of
having financial independence.

3689
02:40:43,981 --> 02:40:48,000
That's what's really rewarding is that I
don't have to think like that.

3690
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:49,680
You know?
Like I haven't been offered,

3691
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:51,900
uh,
to do ads on instagram.

3692
02:40:51,901 --> 02:40:52,320
I'm like,
no,

3693
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:56,940
I can't because unless I,
unless it was something I super believed

3694
02:40:56,941 --> 02:40:58,300
in,
then I might,

3695
02:40:58,340 --> 02:41:00,900
I might consider doing it,
but I could never do it with some

3696
02:41:00,901 --> 02:41:04,350
nonsense like coca cola or something
like that because then skinny t,

3697
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:07,050
what's that skinny t with skinny t.

3698
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:09,090
I see the girls do it.
What a skinny t.

3699
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:12,150
That's a thing on instagram.
I see this fucking guy.

3700
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:13,530
I go to him,
he knows everything.

3701
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:14,470
I go to him,
Hey,

3702
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:17,190

what's that called again?

3703
02:41:17,370 --> 02:41:18,510

3704
02:41:19,190 --> 02:41:20,400
Uh,

3705
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:22,940
but he's uh,

3706
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:25,200
Dunkin say it.
Wherever he kept saying it,

3707
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:26,671
wouldn't,
you know,

3708
02:41:26,671 --> 02:41:28,710
it's like popular.
Oh,

3709
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:33,630

I had was we talked about a dinner.

3710
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:35,250
Yeah.
I don't remember doubles.

3711
02:41:35,251 --> 02:41:40,251
Dunkin just kept going on about Lil B.
I know it will be the base guy say like,

3712
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:45,840
cause Gucci,
it's like the kids knew like there was a

3713
02:41:45,841 --> 02:41:47,100
word.
It's like guys.

3714
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:49,560
Yes.
Oh Jamie.

3715
02:41:49,561 --> 02:41:51,860
Yeah,
Jamie's be,

3716
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:56,820
I know what's floating.
And Jamie is online all day and he's

3717
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,550
just ever,
ever since the Eddie Bravo podcast has

3718
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:01,200
been blocking people.
Yeah.

3719
02:42:01,230 --> 02:42:02,970
So He's,
he's an unblocking rampage

3720
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:06,230
people.
That's,

3721
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:10,310
that's like most,
so what is skinny t is that detox to

3722
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,790
you?
It's like a thing that people promote.

3723
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:14,430
They posted a picture,
I drink my tea every day and it's making

3724
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:17,390
detoxing and they're getting paid to
promote those.

3725
02:42:18,310 --> 02:42:21,870
Well wasn't a thing you were telling me
the Gary Vee was saying that,

3726
02:42:21,871 --> 02:42:23,880
you know,
you can get a lot of money for your

3727
02:42:23,881 --> 02:42:26,670
instagram posts.
I saw like on a good morning America

3728
02:42:26,671 --> 02:42:27,391
thing,
he did that.

3729
02:42:27,391 --> 02:42:32,040
If you have 100,000 followers,
I believe you can get up to about $5,000

3730
02:42:32,041 --> 02:42:33,600
per post.
That's crazy.

3731
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:36,490
And ramp ramps up way high.
20 grand.

3732
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:39,180
There was this 40 grand a post.
Yeah,

3733
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:42,900
I've changed my tune.
I want to sell out now I'm offering my

3734
02:42:42,901 --> 02:42:47,430
services to anything that sucks.
There's this girl and I can't remember

3735
02:42:47,431 --> 02:42:49,400
who,
what she was in a movie camera.

3736
02:42:49,470 --> 02:42:54,470
She's Sorta of but kinda unique looking.
She was getting 65,000 and instagram

3737
02:42:57,180 --> 02:43:01,210

3738
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:03,630
Yeah.
She said she bought a house for doing,

3739
02:43:03,631 --> 02:43:05,190
wait a minute.
I need to sell out.

3740
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:07,140
We do.
What do I,

3741
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,090
what do I sell out to?
Who Do I sell out to?

3742
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:11,440
Anybody.
Everyone vibrams much money.

3743
02:43:11,441 --> 02:43:12,490
You got,
you know,

3744
02:43:12,491 --> 02:43:13,720
I've been promoting you for free.

3745
02:43:15,870 --> 02:43:17,740
Uh,
you owe me.

3746
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,753
No,
I can't.

3747
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:22,980
The only thing I would ever promote his
eye,

3748
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:27,610
it's like the same thing I feel about
the stuff that I promote for free.

3749
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:29,640
It would have to be something that I
liked,

3750
02:43:29,641 --> 02:43:30,600
believed in.
Yeah,

3751
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:31,930
it would have to like,
like hoyt,

3752
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:34,040
if hoyt came to me and said,
will you,

3753
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,420
I'm wearing a white hat,
would you promote our bowls?

3754
02:43:37,421 --> 02:43:38,240
I'm like,
fuck yeah,

3755
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:39,760
shoot him every day.
They're awesome.

3756
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:42,820
They actually put your picture up,
made you beautiful.

3757
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,110
Put it up.
Well,

3758
02:43:44,111 --> 02:43:45,970
no,
I mean you joke around,

3759
02:43:47,050 --> 02:43:49,120
you weren't joking about you like
helping your friends,

3760
02:43:49,150 --> 02:43:54,150
but I don't know how long the powerful
Joe Rogan,

3761
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:57,580
how long has it powerful.
Joe Rogan been around this saying,

3762
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:58,493
yeah,
you know,

3763
02:43:59,410 --> 02:44:03,970
but the point is,
is like now that this is powerful

3764
02:44:04,180 --> 02:44:05,980
because if I put up,
hey,

3765
02:44:05,981 --> 02:44:08,590
where'd you hear about?
Or where did you start following me

3766
02:44:08,591 --> 02:44:08,950
from?

3767
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:13,950
Or where'd you hear about what I do?
I don't eat 80% is Joe Rogan show Joe

3768
02:44:15,970 --> 02:44:17,650
Rogan experience.
And it's so it,

3769
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:20,800
it's been a sane for a long time,
but it is powerful.

3770
02:44:20,860 --> 02:44:23,920
It was really crazy.
Bert Christ was at the airport and this

3771
02:44:23,921 --> 02:44:26,400
lady said she was in her sixties walked
up,

3772
02:44:26,450 --> 02:44:28,370
she goes,
powerful Burke Christ.

3773
02:44:29,470 --> 02:44:31,000
And he was like,
what the fuck?

3774
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:32,890
And he texted me,
he goes,

3775
02:44:32,891 --> 02:44:34,330
dude,
that was crazy.

3776
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:36,610
He's like,
this is like an older lady.

3777
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:38,320
He said,
powerful Bert.

3778
02:44:38,321 --> 02:44:40,030
Kreischer all right.
And he was like,

3779
02:44:40,031 --> 02:44:40,721
whoa.
He goes,

3780
02:44:40,721 --> 02:44:42,850
that's when it hit me.
What the fuck?

3781
02:44:42,851 --> 02:44:46,180
I'm reaching like middle aged ladies.
Yeah.

3782
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:49,990
It's past the middle aged ladies.
If she lives to be 120 that's a hell of

3783
02:44:49,991 --> 02:44:50,824
a lady.
No,

3784
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:52,720
cause we're middle age.
We're middle age.

3785
02:44:52,780 --> 02:44:55,850
If everything goes perfect.
Yeah.

3786
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:58,150
But with science today,
I think we're probably not even,

3787
02:44:58,151 --> 02:45:00,190
I think we're probably one third aged.

3788
02:45:00,530 --> 02:45:03,550
Yeah.
I think it's 100% easy today that

3789
02:45:03,551 --> 02:45:06,040
someone's going to live to be one 50 I
don't think there's any question

3790
02:45:06,041 --> 02:45:07,180
whatsoever.
Yeah.

3791
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:11,260
What stem cell treatments and all this
other crazy nutter 50 yup.

3792
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:12,513
Yeah.
I believe that.

3793
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:16,960
I believe people that are alive today
because I think technology and medical

3794
02:45:16,961 --> 02:45:21,961
science is increasing its viability and
its potential so fast and there's so

3795
02:45:23,501 --> 02:45:26,440
many people working on things all the
time that if you do everything right

3796
02:45:26,441 --> 02:45:28,450
right now,
I think we're going to see people that

3797
02:45:28,451 --> 02:45:31,260
are alive today.
They're going to hit one 50 and I think

3798
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:34,060
the people that are born like five years
from now,

3799
02:45:34,061 --> 02:45:39,061
10 years from now,
they'll probably hit 200 um whoa before

3800
02:45:39,701 --> 02:45:42,670
we go,
before we go Chicago,

3801
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:44,770
UFC,
Ooh it's going to be a good one.

3802
02:45:45,250 --> 02:45:47,340
Colby Covington don't snap me.
Slap me.

3803
02:45:47,810 --> 02:45:48,940
And he said you're going to slap me.

3804
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:50,770
Slap me.
Let's talking shit.

3805
02:45:50,790 --> 02:45:51,940
Lice.
You going to slap you.

3806
02:45:52,310 --> 02:45:54,670
Cause I was telling them that Jon Jones
might slap him.

3807
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:58,060
Oh
I like colby.

3808
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:00,580
I like what he's doing.
He's talking a lot of shit.

3809
02:46:00,581 --> 02:46:02,290
I'm just saying be careful who you talk
shit to.

3810
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:05,950
Talking Shit to Jon Jones,
one of the baddest motherfucker has ever

3811
02:46:05,951 --> 02:46:09,100
lived.
You know he's making a lot of money.

3812
02:46:09,230 --> 02:46:11,900
He's being smart.
Oh cold reason why colby is fighting for

3813
02:46:11,901 --> 02:46:13,790
the title.
The reason why Colby is going to fight

3814
02:46:13,791 --> 02:46:18,570
Hofeld dos Anjos for the interim title
is not just because he's beaten good

3815
02:46:18,571 --> 02:46:20,690
guys cause he has,
he beat Damien Maia.

3816
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:24,170
But it's more importantly that he's got,
he's gonna put asses in the seats.

3817
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:27,260
Well that's part of the fight business
part of the fight business.

3818
02:46:27,261 --> 02:46:28,640
Now you've got to sell it.
I mean,

3819
02:46:28,641 --> 02:46:30,770
yeah,
especially in pre and post conor

3820
02:46:30,771 --> 02:46:31,730
mcgregor,
right.

3821
02:46:32,090 --> 02:46:34,970
And Post conor Mcgregor,
the fucking game has changed.

3822
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:38,270
It's red panties night baby.
Everything is different.

3823
02:46:38,390 --> 02:46:39,770
It is.
And it's just like,

3824
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:42,890
I see people hate on it on Colby for,
you know,

3825
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:46,700
did he deserve the shot at all?
I know is he wins one fight.

3826
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:49,250
He's holding the belt.
Yeah.

3827
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:53,690
I mean if you look at one more beaten,
pull up his record.

3828
02:46:53,691 --> 02:46:56,150
Let me see his record.
If you look at who he's beaten in

3829
02:46:56,151 --> 02:46:58,160
comparison to somebody,
like there's some people that have been

3830
02:46:58,161 --> 02:47:00,620
calling him out that can't get a fight
with him,

3831
02:47:01,010 --> 02:47:04,010
like a Camaro.
Uzman wants to fight him and that guy is

3832
02:47:04,011 --> 02:47:06,770
a beast.
And then there's some other guys that

3833
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:11,771
are really talented but haven't beaten
like any high level guys yet.

3834
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:14,091
Uh,
okay.

3835
02:47:14,091 --> 02:47:18,080
So we lost a warley Alvarez and then
look at the guys he's beaten.

3836
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:21,130
Brian Barbarian is a good guy.
Dumb Young Kim is a,

3837
02:47:21,131 --> 02:47:23,420
as a tough guy,
stung on cam and Damien Maia.

3838
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:26,840
That is not really,
I mean I'm just going to be honest.

3839
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:32,140
This is not a resume of someone who you
would normally see fighting for the

3840
02:47:33,531 --> 02:47:36,320
title right now.
I think he's fighting for the title

3841
02:47:36,321 --> 02:47:39,710
based,
not just on his beat beating Damien

3842
02:47:39,710 --> 02:47:41,030
Maia,
who's a really tough guy.

3843
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:46,640
But I think on the fact that he's a
controversial,

3844
02:47:46,670 --> 02:47:51,670
very popular character.
Does he talk so much shit and because

3845
02:47:52,071 --> 02:47:55,780
he's talked so much shit about
Brazilians and he dominated my,

3846
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:58,010
uh,
I mean it was,

3847
02:47:58,220 --> 02:48:00,690
it was a domination.
He dominated them and it's uh,

3848
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:02,300
what,
what I was a big victory,

3849
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:06,650
but that was his only big victory over a
titled a former title Challenger.

3850
02:48:06,651 --> 02:48:08,510
Yeah.
Who's like a top level guy who was also

3851
02:48:08,511 --> 02:48:09,720
40 years old,
right?

3852
02:48:09,770 --> 02:48:12,410
I mean Damien Maia is,
his best days are behind him.

3853
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:15,770
Just as I say this as a huge Damien Maia
Fan.

3854
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:17,241
Well I,
you know,

3855
02:48:17,241 --> 02:48:22,241
I look at it is you can't take too much
away from colby because I think of a lot

3856
02:48:22,251 --> 02:48:27,251
of great fighters say so if you say nate
Diaz who's been an icon for years,

3857
02:48:27,411 --> 02:48:29,960
one of my favorite of all time,
he's never fought for a title.

3858
02:48:30,220 --> 02:48:31,250
MM,
right.

3859
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:33,200
Yeah.
No.

3860
02:48:33,250 --> 02:48:36,230
So if colby got there however he got
there,

3861
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,050
he wins one more fight.
He's holding that belt.

3862
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:43,970
I think about fighters who've come up
and maybe if they've been quiet or maybe

3863
02:48:43,971 --> 02:48:47,690
they haven't sold their fights,
maybe like as as well as colby has.

3864
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:52,010
And so they've been grinding it out,
beating good guys.

3865
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:53,960
Maybe because they've taken that slow
road.

3866
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:56,250
Maybe somebody who gets lucky in one of
these fights and,

3867
02:48:56,450 --> 02:48:59,640
and catches him on the Chin and then
there two rungs back and then they got

3868
02:48:59,641 --> 02:49:00,860
to grind all the way back up.

3869
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,780
That's a lot of damaged.
They're taking,

3870
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:06,260
we're colby didn't have to,
I mean he played the game the right way

3871
02:49:06,261 --> 02:49:08,300
for today and it's paying off.
Yeah.

3872
02:49:08,301 --> 02:49:09,810
You want to is one loss.
Yeah.

3873
02:49:09,811 --> 02:49:13,260
I mean I think he's 11 and one now,
but you know,

3874
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:16,980
but other people would say,
well look at guys like Anderson Silva

3875
02:49:16,981 --> 02:49:18,930
didn't talk any shit.
Just fuck people up,

3876
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:20,220
you know?
And,

3877
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:23,190
and became one of the greatest of all
time because of that.

3878
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:24,240
Yeah,
that's true.

3879
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:25,290
You know,
you could,

3880
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:28,080
you could look at it like,
do you want to get that shot at the

3881
02:49:28,081 --> 02:49:31,200
title or do you want to be the greatest
that's ever done it?

3882
02:49:31,230 --> 02:49:32,940
Like how,
what is the difference?

3883
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:35,930
I would rather get the title and then
show them the craters.

3884
02:49:37,230 --> 02:49:38,930
Right.
They're not mutually exclusive now.

3885
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:39,833
Right now.
Yeah.

3886
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:44,430
So I mean if he wins then he'll probably
get it a fight with Woodley.

3887
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:45,330
Right?
Oh,

3888
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:48,880
he will definitely get a fight with
Woodley if he wins 100% right.

3889
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:50,910
So what if,
what if that happens?

3890
02:49:50,911 --> 02:49:52,950
And what if Woodley showed a video
today?

3891
02:49:52,951 --> 02:49:55,500
I don't even know if I'm the of
understand how the fuck he did this.

3892
02:49:55,800 --> 02:50:00,800
But tyron woodley has a video up on
instagram with him and a Tiki Golson and

3893
02:50:02,191 --> 02:50:03,420
uh,
he's hitting the pads.

3894
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:07,200
He just had fucking shoulder surgery.
I mean he had shoulder surgery.

3895
02:50:07,201 --> 02:50:08,460
Like what?
Wash this.

3896
02:50:10,090 --> 02:50:13,680
I mean he had fucking shoulder surgery
like four months ago and he's firing up

3897
02:50:13,681 --> 02:50:15,660
the paths.
I don't even know how he did this.

3898
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:20,010
Which shoulder?
That one.

3899
02:50:20,011 --> 02:50:21,210
That right?
Yes.

3900
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:26,700
He looks like a freaking beast.
He is a fucking beast.

3901
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:28,350
Oh my.
He's a legit beast.

3902
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:31,560
Colby says he's a nerd.
Oh,

3903
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:33,800
get the fuck out of here.
Just kidding.

3904
02:50:34,110 --> 02:50:36,980
He's talk shit about him.
Said he was break them.

3905
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:39,240
He said he would break them,
but look,

3906
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:42,300
you tiredly God,
he looks amazing.

3907
02:50:42,330 --> 02:50:45,090
He puts people to sleep.
It's just insane that that shoulder was

3908
02:50:45,091 --> 02:50:46,650
operated on.
Amazing.

3909
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:48,840
I want to say like four months ago.
Yeah.

3910
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:51,120
I don't even understand it.
That even make sense.

3911
02:50:51,121 --> 02:50:53,730
Impressive.
Like four months after shoulder surgery

3912
02:50:53,731 --> 02:50:56,010
is supposed to be like doing like the
little pink weights.

3913
02:50:56,011 --> 02:50:57,200
A chase shoes.
Yeah.

3914
02:50:57,320 --> 02:50:59,760
And pull out his class.
It's supposed to be doing this.

3915
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:01,800
Oh well I don't,
I don't get it.

3916
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:04,590
I mean,
but tyron is very smart and he's very

3917
02:51:04,591 --> 02:51:08,020
smart with his rehabilitation,
but he's doing prp and everything.

3918
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:11,430
He can stem cells,
everything he can to rejuvenate all that

3919
02:51:11,431 --> 02:51:12,480
tissue.
But that's just,

3920
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:16,020
that's insanely impressive and less and
less.

3921
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:20,480
That is as old video that he's fucking
banked.

3922
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:21,870
He's like,
these bitches,

3923
02:51:21,871 --> 02:51:25,170
I know what I'm going to do.
Maybe you want to leave.

3924
02:51:25,171 --> 02:51:26,760
I'm scared.
Yeah,

3925
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:28,350
I have.
Wonderboy is furious.

3926
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,390
Wonderboy is furious at Colby is getting
that shot.

3927
02:51:30,570 --> 02:51:32,520
Cause wonder boys like,
are you fucking kidding me?

3928
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:34,890
How am I not fighting for the interim
title?

3929
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:35,850
You know,
I just,

3930
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:37,170
he just,
yeah,

3931
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:39,580
he just beat Jorge Mas doll.
You know,

3932
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:42,150
he had those two really close fights
with Woodley,

3933
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:43,480
you know,
hit me.

3934
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:44,670
He's,
he's beaten,

3935
02:51:44,940 --> 02:51:46,590
you know,
fucking who's who.

3936
02:51:46,830 --> 02:51:48,170
Yeah.
Well it's,

3937
02:51:48,510 --> 02:51:50,970
I get,
cause colby has worked out with me,

3938
02:51:50,971 --> 02:51:53,040
you know,
he's from or from the same town back

3939
02:51:53,041 --> 02:51:54,630
there.
And so people like,

3940
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:57,240
I can't believe you support whatever.

3941
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:59,100
Like colby go into,
he's a blah,

3942
02:51:59,101 --> 02:51:59,934
blah,
blah.

3943
02:52:00,060 --> 02:52:02,910
And it's just like he's just doing his
job.

3944
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:03,571
I don't want,
no,

3945
02:52:03,571 --> 02:52:06,810
he's selling a cause game,
but this not how he is and real life.

3946
02:52:06,850 --> 02:52:08,260
Oh,
he's a great guy.

3947
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:11,770
He like his,
him and his dad came and lifted with us.

3948
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:14,350
They're,
they're the nicest people ever.

3949
02:52:14,410 --> 02:52:16,030
So it's just like,
it's a smart,

3950
02:52:16,031 --> 02:52:17,980
come on guys.
It's a smart move.

3951
02:52:18,330 --> 02:52:20,450
And it worked.
He did get hit in the head with a

3952
02:52:20,451 --> 02:52:22,670
boomerang for it though.
Hey,

3953
02:52:22,671 --> 02:52:24,730
you take take a little,
you know,

3954
02:52:24,780 --> 02:52:27,490
you take your sticky rumps you take your
lumps.

3955
02:52:27,491 --> 02:52:28,660
Yeah.
It happens.

3956
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:32,440
It does happen.
All I know is he wins one more fight and

3957
02:52:32,441 --> 02:52:35,350
he's got the UFC belt.
How amazing is that?

3958
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:38,020
The interim belt?
It's a belt is a belt.

3959
02:52:38,110 --> 02:52:40,240
I don't care what kind of a belt.
It's a belt.

3960
02:52:40,690 --> 02:52:43,120
Tyron Woodley calls it the booboo belt,
whatever,

3961
02:52:43,150 --> 02:52:46,060
because he's got an injury and that's
the only reason why they still super

3962
02:52:46,061 --> 02:52:47,830
shiny.
It's very shiny and it's still going to

3963
02:52:47,831 --> 02:52:48,950
be around his waist.
Yep.

3964
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:50,060
If he wins.
True.

3965
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:54,310
So it'll be in his fucking his trophy
cabinet.

3966
02:52:54,850 --> 02:52:56,200
Exactly.
The fucking belt.

3967
02:52:56,220 --> 02:52:58,780
Yeah.
So I think I've Po God.

3968
02:52:58,781 --> 02:52:59,870
I'm so pumped.
It's going to be,

3969
02:53:01,050 --> 02:53:05,650
you have some fun that's going to be a
that card pull up that June UFC card.

3970
02:53:05,651 --> 02:53:08,140
That is a killer card.
Um,

3971
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:10,030
there's some real good fights on that
card.

3972
02:53:10,031 --> 02:53:12,820
Is that the card with Derek Lewis and
Francis and Ghana?

3973
02:53:13,630 --> 02:53:15,070
Oh God,
I don't think so.

3974
02:53:15,071 --> 02:53:16,450
Is it?
I want to say it is.

3975
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:19,480
I don't think I want to say it is.
No.

3976
02:53:19,990 --> 02:53:23,380
What's ones that,
is that Vegas Whitaker Romero.

3977
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:29,560
Oh,
Jesus made that a little bigger so daddy

3978
02:53:29,561 --> 02:53:32,850

Romero and Romero,

3979
02:53:32,851 --> 02:53:35,440
his body.
He's a freak of freaks bro.

3980
02:53:36,070 --> 02:53:39,250
The freaker for overeem versus Curtis
Blades to Paul.

3981
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:42,070
Ooh.
Cm punk versus Michael Jackson.

3982
02:53:42,490 --> 02:53:44,140
Both guys.
Holly's fighting.

3983
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:48,040
Both guys are zero and one.
We are all the Holmes fight and Megan

3984
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:48,251
Anderson.
Oh,

3985
02:53:48,251 --> 02:53:50,350
Marian Anderson's up.
Fucking killer,

3986
02:53:50,351 --> 02:53:52,420
Bro.
Megan Anderson is going to be your first

3987
02:53:52,421 --> 02:53:56,230
fight in UFC.
She's a legit beast and a challenge at

3988
02:53:56,231 --> 02:53:57,730
one 45.
Let's see.

3989
02:53:58,340 --> 02:53:59,470
Did as fuck.
Yeah.

3990
02:53:59,471 --> 02:54:01,480
Merseyside Beck.
Dick Versus Ricardo Lamas.

3991
02:54:01,510 --> 02:54:03,910
That's fucking awesome.
Whoo.

3992
02:54:04,690 --> 02:54:06,820
We got our lawsky.
We've got legends.

3993
02:54:06,830 --> 02:54:09,130
Guido versus Bobby Green.
Woo.

3994
02:54:09,670 --> 02:54:11,530
Rashad Evans.
Yeah.

3995
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:12,730
Yeah.
There's some good fights.

3996
02:54:12,850 --> 02:54:14,710
Real good fights.
Yeah.

3997
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:17,120
Oh,
it's going to be the greatest set of

3998
02:54:17,121 --> 02:54:19,120
Itas versus pettis.
God Damn.

3999
02:54:19,210 --> 02:54:20,770
Yeah,
this is very good.

4000
02:54:21,010 --> 02:54:21,910
Yeah.
Very good.

4001
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:26,050
I really hope not.
Not all these fall through like normal.

4002
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:31,080
Well we have only a month and then it'll
be one holly fighting Romero.

4003
02:54:35,470 --> 02:54:37,660
That'll be all this left Robert
Whittaker.

4004
02:54:37,661 --> 02:54:41,080
You'll over Merrill is a fucking bang
and fight for Chicago.

4005
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:44,140
God Damn Dose Angeles versus Covington
though.

4006
02:54:44,141 --> 02:54:46,000
That's the fight.
That's the fight.

4007
02:54:46,001 --> 02:54:50,950
Cause Dosantos at one 70 has been a
fucking monster because he's one of

4008
02:54:50,951 --> 02:54:55,510
those guys that was cutting so much
weight to make one 55 he just couldn't

4009
02:54:55,511 --> 02:54:58,510
take it anymore.
I mean it was just beaten his body up

4010
02:54:58,690 --> 02:55:03,160
and then he moves up to one 70 and he
looks like a fucking killer again.

4011
02:55:03,470 --> 02:55:04,040
He looks like

4012
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:08,180
a world beater at one 70 and he's been
trying to fight Woodley and he just beat

4013
02:55:08,181 --> 02:55:10,070
the shit out of Robbie lawler.
Yeah.

4014
02:55:10,190 --> 02:55:14,660
So that's a big fight for him.
And a big fight for colby for the

4015
02:55:14,661 --> 02:55:15,830
interim title.
Yeah.

4016
02:55:16,490 --> 02:55:17,930
Whoa.
Can't wait.

4017
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:19,640
Can't wait.
Chicago,

4018
02:55:19,650 --> 02:55:21,440
was it the eighth,
ninth.

4019
02:55:21,470 --> 02:55:24,860
June 9th.
I wish I could go into coma until then.

4020
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:25,580
No,
you don't.

4021
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:26,810
Yeah.
You have marathons to run.

4022
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:28,340
Oh,
arrows to shoot.

4023
02:55:28,341 --> 02:55:30,020
That's tricky to which,
let's go shoot some arrows.

4024
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:31,640
Let's wrap this up.
