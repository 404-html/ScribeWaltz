1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,620
The joe rogan experience,
I decided I try to work on this calmness

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,270
and all that.
And for me,

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,120
driving and road rage was the worst.
I used to have the worst road rage ever.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
Oh Dude,
I was terrible man.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,980
You would not,
you would not recognize me.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,990
I once got taken to the police station
because someone accused me is this,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,850
this is a while back.
But they accused me of a,

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,350
exposing myself,
we'll driving.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,230
Uh,
and what the truth of the matters that

10
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,060
someone cut me off and I got pissed off
and I said,

11
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,581
you don't want to,
you,

12
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:30,060
you know,
Hong Kong Bobo here and uh,

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,270
so uncommon Bobo here,
you made a,

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,320
you made a like a blow job,
sort of a case against you.

15
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:37,921
And I'm like,
yeah,

16
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,290
here you go.
Write as a new hash.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,920
Exactly.
Hong Kong.

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,220
And he said to people while they were
driving,

19
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:44,550
no,
no.

20
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,300
I just,
I mean I made the,

21
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,131
I made the,
the,

22
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,650
the graphical motion to have them blow
you.

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,401
Exactly.
Yeah.

24
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,091
Like basically,
you know,

25
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,250
blow me a few.
And uh,

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,390
so what did the same exactly.
Anyway,

27
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,420
I was kind of like,
I'd forgot about it and this police

28
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,450
officer leaves her business card on my
front porch and apparently whoever cut

29
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:09,780
me off was just a complete idiot of a
driver and like really apparently

30
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,520
thought I did this.
So this,

31
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,800
this little police officer,
woman is like,

32
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:14,710
Hey,
uh,

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,680
I know you at the beginning of a porno.
I swear to God in the police station.

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,730
She's like,
I know,

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,890
I know you did it.
And I started laughing.

36
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:24,450
I look for cameras.
So I thought it was a joke.

37
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,790
Like I thought some friends of mine had
really seriously hooked me up on this

38
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,040
because there's no way it was so far
from my reality.

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,270
And she goes,
no,

40
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,040
I know you did.
I have witnesses and I'm like,

41
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,380
you can't have witnesses because it
didn't happen like you're lying.

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,080
And we went back and forth for two hours
about this.

43
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,930
This is how bad my road dredge was.
Two hours she was full on,

44
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:40,860
I'm going to go to the DA.
I'm like,

45
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,540
you can't go to the aid.
There was no evidence.

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,550
And furthermore,
anatomically,

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,080
okay,
this is my lap,

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,660
this is the side of the car and this is
where the steering wheel is.

49
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,380
So unless I'm like hung like a horse,
it is not possible to drive and expose

50
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,160
yourself at the same time to some in the
car next to you.

51
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,620
I'm like,
you can't do that.

52
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,070
So finally I did this lie detector test
and I passed out.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,140
I volunteered to go.
I'm like,

54
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:02,580
I got,
there's nothing going on here.

55
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,520
It was so good.
Stopple I can't even tell you,

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
but that's how bad my road rage was.
Like no wait.

57
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:10,960
He had to go to the station to get it
light or did they have a lie detector?

58
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,990
You're testing the car.
She's got one.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh No,
this is bad.

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,610
This is a month after it happened.
Like I,

61
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh shit.
It was scary actually.

62
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,360
I was,
I realized I was absolutely guilty.

63
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,490
So many girls that have turned down the
$25,000 offer from some king that just

64
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,780
like just goes.
It hits all the ladies like 25,000 week

65
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,550
in there.
But I know so many people that have

66
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,710
turned it down,
but I also know a couple girls that have

67
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:38,730
done it and that's his fucking crazy.
I think there's quite a few of those

68
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,471
guys out there.
Well,

69
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:42,990
I've been to Dubai a number of times and
there's $50 ones.

70
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,870
They're $50 for a prostitute.
Yeah,

71
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,260
but what I'm saying is that these guys
that get girls from America and have

72
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,160
them shipped,
oh yeah.

73
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,360
That to me,
that's crazy shit.

74
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,260
That kind of money.
That's a way,

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,280
this is a weird reality.
You know when you have like trillions of

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
dollars,
like there's people who are like,

77
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,530
I think as far as private wealth is
concerned,

78
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,230
like what we know and you see like the
richest man in the world,

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
man,
not really.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,620
Okay.
Because what you're getting is the

81
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,560
richest man in the world who has assets
that are measurable,

82
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,620
like in the stock market.
When you're dealing with canes,

83
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,800
you don't have any fucking idea how much
those guys have.

84
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,390
You don't know.
Why should you know?

85
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,220
I got a buddy who,
they have a bank.

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,060
I got a buddy who's a billionaire,
real live billionaire and uh,

87
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,800
never knew he had money for years.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
He was just,
um,

89
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,950
my friend's friend and uh,
never knew.

90
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,950
We hung out in New York and everything.
And then one day I was reading about his

91
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:34,490
family in the newspaper and I went,
Holy Fuck.

92
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,960
And I called him on the phone,
I'm like,

93
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:37,040
you have money?
And he's like,

94
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:37,371
yeah.
I'm like,

95
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:37,671
no,
no,

96
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:41,780
no.
You have like fucking money.

97
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Family does.
Yeah.

98
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,990
And I said,
this is bullshit.

99
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,240
We have never gotten to take advantage
of this.

100
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,690
I said,
you have like crazy fuck you money.

101
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,910
So years later he came into the money
like where it was his,

102
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,230
oh,
that's so creepy.

103
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:59,840
Just sitting around lazy waiting for it
to happen.

104
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,960
We worked hard,
but,

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
but someone did die.
I don't want to give away who we

106
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,540
possibly is,
but okay.

107
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,250
But in one year he went from fucking
Zenith,

108
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,510
the Nadir,
like he,

109
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,800
he straight to rehab,
like in the year end,

110
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,860
a year from when he like took over the
money to,

111
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,600
he was,
he would call me and be like,

112
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,350
I'm in Vegas.

113
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,970
I got the top floor of the,
when rented,

114
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,810
I get slip and slides down the hallway.
There's,

115
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,770
there's strippers and hookers
everywhere.

116
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,060
And we got midgets in a storm trooper
outfit serving the strengths and he'd be

117
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,680
like,
I'll have a private jet picking you up.

118
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,290
Get here.
Now how much money did he inherit?

119
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,180
A bout $5 billion.
Ooh.

120
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,030
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

121
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,700
And he's not fun anymore.
That's the best clip right there.

122
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,090
He's not fun anymore.
That's a complete ball changer.

123
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,520
God Damn.
He's not fun.

124
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,120
$5 billion.
It's the one guy that I,

125
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,650
not fun because the rehab kind of killed
it.

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,281
Killed?
No.

127
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,050
You only needed a year before he went
into Rehab.

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
Yup.
Wow.

129
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,260
That's hilarious.
And what was it for coke?

130
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,530
He was smoking crack.
Oh,

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,700
the merits.
Rancho

132
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,730
freaks and Geeks.
Lovers and children.

133
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:42,300
What's going on?
