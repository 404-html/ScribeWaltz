1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,421
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello,
Kyle.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,060
Hello.
Joe Rogan.

4
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,510
Do you look very good?
They're in a suit.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,410
Thank you.
You know,

6
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,020
I like to pretend that I'm a serious
human being by wearing this,

7
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:12,040
but I'm just a dick.
Well,

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,340
you're a youngest fellow,
so maybe a suit would give you more of

9
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:20,080
an air of calm composure authority.
Perhaps.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,080
That's the idea.
If you look like you're really serious

11
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:26,530
than people assume you're serious and
they don't know that I'm making Dick

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,440
Jokes and exactly like that.
It's a good movie.

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,960
It's very smart move.
I had some suits made.

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,190
I had to do this function for one of my
kids' schools and I had to go to this

15
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,860
function.
We had to wear nice clothes.

16
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:41,680
It's like a dress up thing and not
really have nice clothes,

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,010
nothing that like fits.
And so I had to have something made so

18
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,130
now I've been wearing it when I go on
special dates with Mrs Rogan.

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,050
So it's like,
it's a suit like this.

20
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,330
It's a nice suit,
jacket and tailored.

21
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,820
The whole deal fits me.
And how do you feel when you put it on?

22
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:59,170
Do you feel like a serious person?
I feel like a serious person,

23
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,890
like if I.
If I dress like this,

24
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,730
but like a hoodie and a tee shirt.
I feel like a Schlub.

25
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,160
I feel like a Dork.
Graham,

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,910
there's this thing that I do wear,
especially when I'm doing my show.

27
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,840
Oftentimes you do that half assed move
where I look like this,

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,870
but yeah,
but then the shorts on or I might have

29
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,400
sweat pants sometimes.
Yeah,

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,270
sure,
sure.

31
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,690
It all depends on what mood I'm in.
I mean sometimes I'll,

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,450
I'll do the whole thing and look nice,
but usually I'm just being lazy and one

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,540
Guy Ritchie who was on the podcast and
he made a very good statement in defense

34
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:32,344
of the suit.

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,220
It was a.
It was a really interesting sort of

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,550
testimony in defense of the suit and the
pocket square.

37
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,140
He's a big believer of the pocket
square,

38
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,910
which I think is preposterous.
That's a little too far.

39
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,740
It's too far.
I'm with you,

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,130
but it doesn't go out of style.
That's the thing is like if you look at

41
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,600
a picture of somebody from like
Nineteen,

42
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,400
Oh six,
and you look at a picture of somebody

43
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:54,270
from 2018 and they're wearing a suit,
you go,

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,881
oh,
okay.

45
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:58,990
But then other aspects of style and
fashion change so fast.

46
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,520
I mean you look at.
Remember the,

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,660
I think they were called Chanko is like
the really baggy jeans that people wore.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,700
Oh yeah,
like a cabaret cheese.

49
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,100
I don't know what that is.
Is that,

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,220
that really was something that we used
to where I'm dating myself.

51
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,440
This is like in the early nineties,

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,240
late eighties,
early nineties.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,410
It was like they were tight to like
your,

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,580
your pelvic region and then they would
flare up when they got past MC hammer

55
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,450
pants.
So terrible.

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,550
But those didn't really make it right.
And then there were,

57
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,780
but they did make it in the gym.
Like if you go to the gym,

58
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,860
there's still guys who were these kinds
of sweat pants that are like these kind

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,410
of Puffy sweatpants.
They're usually juiced out of their

60
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,244
minds.
Right?

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,180
These are the workout clothes.
Everybody wears it.

62
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,690
Probably wear those pants because there
it is.

63
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,680
There's cavalry cheese.
Oh my God.

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,590
I used to wear those.
Try to get laid.

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,950
That's the opposite of trying to get
laid.

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,100
Not In those days.
Back in those days like people didn't

67
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,830
know any better.
Right,

68
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,090
but it's

69
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,740
like eggs is that things change except
powdered wigs.

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,050
Exactly.
Like people.

71
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,790
People came from.
No.

72
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,290
We found out on the podcast.
He came from syphilis.

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,090
Yes.
The whole wig thing came out of royalty.

74
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,330
These royals had syphilis.
What was the whole story?

75
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:21,331
It was about the term big wig and it was
who were the people was a Dutch Dutch

76
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,500
kings who is the.
Who were the kings,

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,050
so you could find that story because
it's a fascinating story.

78
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,030
What it was was there was these,
I think they were brothers and they had

79
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,920
syphilis.
They were just banging everybody.

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,290
Yeah.
Why do people wear powdered wigs and it

81
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,500
all came from a hair loss that these
guys would have.

82
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,750
There it goes.
The proof story begins.

83
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:45,350
Like many others with syphilis by 15 a,
the std had become the worst epidemic to

84
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,920
strike Europe since the black death,
according to William Close.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,870
Klaus,
close C,

86
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,160
l o w e s,
how would you say that either one.

87
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,070
Close.
I say an infinite multitude of syphilis.

88
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,390
Patients clogged London's hospitals and
more filtered in each day without

89
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,580
antibiotics.
Victims face the full brunt of the

90
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,080
disease,
open sores,

91
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,400
nasty rashes,
blind,

92
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,850
endless demand blindness,
dementia and patchy hair loss.

93
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,370
Baldness swept the land.
So that's what I'm saying.

94
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,300
I'm healthy.
I'm healthy.

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,021
Well,
they just,

96
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,560
it just became a thing because these raw
scroll down.

97
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,840
So it'll tell you like who the people
were that did it.

98
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,030
Yeah.
So,

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,240
um,
it went a little too far and so syphilis

100
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,930
outbreak sparked a surgeon which making
wig making victims hid their baldness,

101
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,240
blah,
blah,

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,531
blah,
blah,

103
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,430
blah.
Louis,

104
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,670
the 14th was only 17 when his mom
started thinning,

105
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,160
worried that his baldness would hurt his
reputation.

106
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,520
Louis hired 48 week makers to save as
image.

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,470
Five years later,
the King of England,

108
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,240
Louise,
cousin Charles,

109
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,790
the second did the same thing when his
hair started to gray.

110
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,410
Both men,
likelihood syphilis,

111
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,470
cordy airs.
How do you say that?

112
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,090
Courtney,
Courtney Hayes and other aristocrats

113
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,380
immediately copied the two kings.
They sported wigs and the style trickled

114
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,310
down to the upper middle class.
Europe's newest fad was born and so

115
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,190
that's where it came from.
So the whole powdered wigs with people

116
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,090
of distinction in court,
all that shit came from syphilis.

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,830
What's like most things?
Well,

118
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,140
whenever somebody tries to,
you know,

119
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,410
Kinda like deify the founding fathers,
I always think,

120
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,270
well yeah,
they were brilliant on some things,

121
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,480
but on the other hand they wore powdered
wigs and shat.

122
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,890
Now's outhouses and enslaves.
Yeah.

123
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,420
So like there's a little bit of a
balance that we have to take into

124
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,910
consideration.
Well,

125
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,240
I mean,
think about how much cultural change has

126
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,930
taken place in our society just over the
last few years.

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,280
Sure.
You mean words that were commonplace are

128
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:39,440
now completely unacceptable.
You know,

129
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,610
styles of behavior and methods of
expression are being criticized and

130
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,860
critiqued.
It this really radical way.

131
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,810
And I think it's good.
I ultimately,

132
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:52,900
I think there's a lot of bad.
I'd say it's good,

133
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,870
but the sentiment is good,
you know,

134
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,180
I think the,
and some of the overreaction,

135
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,500
like there's a spectrum,
right?

136
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,190
There's always going to be like,
did you see the,

137
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,940
there was something that came out
yesterday from Portland State University

138
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
where Peter but goes in and James Damore
the Google memo guy and uh,

139
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,070
heather hiding.
She was a professor at Evergreen state

140
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:22,071
and I remember what the Jordan Peterson
and she was actually on my podcast last

141
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,810
week with her husband,
Bret Weinstein.

142
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,290
Weinstein can't stay wind.
I'm not thinking of the same person.

143
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,540
I was thinking of the person who got
fired because of,

144
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,450
she'd not function and get fired,
but she criticized her for playing a

145
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,230
Jordan Peterson thing.

146
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,190
Is that the same person?
No,

147
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,720
no,
no.

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,720
That's Lindsey.
She was in a different university.

149
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,270
Okay.
A Canada in Canada,

150
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,340
another university in Canada.
Um,

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,660
this is in Portland.
Anyway,

152
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,690
so they're in the middle of this
conversation.

153
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:54,530
And Heather who is a,
she's a biologist and she starts going

154
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:59,210
over the biology of the differences
between males and females that are

155
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,440
undeniable and these kids get up and
they started yelling that this is

156
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,170
bullshit and fuck you and power to the
people,

157
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,090
all this crazy shit.
And then they tip over the sound system

158
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,740
and they're the most hilarious classical
liberal,

159
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,260
progressive lefties,
green hair.

160
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
The guy who was like this poofy Afro and
he's like,

161
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,150
you know,
we don't tolerate Nazis man,

162
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,880
like fucking Nazis or biologist.
He's a shit.

163
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,450
That stuff is the kind of stuff that I
think turns people off to the left and

164
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,080
almost provides a gateway to the right.

165
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,470
We're all of a sudden people can buy
into and even broader right wing

166
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:43,190
ideology because if you look at the left
and that's your perception of the left

167
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,610
is it's the people with the pink hair or
the blue hair and they're just going

168
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,070
around and their whole point is two d
platform.

169
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,830
People are sensor.
People are screaming about Ben Shapiro

170
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:55,400
or whatever the case is.
Like my whole thing is put.

171
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,800
If you're on the left.
And I think most lefties do this to be

172
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,990
fair.
Put the identity politics aside.

173
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,980
Okay.
And let's talk about the things that we

174
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,890
actually already have a majority of the
American people with us on.

175
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,900
So you know,
like a classic leftwing idea.

176
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,810
Let's have a living wage.
The minimum wage is not a living wage

177
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:13,400
right now.
You could work full time and not make

178
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:14,690
enough money to survive.
Well,

179
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,480
if you're on the left and you go out
there and you talk about we need to

180
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,180
fight to try to get a living wage and
make our government work for us.

181
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,010
Well then you get everybody to agree
with you.

182
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,860
Even most Republicans agree with you.
It didn't go down the list.

183
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,620
Whether it's legalizing marijuana is 60
percent of the American people are now

184
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,270
with us ending the wars.
There was a poll that came out in a

185
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,680
2013,
so it's old admittedly,

186
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,240
but only 17 percent of the American
people still want it to be in the,

187
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,500
in the war in Afghanistan.
And we're still there today.

188
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:41,390
I'd imagine if anything,
that number probably dropped even

189
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,230
further.
And everybody's like,

190
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,170
what are we doing in Afghanistan?
Right?

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
But isn't.
The problem with polls is when you ask

192
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,290
people about it,
you're not asking them if they're

193
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,000
informed.
You're just asking you.

194
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,740
You're just asking your opinion on it.
What I was saying about the left versus

195
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,900
the right is that the real problem is
anybody can be on either,

196
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,700
so you're going to get these people that
are going to disrupt this heather hiring

197
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,800
lecture on biology from an informed
scientific perspective and like,

198
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,360
fuck,
this man is a patriarchy.

199
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,330
You're going to get that,
but you're also going to get people like

200
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,390
yourself.
You're also gonna.

201
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,410
Get people that are aware of the issues
and educated and are debating this in a

202
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,950
very public way and trying to figure out
what's the best possible solution to

203
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,680
these things.
The problem is anytime you have a group,

204
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,890
whether it's pick the group gun owners,
vegans,

205
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,290
what are anybody can fucking join man,
and as soon as anybody can join,

206
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,650
you can't look at like the worst case
scenarios.

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,030
The green haired Dork that kicks over
the microphone because they don't like

208
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,870
the idea that heather is speaking
logically about biology.

209
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,870
Like no,
you have to look at like the the whole

210
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:49,704
thing.
Sure.

211
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,880
And we don't like to do that.
We'd like to point at the green hair

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,300
dork and say,
hey liberals,

213
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,650
there's your left Sharon.

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,110
Exactly.
And you know the breakdown to me is when

215
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:02,290
you look at somebody like that,
they're in the category of what I would

216
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,100
call authoritarian left because they
want to control other people's actions.

217
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,540
They want to shut down that speech and
say,

218
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,670
your ideas are so dangerous.
I don't even want to hear it.

219
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,500
There's a whole nother contingent of the
left,

220
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,840
which again I would argue is probably
the majority of the left,

221
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,070
which is the libertarian left,
which is people like me and many others

222
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:18,700
who say,
listen,

223
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,740
live and let live on social issues.
I'm never,

224
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,010
even though I don't agree with Steve,
Steven crowder bench purell on anything,

225
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,070
I'm never gonna,
you know,

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,610
try to protest.
To get them to not speak their mind at a

227
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:34,990
school is foolish.
It makes it look like you don't have an

228
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,600
argument when you say,
I can't let that guy talk,

229
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,880
and then they get to go around and say,
I'm so persecuted because I'm right.

230
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,610
Right,
right.

231
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,240
You know.
Meanwhile I say,

232
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,590
okay,
you want to have somebody like that go

233
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:45,460
speak to college.
Sure,

234
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,330
fine.
Let them speak.

235
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
Let me get this speech after.
Well,

236
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,354
it's good enough.

237
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,450
I mean,
I think open conversations are critical

238
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,870
and I also.
This is going to probably be unpopular.

239
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,330
I don't think the way to do it is in
front of a large group of people.

240
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,450
I think you open yourself up to a lot of
grandstanding,

241
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,530
a lot of saying things just for applause
breaks a lot of.

242
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,980
There's a lot of bullshit.
It just.

243
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:08,950
It changes the nature of the
conversation because it becomes theater.

244
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,210
You're doing this thing in front of all
these people and you can hear a lot of

245
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,940
these times people say things like,
I'm a comic,

246
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,670
so I know when someone's saying things
for reaction,

247
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,120
there's a way you do it.
Will you say it like this and that's

248
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,170
what we want.
And everybody goes,

249
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,490
you do not,
you do not talk like that when it's just

250
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,770
you and a person was just you and a
person.

251
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,480
You are just alone with your ideas.
And I think that is the way a guy like

252
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,020
Ben Shapiro and,
you know,

253
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,680
put whoever you want on the left should
have a discussion.

254
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,530
Yeah.
Um,

255
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,180
there's something about that,
that soft history,

256
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:43,960
you know,
like,

257
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,850
so you're not creating the best
argument.

258
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,550
You're just trying to sound like you
have the best argument.

259
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,290
And you know,
Bill Maher,

260
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,190
for example,
does this where he's very at the punchy

261
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,180
one liners.
Sure.

262
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,120
Like he's in a conversation with his
panel on his show and it'll be like

263
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,451
blah,
blah,

264
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:58,960
blah,
blah.

265
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,160
And there was
a comment,

266
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,100
say anything you just kept,
it was like a quick partisan hacky point

267
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,110
you made.
But since people already agree with you

268
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:09,190
in the audience,
they clap.

269
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,030
So it's hard to flesh out the ideas.
And really that's why.

270
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,740
Listen,
I've always said I'm not the biggest fan

271
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,120
of debate because.
So I've done a few debates and people

272
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,670
online like when I do debates,
but I'm not the biggest fan of debates

273
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:26,530
because I think it's like the wwe of
intellectual pursuits where you go in,

274
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,950
this person's whole point is to defend
this side of it.

275
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,100
My job is to defend the other side of it
and it's like,

276
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,330
okay,
clash.

277
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,201
But it's like,
okay,

278
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:40,201
well then when we come across an issue
like the fucking 64 genders on facebook

279
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,640
or whatever it is,
and I actually might agree,

280
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,950
am I now put in a position where I'm
supposed to be like,

281
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,510
no,
I'm going to disagree because that's the

282
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,800
format of the thing that we're doing.

283
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,170
It's just weird and it's not normal.
Yeah,

284
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:53,320
and I think that's actually very
important for both sides to do.

285
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,410
Like when there's something on your side
of the disagree with you should be

286
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,160
honest about it.
And even saying that that there's a side

287
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,370
that there are sides,
that there's our side versus their side.

288
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,520
We're.
I think we're so inherently tribal that

289
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,370
we should resist any temptation
whatsoever to form teams,

290
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,120
especially about critical issues.
Like really important social issues,

291
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,170
really important economic issues,
really important civil rights issues.

292
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,470
These are just things that we should
just talk about without looking at them

293
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,520
in terms of,
oh,

294
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,450
the left wants this,
so I oppose it or the right ones this.

295
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,420
So I have to figure out ways to mock it.
Yeah.

296
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,670
Um,
yeah.

297
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,900
I don't even know what to say in
response to that.

298
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,734
I agree with that.

299
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,300
You know,
it was,

300
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,010
we were talking about this before the
podcast that like what I try to do is

301
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,940
have conversations with everyone.
I tried to have conversations with nutty

302
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:46,240
people like Alex Jones.
I try to have conversations with

303
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,390
rational people like Sam Harris.
I touch on have conversations with all

304
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,760
kinds of people,
but without fail,

305
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,170
every time I have a left wing person on
um,

306
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,350
some Kuk left wing.
Yeah.

307
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,660
You know,
what's going to happen anytime I have a

308
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,080
right wing person on,
um,

309
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,330
some.
All right.

310
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,450
Nazi apologist.
It's like this weird inclination we have

311
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,550
to try to label and categorize people
and I try to resist those labels as much

312
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,870
as humanly possible.
Well,

313
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,350
I feel like what you're really good at
is you can have on people who disagree

314
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:22,351
completely on stuff,
but you'll kind of find a nugget of

315
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:26,680
agreement in the conversation with that
person and then you can expand on that

316
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,320
and you can end up having a very nice
conversation and you're not.

317
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,550
You never really bring anybody on to try
to like brow beat them and tell them

318
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,230
that they're wrong on this issue or that
issue.

319
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,390
You know what I mean?
I have no desire to do that.

320
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:38,830
I don't know.
I mean,

321
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,640
look,
I've had.

322
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,760
I've had a lot of arguments in my life
and I don't like them.

323
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,540
I don't think they're beneficial.
I mean,

324
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,830
I think debate is good,
but every time I've ever been in an

325
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,560
argument with someone,
like a real argument always come out of

326
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,530
it.
Feeling Gross.

327
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,151
Yeah.
You're.

328
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,200
There are times in life or arguments are
necessary.

329
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,670
There's times in life where you're just
faced with aggression or conflict and

330
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,650
you have to do something about it.
You have to meet it head on.

331
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,820
There are times in likely that,
but whenever you can avoid that do and I

332
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,170
think a lot of what arguments are,
and I failed at this in my life many

333
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,870
times,
but a lot of what arguments are is the

334
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,250
way you've reacted to the the thoughts
and the expression that another person

335
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,720
has and if you just reacted a different
way or approach it in a different manner

336
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,960
or took it into consideration a little
bit more before you responded.

337
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,070
I think the conversation could have gone
another way and I think I'm learning how

338
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,330
to do that more and more as I get better
at podcasting,

339
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,510
at better at conversations,
learning how to just settle someone down

340
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:38,570
and learning how to genuinely be a nice
person.

341
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,750
So I don't.
I don't want to insult anybody.

342
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,270
I don't want to be in a disagreement
with someone.

343
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,580
I want to discuss ideas.
Sure.

344
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,260
Who was that?
Who is that skeptic guy from years back

345
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,100
that he put you on the list of top 10
conspiracy,

346
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,610
blah blah,
and then running,

347
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,770
and then I remember watching that clip
and it was so frustrating when you guys

348
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,480
were going back and forth because you
would say,

349
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,760
I think you were talking about the 9:11
thing and you're like,

350
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,550
I'm 100 percent.
Not saying it was a conspiracy.

351
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,570
I'm saying it looked like the building
came down in a controlled demolition.

352
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,510
Those are two very different things.
It's one thing to say,

353
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:16,060
I believe it's a conspiracy.
It's another thing to say the way it

354
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:19,270
came down a look like it was a
controlled demolition,

355
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:24,100
but he kept insisting and trying to tell
you what you believe as you're sitting

356
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:24,970
across the room and you're like,
no,

357
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,890
I don't believe that.
He was trying to tell me what I was

358
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,810
saying.
Right.

359
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,400
And it was

360
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,520
clear in all,
okay,

361
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,500
how do I say this?
Uh,

362
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,030
I don't think Brian is a bad guy.
I don't think his brain works correctly.

363
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm being honest.
I think there's,

364
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,810
there's a real problem there.
And when he does these science,

365
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,320
these videos,
he sounds like a strip club Dj.

366
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,130
Do you know what I mean?
Like I've never seen his original

367
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,190
content that people talk.
Will they take on an effective.

368
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,580
There's a wet heat,
but that thing is done by people that

369
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:02,120
are trying to achieve a desired result.
Like it's not that they're themselves

370
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,270
talking about a very specific thing,
it's that they are trying to put on an

371
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,740
air of intellectual authority and you
know,

372
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:12,740
he talks to himself as a science writer,
whatever that is.

373
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,760
Like,
I don't hate that guy.

374
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,380
I'm not mad at him.
The whole thing was kind of foolish and

375
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,720
it was very damaging to him.

376
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,250
And he wound up going to jail
afterwards.

377
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,370
Really?
Yeah.

378
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,520
Not because of that,
but because of something that he did,

379
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,250
he was involved some sort of scam with,
uh,

380
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,850
was it Amazon or Google?
Ebay.

381
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,490
That's right.
He was involved in some sort of a scam

382
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:34,520
or he had an embedded cookies.
You'd go to his site and make it.

383
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,210
Made it look like when you were buying
things online that you had gone through

384
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,100
his site first.
When in fact you hadn't,

385
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,750
there was just a cookie that was
embedded,

386
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,380
some,
some,

387
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,850
something along those lines.
Whatever it was,

388
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,410
it was illegal and they wind up going to
jail.

389
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,200
So,
and even his defense of that,

390
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,680
it's like,
I think there's something wrong there.

391
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:49,980
I

392
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,350
don't know what that something is,
where there's a,

393
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,870
there's a spark plug that's not screwed
in all the way.

394
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,920
There's something wrong.
Well,

395
00:17:55,921 --> 00:18:00,921
speaking of a fake personas,
I feel like that's the worst when it

396
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:05,820
comes to politics and I do feel like
there's very,

397
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,331
very,
very,

398
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,580
very,
very few upsides of trump in my opinion.

399
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,660
But one of the upsides of trump is that
he did kind of break the mold in terms

400
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,850
of what was viewed as,
um,

401
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,190
the right way to communicate as a
politician.

402
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,910
Because before him you had all these
very measured people who had the proper

403
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,300
posture and they spoke with their thumb
pointing down because they don't want to

404
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:28,820
be strong with their finger pointing at
you like that fist.

405
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,620
And then he comes along and he's
obviously shooting from the hip and he

406
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,310
clearly has no filter and he's tripping
over his words a tremendous,

407
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,980
believe me,
he's unnecessarily punchy and short with

408
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:38,814
his sentences.

409
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,540
And I remember there was a report that
came out that said he communicates,

410
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,180
I think it was like a sixth or seventh
grade level or something like that and

411
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,840
everybody in the media was mocking it.
And I did a segment where I said you

412
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,360
guys are mocking and that's a terrible
idea because guess what?

413
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,090
The way he speaking,
even though it sounds stupid,

414
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,060
it's going to pierce through like,
you know how when some people talk it's

415
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,310
hard.
You have to focus to pay attention to

416
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,290
listen to where they're going with it
and it's hard.

417
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,780
And then there's other people who talk
and it's like you just,

418
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,330
you just get it.
It's immediately right in your brain and

419
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,340
he doesn't matter.
Agree or disagree with the substance of

420
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,900
what that person is saying.
You know,

421
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,640
when somebody is an effective
communicator.

422
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,020
And when he was at out there on the
campaign trail and he was,

423
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,090
for example,
campaigning in the rust belt where

424
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,640
Hillary Clinton did not go right.
And he was like,

425
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,570
ah,
Nafta enough,

426
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,250
just terrible.
They shipped out all your jobs.

427
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,140
It was unbelievably terrible.
Believe me,

428
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,340
let me just tell you what I'm going to
do.

429
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,740
I'm going to keep your jobs here.
It's going to be unbelievable.

430
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,900
Believe me.
That's pretty good.

431
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,651
I'd say it is good,
right?

432
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,490
I do.
Pretty good trump people tell me a

433
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:33,560
little off,
but the matter is,

434
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:34,394
these are excellent.

435
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,780
So the fucking thing he did recently
where he said that he had gone into the

436
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,170
school when the school shooting was
going on in their unit who didn't have a

437
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:44,020
gun.
Yeah.

438
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,300
It's like we mentioned any other setting
that you can't.

439
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,770
I was with him when he was like
listening to cops should have gone in

440
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:51,391
and everybody's like,
yeah,

441
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,740
of course the cops had gotten.
Yeah.

442
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,470
But then he has to gratuitously take it
so much further.

443
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,080
Then he goes,
I would have gone in and then he adds

444
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,200
without a weapon.
Like now everybody knows you're just

445
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,790
full of shit and manage.
If he was there,

446
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,530
oh,
imagine if he was there,

447
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,010
like if trump just happened to be there
giving a speech at the school in a

448
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:11,790
school shooting started and uh,
and he didn't do anything.

449
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,480
He just stood on the outside.
We know he would have a guarantee.

450
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,860
I mean,
he's the guy who said,

451
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,310
oh,
my personal Vietnam was avoiding stds at

452
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,580
the [inaudible] I went to.
Pretty funny.

453
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,950
Yeah.
So that was,

454
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,900
isn't,
it wasn't a scene in,

455
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,870
um,
the dead zone.

456
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,330
Yeah.
I didn't see the dead zone wells in the

457
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,920
book.
In fact,

458
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:41,150
the guy uses someone to shield him from
a shooter and that's what keeps that guy

459
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,820
from ever becoming president.
So it keeps him from pressing the button

460
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,980
because the guy was going to become
president and he was going to launch a

461
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,350
nuclear war,
uh,

462
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,290
assault and nuclear war.
And this guy that,

463
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,120
uh,
was Christopher walken's.

464
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,360
Kay was Christopher Walken was right
thing.

465
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,180
So he realized by touching this guy's
hand,

466
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:04,570
this guy was going to do this.
And so there was some scenario took

467
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:08,140
place where someone was trying to shoot
him and he used someone else to shield

468
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,650
him from the bullet and that's what
prevented him from ever becoming

469
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:12,330
president.

470
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,700
And what's the,
it's a movie that dead zone.

471
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,410
It's a movie and it's also a,
it was also a book by Stephen King.

472
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,560
I'm trying to read the book and I saw
the movie.

473
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,900
I'm trying to remember.
Was it walking?

474
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,550
Yeah.
Fuck,

475
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,570
that's right.
That's right.

476
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,910
Young walking.
Look at that handsome face bastard.

477
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,730
It was a weird looking dude.
Where does,

478
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,530
where does it gets?
But that's what's cool about them.

479
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,070
It's great movie though.
Fun Mate might not be great anymore.

480
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,260
It might be one of those movies.
Like I always told people we should

481
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,610
watch altered states.
It's amazing.

482
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,160
And then I watched it.
Certain things age so bad.

483
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:43,510
We were just talking about it.
Um,

484
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,060
I don't know,
but especially with comedy and you've

485
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,130
pointed this out,
if you go back and look at old comedy,

486
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,530
it's just a different world.
They were living,

487
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,790
standup and exactly you.

488
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,080
If you take the conversation we're
having and you like somehow get it back

489
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,230
to 1950,
people will look at us like just the

490
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,230
fact that we casually curse and you
know,

491
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,310
the concepts we're talking about,
they'd be like,

492
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,860
this is unbelievably impolite.
Yeah.

493
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,120
You know what I mean?
Well,

494
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:12,070
one of the best examples I think is
Stephen Colbert saying that president

495
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,500
trump uses his mouth is Putin's cock
holster.

496
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,190
Just set it on whatever network,
tv or cable,

497
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,810
whatever the Johnny Carson do with that.
I mean,

498
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,390
no way.
Go back to the old Ed Sullivan show.

499
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:27,391
You know where Jackie Mason got banned
for life because it looked like he gave

500
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,370
the finger.
He did this thing right?

501
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,570
Like this.
This is what I do.

502
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm Jackie Mason.
He says he never even gave him the

503
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,060
finger,
but he was accused of giving someone the

504
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:39,250
finger and that was it.
He was banned.

505
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,700
Didn't they do that with Elvis when he
performed?

506
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:44,350
He like moved his hips in a way that
they thought was too sexual.

507
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,820
So they're like,
we can't show this because there are

508
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:47,140
kids that exist in the world.
Well,

509
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,120
they would only frame him from the waist
up.

510
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,450
They wouldn't show all that thought
motion.

511
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,950
It was too much.
Fuck on what Elvis.

512
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,450
Come on man.
That's so goofy.

513
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,450
Like I don't get what it is about
different times.

514
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,360
I mean there were just a few generations
away from the powdered wigs.

515
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,600
I mean really that's,
I mean that's such a different world.

516
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,700
I can't wrap my mind around it,
but you know what?

517
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,520
It's true that I.
Who Was it?

518
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,650
I think it was lenny bruce who had all
these different lawsuits against him

519
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:16,651
because so in a way he's like,
he kind of paved the way for people like

520
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:19,750
us where you,
especially because you're in comedy too,

521
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,670
but even just for the Internet where we
have this,

522
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,940
you know,
this free open platform where we talk

523
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:27,460
about whatever.
I feel like we wouldn't even be able to

524
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:28,820
get away with talking,
you know,

525
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,200
mentioning the sexual stuff or cursing
if it wasn't for guys like that who

526
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:36,220
paved the way because people were
getting arrested for doing a standup set

527
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,640
and cursing 100 percent.
I have a bunch of framed lenny bruce

528
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,230
posters in my house.
Yeah.

529
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,330
I think he,
uh,

530
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,070
is one of the most important figures in
the history of pop culture because he,

531
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,710
he was a way ahead of his time,
you know,

532
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,970
just way,
way ahead of his time.

533
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:54,971
He had jokes back then that I saw people
stealing in the 19 eighties.

534
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,500
Wow.
I don't even know if they were stealing

535
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,000
it.
I rephrase that.

536
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,970
I think they might've had parallel
thinking.

537
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,240
One of the jokes was about gay people
that in certain places being gay and

538
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,880
like sodomy is actually,
I think sodomy is still technically

539
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,010
illegal in some places.
In some states I think.

540
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:14,690
Yeah.
Hippy or some shit,

541
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,670
which includes going down on somebody.
By the way.

542
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,070
No blow jobs are technically illegal in
some states.

543
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,860
That's fucking hilarious.
Right.

544
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,500
But um,
what was my point that.

545
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,220
Oh,
so his joke was that he was dig this

546
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:29,930
man,
if you're gay,

547
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,950
he goes,
uh,

548
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,760
they put you in jail with a bunch of men
who have sex with you.

549
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,450
I mean,
that's a joke that can last.

550
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,910
That's a fucking joke.
That would work today.

551
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:47,650
If nobody figured that out today and it
didn't exist in,

552
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,800
somebody just said that on stage today.
You know,

553
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,910
there's a lot of those though that
people like they don't realize it's been

554
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,520
said before because it just seems like
that happens.

555
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:56,870
Of course.
Even in what I do,

556
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,350
political commentary,
I'll make points and it'll be a point

557
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,560
that eight people made before me.
I think I'm some fucking genius over

558
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,130
here.
It's unavoidable.

559
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,380
Especially with like obvious points.
Like when I started out in Boston doing

560
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,050
stand up,
we're obviously right next to New

561
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,800
Hampshire and New Hampshire's state
motto on their license plate is live

562
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:17,780
free or die.
And I said,

563
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,150
yeah,
those plates are made by prisoners.

564
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,380
How fucked up is that?
And I'm sure it is.

565
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,770
I am absolutely positive.

566
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,560
Other people thought that up as well
because that's always been a thing,

567
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,810
right?
Like people would make fun of.

568
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,500
Prisoners would make license plates.
Like it was like a see in movies.

569
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,270
Like yeah,
you're going to go make license plates.

570
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,110
Like that's what happened.
You know,

571
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,840
they put the cuffs on him,
you know?

572
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,850
Yeah.
Now you'll be making license plates like

573
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,880
for some reason like being in prison was
associated with making license plates

574
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,190
there and there's some,
just because you brought up prisons,

575
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,400
there's a pivot here,
but there's some creepy stuff going on

576
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,250
in terms of the Labor that they're
getting from prisoners.

577
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,941
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

578
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:58,460
We were just talking about that with the
fires that they were paying.

579
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,600
Those guys got a dollar a day to risk
their life in the Santa Barbara fires.

580
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,920
Fuck man.
How was that allowed hate maybe give me

581
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:08,420
a month off,
you know,

582
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:10,070
or a year off or whatever.

583
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,030
You know,
maybe if you did,

584
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,700
you're not a dangerous criminal,
like maybe did something stupid,

585
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,920
you know,
some petty theft or something like that

586
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,620
and you know,
look,

587
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,990
I'll go out there and fuck the fire,
but you gotta you gotta give me some

588
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:22,940
sort of a break off my sentence.
Nope.

589
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,610
We're going to give you a dollar a day.
So they make them do it and then they

590
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,880
still had the normal sentence.
They don't even reduce it or anything.

591
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,500
I don't know.
I wish I did.

592
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,540
I mean,
I'm sure good behavior,

593
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:35,450
reducing sentences,
I'm sure that probably does something,

594
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,350
but the idea that they could pay you a
dollar a day to fight a fire.

595
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,990
It's fucking crazy or a dollar an hour
or whatever the fuck the actual number

596
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,980
was.
The way we do prisons in general

597
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
in the US is really weird because I feel
like there's like the Norwegian way of

598
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:52,650
doing stuff and the Scandinavian way of
doing stuff where they gear everything

599
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:55,980
towards rehabilitation to get them back
into society and functioning.

600
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,280
Um,
and in the US I feel like we don't gear

601
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:00,780
it towards rehabilitation.
We gear it towards punishment.

602
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,650
We're going to punish you and you know,
I,

603
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,390
I think you could,
there are fair critiques of the

604
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,710
Norwegian system like in Scandinavia.
What,

605
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,800
who's The guy?
Andrews Brevig,

606
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,020
he killed all these.
Anyone that was complaining because he's

607
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:15,240
like,
I only have a ps two and you guys need

608
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,600
to give me like a newer video game
system so you can look at that and go,

609
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,730
listen man,
you guys are being too fucking liberal.

610
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,230
Fuck that guy.
He had like two rooms that were his cell

611
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,990
and he could walk into fucking court
yard and shit.

612
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,300
So I think there are genuine criticisms
of that,

613
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,460
but at the same time what's fascinating
is they have a significantly lower

614
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,400
recidivism rate than we do.
So here,

615
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:38,010
if you go to prison,
it's very likely that you're going to

616
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:41,070
end up back in prison in those places.
If you go to prison,

617
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,750
you know,
especially if it's like a lower level

618
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,510
crime,
they rehabilitate you and you get out

619
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,970
and you're a functioning member of
society so we can learn something from

620
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:48,751
them.
In my mind,

621
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,380
I think there should be some sort of a
middle ground like I think prison should

622
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,191
be used.
Yes.

623
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,430
In some instances people need fucking
punishment in some instances of course,

624
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,030
but we need to mix that in many
instances with a healthy dose of

625
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,370
rehabilitation as well.
So we are our,

626
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:04,470
I don't know,
functioning like an actual society as

627
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:08,100
opposed to jailing more people in this
country than any other country in the

628
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:08,760
world.

629
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,330
I don't necessarily think that
punishment by itself helps anybody.

630
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,400
I mean,
if you take a gun and you lock them in a

631
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,850
cell and he's in that little tiny cell
until his body stops working and he

632
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,680
dies,
is that helping anybody?

633
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,700
I mean,
who is that helping?

634
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,220
So are there some city?
So for me,

635
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:27,150
I feel like there are some situations
where I get the idea of like life in

636
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,940
prison without the possibility for.
Yeah,

637
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,360
I get it too.
But I mean why look at a Ted Bundy

638
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,250
character or some something along those
lines.

639
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,230
Just indefensible,
right?

640
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,260
Some serial killer,
a psychopath.

641
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,420
What do you do?
Fucking kill him.

642
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,330
Just going to ask you,
how do you feel about the death penalty,

643
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,060
but now I know.
Kill him.

644
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,710
Just come on Mandy.
There's not enough time in the world to

645
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:54,711
fix a Ed gain your or who was the
fucking clown?

646
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,040
William Casey.
The clown guy who killed all those kids

647
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,570
and burden in his backyard.
Yeah.

648
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,180
There's some people that Cleveland
somewhere in Ohio.

649
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,810
So your,
your,

650
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,180
your place buddy.
There are some people who are just.

651
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,580
The point you're making is there are
some people who are too far gone.

652
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,900
When I say you're a place,
I'm not talking to you,

653
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm talking to Jamie for people just
listening,

654
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:14,140
like why is he fucking with Kyle and
saying he's involved with the cloud.

655
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,100
It's just to know I might not have even
been Ohio,

656
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,740
might've been pittsburgh somewhere dark
and cloudy.

657
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,060
So the point you're making is that there
are people who are too far gone and,

658
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,950
and I agree with that a hundred percent.
So.

659
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,300
But my whole thing on the death penalty
is I've always thought the idea of it in

660
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,120
principle is something I get.
Like you could point out all those

661
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,910
people who did those horrific things and
like there's no hope of them

662
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,100
rehabilitating their total monsters.

663
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,650
And I say philosophically,
I have no problem getting rid of those

664
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:43,480
people because you're just eliminating a
problem.

665
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,570
But in my mind,
the reason why I'm not in favor of the

666
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:49,810
death penalty is because four percent of
the time we get the wrong people.

667
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,420
Right?
So if you have a system where you're

668
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,760
guaranteed to kill the wrong people some
percentage of the time,

669
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,380
then what we're saying is,
well,

670
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,680
we're going to let the state murder
people for percent of the time and

671
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,930
that's something that I just can't have
my tax dollars going towards.

672
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,250
You know what I mean with you 100
percent,

673
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:06,250
but is it any better to have those
people locked up in a cage for the rest

674
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,900
of their life until their body stops
working?

675
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,810
Well,
I guess the idea is if you have them

676
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,590
locked up and you have people at the
innocence project working on trying to

677
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:18,460
overturn cases where there was a wrong
conviction that eventually you can write

678
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,030
the wrong of getting those wrong people
four percent of the time,

679
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,230
but it's finite.

680
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,420
If you say no,
you're going to,

681
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,280
we're going to put you on on death row
and you're going to die in eight years,

682
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:30,430
or whatever it is.
Then sometimes you can't finish the case

683
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:33,700
in time to overturn it.
And so that's my whole thing about the

684
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,534
dead.
Like I,

685
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,150
I agree philosophically,
and that's something many people to my

686
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,190
left have come after me for and said,
no,

687
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,440
you're wrong.
You should be against the death penalty

688
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,120
in principle,
but I say,

689
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,770
no,
I get it theoretically and

690
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:47,440
philosophically,
but it's just that when you actually

691
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,630
implement it,
there are pragmatic problems like,

692
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,000
you're going to kill the wrong fucking
people and I'm not okay with that.

693
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,580
You know what I mean?
I don't know if it's better to kill the

694
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:57,790
wrong people or to keep the wrong people
locked in a cage suffering for the rest

695
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:58,210
of their life.

696
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,250
Who were,
where did a William Casey live?

697
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,530
John Wayne gacy was on Wayne,
Chicago,

698
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,510
Chicago.
His middle name was Wayne.

699
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,550
John Wayne,
John Wayne gacy.

700
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:10,250
I didn't know that was William Gacy.
I'm thinking William Mason,

701
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,790
the guy from shameless.
I'm all fucked up.

702
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah.
Well,

703
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,310
we were talking about something before
the podcast and I think,

704
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,100
um,
uh,

705
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,450
this is,
I think this is really the future,

706
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:24,910
whether it's in our lifetimes or our
children's lifetimes,

707
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:28,120
but I think that they're going to be
able to read minds and I think it's not,

708
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,060
we're not far away from that.
We're going to really be able to know

709
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,630
the actual contents of your thoughts,
whether or not you really did murder a

710
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,340
bunch of kids,
burry them in your backyard.

711
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,180
We're going to know.
And until then we're dealing with a

712
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:45,010
bunch of really big fucking problems.
One of the biggest problems is people's

713
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:48,220
memories.
People's memories are so bad.

714
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,490
They're so bad.
So when you have eyewitness testimony

715
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,750
and you can convict people wrongly,
which happens every day,

716
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,540
and they think they're right,
they think they,

717
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,150
they really do believe they're right.
Really?

718
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,220
Believe it.
That's a fucking problem,

719
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,190
man.
That's just a giant problem is the human

720
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:11,050
memory is incredibly flawed.
And when someone's life is on the line

721
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,410
and you know you're going to convict,
the guy who didn't do anything,

722
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,040
he just looks kind of like what you
remember this person who murdered that

723
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,390
guy looks like,
well,

724
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:22,090
that's where a lot of the things get
overturned is because they had dna

725
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:25,510
evidence that overrides whatever the
testimony was that the people at the

726
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,050
time and speaking of technology
advancing it,

727
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,490
there's many scary aspects to it.
But,

728
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,590
you know,
the elephant in the room to me is the

729
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,810
fact that look at what the NSA is
already doing.

730
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,510
They're already spying on absolutely
everybody in the country.

731
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,120
They collect all of our metadata and
stored.

732
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,270
It's a multibillion dollar facility in
Utah.

733
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,820
And then like,
there's no doubt that all this

734
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,920
technology is going to be used against
us.

735
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,360
You know what I mean?
Well,

736
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:52,190
it certainly can be if they choose to.
Like if you become a guy like a,

737
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:52,980
uh,
you know,

738
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,470
like Julian songs or who leaks something
and then they go,

739
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,020
hey,
let's go pull up Kyle's a text message

740
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,580
records.
Oh look,

741
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:05,690
he looks crossdressing fucking people's
mouths.

742
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,160
What?
Whatever it is.

743
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:07,890
I mean,
they,

744
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,890
they can and then they could leak that
to whatever media people that they're in

745
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,200
bed width.
There's just a lot of shit that they can

746
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,011
get away with.
Well,

747
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,370
that's partially what they did with
Eliot Spitzer because Elliot Spitzer,

748
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:22,530
they called them the sheriff of Wall
Street because crack down on Wall Street

749
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:23,361
and then,
oops,

750
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:23,990
look at that.

751
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,960
His,
his credit card information from the

752
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:30,590
brothel he went to was leaked to a press
outlet.

753
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,180
Well,
how the fuck did you get the credit card

754
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,160
information?
Because they knew what they were looking

755
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,940
for because they were trying to bring
him down that he was actually going

756
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:40,340
after brothel.
That's what I was going to say and I

757
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:43,700
think it was his hypocrisy that brought
him down and not the fact that he went

758
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,100
to a brothel stay.
You're cracking down on brothels and

759
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,560
going into brothels at the same.
Just arresting people.

760
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,880
Yeah.
Was fucked up.

761
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,010
It was ridiculous.
It's like if like.

762
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,290
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense that he

763
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,580
thought that he could get away with
that,

764
00:33:55,581 --> 00:34:00,110
but the real problem with that guys,
that guy was an interesting politician.

765
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,470
He really did have some really good
points,

766
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,940
a lot like a wiener was kind of
interesting in that way too.

767
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,100
He had some really good points.
He's a great speaker,

768
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,620
but he was also free.
Did you see the documentary on him?

769
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,300
I did it.
I mean,

770
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,190
will you want to.
I didn't finish it though.

771
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,410
I've watched part of it and then I just
got bored.

772
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,630
I mean you want to talk about a fall
from grace.

773
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,790
He was somebody who was viewed as like,
oh,

774
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:26,840
there's fire breather on the left who
goes after people and doesn't take any

775
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:29,060
shit,
and then fast forward and it's like,

776
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,710
oh,
you got caught,

777
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,230
you know,
sending Dick Pics to like 80,000 women.

778
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Some of them under age and I feel so bad
for his wife sending Dick Pics while he

779
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:44,201
was holding his kid,
his kid sending pictures of him with his

780
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,890
kid and his arms and his boner.
That's one of those scandals where it's

781
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:49,700
like,
nope,

782
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,810
you're not coming back for that.

783
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,180
Everybody's like,
fuck off.

784
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,500
This is what I said.
So I said on the podcast,

785
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,570
and I'm saying right now,
I think he's in jail right now.

786
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,404
Right?
Is he in jail?

787
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,900
He's in jail.
I don't know if you go into jail,

788
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,640
Andrew,
you're a comic.

789
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,950
You just don't know it.
You just don't know it.

790
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,550
I guarantee he's a comic.
He just never did it and he just went

791
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,920
into politics and you know,
he's a real good speaker.

792
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,020
He's kind of a funny guy.
Okay.

793
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,530
So I wanted to talk to you about comedy.
I really did because.

794
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,440
So I've had,
um,

795
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,690
I've done a few live things in my life.
I did a live show once and then,

796
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,350
um,
but I also did a best man speeches in

797
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,370
front of rooms of,
you know,

798
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,460
over 100 people.
The first one best man's speech I did,

799
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:32,990
I cried like a pitch.

800
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,420
It was the saddest thing ever.
I'm up there talking about one of my

801
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:39,380
best friends and I'm like,
we used to wrestle on the triple e.

802
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,610
It was,
it was pathetic.

803
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,970
It was pathetic though.
That's just some emotions you,

804
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,090
you care about the guy.
Well,

805
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,560
yeah,
that's the thing is that people came up

806
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,810
to me after and they,
they liked it and they were like,

807
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:49,800
Oh man,
that was great.

808
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:50,720
It was heartfelt.
I was like,

809
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,670
I barely fucking said a word that
anybody can understand cause I was

810
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:54,504
blubbering.
It was,

811
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,390
but that's okay.
But I think there's a real problem that

812
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,530
people have with avoiding emotions,
you know?

813
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,190
I was too vulnerable in front of people.
I didn't know that was a good banner.

814
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,680
You're defending me.
Thank you for that.

815
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:09,030
But the second best man speech I gave,
I went into it thinking like,

816
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,640
okay,
I'm gonna I'm gonna crush a little bit.

817
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,610
I was thinking that a little bit,
but like,

818
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,510
so I,
I like to,

819
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,240
when I talk I like to have just bullet
points of what I want to talk about and

820
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,800
just,
just a loose outline and then I'll riff

821
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:23,460
off of it.
And what happened was all the lines that

822
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,370
I thought would get a laugh did not get
a laugh,

823
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,060
but all my throwaway lines got good
laughs.

824
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,930
So I was amazed by that.
And then also I was amazed at the

825
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:38,931
fucking rush of getting a room to hang
on your every word and to genuinely

826
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,980
laugh at what you're saying.
Yeah.

827
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,480
And so every time you do stand up,
is that the feeling you get?

828
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,210
You definitely get a rush.
There's no doubt about it.

829
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,370
You crush,
you get a rush.

830
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,500
Yeah.
You get a.

831
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,520
well,
it's a different rush and different size

832
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:58,320
places like there's more of a surreal
thing when you get a.

833
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,260
there's a,
there's an area you get to like around

834
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,750
5,000,
6,000 people where it gets real.

835
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,570
It gets real weird,
man.

836
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,240
It gets fucking weird.
That gets weird.

837
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,510
Like almost like you are you just a,
you're doing a show then more than

838
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:17,220
you're connecting with people.
You're going to come to the comedy store

839
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:19,530
tonight.
That's a intimate place.

840
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:24,060
That's 150 people.
That's tight little small room and

841
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,820
that's like you're there,
you're there with the people.

842
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,490
It's different.
That's a rush too though.

843
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,020
That's a different.
It's a different rush.

844
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:32,550
They're all.
It's all a rush,

845
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,730
but
your responsibility to the material and

846
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:43,761
the delivery sort of overrides the rush
because you can't really get caught up

847
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,121
in and go,
wow,

848
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:49,290
this is amazing because you have to be
thinking about the timing.

849
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,110
You have to be tuned into exactly what
you're thinking about.

850
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:53,580
You can't be thinking about,
oh,

851
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:55,020
this is getting a lot of great laughs.

852
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,380
You have to honestly be thinking about
the actual subject.

853
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,690
People fucking know what you're thinking
about.

854
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:01,740
Man.
It's weird,

855
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:02,574
isn't it?
Well,

856
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,250
I think it's a type of hypnosis.
I think,

857
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,970
and I don't mean hypnosis like you,
you tricked the people into doing

858
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:12,210
something,
but I mean like you mind meld with the

859
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:17,211
audience and some sort of a weird way.
People know when you're on some sort of

860
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:21,300
a script and they know when you're
talking from the heart and it's really

861
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:25,300
strange because you could have somebody
who's well versed in going through a

862
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,390
script,
but there's still something that's

863
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,020
missing from what they're saying and I
feel like that's one of the many reasons

864
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:34,290
why this podcast is very popular because
you get people on here and you just have

865
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:39,291
a conversation and your you are really
connecting and then you're also really

866
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,650
connecting with people who are watching
because you're just having a

867
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,130
conversation.

868
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,950
It's like you're at a bar and
everybody's just kind of talking and

869
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,480
it's not like people come here and
they're like,

870
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,260
let me now go to my point that I was
going to make on this and this.

871
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,880
Because that's when people start to
yawn.

872
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,690
And that's actually why I think a lot of
the.

873
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,510
The older shows like you know the.
Not to shit on the late night hosts,

874
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,120
but that's why I feel like that kind of
dying out.

875
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,650
And there's this giant rise of the
Internet.

876
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:06,370
Because that's all very segmented and
structured and you have to go in and out

877
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,460
real fast and it's,
there's nothing human about it.

878
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:13,300
It's almost like it's celebrities
telling you were on this different level

879
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:17,530
and you're going to watch us be on this
different level as opposed to just being

880
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,660
a regular person and they like work with
Spielberg.

881
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,740
Well,
it's interesting.

882
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,100
Steven is a amazing director.
It's just,

883
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,810
it's just so huge.
And also you would be like the talk show

884
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:30,580
host,
so you'd be sitting there and I'd be

885
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:31,120
sitting.
Yeah,

886
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,953
yeah,
yeah.

887
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,420
Which is weird.
And I'd be turning sideways facing him.

888
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:39,760
I mean it's so it's so follow leader
copycat because this is just the way

889
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:43,180
they did it with Jack Paar right back in
the fucking 18 hundreds,

890
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,400
whatever the fuck that was.
Right.

891
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,550
And they go from there to Jimmy Kimmel
who does it the same way and then the

892
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,290
first time somebody breaks the fuck and
mold.

893
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,820
Everybody's like,
what is this?

894
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:52,770
This is brilliant.
Why?

895
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,730
Why aren't we doing more of this?
This makes sense.

896
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,860
I mean,
you could kind of do this conversation

897
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,740
in front of a large group of people.
I mean,

898
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,860
a lot of people do do live podcasts.
I feel like it's a little different

899
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:03,390
though.

900
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,980
We're in the field,
so like that too because I don't know.

901
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:10,220
I feel like there's an energy that you
get from the audience where you kind of

902
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,240
try more to do those punchy one liners
on postage is flowing 100 percent.

903
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,180
Yeah,
you do.

904
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:19,450
And sometimes it's great.
Like I've done some live ones before

905
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,510
with friends and it's great and we did
the end of the world podcast.

906
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:27,511
We did a live podcast from the comedy
store at the night of the election and

907
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,890
during the election we realized that
trump,

908
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:32,680
we saying it's the end of the world no
matter who wins because you're writing,

909
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,820
but when trump won,
I mean bill burr was just on fire in

910
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,630
front of this fucking that guy.
Smart man,

911
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,840
smart.
Not just smart,

912
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:45,841
but that he had material about this that
was just perfect and it just was

913
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:51,370
crushing and there was a panel of six
other comics were all just laughing and

914
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:51,640
talking.

915
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,070
Shit though is a lot of fun.
And it worked.

916
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,900
That work.
That's one of the rare times that work,

917
00:40:55,901 --> 00:41:00,760
but the way we did it was we had a chair
or a table set up and then we all sat

918
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:03,910
facing the audience and just talked,
you know,

919
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,310
like,
like a regular podcast but in front of a

920
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,350
live crowd.
And then someone would come out with

921
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:10,840
Brian Hennigan would come out and give
us the updates.

922
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,370
Trump is ahead by,
you know,

923
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,560
18 points.
So did,

924
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,630
did you see that coming trump winning or
no?

925
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,300
Um,
I thought it was entirely possible.

926
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,760
I thought it was entirely possible.
I didn't see it coming.

927
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:25,630
I felt like everybody was so convinced
that Hillary was gonna win.

928
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,900
I just felt like that was probably what
was going to happen.

929
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,590
So I feel like one of the reasons why
my,

930
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,540
my show got popular over is stuck in my
own digging.

931
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,490
This sounds so gross,
but,

932
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:41,160
but I actually predicted a pretty early
on when Hillary,

933
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:42,830
it was clear Hillary was going to get
the nomination.

934
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,590
I was sounding the alarms and I was
saying,

935
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,440
listen,
Hillary versus trump is a worst case

936
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:52,160
scenario because Hillary Clinton is the
status quo.

937
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,100
She is the establishment.
She is business as usual.

938
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,320
She doesn't have a message,
she doesn't have a vision.

939
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,080
All she's doing is spewing platitudes
and cliches,

940
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,360
break down the barrier,
stronger together,

941
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,530
doing identity politics nonstop,
which is nothing but pandering and not

942
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,740
talking about policy substance.
And then like we touched on earlier,

943
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,260
you had Donald Trump who,
uh,

944
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,660
I disagree with him on virtually
everything,

945
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,150
but the guy knows how to fucking play to
a crowd,

946
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,520
knows how to tell people what they want
to hear.

947
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,740
So when he's in front of a blue collar
audience,

948
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:23,970
he's out there ripping the trade deals
and say,

949
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:26,120
I'm going to keep your jobs in the
country and it's gonna be amazing.

950
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,330
And that's something that landed.
And then when you have hillary,

951
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:34,331
so dumb is to not a campaign.
And what Michigan and some Ohio was

952
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,470
whole house I think she went to,
but some of the rust belt states.

953
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,120
Well,
the reason he ended up winning is

954
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:42,710
because of the rust belt.
So and my whole point was trump is a

955
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,310
populist and admittedly when push came
to shove,

956
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,220
now that he's elected a fake populous
because he has Goldman Sachs throughout

957
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,020
his administration and you serving Wall
Street,

958
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,500
but a fake populist will always beat a
status quo politician.

959
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,640
Biggest people are sick and tired of
business as usual and they feel like,

960
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,980
well,
I'm getting shafted now and she's coming

961
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,630
along telling me I'm going to keep
everything the same.

962
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:08,480
Why the fuck would I be happy and
excited to vote for her?

963
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,980
It was like there was so many things
that were in place that were against

964
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:13,130
her.

965
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,980
First of all,
she would.

966
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,000
She has absolutely poor health and it
was admitted by her husband that she had

967
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:24,620
fallen down and cracked her head open
and had pretty severe brain injury that

968
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:26,900
she took.
Took more than six months for her to

969
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:28,460
recover.
According to bill,

970
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,250
we saw our fainting all the time.
I mean,

971
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:31,771
she,
she,

972
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,230
yeah,
that was creepy at the nine slash 11

973
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:35,620
thing when she's not good.
It's just in the.

974
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,590
Oh,
she had the flu.

975
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,640
I've had the flu.
I don't fall asleep.

976
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm standing up.
I mean,

977
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:42,740
that shit ain't good.
That's not good.

978
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,520
And that was just one thing.
The other thing is she's just a

979
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:50,480
disingenuous person when the whole comey
thing with the FBI,

980
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:53,180
when he,
when there was a video that came out

981
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:58,181
where he explained what the charges were
and what they had found about the emails

982
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,530
and then she explained the version of
it.

983
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,720
She's just not honest.
Yeah.

984
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,970
Then it was the whole gay marriage
thing.

985
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,190
She didn't support gay marriage.
Twenty 13,

986
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:09,230
13.
That's fucking crazy.

987
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,810
That's crazy.
And then here's the other thing,

988
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,330
she's a woman.
There's a lot of sexists.

989
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,730
There's a lot of people that didn't want
a woman to be president,

990
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:18,920
period.
Especially not a woman that could point

991
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,960
to all these floors.
Poor health,

992
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,650
liar,
dishonest in bed with Wall Street,

993
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,390
uh,
gets paid by banks.

994
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,670
Hundreds of thousand dollars won't
release the transcripts.

995
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,040
Clinton Foundation seems Kinda Shady.
There's so different things that were

996
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,460
against her.
She put the fact that she's a woman

997
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,360
front and center on with her was her
campaign slogan and you know what

998
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,180
happens when you try to shove identity
politics down people's throats.

999
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,510
They you to fuck off because they go,
I don't care that you're a woman.

1000
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,820
I want to know what you're going to do
for the country,

1001
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,140
but the people were that were into that.
We're telling her that that was going to

1002
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:53,280
be her key to victory.
We're going to make history.

1003
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,820
Nobody knows less about politics than
democratic strategist in Washington dc

1004
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,420
because as of right now,
what they're trying to do is they're

1005
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,920
trying to fight back against their base,
so they're based.

1006
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,310
It's people like me and what we want.
I'm very clear about what I want.

1007
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,120
It's not hard to please people like me
who are on the left.

1008
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,220
We want a living wage.

1009
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,770
We want Medicare for all which you know,
every other modern nation has one

1010
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,660
version or another of a single payer
healthcare system.

1011
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,100
We just want to be like the rest of the
modern world.

1012
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,310
We want free college again,
Slovenia has fucking free college.

1013
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,830
We can't afford to do free college when
we just spent seven fucking trillion

1014
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:34,530
dollars on the Iraq war.
We want to end the wars.

1015
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,070
So I have very clear policy goals that I
want.

1016
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,170
And guess what?
Bernie Sanders came along,

1017
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,430
spoke about those issues.
He went from being this obscure senator

1018
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:47,250
from Vermont,
which has a population of 12 people to

1019
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:52,251
getting 47 percent of the vote in a race
against a political juggernaut,

1020
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,890
a behemoth that had the entire
Democratic Party machine behind her.

1021
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,890
So they were rigging the primers 100
percent.

1022
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:00,000
Yes.
And that's what we learned.

1023
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,110
And that's why,
uh,

1024
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,000
Julian assange went from being viewed
as,

1025
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,740
oh my God,
this guy is great.

1026
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,810
That's how the left used to view them.
And now many people,

1027
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,610
democratic partisans are like,
ah,

1028
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,660
fuck this Guy Russia,
Russia,

1029
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,520
that I.
that's.

1030
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,500
And I was just talking to you about this
before the podcast.

1031
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,500
I was watching CNN before he came here
for about an hour and 30 minutes

1032
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,120
nonstop.
Russia coverage,

1033
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,680
nonstop,
fucking Russia coverage.

1034
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:22,170
And then guess what?
Now when Donald trump goes out there and

1035
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,490
he's a fake news,
CNN,

1036
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,481
everyone's going to go,
yeah,

1037
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,100
you know what?
All they do is fucking talk about Russia

1038
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,050
all day long,
so maybe the guy has a point,

1039
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,160
so the institutions that we have and the
establishment as it is,

1040
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,990
it opens up the door for a demagogue and
a liar and a fake populist like trump to

1041
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:41,310
come in there and exploited.
So if you give people a choice between a

1042
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:45,120
broken system that's fucking them over
where half of workers in America make

1043
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,800
$30,000 a year or less.

1044
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,210
You give people an option between keep
everything as is or take a fucking human

1045
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:53,580
bowling ball and throw it at the
establishment.

1046
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,631
They're going to say,
okay,

1047
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:56,280
fuck it.
We'll roll the dice on this trump guy.

1048
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,070
And then meanwhile I look at his agenda
and everything that he's done since he's

1049
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,050
got elected,
it's the opposite of his populist

1050
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:05,190
rhetoric on the campaign trail.
His fucking tax bill had a 33 percent

1051
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:08,220
favorable rating and they were bragging
about it when they passed it.

1052
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,110
This is a bill that cuts corporate taxes
from 35 percent to 21 percent at a time

1053
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:16,110
when corporations already paying a
historically low percentage of the tax

1054
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:20,460
burden and it raises taxes on everybody
that makes $75,000 a year or less over a

1055
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:24,000
10 year period.
I mean you couldn't get a piece of

1056
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:28,320
legislation that spits in the face of
working people more than that,

1057
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,860
but the saddest thing is

1058
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,300
this guy is so comically easy to beat,
but the Democrats can't get their shit

1059
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,690
together because they're fighting back
against the grassroots who care about

1060
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,180
the issues because they're in bed with
corporations.

1061
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,400
The Democrats are in bed with
corporations just like the Republicans

1062
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,740
are.
So if you've got this corrupt party

1063
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:48,130
establishment and they're trying to
tamper down the wing of the party,

1064
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,990
that can actually win,
well then guess what?

1065
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,610
You're going to keep losing to these
monsters,

1066
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:55,570
these comic book villains on the right.
Don't you think that the parties

1067
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,990
themselves,
there's a giant issue with the momentum

1068
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:01,330
behind them,
the lobbyists and special interest

1069
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:05,650
groups,
the embedded just sort of ecosystem that

1070
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:10,651
they both carry with them for someone
new to step in and sort of represent the

1071
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:16,300
actual people like yourself that have
this very clear view.

1072
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,900
Well that's why they have so many people
that they're beholden to by the time

1073
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:22,240
they get into a position where they can
even run for president,

1074
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,060
they've all been vetted and checked and
well,

1075
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:25,840
that's why they're.

1076
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,230
There are some keys here.
So one of the most important things is

1077
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,270
when you look at a politician who's
running thing,

1078
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,850
number one is check.
Do they take corporate PAC money?

1079
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,130
If the answer's yes,
fuck,

1080
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:39,940
I'm not interested.
If you don't take corporate PAC money,

1081
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:43,090
that means okay,
at least I know you're being honest and

1082
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:45,100
you're being open and when you talk I
can believe you.

1083
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,070
But if the problem comes along that
successful politician,

1084
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:52,570
someone who could actually possibly when
they do take corporate pac money,

1085
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,010
but there are a better alternative than
say a,

1086
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,341
you know,
pence.

1087
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:59,710
If pence shirts to be present after then
you go,

1088
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,150
okay,
we've got to choose the lesser of two

1089
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:02,980
evils.
That's essentially what we did with

1090
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,970
Hillary,
right?

1091
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,490
That's right.
And I get into that weird position

1092
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:06,851
where,
yeah,

1093
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:07,990
she's kind of corrupt,
but look,

1094
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:09,370
she's going to be historic.

1095
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,010
She's a woman.
She's infinitely more qualified than him

1096
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:14,170
and he had the Lesser Evil Ism thing is
a,

1097
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:19,171
is a big issue because that's the game
that's played on the American people.

1098
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,540
And I think Americans know that it's
being played on them.

1099
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,730
You know,
like if you look at the um,

1100
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,810
the opinion polls on Congress,
Congress oscillates between a 14 percent

1101
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:31,540
approval rating and a 21 percent
approval rating and what's supposed to

1102
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:32,860
be a democracy.
So in other words,

1103
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:35,500
you vote these people in and then two
weeks later you go ask people,

1104
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:36,460
Hey,
what do you think of the Congress?

1105
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:39,010
You just voted in?
And like 14 percent of them are like,

1106
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:40,510
I think they're good.
Everybody else was like,

1107
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,270
fuck them.
So we all know that there's a problem

1108
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,950
here.
And the root of the problem is the

1109
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:47,560
corruption of the system.
And the corporate money flooding our

1110
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,740
politics and then the politicians get in
there and all they do is represent the

1111
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,480
corporations and they don't represent
the people.

1112
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,610
So to your point,
yeah,

1113
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:58,150
in order to rise up through this system,
that's why they.

1114
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,330
That's why the establishment loved
Hillary Clinton because she played by

1115
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,300
the rules in this corrupt system.
Did you know that?

1116
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,300
Her and bill through their entire
career,

1117
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,350
they raised over $3,000,000,000 in
private donations.

1118
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,750
That's hilarious.
And that's how you get to the point

1119
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:16,360
where it was wall to wall.
Obviously she's going to win.

1120
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:18,440
This is a no brainer and everybody loves
her.

1121
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:21,670
I know everybody loves her on Fucking
Wall Street and in Washington DC.

1122
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,991
But.
And again,

1123
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,820
this to go back to the Bernie Sanders
point,

1124
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,950
now we're seeing more politicians coming
up that are

1125
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,490
in his model where they say,
I'm not gonna.

1126
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,170
Take any corporate PAC money I have.
I don't even want a super PAC.

1127
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,650
If I run for president.
And then what happens is people know at

1128
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,770
the end of the day I can trust that
person even if I don't agree with that

1129
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,450
person.
And that's why Bernie Sanders is the

1130
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:43,490
most popular politician in the country
by a mile and a half.

1131
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,150
He's the most popular by a long shot.
And the reason is there are even many

1132
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:48,710
people on the right who look at him and
go,

1133
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,900
you know what,
I don't agree with them on abortion.

1134
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,410
I don't agree with him on this or that,
but I trust the guy and I think he's

1135
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:55,244
fighting for me.

1136
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:57,130
Well,
there's definitely that.

1137
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,390
I mean there's,
he's,

1138
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,730
he's a guy that really has a clean
record in terms of like the money that

1139
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:08,410
he's taken.
That alone is very unique and that alone

1140
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:11,170
makes him stand out from the other
people that were running for president.

1141
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,860
When you look at the future though,
like who?

1142
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,900
Other than him.
And I think the problem with him is

1143
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:18,250
he's,
he's another one.

1144
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:21,580
He's not a good health.
He's a thousand years old.

1145
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:22,990
We could just say it.
It's also,

1146
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,760
well,
there's people that are his age that are

1147
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:26,950
in very good shape.
Like how old is he?

1148
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,160
Uh,
75,

1149
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,770
four,
seven.

1150
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,613
Jamie,
can you check that?

1151
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,050
My friend Aaron Snyder had a podcast the
other day with a gentleman who's 78

1152
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,610
years old who goes on backpacks,
solo,

1153
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:42,760
alcance,
any rides,

1154
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:46,510
holy mountain bikes and exercises and
does all this shit.

1155
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:50,500
Like there are people out there that are
his age that take care of their body,

1156
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,660
but the problem with Bernie,
76,

1157
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,770
76 sit somewhere in the middle of his
sternum.

1158
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,000
He's got.
He's going Dr. posture like he looks

1159
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:06,001
like a Schlubby slumpy sort of unhealthy
person,

1160
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:08,740
doesn't he?
And I know that's not unimportant,

1161
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:12,040
but it is kind of important to people.
You want some?

1162
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,320
Yeah.
You're saying the optics of it matter to

1163
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:15,041
an extent.
Sure.

1164
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,230
I mean out there.
Well there are.

1165
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,360
There are a few good politicians.
So for example,

1166
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:22,510
Rocana is a positive.
She's actually from California.

1167
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,820
He's a congressman.
I want the name.

1168
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,330
He has risen usual.
He's risen through the ranks.

1169
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,530
Star Trek Guy.
Well he's a bad ass.

1170
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,100
He's a bad ass.
So know I could maybe hook up if you

1171
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:35,290
wanted to have him on the podcast.
I'll talk to them and see if he'd be

1172
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:36,130
willing to come on.
I think he would,

1173
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,470
but um,
he's a,

1174
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,750
he's a young guy.
And how old really smart guy.

1175
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,040
I don't know exactly how old he is,
but he's,

1176
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,090
he's young.
You have to be,

1177
00:52:43,091 --> 00:52:46,030
what,
39 or something to run for Congress.

1178
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,880
I'm 35.
Jamie,

1179
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:53,050
check that fact to our presidents.
30 presidents.

1180
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,070
Thirty five.
There you go.

1181
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:54,963
That's so young.

1182
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,720
I was retarded when I was retarded.
Now when I'm 30,

1183
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,730
I'm so fucking stupid.
When I was 35.

1184
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,820
How can you allow people to be 35 years
old and run for president?

1185
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,200
Yeah.
So crazy.

1186
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,450
Yeah.
But I mean at the same time,

1187
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,800
I'm sure there are some people who can
do the job,

1188
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:10,780
but anyway,
back to Rocana.

1189
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:11,860
Rocana.
Um,

1190
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,170
he's a bad ass.
He's,

1191
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,330
he doesn't take any corporate PAC money.
He's got a great record of fighting for

1192
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:19,330
the people.
He's one of the few people who remember

1193
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:23,420
when we were talking about going to
Syria and doubling down on doing in

1194
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:25,770
Syria.
Will trump recently announced we're

1195
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:26,070
staying

1196
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,470
there indefinitely.
So we have a permanent military

1197
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,040
occupation in Syria.
Rocana is one of the very few voices in

1198
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:32,910
Congress.
I mean,

1199
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,680
all the Democrats should be out there
saying,

1200
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:36,630
what the fuck are we doing here?
Let's get out of what the.

1201
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,870
What's the point of being there?
Rocana was one of the few who actually

1202
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,150
spoke up about it and actually said,
no,

1203
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:43,620
this is crazy.
Number one,

1204
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,030
we shouldn't be there.
Number two,

1205
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,180
we haven't even had a vote on it and
congress.

1206
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,820
The whole idea is if you go do a
military intervention according to the

1207
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,690
constitution,
you have to get a declaration of war

1208
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:56,820
from Congress and real constantly.
This is crazy.

1209
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:59,100
We're nowhere near abiding by the
constitution here.

1210
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:01,560
We have to at least have a vote on it.
He's one person.

1211
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:04,260
Tulsi Gabbard is another politician
who's fantastic,

1212
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,490
who is a weird names.

1213
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,590
Let me see this real kind of person
first.

1214
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,930
Let me see what they look like.
I'm going to give him the sniff test.

1215
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,630
This is how Americans do it,
and look at a man.

1216
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,580
I don't know about this guy.
Show him Tulsi.

1217
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,320
Gavin,
I'm very curious what you going to say

1218
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,131
about Tulsa?
You average.

1219
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:19,300
Let me go with the person first.
Sure.

1220
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,420
Yeah.
My first guest on spelling didn't pull

1221
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:26,010
up what I was o k h a n n a.
that's one name.

1222
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,640
That can't be one name as the first row
was the first name.

1223
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,950
Khan is the last name.
What's his first name?

1224
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,690
So it caught me off guard.
Fuck Outta here.

1225
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:35,730
With that,
let me see what it looks like.

1226
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,990
He's from a silicon valley.
How do you say it's silicon or silicon?

1227
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,730
Silicon now you're confusing me.
I think I say silicon.

1228
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,950
I don't know if that's right though.

1229
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,430
Well,
yeah,

1230
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,900
he uh,
that fucking name.

1231
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:56,610
I don't know about that name.
But then again saying Obama got elected

1232
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:57,480
president.
We

1233
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,100
scrutinize this fellow.
Hm.

1234
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,240
Well,
we got a lot of good things here going.

1235
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,520
First of all,
the diversity factor is high.

1236
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,940
It's off the charts,
but what I love about Roe is that he

1237
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:12,180
doesn't do the fake bullshit identity
politics of like,

1238
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,160
I'm not white,
therefore,

1239
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,960
you know,
I'm great.

1240
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:16,800
He does.
In fact,

1241
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,300
he's one of the very few politicians who
regularly speaks up about people in the

1242
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,930
middle of the country who got their
fucking factory jobs outsourced because

1243
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,990
corporations wanted to make more money
and he's against all these trade deals

1244
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,240
and said Dork with the tee shirt on.
Fired up.

1245
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,980
Ready for row,
dude.

1246
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,660
Okay.
I need you.

1247
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,300
I need you to just rethink your life.
That looks like a yellow shirt.

1248
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,470
A young fatter.
Mario Lopez to the right too.

1249
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,720
Doesn't it?
A little bit.

1250
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,270
Sorry Mario.
No offense.

1251
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,900
Was that him with Ted Kennedy down there
in the lower right hand corner?

1252
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,200
Yeah,
but I think that split screen Asian.

1253
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,113
Ted Kennedy.

1254
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,690
I'm sorry,
whoever that person is.

1255
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:01,260
But in the tiny screen it did look like
Ted Kennedy before you build it up.

1256
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,550
Yeah.
Okay.

1257
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,640
So this guy show him Tulsi Gabin.
See?

1258
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,500
So He's a congressman in California?
Yes.

1259
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,670
Alright.
Yeah,

1260
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,790
yeah.
Tulsi tea.

1261
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,810
You one of the people that's being
thought of as a possible Democratic

1262
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:18,480
candidates because a lot of people are
talking right now about.

1263
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,260
No,
I'll tell you.

1264
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,240
I'll tell you who's going to run in 20,
20 copra.

1265
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,380
Okay.
No disrespect to you,

1266
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,550
Oprah,
if you happen to see this,

1267
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,070
but fuck off.
No,

1268
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,700
no disrespect to you.
The Rock.

1269
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,820
But fuck off.
Tulsi is kind of how I.

1270
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,230
that's like you going to say that?
That's what I kept insisting you show

1271
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,740
from Hawaii.
I think so.

1272
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,840
Two things.
I liked both of those things,

1273
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,240
but so for,
in 20,

1274
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,300
20,
a little too hot,

1275
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,600
let me see.

1276
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,570
Closing on her.
Make her a little larger.

1277
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:46,210
Organist spoken.
Tells me your chances are very pretty.

1278
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,870
She's a beautiful woman.
I mean is America ready for a beautiful

1279
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:51,960
woman to run for president with all her
boyfriend?

1280
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,940
She's a brilliant woman and but she's
also beautiful.

1281
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:01,600
So it takes no corporate PAC money also
as against all these unnecessary regime

1282
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:05,200
change wars.
So I think she's also goes to spin class

1283
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,970
also does box jumps,
but 20 slash 20 show the military.

1284
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,320
She was.
Yes.

1285
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,670
Interesting.
That's a good.

1286
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,650
That's a positive.
You got a lot of those little colored

1287
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:17,320
things on our shirt and again,
she's one of the strongest voices

1288
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:19,330
against.
Go into Syria and all that,

1289
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,280
you know,
will also had a lot of those things on a

1290
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:22,240
shirt.
L,

1291
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:25,430
Ron Hubbard.
Remember the car?

1292
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,480
That guy was fucking.
I don't think his were legit though.

1293
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,410
I'm going to go out on a limb.

1294
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:30,723
Yeah,
she looks.

1295
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,740
She looks good.
I like it.

1296
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,700
So,
um,

1297
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
for 20 slash 20,
I'll tell you who's going to run.

1298
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,210
Bernie's going to run again.
He is.

1299
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:38,380
Yes he can.
He do that?

1300
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,650
Who's going to run?
He'll be 78 years old.

1301
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,800
He's riding a fucking wave though.
I'm on Gh.

1302
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,810
I've been lifted.
I'm going to try to straighten my leg.

1303
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:49,100
Go.
I tried to pull it back up into this

1304
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,860
position.
I got one of those things.

1305
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,110
It hangs from the door.
I'm stretching my neck.

1306
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,510
He's like Larry.
Larry.

1307
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:56,110
David,
right?

1308
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,943
It looks like Larry.
David.

1309
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,410
Yeah.
What about Oprah?

1310
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,210
Oprah's not running bullshit.
She's not running.

1311
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,540
She's gonna run.
I'm calling her right now.

1312
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:02,920
She's nine months now.
She's not running.

1313
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:03,611
She's running.
Well,

1314
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,530
that'd be fodder for us to laugh at for
a long time.

1315
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,760
I don't know man.
She might win.

1316
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,350
No fucking NBC.

1317
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:13,030
Whoever the Dork is that was running the
NBC twitter that was saying our

1318
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,500
president,
like they about Oprah.

1319
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,430
That yeah,
no,

1320
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,900
and Oprah gave that speech.
That was at the Golden Globes.

1321
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,630
She gave this big giant game and
everybody was like,

1322
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:25,330
she's got a vagina.
Let her talk,

1323
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,220
and she,
she's keeping me listen.

1324
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,390
Big powerful speech.
Hollywood is so fucking insular.

1325
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:35,470
They love sniffing their own farts and
suck in their own Dick clueless actress.

1326
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,960
Stacey Dash is running for Congress in
California.

1327
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,530
Stacey dash is like a Republican.
She's like a hard time.

1328
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:43,450
She was on Fox News.
Trump supporter.

1329
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,920
Republican.
Yeah,

1330
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,754
she was from.
Oh,

1331
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,050
clueless.
The movie.

1332
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,780
They meant.
Not that she's clueless.

1333
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,060
I read it wrong.
Maybe she is clueless to,

1334
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,340
but stacey dash is like super hardcore.
Oh yeah.

1335
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,900
Super Hardcore Republican Fox
commentator known for controversial

1336
00:58:58,901 --> 00:58:59,734
opinions.

1337
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,110
So Oprah.
Oprah.

1338
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,970
No,
not right now.

1339
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,600
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you,

1340
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,210
the Edmund's going to be the first man.
The Rock not running.

1341
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,250
Mark Zuckerberg wants to run,
but he might not run.

1342
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,050
Why don't you think he'll run?
Is He old enough?

1343
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,710
He's said he's old enough,
but like getting in under the wire.

1344
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,510
How fucking goofy is that guy,
man?

1345
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,460
I mean goofy.
He's showed a picture of him like

1346
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:25,310
fucking feeding a lamb or some shit.
He did an okay to fetal lamb.

1347
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,500
What's wrong with this person?
I'm anti lamb feeding.

1348
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,860
I'm taking a strong stance on the Joe
Rogan.

1349
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:35,600
Someone wants lambs to starve to death
tune in secular talk podcast.

1350
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,800
I'm mark Zuckerberg.
He's been doing this goofy Torah where

1351
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,740
he goes to Iowa and pretends to eat with
regular people and he's like,

1352
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:47,090
I spoke to a guy named Ted today and he
has a interesting story.

1353
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,460
Hmm.
I hate the pandering.

1354
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,810
Where they to.
That's the thing,

1355
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:52,760
like when they bring up the personal
stories in there,

1356
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:55,220
like pretending to care about some
random dude in Kentucky.

1357
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,151
It's like,
fuck off.

1358
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,130
Just tell me what your ideas are.
You don't have to do the fake empathy

1359
00:59:58,131 --> 00:59:58,791
shit.
Right,

1360
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,624
right,
right.

1361
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,700
Uh,
so I don't think he's going to run even

1362
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:04,310
though he wants to because he'll get his
ass handed to him.

1363
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:06,980
Mark Cuban is another guy with a giant
ego who's thinking about it,

1364
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:10,820
but I don't think he'll end up doing it.
I don't think they want that scrutiny.

1365
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,201
Like,
yeah,

1366
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:13,920
a lot of shit comes out.
Yeah.

1367
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:15,500
I mean,
think about who trump was.

1368
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:18,410
Preelection and trump is now.
Before the election,

1369
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:22,640
he was kind of lovable.
He's like this lovable egomaniac.

1370
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,900
Weirdo guy.
He had the election.

1371
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:26,481
Yeah.
Well,

1372
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:28,040
you know,
let me take that back because it was all

1373
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,850
that birther shit that was pretty wacky,
but pre birth or shit,

1374
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,310
he was the guy who played the role of
the.

1375
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,580
I'm the big boss,
corporate sky.

1376
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,550
Skye.
I'm the state.

1377
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,370
It was a bigger than life character.
Large hair,

1378
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:46,340
big fucking name on the buildings.
Gold,

1379
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,770
gold lettering everywhere.
Gold bathroom,

1380
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:53,300
gold toilet paper like you.
Does he not know that there's such a

1381
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,190
thing is as.
What's the word I'm looking for?

1382
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:56,290
Garish.
Does that garrison?

1383
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,100
Yeah,
I don't think he does know that well.

1384
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:01,900
He's old man with old people.
That was like someone said it best and

1385
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:05,360
it's one of my favorite quotes about
trump that he is what a poor person

1386
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,660
imagines a rich person would be like.
That's a great point.

1387
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:09,470
Yeah.
Yeah,

1388
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,590
and he's a.
he's a dumb person's idea of a smart

1389
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:16,580
person because he's very confident.
Any mosts and like you say,

1390
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,190
gold fucking everything.
It's almost,

1391
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,980
it's almost like a rapper's more
stuntin.

1392
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,180
Oh Yay.
I got my role's bitch.

1393
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,040
You're going to be trump.

1394
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,970
Is that your grill?
Paul was showing all your rings.

1395
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:31,790
You're in front of your Lamborghini.
Bunch of girls shaking their booty in

1396
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:33,980
front of you.
How did grills ever become a thing?

1397
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,050
How did they not become a thing?
Why don't I have one?

1398
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,300
That's the real question.
We were going to get what?

1399
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:40,580
Paul wants better reached out to us.
We to hook us up.

1400
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,950
You could actually maybe make girls
popular.

1401
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,410
I don't think so.
I'm doing a good job with fanny packs

1402
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:46,190
though.
I'm telling you that.

1403
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,330
Oh,
sales are up.

1404
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,030
Sales are up.
I'm pretty sure if fanny packs are back.

1405
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,360
You know what?
I haven't given up on cell phone holder.

1406
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:54,360
I saw that,
yeah,

1407
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,150
I saw those people gave up on that a
long time ago.

1408
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:56,811
No,
make fun of me,

1409
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:57,381
but I'm like,
fuck you.

1410
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,820
It's coming back in style and I'm
rocking it.

1411
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,860
Somebody had a really funny joke.
I forget who it was.

1412
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:03,350
I wish I could give them credit,
but it was something along the lines of,

1413
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,610
that's the type of black guy that's
unthreading to why people type black guy

1414
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:12,380
that wears a cell phone holder or the
outside buckle clip cell phone holders

1415
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,830
just don't have him wear it around a cop
because they might think it's a gun.

1416
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,480
Right?
Don't reach for it.

1417
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,290
Don't reach for anything.
Um,

1418
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,600
yeah.
The um,

1419
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,580
the grill thing,
I dunno.

1420
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,170
Um,
I think a gold tooth be kind of fly like

1421
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,180
one was maybe a fang or golfing kiss.
I think that they think it shows status,

1422
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:36,810
but in reality it shows in attempt to
hit higher status.

1423
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:37,680
You know what I mean?
Well,

1424
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,660
it's like that Jay z song,
99 problems,

1425
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:41,150
but a bitch ain't one.
You know,

1426
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,710
if you grew up with those holes and use
apatow's,

1427
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,650
you'd celebrate the minute you have doe,
right?

1428
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,930
So critics you can kiss my little
asshole.

1429
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,120
So when you don't grow up with much,
then you're like,

1430
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,450
I'm going to fucking get a lot and then
I'm going to show off that I have a lot.

1431
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:55,710
So you know,
I got this shit.

1432
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,850
It's a giant part of the culture.
I mean,

1433
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:02,640
and even in the more reserved people
ignazio like who's like a more lyrical

1434
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,310
artist type character.
Father was a jazz musician.

1435
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,360
He drives a Mercedes and pictures in
front of the nice things.

1436
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:13,890
It's just a part of the whole culture.
You gotta gotTa have Nice Shit.

1437
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,160
You can't be living in a log cabin
spitting out rap music.

1438
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,170
Nobody wants to hear anybody from like
a.

1439
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,680
what's that show?
Life below zero.

1440
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,160
The show where they all in Alaska,
Alaska.

1441
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,940
Nobody wants those people rapping,
but I feel like if somebody does that,

1442
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,870
then that for that person who really is
about the art of what they're doing.

1443
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,930
Yeah.
You know what?

1444
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:37,110
I know it's not going to happen.
No one's going to listen to a fisherman

1445
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:42,111
wrap like a dude who's like salmon
fishing commercial,

1446
01:03:42,431 --> 01:03:45,720
like one of those dudes from a deadliest
catch.

1447
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,160
If one of those guys had like when
they're,

1448
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,960
you can't,
can't be a rapper.

1449
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,540
He smell like fish.
You got to be clean.

1450
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,390
You have to have gold teeth or
something.

1451
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,150
You have to have a grill.
That's a is Paul Wall.

1452
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,830
All he lost a lot of weight.
It looks good.

1453
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,590
That beard fake.
Um,

1454
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,410
I think it's just trimmed.
Why do you think it's fake?

1455
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,260
Because it looks too good.
It looks like I'm not hating because I

1456
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,420
sound like a hater.
I just ferment gel the shit out of my

1457
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,460
hair.
So it looks like he puts her just from

1458
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,800
anjell on that baby.
Um,

1459
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,710
I don't know.
He might've might've darkened up is

1460
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:16,980
Paul.

1461
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,160
I feel your pain man with the.
I've been dying my hair since I was 18.

1462
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:22,360
How pathetic is that?
Your hair started going gray at 18.

1463
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,370
18.
Really?

1464
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:24,750
Yeah.
I don't know and I have no idea if it

1465
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,810
was genetics or if it's stress or
whatever the fuck are you under stress.

1466
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,010
I don't,
I mean no,

1467
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,830
not any more than a guy who has to
fucking go to a coal mine or some shit.

1468
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:34,230
I'm privileged compared to most people.
So.

1469
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:35,100
No,
I don't think so.

1470
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,830
I think,
I think it might just be genetics.

1471
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:39,390
I'm not sure,
but it's working for yourself is a

1472
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:40,590
little difficult though,
right?

1473
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:43,500
Like not having a steady paycheck where
you have to.

1474
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,030
And you were also involved in the
youtube demonetization wave that hit

1475
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:51,570
after that pooty pie.
Cocksucker decided it was a good idea to

1476
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,720
use the n word on a video game streams.

1477
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,930
Well just for the record when I was an
awkward young white boy who used it to,

1478
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,460
but with an a at the end,
not an er,

1479
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,100
there's a big difference to throw
around.

1480
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,180
Just throw it around,
like singing along to lyrics.

1481
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,600
If I sing it along to the lyrics,
I roll my window up first at a respect.

1482
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,530
Right.
And then you do.

1483
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,710
And then I just sort of mouth it like.
Yeah,

1484
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:13,140
I don't really say it out loud.
So in the rap songs,

1485
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:14,580
yeah,
I of course I did.

1486
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,770
Did it in the rap songs,
but also just being an awkward,

1487
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,740
a young white boy from Shell and having
a lot of black friends growing up and we

1488
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:22,060
just throw it around like nobody's
business.

1489
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:23,850
What year were you in newer show?
Uh,

1490
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,640
so I'm born and raised there.
So I was born in 88 and you know,

1491
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:30,940
in probably when I was 20 is when I left
there.

1492
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,920
Dude.
So when I was living in new Rochelle,

1493
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:36,100
you were living in new Rochelle because
I was living there and like 91.

1494
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,300
That's when I lived there.
Okay.

1495
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,730
But now I'm going to make you laugh
because I was just talking to car and on

1496
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:44,590
the way here about this.
So I feel like I have a memory of being

1497
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:48,790
a kid watching fear factor.
You're on it.

1498
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:51,970
And then I was so young that my mom
after it was like,

1499
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,200
okay,
it's bedtime honey.

1500
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,770
Wow.
And I'm like,

1501
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:59,050
I was a little fucking kid watching Joe
Rogan and now I'm doing this podcast.

1502
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:04,170
Well that totally makes sense because
that show was 16 plus years ago.

1503
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,120
Right?
Two thousand one.

1504
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:11,350
I want to say two or one,
maybe two.

1505
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,240
Let me ask you a question about when you
were doing that show,

1506
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,710
did you feel cause you,
you're a really smart guy and you're

1507
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,840
interested in a lot of different things
and you.

1508
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,410
I can tell just by talking to you,
you're somebody who needs to pave your

1509
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:25,390
own path and be your own boss and it's
clear.

1510
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,680
So did you feel like almost like a caged
animal when you were doing fear factor

1511
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,110
because like you had to,
you were forced to show up at a certain

1512
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:35,760
time every day and no,
I felt lucky that I had a job where it

1513
01:06:35,761 --> 01:06:38,040
can make a shitload of money.
Was that your first?

1514
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,160
No,
you had news radio before that I had

1515
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:45,330
news radio which was extremely,
extremely fortunate.

1516
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:50,470
I mean that you couldn't.
I couldn't have stepped in shit any

1517
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:53,800
deeper than with news radio.
It was just total luck.

1518
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:59,190
I literally had like three acting
classes ever because I had to take them

1519
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:05,491
because Disney gave me a development
deal because of a just stand up and they

1520
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,420
just throw money at you and say do
something.

1521
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,630
In the nineties they were doing that
because they had seen what happened with

1522
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:13,300
Rosanne.
They had seen what happened with Tim

1523
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,640
Allen and Seinfeld and like,
that's what you gotta do you gotta find

1524
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,100
someone that you think is funny and
develop show around them,

1525
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,100
and it worked with some people.
Brett Butler out a show.

1526
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:25,450
There was a lot of that going on and so
they were trying to do that and so I had

1527
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:27,300
a development deal and then I had to
show that it was on,

1528
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:31,480
on Fox for a few episodes and it got
canceled and then I got on Newsradio.

1529
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,250
So I'm on news radio.
Six years into my standup career I was

1530
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,560
literally a beginner in terms of
standup,

1531
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:41,350
like have you talked to a standard six
years considered a beginner,

1532
01:07:41,351 --> 01:07:42,184
you said?
Yes.

1533
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,440
That's a beginner.
Yeah.

1534
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:44,530
You don't know what the fuck you're
doing.

1535
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,290
I took a guy on the road with me
recently.

1536
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:50,410
They had been doing comedy for seven
years and he's got 20 minutes material.

1537
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,360
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

1538
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:55,750
It's fucking to go rind son Nez.
Other people like more advanced,

1539
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:59,020
like Tony Hinchcliffe seven years in had
already done a Netflix special.

1540
01:07:59,080 --> 01:07:59,891
Wow.
Yeah,

1541
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:02,860
I mean it really varies.
It varies.

1542
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,530
In comedy,
you feel more is like your baby than any

1543
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:06,670
of the acting stuff,
right?

1544
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,920
Oh yeah.
Well the acting stuff was just an

1545
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:10,870
opportunity to make money and it was
just.

1546
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,660
It was also an opportunity to get people
to come see you do standup,

1547
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,100
but it was weird like to all of a sudden

1548
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,390
be acting with Phil Hartman and Andy
Dick and Stephen Root.

1549
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,070
Maura Tierney is like,
I don't even.

1550
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,420
I shouldn't even be here.
Well,

1551
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:26,160
how the fuck do you think?
I feel sitting across from Joe Rogan if

1552
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,980
we're just talking.
I know,

1553
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:31,610
but it's nice.
I mean that is true.

1554
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,230
It all becomes normal man.
I mean,

1555
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,470
I still get weirded out when I meet
famous people that I really like put

1556
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,401
who?
I mean,

1557
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:38,950
there obviously are people who are,
you know,

1558
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:41,420
like Jack Nicholson for example,
is way more famous than you,

1559
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,910
but like there's not many people.
You're almost,

1560
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,050
are you able,
would you say you're a.

1561
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,010
no,
no,

1562
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,720
no.
I'm like a c list person.

1563
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,450
Yeah.
I don't act.

1564
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:53,270
I'm not on TV.
I'm c list and I'm going to cage

1565
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:55,190
fighting commentator,
you know,

1566
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,620
it's pretty easy to dismiss me.
Yeah,

1567
01:08:57,621 --> 01:08:59,450
I'm more the list.
I just,

1568
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,680
a lot of people your age know wham.

1569
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,040
It's a different worry buddy.
My Age knows who you are.

1570
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,630
It's different,
different world.

1571
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,960
But uh,
so the fear factor thing was I had done

1572
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:15,260
a lot of stuff after news radio that
didn't work.

1573
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,680
Not a lot of stuff,
but a few pilot scripts that I had

1574
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:20,720
gotten,
a few meetings that I had with people

1575
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:22,780
that were kind of goofy.
There was a lot of like,

1576
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,040
and I didn't,
I loved working with my,

1577
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,550
my cat might cast my friends from news
radio.

1578
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:30,980
They were great,
but I had also worked with a bunch of

1579
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:34,760
actors who were actors that said,
it's not an environment,

1580
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:38,090
it's not a job that lends itself to
authenticity.

1581
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,000
It's a job that lends itself to
conformity because you're always

1582
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,280
auditioning for things,
so you want everybody to like you,

1583
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:46,640
so you sort of pattern your likes and
dislikes,

1584
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,680
your behavior patterns,
your,

1585
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:51,470
your,
your opinions to what you lick your

1586
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:52,850
finger and put it in the air.

1587
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,410
Whereas the wind blowing,
I'm going that way.

1588
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,590
That's the safest way to make a living.
And there's a lot of that in Hollywood.

1589
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,750
I was going to say,
that gets back to my point about how

1590
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,970
insular they are,
how everybody in Hollywood like,

1591
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:02,511
yeah,
Oprah,

1592
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:03,920
20,
20 is fucking great means.

1593
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:08,720
Who the fuck is sitting in Kentucky?
Like can we go over?

1594
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,580
We have a great ride.
Yeah.

1595
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,440
Well maybe somebody,
maybe some men struggling with wrestling

1596
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:17,940
with menopause.
Maybe some stops all xanax out.

1597
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,050
Sitting there like drinking wine with
her husband pays the shit he says he

1598
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:26,230
does.
Um,

1599
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,270
so when fear fact came along,
two things,

1600
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:31,070
I thought one was going to be cancelled
immediately.

1601
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,870
I was really convinced and went on
forever,

1602
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:34,880
forever.
One hundred and 48 episodes.

1603
01:10:34,881 --> 01:10:37,120
Then we came back and did seven more.
Um,

1604
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:41,030
but the,
I'm getting attacked by dogs and make

1605
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:42,430
people eat,
eating bold dicks.

1606
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,690
I was like,
this is no way this is going to last.

1607
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,490
It's crazy.
And so I felt,

1608
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,760
I felt like at the very least it would
give me some material and it was,

1609
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:54,140
it was a generous amount of money and it
was money that I was like,

1610
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:56,210
okay,
if I do this and I keep doing this,

1611
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,790
I don't have to do other things like I
can be free.

1612
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,240
And that having that ability to say no
to things and have fuck you money and to

1613
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:07,400
just not worry about how to pay your
bills.

1614
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:11,390
I knew when I lived in new Rochelle is
actually when I got my first development

1615
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:13,100
deal and when I got my first
development,

1616
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,260
there was this,
this physical weight left lip lifted off

1617
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:21,540
of me where I didn't have to worry,
how am I going to pay my rent next

1618
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,160
month?
How am I going to pay my gas,

1619
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:23,850
how am I going to share?

1620
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,390
Because that was a.
I went from that to having some money

1621
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,160
and the feeling that I got,
I was like,

1622
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:29,611
oh,
okay,

1623
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:34,150
this is valuable.
This is some bullshit idea like having

1624
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:36,120
my.
I'm not saying that being rich makes you

1625
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:36,931
happy.
It's not,

1626
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:41,931
but having resources is a valuable thing
and having the resources to not have to

1627
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:45,300
do something you don't want to do and
where you can pursue what you want to

1628
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,890
do,
that's valuable as well.

1629
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:51,270
So it's funny you bring that up because
I covered a study that came out a few

1630
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,270
weeks ago on my show and I'm apparently
researchers found out that when you can,

1631
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:01,440
you hit a certain level of happiness
when you hit $75,000 a year because I

1632
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:06,210
think they figured out that that's where
people can generally pay the bills and

1633
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,890
be okay.
And then they said,

1634
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,350
uh,
if you make up to 95,000,

1635
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:14,940
you do see a noticeable increase in
happiness when you jumped from 75,000 to

1636
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:15,830
95,000.

1637
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,840
So that's when people pretty much across
the board are like,

1638
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:19,674
okay,
I'm good.

1639
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,860
And then everything after that you're
playing with house money.

1640
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,240
So they say,
you know,

1641
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:28,410
the difference between making $95,000 a
year and a million dollars a year,

1642
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:32,220
even though there's a big material
difference there in terms of how much it

1643
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:35,640
buys your happiness it,
there's a tapering effect when you hit

1644
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:39,150
that $95,000 threshold.
I think also the amount of work that you

1645
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:43,320
have to do to make a million dollars a
year significantly stresses you out.

1646
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,960
You don't have time to do things that
you love,

1647
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,120
like say if you,
you know,

1648
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:48,960
you have some hobbies that you really
enjoy.

1649
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:51,540
You feel like I got to leave those alone
for awhile.

1650
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,230
I got to pursue my career and go after
my career and really make it happen.

1651
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah,
it's hard to balance that life.

1652
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:03,291
Comfort in appreciation for your just
your existence here and trying to make a

1653
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:09,020
living and sometimes people get that way
wrong and they go all in on making a

1654
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:14,030
living and then you become some fucking
Harvey Weinstein Guy who's just all

1655
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:19,590
about just vices and just filling your
life up with things that try to make you

1656
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:23,490
happy because you've got $500,000,000 in
the bank and you're constantly working

1657
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,170
and you just set a good example.

1658
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:28,470
Harvey Weinstein is a good example
because he's shit fucking people in gas

1659
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:30,060
and whatnot.
Electric.

1660
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,280
Um,
the,

1661
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,810
the,
the better example would be someone who,

1662
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,750
uh,
works.

1663
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:37,350
So they have a heart attack and then
realizes they never had any fun.

1664
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:40,280
And now their health has deteriorated so
radically that they,

1665
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:43,950
they can't have fun and then they can't
work and they can't even do what they

1666
01:13:43,951 --> 01:13:45,240
do.
And then they have to sort of reboot

1667
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,210
their life.
I mean,

1668
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:50,520
I just think it's very important to
enjoy your time here.

1669
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,160
It's fucking fleeting.
Like Kevin Smith.

1670
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,810
Just A.
I saw that.

1671
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1672
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:57,810
I love that guy.
He's a great guy.

1673
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:00,210
Because you've been on the podcast a
couple times.

1674
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,460
I've been on his.
He's been on this one a couple times.

1675
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,590
He's awesome.
He's just a sweet,

1676
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:08,520
genuine sweetheart of a guy.
He's one of those guys where if he

1677
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,440
doesn't like someone,
I don't like them.

1678
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,980
So like you trust him

1679
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,440
that much.
His judgment.

1680
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:15,550
Sure.
If Kevin Smith doesn't lie,

1681
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,640
he's a really nice guy.
Like if he doesn't like you,

1682
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:22,030
you must be a shit.
It just doesn't make any sense.

1683
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:26,350
And you know this.
But my point is that this is fleeting.

1684
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,550
It doesn't,
you know,

1685
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,280
I'm 50 years old.
I became 50 years old.

1686
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,350
I don't know how that happened.
It just keeps happening.

1687
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:32,861
Well,
it's funny,

1688
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:35,770
I just turned 30.
I just turned 30 on January 31st.

1689
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,480
It was the first birthday where I ever
went,

1690
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,460
Ooh.
Yeah,

1691
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,920
I remember 30 shit just got a little
real.

1692
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,250
I remember 30 because I was dating a
girl was kind of a Twat.

1693
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,390
She was just kind of living and not her
fault.

1694
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:47,640
She's a little negative.
She was like,

1695
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,600
I already thought you already worth 30.
I'm like,

1696
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:53,200
what the fuck does that mean?
I was telling you something's weird and

1697
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:53,650
you're not even.

1698
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,360
You're not even thinking about my
perspective.

1699
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,800
I thought you already worth 30.
What is that what you're saying?

1700
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,480
I looked through what bitch?
What are you saying?

1701
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:05,980
That's a weird thing to date for like a
surface thing,

1702
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:06,341
like,
oh,

1703
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:09,220
I think the person is older.
I think the person is worth a lot of

1704
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:11,190
money or I think that's what it was.
The shoes.

1705
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,660
A deeply unhappy person that was trying
to diminish me.

1706
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,470
Well,
it happened.

1707
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,420
Not a healthy relationship now.
It wasn't a healthy relationship period,

1708
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:22,630
but there's a lot of.
Lot of that happens in relationships,

1709
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:24,610
right?
People try to diminish each other or

1710
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:27,520
they feel like they're in a bad position
of power,

1711
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,160
like they feel like they don't have the
power in the relationship,

1712
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:34,000
so then they see that there's possibly a
vulnerability and instead of like

1713
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,300
soothing that person,
they attack that vulnerability.

1714
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,490
That's how you know you're in a terrible
toxic.

1715
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:41,740
Their power struggles share.
Oh yeah man.

1716
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,310
That's the worst.
It becomes a weird Machiavellian fucking

1717
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:46,300
game.
Yeah.

1718
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:46,991
And it's like,
well,

1719
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:48,700
the whole idea of a relationship is
supposed to be.

1720
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,610
That's where you go to get away from the
bullshit of everything.

1721
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,160
So when that becomes part of the
bullshit,

1722
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,480
it's like,
what the fuck are we doing here?

1723
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,640
What are we doing?
He will probably get addicted to that

1724
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,100
cycle there for a fucking for sure did
man it.

1725
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,350
But it's hard to tell people while it's
happening.

1726
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:03,910
It's hard to tell people,
hey man,

1727
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,370
you're in a bad relationship.
Like this is not good.

1728
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:10,590
Like especially like rich guys with hot
girls that like,

1729
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,190
don't worry,
it doesn't make any sense.

1730
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,840
And the was like miserable and you're
like,

1731
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:16,330
hey man,
do you see what's happening?

1732
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,290
This is not your money,
it's not gonna work,

1733
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,090
man.
It's fucking sucks,

1734
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,920
right?
For that rich guy was kind of a dork.

1735
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:24,371
He's like,
well,

1736
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:29,371
what the fuck did let you know what else
sucks when the antelope has a limp that

1737
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:32,170
sucks,
and the lions running Adam and they're

1738
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:36,160
in a God damn thing they could do.
The universe does not care about

1739
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:41,161
whatever this imbalances,
but you as a thinking cognitive species

1740
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,130
like you as a conscious aware
individual,

1741
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,060
you got to pay attention to that.
Like she's going to get your money or

1742
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:51,760
she's going to leave,
but either something's happening,

1743
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,650
something's happening.
So,

1744
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,360
uh,
going back to the point you made about

1745
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,180
the rat race of life and people who get,
like obsessed with work and stuff like

1746
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,970
that.
Here's an interesting fact that nobody

1747
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:02,620
talks about it.
I don't know why people don't think it's

1748
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:04,660
a bigger deal,
but did you know that the United States

1749
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,860
is the only developed country that
doesn't have paid time off by law?

1750
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,290
Every other modern countries.
You go to Europe for example,

1751
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:17,291
they asked why we win bro Jesus.
So we have people who were on pills and

1752
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:22,511
shit talking to me about losers,
Gordon Gekko loser countries,

1753
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:27,050
and you say,
why aren't we like these losers,

1754
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,680
those assholes with healthcare and
fucking vacation?

1755
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:31,730
I definitely think people should get
paid time off.

1756
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,170
And I definitely think,
I mean I've,

1757
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:37,190
I've had some pretty intense arguments
with wealthy people about a living wage

1758
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,690
and I'm like,
you're out of your fucking mind if you

1759
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:42,560
think someone should be working for less
than $15 for an hour of their time.

1760
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,430
So I'm telling you,
a guy's going to go in your backyard,

1761
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,230
he's going to dig a fucking hole for an
hour.

1762
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,170
You want to give him $5?
How much do you want to give them?

1763
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,240
You want to give him $7?
Well Joe,

1764
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:57,200
that's a market and they need to be able
to make contracts free of government

1765
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:57,860
intervention.

1766
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,490
Then I don't care for 12 years old,
12 year old,

1767
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:04,400
a 12 year old digs for an hour,
give them 20 bucks.

1768
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:08,230
This is crazy.
I mean the number is crazy and people

1769
01:18:08,231 --> 01:18:10,340
will.
The businesses won't be able to survive.

1770
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:11,990
And that's just not true.
It's not true.

1771
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:15,170
The person who is making the most money
at the top of the business won't make as

1772
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:16,490
much money as they.
Exactly.

1773
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,260
In fact,
whenever people bring that point up,

1774
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,180
oh,
we can't raise the minimum wage because

1775
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:23,000
of reasons and stuff and things.
I always bring up Australia.

1776
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,480
I'd like to point out that I made.
I know Jack Shit about economics.

1777
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,490
Okay.
I know a little bit more than Jack Shit.

1778
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,510
But if you look up the minimum wage in
Australia,

1779
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:34,630
Jamie,
I think it's like $17 in change.

1780
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,070
They pay you in boomerangs over there,
bro.

1781
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,170
Kangaroos,
they give you a bucket of poisonous

1782
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:41,840
snakes.

1783
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,080
Hey,
good luck.

1784
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,490
So I think it's like $17 and change and
it's not.

1785
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,650
They didn't look at that.
And are they,

1786
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:52,580
are they a hellscape?
Joe Is Australia all bullshit aside?

1787
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:56,030
I think Australia is fucking amazing.
So spare me with the bullshit arguments.

1788
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,580
I can't afford to pay people a living
wage.

1789
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,250
Read this.
The fair work commission has handed down

1790
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:03,260
its annual ruling on Australia's minimum
wage,

1791
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:08,410
raising it by two point four percent to
$672 and seventy cents a week.

1792
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,310
That's excellent.
So means that extra 15 point a $15,

1793
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:18,050
eighty cents per week for the one point
$8 million workers who are paid the

1794
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:22,490
minimum wage will apply from July first
and equates to a minimum hourly rate of

1795
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,790
$17 and seventy cents.
And that's in 2016.

1796
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,420
May Thirtieth of 2016.
That's an excellent 7:25 here.

1797
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:33,470
Did you know that the raising the
minimum wage here today is actually

1798
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:38,471
worth less than the minimum wage was
worth in 1968 because if you account for

1799
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:41,360
inflation,
the minimum wage from 1968 would be

1800
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:42,950
about $10 in change today.

1801
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,000
So people who are in the minimum wage
today make less than they made in 1968.

1802
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,130
I believe it.
What do you think that is?

1803
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,790
Do you think that's people just taking
advantage of poor people?

1804
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:56,750
Is it they are they?
Do they really believe this is a

1805
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,470
stepping stone position?
That no one who's making minimum wage

1806
01:19:59,471 --> 01:20:03,170
should ever consider this something
they're going to do forever.

1807
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,860
So I don't think that it's bad people.
I don't think it's bad individuals who

1808
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:11,610
are trying to take advantage of people.
I think the problem is the system and

1809
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:16,260
the only reason why we don't have a
system like Australia does with their

1810
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:19,230
minimum wage is because corporations
have bought the government.

1811
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,710
So if you look at the polls,
80 percent of people want to raise the

1812
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:25,410
minimum wage,
but we don't get that and we don't get

1813
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:28,050
that because there's a tremendous amount
of money being poured into our

1814
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:30,420
government from the likes of
corporations that don't want to raise

1815
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:31,200
the minimum wage.

1816
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,270
So that's the only constituent group
that has all the power and they happened

1817
01:20:35,271 --> 01:20:38,820
to be the only constituent group against
having a living wage.

1818
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,340
So I think that's the general dynamic
behind it.

1819
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,760
I do think that there are some small
businesses where they're like,

1820
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:47,460
listen,
I genuinely don't have the money to do

1821
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:48,480
this.
You know what I mean?

1822
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:49,890
So,
uh,

1823
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,480
for those cases,
yes,

1824
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:53,580
we can have a,
a separate conversation about those

1825
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:55,350
instances.
But if you're a fucking giant

1826
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:58,140
corporation,
don't bullshit us and tell us you can't

1827
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:01,290
afford to pay somebody a living wage
because in the case of like Walmart for

1828
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:04,230
example,
they don't pay their people living wage

1829
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,960
and then they dump all of their workers
onto the,

1830
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,960
onto the medicaid rolls and onto the
social safety net.

1831
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,530
So tax payers end up paying billions of
dollars to support them.

1832
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,530
Meanwhile,
the people who are part of Walmart or

1833
01:21:16,531 --> 01:21:18,120
running out the back door with all the
fucking money.

1834
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,740
Yeah,
that's real.

1835
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,460
I mean that's kind of undeniable.
And the idea that a CEO should be able

1836
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:26,490
to earn that much more money than
anybody else.

1837
01:21:26,491 --> 01:21:30,900
It's kind of fucking crazy to like the
whole ceo position is very bizarre.

1838
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,010
The fact that these guys get payouts
when their companies go under and Wall

1839
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:36,570
Street bailouts.
Oh God.

1840
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:39,900
I mean stop and think about that for a
second because I don't think that people

1841
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:44,901
really got how ridiculous that was.
So if you own a fucking Deli or you own

1842
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:48,360
a dry cleaners and you go under,
you know what they say?

1843
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:49,980
Tough Shit.
Take Care Buddy.

1844
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:50,814
Yeah,
exactly.

1845
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:55,170
But if you're a part of a big bank or
you're part of a fucking hedge fund that

1846
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:58,950
made the decisions that ended up
crashing the fucking economy,

1847
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,270
not only do you not get fired,
they say in order to retain the talent

1848
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:05,610
of these people,
we're going to have to pay them bonuses

1849
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,880
with the taxpayer money that just bailed
out the corporation that they

1850
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:09,714
bankrupted.

1851
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:12,540
That was hilarious.
So it wasn't just that these people got

1852
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:15,030
bailed out,
which was also very arguable.

1853
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,240
Are good position to argue against that.
Right?

1854
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,010
Like,
I don't know what would've happened if

1855
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,650
we let the banks fail.
I know how catastrophic that would have

1856
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:25,020
been to our economy,
but it's arguable whether it was a

1857
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:27,930
debatable point.
It's not a debatable point to give those

1858
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:31,840
fucking people millions of dollars of
taxpayers money has gone to the bailout

1859
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,290
so that they can get that bonus.
It's in their contract.

1860
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,640
Correct.
And Obama was like,

1861
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:37,560
well,
it's in their contracts will fuck their

1862
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:40,110
contracts.
The contracts had no good now because

1863
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:43,380
the whole company went under.
Your bank's fucked up.

1864
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,650
You guys were running the banks.
You don't get that 50 million bucks you

1865
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:48,540
were promised,
and here's what they don't do.

1866
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:50,700
They never come out and say,
okay,

1867
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:54,120
well we're going to do is a bailout of
the people who are hurt by this.

1868
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,080
They always go,
well,

1869
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:57,750
what we have to do is we have to give it
to the companies that just made the

1870
01:22:57,751 --> 01:23:00,360
decisions that fucked everything up in
the first place and sit down and shut up

1871
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,820
and those guys are already rich.
That's what's even crazier.

1872
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:06,580
You're giving rich people tons of money
after they fucked up and did a shitty

1873
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:11,440
job and this goes back to why trump
seemed appealing to so many people is

1874
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:13,270
because you have,
you know,

1875
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:16,700
somebody who seems like a measured guy
and a smart guy and he said he was going

1876
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:19,360
to change the game,
but then he also fucking bailed out Wall

1877
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,490
Street and people look at that and they
go,

1878
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:22,420
okay,
you know what?

1879
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:24,340
Fucking anything but this.
Okay,

1880
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:26,290
Forget Hillary Clinton.
Forget the status quo.

1881
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,730
I'll take the guy who's going to break
shit.

1882
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,100
Yeah,
I definitely think there was something

1883
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:30,730
like that.

1884
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:33,400
There was also that he didn't seem like
one of them.

1885
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:37,360
He seemed like something different,
like let's try something different.

1886
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,390
This is a new thing.
The old thing is not working.

1887
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,650
This whole person who talks like this,
who gives these speeches in front of

1888
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,800
large groups of people,
I'm going to promise you change and hope

1889
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:52,120
and dignity and burn and vague words
that mean flowery things.

1890
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:55,270
Noises to here.
So this gentleman,

1891
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:58,620
what's his name again?
The the guy with the short name Rocana.

1892
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,513
Rocana.
Yeah.

1893
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,870
Row was the full name.
What's his full name?

1894
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,860
No idea.
I just know rig back something crazy.

1895
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,070
I mean,
how does he speak?

1896
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,530
Speak like a politician.
He's talking like a normal dude.

1897
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,210
He talks like a normal dude.
Can we listen?

1898
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,920
Very honest guy.
I want to smell them out.

1899
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,190
If you want to find a clip on youtube or
something like that.

1900
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,300
Clip.
Let's break it down.

1901
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:23,590
But I'm willing to fucking put my chips
in this guy's corner.

1902
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,540
Well,
it's not going to run in 20 slash 20,

1903
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:26,374
but he's.
He's,

1904
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:27,490
Oh,
don't be a pussy.

1905
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,680
He's on the radar.
He's got a Tan suit.

1906
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:30,940
It's over.
You can't do it.

1907
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,560
Don't you remember the Tan Suit Obama
thing?

1908
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,423
I do.
Yeah.

1909
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:39,100
To cover this event.
This is a very respectful gathering and

1910
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:46,820
the purpose is very simple as I haven't
had the opportunity to campaign for over

1911
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:55,950
a year and a half across this district.
The best part I think this

1912
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,813
meeting,

1913
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:02,220
check him out.
He's going after his opponent when he

1914
01:25:02,221 --> 01:25:03,950
was running.
If you really want to to your warning

1915
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,190
here,
talking about Medicare,

1916
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,560
going to get this guy on adderall.
Listen,

1917
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:11,170
you've got to get them on those pills at
trump's on them,

1918
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,930
on those fucking energy pills.
We really have like a lot,

1919
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:15,570
a lot of vigor,
a lot of.

1920
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:19,430
A lot of pep in your step.
You think trump's on pills 100 percent.

1921
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:23,390
You think he's on adderall?
I think he's on something like that on

1922
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:26,550
it.
Do really well.

1923
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:31,551
Apparently there is a reporter that
literally named the pharmacy.

1924
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:36,900
Where do the Duane Reed pharmacy where
trump had his prescription.

1925
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:40,380
Oh Shit.
Where he used to be on one form of

1926
01:25:40,381 --> 01:25:42,900
amphetamine.
That was a diet pill supposed to be on

1927
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:44,370
for six months.
He was on for years.

1928
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,580
It completely makes sense.
You talked about the amount of time that

1929
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:50,310
guy spent on the campaign.
70 some odd year old guy out there

1930
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,690
giving speeches and leslie and entergy's
incredible.

1931
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,970
Yeah,
and let me tell you something.

1932
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,690
Everybody that I know that did adderall,
like I had a good.

1933
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,500
I have a good friend it before.
Yeah,

1934
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:00,120
I haven't,
but I have a good friend who was on it

1935
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,760
for a long time and he got off at.
He gained 50.

1936
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,220
He feels like it's hard

1937
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,590
for him like he but he,
he said doctors,

1938
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:10,190
we're just handing them this stuff and
that stuff and that one doctor gave him

1939
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:13,870
three different amphetamines and told
him find the one that you liked the

1940
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,560
best.
That's a heart attack waiting to happen

1941
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:18,020
if you take them all at once,
jacked up on these things all the time.

1942
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:21,320
And last time I saw him was like four
years ago when he was jacked up on them

1943
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:21,951
and I'm like,
dude,

1944
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:23,570
what's going on?
And he's like,

1945
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:25,250
ah man,
these fucking on adderall.

1946
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:27,680
And I go,
you kinda like out of it.

1947
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:28,241
He's like,
yeah,

1948
01:26:28,241 --> 01:26:29,330
I just,
you know,

1949
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:31,850
so he's now he's back to normal,
but he's like,

1950
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:36,320
I eat anything and I gained weight.
Now the whole system's all screwed up.

1951
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:41,350
What is it about some people who can't
have a little bit of something and

1952
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:45,440
experienced the upsides of it without
getting totally hooked by it because

1953
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:47,600
that's something I feel like that's
something that I can do.

1954
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,950
Like I could try something and then I
can experience the upsides of it and

1955
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:53,420
not,
you know what I mean?

1956
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,700
So productivity thing.
So for example,

1957
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:56,730
I brought,
I brought you,

1958
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:01,040
you said you already have a budget,
but Kratom I wanted to try a Kratom

1959
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,570
Kratom something that I have and I
always feel like it,

1960
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:09,480
it's like almost like caffeine to me.
I feel like it allows me to control,

1961
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,250
control my consciousness better.
So if I want to make a decision to do

1962
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,680
something,
I feel like if I have Kratom in me,

1963
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:19,060
I can focus on it more.
I could be more creative and it's just

1964
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,600
upsides of it,
you know what I mean?

1965
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,580
Is that how you feel when you smoke
weed?

1966
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,540
Yeah.
Well,

1967
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:27,440
what we eat is like a,
a bunch of different things is one of

1968
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,400
the things that I like about weed that a
lot of people are terrified.

1969
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:36,440
One of the things that people don't like
about weed is the intense introspective.

1970
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,690
I get paranoid or yeah,
that's what it is.

1971
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:41,000
But that I think is where you get
growth.

1972
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,201
Really.
Yeah,

1973
01:27:42,201 --> 01:27:43,850
man.
I think that that fear.

1974
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:46,370
So do I have like demons in my past that
when I,

1975
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,060
when I smoke it,
unlike looking at that and I went away,

1976
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:54,020
I don't want to psychoanalyze,
but I feel like what from my own

1977
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:56,600
personal view,
if I feel bad about something,

1978
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:59,960
if I smoked pot and then all sudden I
remember something I did like two years

1979
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:00,471
ago,
I'm like,

1980
01:28:00,471 --> 01:28:01,480
why did I do that?
Like,

1981
01:28:01,481 --> 01:28:02,630
what was it?
What the fuck was that about?

1982
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,930
I think that's an opportunity for
psychic growth.

1983
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:10,250
It gives me an opportunity to examine my
own thoughts and try to figure out what.

1984
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:14,510
What I mean like who you are at any
given time is a bunch of different

1985
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:15,200
factors,
right?

1986
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,550
It's what's going on in your career,
what's going on in your personal life,

1987
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,830
where's your health at,
how stressed out,

1988
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:25,610
how many of these factors are outside of
your control with where's your what,

1989
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:29,600
what's what's the state of your success
in life and all these various things and

1990
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:33,350
then all those things together and
that's who you are at any given time and

1991
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:34,370
it fluctuates.
It moves,

1992
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:36,890
it goes back and forth,
and if you catch yourself at a good time

1993
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:39,140
and you smoke pot,
you feel great and if you catch yourself

1994
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,780
at a point where maybe you're examining
these things,

1995
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:44,660
like sometimes you'll think about these
various factors and you get very

1996
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:48,740
uncomfortable and some in when you were
in a state just an hour ago where you

1997
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:52,130
were super comfortable about your life.
Now all of a sudden you're don't feel

1998
01:28:52,131 --> 01:28:53,210
good.
Like what is that?

1999
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:55,100
Well,
it's probably there's some sort of

2000
01:28:55,101 --> 01:29:00,101
subconscious thoughts and ideas you've
ignored and I think the ignoring those

2001
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:02,400
things is probably

2002
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:07,550
unhealthy and even though that feeling
of paranoia or whatever you want want to

2003
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,740
call it,
I call it ruthless introspective

2004
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:11,574
thinking.
Right?

2005
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,850
That feeling is probably,
it's healthy because it's,

2006
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,990
it's making you examine things that
you're probably pushing to the dark

2007
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:24,390
regions of your consciousness.
You don't make them make you

2008
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:29,130
uncomfortable so you push them aside and
I think they're better off explored and

2009
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:32,580
dealt with.
So I feel I've always felt like

2010
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:38,060
substances that either up my mood and
make me feel like I want to be very

2011
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:42,330
proactive and creative and busy and
talkative,

2012
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,060
fine with taking something like that,
fine with taking the opposite.

2013
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:49,500
Something that relaxes me and makes me
feel just at ease and calm.

2014
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:53,330
But I've always.
So with my limited experience with weed,

2015
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,520
because I've only smoked,
we honestly maybe eight to 12 times in

2016
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:57,690
my life,
some right now.

2017
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,060
No.
I will fucking shit myself and realize

2018
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:05,070
that there's millions of people watching
us right now and I'll realize that that

2019
01:30:06,451 --> 01:30:08,640
happens sometimes too.
But anyway,

2020
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:12,690
so I've always had an issue with
psychoactive substances were so I've

2021
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:14,640
never tried.
And all the ones that did drugs,

2022
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:16,860
you talk on a regular basis like
psilocybin and stuff like that.

2023
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,160
Um,
I'm,

2024
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:20,670
I've always been scared of them.
Um,

2025
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:25,790
and I always feel like the drugs that
will make me see things that aren't,

2026
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:31,490
they're hallucinogenics I'm just scared
of them because I feel like I,

2027
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,830
I'll take that trip and not come back,
you know what I mean?

2028
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,280
I know that I'm just wanting to bringing
it up to you because I know you disagree

2029
01:30:38,281 --> 01:30:41,250
with that and I'm curious what you think
about why I'm scared of those because

2030
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:44,790
with my experience with weed,
most of the times I smoked it,

2031
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,670
it really was like a paranoid type.

2032
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,110
You probably,
first of all,

2033
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:52,050
we probably smoked too much.
I always did.

2034
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:54,630
I'm sure I did.
I was advised people when the first time

2035
01:30:54,631 --> 01:30:56,520
they smoke pot just take one little hit
this,

2036
01:30:56,521 --> 01:30:59,250
a little hit and just experience the
good parts,

2037
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:02,070
which is like a good,
weird kind of funny feeling.

2038
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:05,580
And then there's also,
I feel like it's a turbo charger for

2039
01:31:05,581 --> 01:31:08,130
your imagination.
It's one of my favorite things that

2040
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:08,840
happened,
but I,

2041
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,640
my,
I feel like I already have a hyperactive

2042
01:31:11,641 --> 01:31:14,010
mind.
And then when I met the path,

2043
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:17,430
my mind will go down when I smoke weed,
you know,

2044
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,260
suddenly I'm thinking about,
I don't know,

2045
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:23,410
fucking naked vikings and that's.
But like,

2046
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:23,941
it's like,
well,

2047
01:31:23,941 --> 01:31:25,620
how the fuck am I thinking about all
this shit?

2048
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,890
But it's like a shock to the system.
And did you um,

2049
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,470
the first few times I smoked weed I
didn't get high.

2050
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,660
Did that happen with you or no?
No,

2051
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,920
no,
you gotta tie immediately.

2052
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,800
Got Really High.
So I have a pretty funny story about

2053
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:38,640
that.
I,

2054
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,920
the first few times I smoked it,
I thought I was cool.

2055
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:42,090
I was in high school.
I'm like,

2056
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:43,860
yeah,
I'm going to be cool kid and smoke weed.

2057
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,880
So I smoked it and didn't have any
effect.

2058
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:51,420
And then by the third or fourth time
somebody had asked me before I had

2059
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:52,480
class,
uh,

2060
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,760
you want to smoke weed?
I was like,

2061
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:54,421
yeah,
fuck it.

2062
01:31:54,421 --> 01:31:55,700
Let's do it.
It didn't affect me the other a few

2063
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,750
times.
Why not went and smoked it.

2064
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:02,230
I opened the to come back in school and
I start walking down the hallway.

2065
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:03,970
Doom,
doom,

2066
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:04,943
doom,
doom,

2067
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,410
doom.
Guy was like,

2068
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:11,490
bumbumbumbum feels weird and then I'm
sitting in class,

2069
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:16,210
convinced my eyes are probably bloodshot
red in my mind.

2070
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,390
Everybody in the room knows I'm high and
they're like thinking like,

2071
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,770
hey,
this asshole's hi,

2072
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,520
I'm scared to death of the teacher.
So anyway.

2073
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:26,980
But there was,
there was a few times where I smoked

2074
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:29,560
weed and I had a positive experience,
but it was like all it was was just

2075
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:32,560
giggling nonstop with my friends to the
point where we'd laugh,

2076
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:33,310
laugh,
laugh,

2077
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:36,130
and then I remember one of us literally
asking,

2078
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:37,930
Hey,
why the fuck are we laughing?

2079
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,280
And somebody said,
I don't know.

2080
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:41,590
And then we kept laughing.
Well that's,

2081
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,420
listen,
it's a good thing to laugh.

2082
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,850
I don't think it's a bad thing,
but one of the reasons why you don't

2083
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:48,580
remember what you were laughing and
there's a real issue with short term

2084
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:50,490
memory in marijuana.
You know,

2085
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:54,640
it's one of the reasons why I prefer
marijuana with nootropics.

2086
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,440
I like the combination of the two.

2087
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,340
I think they balanced each other out
because the nootropics accentuate your

2088
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,070
memory.
And then on top of that,

2089
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,540
the marijuana sort of flux with your
memory a little bit.

2090
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:05,920
If there's a,
there's,

2091
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:07,120
there's real issues.
I mean,

2092
01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:10,510
marijuana is not,
it's not 100 percent innocuous in terms

2093
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,100
of your like psychics,
stability.

2094
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:15,790
Well you said when you took off the
month you had your dreams.

2095
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:19,060
There were way different.
They were very,

2096
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:22,540
very intense.
Like within the first week it started

2097
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,480
getting really crazy,
like intense,

2098
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,800
like weird lucid dreams.
Like just very,

2099
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:37,270
very bizarre and detailed and bright and
vivid.

2100
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:42,870
And so you think that it's one of those
things where that's not good.

2101
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:47,980
So are you trying to avoid smoke weed a
little less so that you don't have the

2102
01:33:47,981 --> 01:33:49,570
effects on sleep?
Or do you like.

2103
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,640
I don't think it's bad for your sleep
and red.

2104
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,840
Is that what it.
God,

2105
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:57,400
I wish I could remember.
Let's see if uh,

2106
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,980
see if he could pull that up.
Like what?

2107
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:04,040
What are the marijuana?
And there's some positive benefits to

2108
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:08,300
it.
It just bypasses that rem sleep,

2109
01:34:08,301 --> 01:34:11,590
deep rem sleep quicker.
And you get to the deeper stages of

2110
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:14,760
sleep because rem sleep a lot of people
think is like the deepest levels.

2111
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,790
It's not,
you know,

2112
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,630
there's a deeper level of sleep and the
idea is that marijuana somehow or

2113
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:21,700
another gets you to that deeper level
quicker.

2114
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:25,630
There's a lot of people that I know that
smoke pot before they go to bed and it's

2115
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,250
very helpful.
Yeah,

2116
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:29,230
very helpful.
That's one of the interesting things

2117
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:32,530
about Kratom and why I think it's kind
of similar to weed and how people use

2118
01:34:32,531 --> 01:34:33,700
it.
Even though the feeling is different

2119
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:37,990
when they take it,
is that many people take it because they

2120
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:42,190
were addicted to opioids and it,
it helps them get off the pills and on

2121
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:44,260
Kratom if you have too much of it,
you just throw it up.

2122
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:46,930
If you have too many opioids,
you can die from an overdose.

2123
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,450
And this is one of the reasons why the
FDA is cracking down on it because

2124
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:51,850
they're fucking bought by big Pharma and
they don't want anything that's going to

2125
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:53,350
compete with their fucking profits.
Yeah.

2126
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:56,020
There's no reason to ban that.
There's no deaths.

2127
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:58,100
There's no addictive.
It's not.

2128
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,720
It's not something that's fucking people
up.

2129
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,670
It's just not so.
People take it for a cause.

2130
01:35:02,671 --> 01:35:05,370
They had an addiction to pills.
People take it for PTSD,

2131
01:35:05,371 --> 01:35:08,970
they take it for depression and anxiety.
They take for recreational reasons,

2132
01:35:08,971 --> 01:35:10,860
they take it to wake up in a smaller
dose.

2133
01:35:10,861 --> 01:35:13,590
They take it to sleep in a bigger dose.
It's a substance like that.

2134
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,560
That's a weird substance in terms of
like,

2135
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,630
I don't know any other substance where
you took a low dose and it's a stimulant

2136
01:35:18,631 --> 01:35:22,110
you until you always take a lower dose
of opioids.

2137
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:24,210
It's more of an upper.
You take a bigger dose of opioids is

2138
01:35:24,211 --> 01:35:26,280
more of a downer.
What's the rationalization for

2139
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:29,160
categorizing it as an opioid?
Because it affects the same receptors in

2140
01:35:29,161 --> 01:35:32,100
the brain,
but it doesn't have the same response.

2141
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,720
That will.
That's why that's a very.

2142
01:35:33,721 --> 01:35:37,380
It's a very misleading thing that the
FDA did is because what they're trying

2143
01:35:37,381 --> 01:35:39,170
to do is find a backdoor way to be like
that.

2144
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,890
Sorry,
you guys can't have it because it's an

2145
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:42,720
opioid and it's dangerous and it's this
and this that,

2146
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,850
but they're glossing over the most
important point,

2147
01:35:44,851 --> 01:35:46,500
which is the one that we were talking
about,

2148
01:35:46,501 --> 01:35:48,960
which is if you take too much Graham,
you just throw up.

2149
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,390
If that's not the case with opiates,
just white people overdose all the

2150
01:35:51,391 --> 01:35:55,620
fucking time and actually the bigger
problem is that when people get addicted

2151
01:35:55,621 --> 01:35:58,110
to opioids and then because of the
crackdown,

2152
01:35:58,111 --> 01:36:01,340
now they're.
They're not prescribing as many opioids.

2153
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,350
Then those same people go to the black
market and they get fucking heroin and

2154
01:36:04,351 --> 01:36:06,180
then when they get a heroin on the black
market,

2155
01:36:06,181 --> 01:36:09,570
oftentimes it's laced with fentanyl,
which is a fucking elephant

2156
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,220
tranquilizer,
which then kills them.

2157
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:15,270
So it's killed Tom Petty and princess
here and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

2158
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:17,550
They were speculating that defendant was
in his heroin,

2159
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:19,950
which is why he died.
That was heroin.

2160
01:36:19,951 --> 01:36:20,784
Heroin,
right.

2161
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:21,990
He didn't have pills.
Oh no,

2162
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:22,351
it wasn't.
Yeah,

2163
01:36:22,351 --> 01:36:23,640
it wasn't pills.
He was doing heroin,

2164
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:27,520
but the stuff that they found,
princess system,

2165
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,980
he apparently didn't even have a
prescription for fentanyl.

2166
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,550
Oh,
so you're saying somehow somehow or

2167
01:36:32,551 --> 01:36:33,720
another he got it.
I don't know.

2168
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:37,270
I mean probably want something stronger.
He apparently had fucked his hips up.

2169
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:42,610
Prince Prince had done all that crazy
dancing on stage and all those years,

2170
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:43,803
you know,
um,

2171
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:47,770
my friend maynard from tool,
he had to get a hip replacement from

2172
01:36:47,771 --> 01:36:51,040
stomping on stage.
You ever see like how maynard sayings

2173
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:54,430
when he would sing,
he would just be fucking stomping on

2174
01:36:54,431 --> 01:36:55,720
stage.
He blew his hip out.

2175
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,270
That's crazy.
Now he's got an artificial hip.

2176
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,610
They cut the top of it.
How old is he?

2177
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,310
Fifty 51.
Shit.

2178
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:05,050
Human body.
So fucking fragile.

2179
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:06,670
It is super fragile

2180
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,730
and I'm going to have to be.
Everybody's going to be like,

2181
01:37:08,731 --> 01:37:10,770
shut the fuck up kyle.
You can't stop talking about Tiger Woods

2182
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:12,060
because I love golf and I love Tiger
Woods.

2183
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,780
Tiger Woods is a great example of that
guy had fucking for baxter surgeries.

2184
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,630
Yeah,
for back surgery.

2185
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:19,060
Dude.
I know a lot of people that have had

2186
01:37:19,061 --> 01:37:22,190
back surgery.
My good friend Eddie Bravo has an

2187
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,430
artificial disc in his back.
Shit.

2188
01:37:24,431 --> 01:37:26,380
And he does.
He still do Jujitsu.

2189
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:28,840
And and stuff,
he doesn't right now because he blew his

2190
01:37:28,841 --> 01:37:31,570
acl out.
He to have acl reconstructive surgery.

2191
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,590
I mean,
look,

2192
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,030
Jujitsu is rough on the body.
I've had two knee reconstructions,

2193
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:41,220
one from taekwondo,
one from one from a Jujitsu.

2194
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,900
But then I had a third operation from
Jujitsu as well.

2195
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:48,901
So two knee surgeries from Jujitsu.
And I had some significant back problems

2196
01:37:49,091 --> 01:37:50,600
too.
Everybody gets them just,

2197
01:37:50,601 --> 01:37:51,850
there's no way around that.
If you're,

2198
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:55,060
if you're training hard,
your body can only take so much.

2199
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,990
And you were talking about the stem
cells that you saw,

2200
01:37:57,991 --> 01:37:59,880
the podcast with Mel Gibson,
with the stem cells.

2201
01:37:59,881 --> 01:38:02,400
How is it fascinating?
I haven't gone the Panama yet to do

2202
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:02,970
that.

2203
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,410
Um,
I've only done them in America,

2204
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:07,290
which apparently you can't get the same
sort of potency,

2205
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:10,530
but there's some new research that shows
that there's some,

2206
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,150
uh,
there's some other stuff they're working

2207
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:15,240
on now that is a,
this sounds gross,

2208
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:18,350
but umbilical blood,
they're,

2209
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:21,480
they're using blood from,
um,

2210
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,630
from umbilicals of people that are,
you know,

2211
01:38:24,631 --> 01:38:29,160
like just giving birth and they're
having radical healing response with

2212
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:30,150
this stuff.
Well,

2213
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:32,550
there was a study that came out a few
years ago that said when you took the

2214
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:34,270
blood of young mice,
Brian,

2215
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:37,020
and put them into all my different
context.

2216
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:38,760
Yeah.
That is a.

2217
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:42,060
that's something that erroneously was
attributed to Peter Teal.

2218
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:44,220
The Peter Teal was doing that.
Apparently he said he wasn't,

2219
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:48,000
but there's a startup in silicon valley
that does that.

2220
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:52,770
It offers and guys are going there and
so like a guy would go there and some 25

2221
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:56,130
year old kid who does crossfit everyday
would give up a couple of pints of blood

2222
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:59,250
and they'd shoot it into your system and
then you go out there and fuck the shit

2223
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:00,084
out of your wife.

2224
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:01,770
It can't be that simple.
Right?

2225
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:05,190
Like that's almost too simple a concept.
They just take the blood for the young

2226
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:06,810
people,
put it into the old people and

2227
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,940
everybody's a fucking Olympic athlete
maybe.

2228
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:09,691
Yes.
And maybe.

2229
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:11,190
No,
I'm like a vampire too,

2230
01:39:11,191 --> 01:39:12,420
right?
Isn't that like the whole theory?

2231
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:15,300
Little bit.
Elizabeth bathory thing,

2232
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:17,190
right?
You remember the story of Elizabeth

2233
01:39:17,191 --> 01:39:18,150
bathory?
No,

2234
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,820
she was.
It's interesting.

2235
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:25,821
Somebody contacted me on twitter and
told me that this story might be a

2236
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:29,290
distortion,
even though it's in the,

2237
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:33,750
it's sort of in the historical record.
They might've actually been trying to

2238
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:36,210
steal her land so they might have
fabricated some of these charges.

2239
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:37,710
But one of the,
um,

2240
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:42,240
the ancient stories of Elizabeth battery
was that she was this incredibly evil

2241
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:47,241
woman that as she got older she would
torture and kill young peasant women and

2242
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:53,190
like bathe in their blood because she
wanted to regain her youth and she was

2243
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:54,560
jealous of these.

2244
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:55,141
Yeah.
Yeah.

2245
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:56,970
Yeah.
I don't know if it's real though.

2246
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:00,390
This person who said that it was a hoax,
it was a made me go,

2247
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:01,830
oh,
okay.

2248
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:03,570
I could see that happening to,
you know,

2249
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:08,010
where someone wanted to steal from her.
So they concocted some charges or it

2250
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:09,660
could be either or.
It could be both.

2251
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:10,650
You know,
who the fuck knows?

2252
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:12,060
Well,
with the stem cell thing,

2253
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:17,061
I feel like it should be here already if
the evidence is as solid as he was.

2254
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,740
The doctor was saying yes and no.
Um,

2255
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:23,370
the evidence is very solid that there's
some regenerative properties of stem

2256
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:26,490
cells.
The problem is we don't have enough

2257
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:31,550
evidence of what the potential downsides
could be and whether or not there's a

2258
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,740
very specific protocol that ensures
safety.

2259
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:38,670
Now Dr Neil Riordan is on top of all
that stuff and his books,

2260
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:40,380
we used to have them sitting around
here,

2261
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:41,910
but I think we put them in our little
library.

2262
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:43,680
Um,
his books,

2263
01:40:43,681 --> 01:40:48,600
detail all of the various studies that
have shown efficacy and all the

2264
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:51,900
different benefits that they have.
And for a lot of people like Mel

2265
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,920
Gibson's dad who was two when he went in
there,

2266
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,640
now he's almost a hundred and Mel
Gibson's dad was fucked.

2267
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,550
I mean he couldn't walk.
He was all jacked up and it straightened

2268
01:41:00,551 --> 01:41:03,460
them right out.
So not to get all conspiratorial,

2269
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:05,740
but it may be,
may be,

2270
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:08,590
I have no idea,
but maybe the reason why it has not

2271
01:41:08,591 --> 01:41:13,591
already here is because there's some
preexisting treatment for stuff like

2272
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:17,760
that that they don't want to scrap.
Know what I mean?

2273
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:19,510
I mean,
it's always possible.

2274
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:24,160
I think more likely they're skeptical.
And then the FDA also wanted to

2275
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:29,140
categorize some stem cell preparations
as a drug because you have to do

2276
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:31,450
something to the stem cells.
And then the,

2277
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:33,880
in,
in the process of cultivating them,

2278
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:35,320
there's some sort of a,
um,

2279
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:40,450
a method that they do that they believe
categorizes it as a drug.

2280
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:44,060
I'm obviously a moron,
so I'm not the right person telling you

2281
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,923
about this.

2282
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:50,080
But Dr Neil Riordan is lobbying to get
it passed in Texas.

2283
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,030
God Damn Great State of Texas.
Hallelujah.

2284
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,960
If anybody can do it,
Texas can do.

2285
01:41:53,961 --> 01:41:54,960
If they don't go,
yeah,

2286
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:56,740
they don't care.
They don't give a fuck.

2287
01:41:56,741 --> 01:42:00,340
It's barely America.
That's Texas is it's own thing.

2288
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:02,920
I would love it if they did that,
if they did it where you could go to

2289
01:42:02,921 --> 01:42:05,470
Texas and get these treatments.
Everybody that I know that it's gone

2290
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:08,710
over there and gotten the treatments has
had some radical positive response.

2291
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,300
Well,
didn't know quite a few people that have

2292
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:11,260
gone there.
There are,

2293
01:42:11,261 --> 01:42:16,090
I know countless stories of people.
So I know somebody who got the lasik eye

2294
01:42:16,091 --> 01:42:21,091
surgery and they flew to the UK to get
their version of it because their

2295
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:27,250
version of it is on his is better,
is superior and we have the older one

2296
01:42:27,251 --> 01:42:30,280
here and they're still waiting on the
approval for the new way of doing it.

2297
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,140
Well why would they hold back approval
on that?

2298
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:33,580
So it doesn't make any sense.
I don't know.

2299
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:36,460
And this is what I'm saying.
I feel like in many instances,

2300
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:39,010
not in every instance,
but in many instances you have to

2301
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:42,880
preexisting treatments that are already
in place and there and pharmaceutical

2302
01:42:42,881 --> 01:42:45,970
companies make a lot of money from
having those treatments already in

2303
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:48,340
place.
So if you try to upend the apple cart

2304
01:42:48,341 --> 01:42:49,740
overturn the apple cart,
I mean that's.

2305
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,400
This gets back to the whole kratom
point.

2306
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,520
There's a reason why.
If this is something that's basically a

2307
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:58,900
cure for addiction to opioids,
why the fuck are we not pushing it like

2308
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:01,510
crazy?
And the reason is they don't want to

2309
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:03,040
start making money off the fucking
opioids.

2310
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,740
That is,
I think that is a much more likely

2311
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:09,790
conspiracy because there's just an
ungodly amount of money and opioid.

2312
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:11,640
Yeah,
so look at the pill mills and fucking

2313
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,990
West Virginia.
Millions of pills in a town that doesn't

2314
01:43:13,991 --> 01:43:17,350
have that many people.
Did you ever see the documentary,

2315
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:19,600
the Oxycontin Express?
I did not know.

2316
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,740
Oh,
actually I may.

2317
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,600
May Have the one where they go to
Broward County.

2318
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,550
Yeah.
I think I saw that they've changed the

2319
01:43:24,551 --> 01:43:27,400
law since then because people were going
to.

2320
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:31,060
I mean it was one of the most ridiculous
things they've ever had in this country.

2321
01:43:31,061 --> 01:43:33,640
They had a setup where they had these
pain management centers,

2322
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,680
so is one box,
right?

2323
01:43:35,681 --> 01:43:38,410
One building and in this building
there's two different doors.

2324
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:40,450
One door is the doctor.
You go to the doctor,

2325
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,430
go,
hey man,

2326
01:43:41,431 --> 01:43:43,330
I'm fucking back hurts.
And the doctor says,

2327
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:44,560
okay,
I'll write you a prescription.

2328
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:47,880
Go next door to the pharmacy.
The pharmacy only has oxicon.

2329
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:51,530
Yeah.
It's like if you only have a hammer,

2330
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:55,460
everything looks like a nail and hammer
here.

2331
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:57,540
How am I going to chop this tree down?
Well guess what?

2332
01:43:57,541 --> 01:44:02,360
I'm going to use a hammer.
I mean it's fucking crazy that this was

2333
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:06,530
going on for so long and then they also.
This is where it got really weird.

2334
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,900
It wasn't just the of these pain
management centers,

2335
01:44:08,901 --> 01:44:13,901
they also didn't have a state database,
so if you went to Jamie over there and

2336
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:18,860
got a prescription for Oxycontin and
then you left Dr Jamie's office with fat

2337
01:44:18,861 --> 01:44:21,410
bag of pills.
You could go to Dr Joe's office and I'll

2338
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:24,350
give you another prescription.
These pain management centers were all

2339
01:44:24,351 --> 01:44:27,170
over the place in Florida,
so Florida was literally.

2340
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:32,360
Because I mean there's no other way that
I could imagine that this would be done

2341
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:34,880
conscientiously.
I think this is all corruption.

2342
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:38,450
I think the only reason why they would
have no database.

2343
01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:40,770
It's not.
We're not in the 15 hundreds measure.

2344
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,870
You guys could keep records of WHO's
fucking on this shit and who's not.

2345
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,861
There's a way.
I mean,

2346
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:47,870
they had records back before the
Internet.

2347
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,240
This.
There's no excuse for this.

2348
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:54,080
This is I think,
intentional corruption and what's crazy

2349
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:57,410
is now the pendulum is swinging almost
too far in the other direction.

2350
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,890
Ohio Attorney General Suing opiod use
distributors.

2351
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:05,330
Now this is a good example of what I
think is the pendulum swinging too far

2352
01:45:05,331 --> 01:45:09,050
in the other direction because I have
pain patients who contact me all the

2353
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:13,910
time and they talk about how since
there's new federal regulations over the

2354
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:15,950
pills,
what's happening is many doctors are

2355
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:18,980
afraid to prescribe them at all,
even when it's a legitimate pain issue

2356
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:22,850
and so people contact me and they go,
I don't know what to do because I need

2357
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:26,510
my pills because I have severe pain
problem and I've had it for an extended

2358
01:45:26,511 --> 01:45:29,150
period of time and nobody wants to give
me the pills anymore and they feel like

2359
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:30,490
they're forced to go on the black market
now.

2360
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:31,680
Right.
And,

2361
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:34,550
and now that they're eliminating Kratom
it's even more fucked up.

2362
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:37,460
Exactly.
So what is the status of Kratom

2363
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:38,600
currently?
Still legal.

2364
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,860
Still legal.
Still legal,

2365
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:42,290
but it's a monitored substance by the
FDA.

2366
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,720
What does that mean?
It basically means if they want to,

2367
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:47,620
they see fucking shipments of it when it
comes into the US,

2368
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:50,420
if they want,
if they want to get that shipment back.

2369
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:52,160
No,
you can't get it back off,

2370
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:53,820
back off.
We're going to take your beneficial

2371
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:55,040
plants,
but it's still.

2372
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:59,630
Thankfully it's still it still leeway.
The last time the FDA really tried to

2373
01:45:59,631 --> 01:46:01,430
crack down on it and make it a schedule.
One drug,

2374
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:05,480
the fucking bowels of hell opened up on
their face because they opened up a

2375
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:09,770
comment section,
a comments period and like 99 point nine

2376
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:12,590
percent of the comments were like,
fuck you to saved my life.

2377
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:14,960
You guys are fucking criminals.
How dare you do this?

2378
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:18,260
And then they had to back off because
the comments were just so overwhelming.

2379
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:21,770
So now they're trying to sneakily do it
again.

2380
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:24,110
And what's happening is they just a
referenced,

2381
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:26,360
Oh,
there were 44 cases of somebody who

2382
01:46:26,361 --> 01:46:30,020
overdosed from Kratom multistate
outbreak of Salmonella.

2383
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:32,240
Right.
So this is related to creative.

2384
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:35,330
Exactly.
So there were a few cases of Salmonella

2385
01:46:35,331 --> 01:46:37,970
tainted Kratom and so the idea is
another way they try to go up,

2386
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:39,430
like we gotta get,
we gotta get rid of it because there is

2387
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:42,770
some salmonella cases at this time.
The CDC recommends that people not

2388
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,340
consumed Kratom in any form because it
could be contaminated with Salmonella.

2389
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,920
We instead suggest fentanyl,
which kills rhinos.

2390
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:56,870
We could kill fucking whale with a with
a altoids size piece of fentanyl.

2391
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,770
They literally kill a whale.
I know that will be fucked.

2392
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:03,890
An altoid show.
They said Doris,

2393
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,930
they said there were 44 deaths linked to
Kratom.

2394
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:09,180
Twenty eight cases.
Few people got diarrhea,

2395
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,700
but we'll have in hospice.
That's it.

2396
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:13,770
Eleven,
11 hospitalizations.

2397
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,320
The story,
he gets crazier because there were 44

2398
01:47:16,321 --> 01:47:18,750
cases that the they cited and said,
well look man,

2399
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:20,730
44 cases of people dying when they took
Kratom.

2400
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:23,160
Guess what?
No reporters decided,

2401
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,320
let's look into this.
Let's dig deeper and see what happened.

2402
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,740
First of all,
one of the cases was a suicide that they

2403
01:47:28,741 --> 01:47:30,570
counted as a death.
They're attributing to Kratom.

2404
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,730
That's hilarious.
Another was a homicide.

2405
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,140
That's hilarious.
And then so now we're going on 42.

2406
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:39,390
There were,
and then most of them people had like

2407
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:43,410
five or six different drugs in their
system and they're saying not dad's

2408
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,283
Kratom.
So,

2409
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:47,010
well that's one of the things that they
did with marijuana and car accidents.

2410
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,091
They were saying,
oh,

2411
01:47:48,091 --> 01:47:50,370
all these different car accidents.
People have marijuana in the system.

2412
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:51,480
Yeah.
Well they were also a drunk.

2413
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,261
Exactly.
Yeah.

2414
01:47:52,261 --> 01:47:53,190
People were partying,
man,

2415
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,070
that they're out of their fucking head
and they crashed into trees.

2416
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:58,860
So it's not good.
How do you feel now that California has

2417
01:47:58,861 --> 01:48:01,350
legalized it?
Is it because you had the medical one

2418
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:05,070
before and now is it more of a pain in
the ass to get weed?

2419
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,590
Because it's legalized.
It's very easy to get weed and

2420
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:09,420
California.
It's very easy.

2421
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:12,540
It's not as easy as in Colorado.
Colorado's got a down.

2422
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:16,050
Colorado's got it nailed and they are
swimming,

2423
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:19,410
swimming in money coming to the point
where they have to give people money.

2424
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:20,580
That's right.
That's right.

2425
01:48:20,581 --> 01:48:23,160
They gave a check to everybody in the
state and they take.

2426
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:26,880
I love how they take a lot of the money
and they divert some of it to education,

2427
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,190
some of it to,
to substance treatment.

2428
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,160
So they're doing the most responsible
thing for it and like you said,

2429
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,220
they the tax on it.
Everybody's like,

2430
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:36,240
okay,
yeah,

2431
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,413
yeah.
Okay.

2432
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,453
What?
I mean it's.

2433
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:42,090
It's a high tax rate.
I think they have a 39 percent tax rate

2434
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,720
on a recreational and I think it's like
an 11 on medicinal,

2435
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:48,510
but here's the thing.
It's not exorbitantly expensive.

2436
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:51,330
It's a plant that grows easy.
It's not hard to grow.

2437
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:56,360
It's not like some very difficult grape
that needs a perfect climate and it's

2438
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:59,520
not.
Marijuana is not hard to grow,

2439
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:04,590
so there's not a lot of arguments
against it for responsible adults.

2440
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:07,170
Yeah,
and that's the thing is are we going to

2441
01:49:07,171 --> 01:49:10,740
regulate responsible adult use of
substances?

2442
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:13,170
Because if we do,
we'd be hypocritical if we didn't

2443
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:14,850
eliminate alcohol.
Exactly right.

2444
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:16,140
One of the worst ones,
if you look,

2445
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:19,200
if you look at it objectively,
you would have to say,

2446
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,470
listen,
this substance which is legal and has

2447
01:49:22,471 --> 01:49:26,100
been legal for a very long time,
is actually more dangerous than many of

2448
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:29,790
these ones that are illegal,
and we learned from alcohol prohibition.

2449
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:34,050
How terrible and idea is to just ban the
substance because what happened during

2450
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:36,960
prohibition,
the Mafia got incredibly powerful

2451
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:39,240
because they're the ones selling the
alcohol.

2452
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,210
They're the ones making the money,
and then when you have a dispute and

2453
01:49:42,211 --> 01:49:45,180
your product is on the black market,
you know how you solve that dispute with

2454
01:49:45,181 --> 01:49:47,040
fucking guns in the street.
You know,

2455
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,010
you solve the dispute.

2456
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,620
If it's illegal,
you go to court wearing suits and ties

2457
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,600
and you figure it out like adults.
Well,

2458
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:57,601
this is another thing that trump should
have recognized when he was sessions is

2459
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:00,340
a perfect example that God is a God damn
monster.

2460
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,790
He's an easy.
He's an old school mentality of like,

2461
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:07,600
I was raised my niche wrong.
If you put substances in your body where

2462
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,000
he literally said good people don't use
marijuana.

2463
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:11,380
Well that's crazy,
bro.

2464
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,060
Yeah,
you can stick a moral judgment on you

2465
01:50:13,061 --> 01:50:15,190
for that.
I think there's something like 37

2466
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:18,130
percent of the country is a regular
marijuana user.

2467
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:20,500
So you're saying 37 percent of the
country's bad people.

2468
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,620
Yeah,
exactly.

2469
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,050
And this is another example,
by the way,

2470
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:27,550
have 60 percent of people now want to
legalize marijuana across the country.

2471
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:31,210
So this is another issue where if the
Democrats decided,

2472
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:35,020
let's not be fucking corrupt idiots and
let's actually fight for something,

2473
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:38,800
do you have any idea how big of a ballou
tsunami there would be in the next

2474
01:50:38,801 --> 01:50:39,460
election?

2475
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:42,200
If every Democrat came out there and
said one of the things were far

2476
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:44,230
legalizing marijuana,
we're going to fight for it and we're

2477
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,740
not going to take no for an answer and
we're gonna make a lot of money that can

2478
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,980
go to the schools.
They can go to the infrastructure as

2479
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:53,980
code and the job creation.
These are arguments that also appeal to

2480
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,780
the right.
If you tell people on the right,

2481
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,400
hey,
you guys say you love small government,

2482
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,700
you know what's really big government
when they knocked down your fucking door

2483
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:03,310
and drag you out in handcuffs because
you decided to tweak your consciousness

2484
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:03,940
slightly.
Yeah,

2485
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,290
that's the biggest government
imaginable.

2486
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:07,270
They kick your door down,
shoot your dog because you've got to

2487
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:09,580
fucking bowl sitting on your coffee
table.

2488
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:12,940
There's so many examples of that too.
If,

2489
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
if trump really wanted to stop all this
illegal Mexican cartel legalize,

2490
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,940
legalize and tax it,
regulate it,

2491
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:25,050
done thousands of jobs to create.

2492
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:27,580
Exactly.
There's no reason for them to be here.

2493
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,690
Yeah,
and that.

2494
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:29,740
See,
this is one of the things that's so

2495
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:33,400
frustrating to me doing what I do and
one of the reasons why I think it shows

2496
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:38,401
like ours have blown up is because we're
willing to say the most obvious things

2497
01:51:38,561 --> 01:51:42,040
that everybody's thinking,
but the system is dragging like fucking

2498
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:44,650
50 years behind what we're talking
about,

2499
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:47,560
but you could never do the show that you
do or this kind of show.

2500
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:50,070
If you had like real serious
advertisers,

2501
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:52,930
entrepreneurs,
percent serious network and producers

2502
01:51:52,931 --> 01:51:55,480
and executives have.
You had a bunch of executives that were

2503
01:51:55,481 --> 01:51:58,930
above you and you know,
fill in the blank CNBC or whatever and

2504
01:51:58,931 --> 01:52:02,350
their job depended upon you.
Not saying something fucked up that was

2505
01:52:02,351 --> 01:52:06,880
going to get the advertisers to crack
down on their program and you wouldn't

2506
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:07,570
be able to do it.

2507
01:52:07,570 --> 01:52:09,250
You wouldn't have freedom.
In fact,

2508
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:14,730
a Janky Uber was on MSNBC.
The reason he ended up leaving MSNBC,

2509
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:19,690
he was too hard on the Democrats,
so his higher ups were like,

2510
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:22,480
hey listen man,
I just heard from our friends in

2511
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:25,900
Washington that you need to reel it in a
little bit,

2512
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:27,610
turn,
and he's like,

2513
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:28,361
wait,
I don't understand.

2514
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:31,720
So the whole idea of MSNBC is be
partisan,

2515
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,960
be in favor of the Democrats and support
the democratic establishment.

2516
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:39,160
The whole idea of Fox News is be
partisan support the Republican support

2517
01:52:39,161 --> 01:52:41,590
the establishment.
If somebody comes along and they go,

2518
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:44,350
you know what?
Your whole fucking game is bullshit.

2519
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:45,920
Both the are corrupt.

2520
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,560
Nobody's fighting for the people.
You're ignoring.

2521
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:52,610
The fact that only 14 percent of the
American people even support Congress.

2522
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:55,820
You're ignoring the fact that 60 percent
of people want to legalize marijuana.

2523
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:59,720
If you go and talk about real issues,
that's when they step up and they go,

2524
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:01,700
listen,
we can't have you because you know,

2525
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:03,230
hey,
you curse too much or this isn't

2526
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:08,060
palatable and it's always people above
you who feel like they should be able to

2527
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:10,610
control your content,
but they don't understand the reason why

2528
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:13,340
the content is popular in the first
place is because you're not fucking

2529
01:53:13,341 --> 01:53:14,600
being controlled.
Exactly.

2530
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:18,020
Exactly.
They they're operating in this archaic

2531
01:53:18,021 --> 01:53:20,810
format to.
The other problem is they interrupt

2532
01:53:20,811 --> 01:53:24,530
their show every 15 minutes for our
shows and it's just they break the flow

2533
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:28,100
of it and then they got fucking
commercials for antidepressants and

2534
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:33,130
diarrhea pills and whatever the fuck
else are selling and it's just nobody

2535
01:53:33,321 --> 01:53:34,100
wants that.

2536
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:37,340
This is a.
it's an archaic version of entertainment

2537
01:53:37,341 --> 01:53:41,390
and it made sense back when.
That was the only way to get your

2538
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:44,270
entertainment when the only way to get
your entertained was the big three.

2539
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:45,380
NBC,
ABC,

2540
01:53:45,381 --> 01:53:47,450
CBS,
and Fox comes along with tosses the

2541
01:53:47,451 --> 01:53:49,820
apple up and then you got cable.
Oh my goodness.

2542
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:51,000
Now things are crazy.
Well,

2543
01:53:51,001 --> 01:53:54,740
the cable news is really opened it up
and now you got wild shit like Fox News

2544
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:56,930
and all this and Meghan Kelly doesn't
have any clothes on.

2545
01:53:56,931 --> 01:54:01,931
She's telling you about fucking history.
All that stuff was really an interesting

2546
01:54:02,091 --> 01:54:03,830
thing.
Then the Internet comes along,

2547
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:07,910
all bets are off 100 percent and they're
fuck because a guy like you mean who?

2548
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,800
Who's.
Who's involved in your operation?

2549
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:12,530
How many people?
Three,

2550
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:13,570
four.
Sylaria.

2551
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:14,181
Yeah.
Hi,

2552
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,130
Bill with Lilith.
Those a lot of stuff.

2553
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:18,640
She's awesome and yeah,
I mean that's,

2554
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,850
that's,
that's nuts.

2555
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:23,360
I mean how many fucking people would be
involved in the Ryan seacrest show?

2556
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:24,830
Forget it.
And hundreds.

2557
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,350
Right?
And the fact that when you keep

2558
01:54:27,351 --> 01:54:28,184
something,
Ryan seacrest.

2559
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,750
Yeah,
he's so irrelevant.

2560
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:31,730
And will you keep something small and
close to the chest?

2561
01:54:31,731 --> 01:54:33,740
I feel like that's when you can mold it
and make it your own.

2562
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:37,250
When it becomes a giant big operation at
43 hands are in it,

2563
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:42,560
well then all of a sudden it feels like
it's stale and detached and not

2564
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:44,660
connected to anything real that people
can relate to.

2565
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:46,550
Now I've been involved in that kind of
stuff before.

2566
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:49,250
I know what happens.
Just there's too many cooks in the

2567
01:54:49,251 --> 01:54:51,390
kitchen.
Everything gets fucked up and everybody

2568
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:53,000
is also trying to justify their
position,

2569
01:54:53,001 --> 01:54:55,850
which is almost unnecessary.
I mean there's so many positions when

2570
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:58,340
you.
When you work on a television set and

2571
01:54:58,341 --> 01:55:00,920
you see how many people are just
standing around and you go,

2572
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,120
oh,
what the fuck is,

2573
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,890
why are there so many jobs?

2574
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,800
Like why there's so many people working
on.

2575
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:08,300
A lot of it is like they've kind of
created these jobs,

2576
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:10,880
justify their position and then when
there's meetings,

2577
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,740
those people all have like an idea that
they want change.

2578
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:20,000
They want to change this or tweak that,
and so they can say that was my idea and

2579
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:21,180
that justifies the real.
Well,

2580
01:55:21,181 --> 01:55:24,140
it was my idea to tell kyle that he's
got to stop doing this and start doing

2581
01:55:24,141 --> 01:55:27,110
that and we got kyle to wear a suit and
he pushed back,

2582
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,460
but I was right.
I was right.

2583
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,040
You know,
like there's all that kind of shit that

2584
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:34,990
happens on these Goddamn TV sets and it
ruins the,

2585
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:39,770
the individual idea,
like a person's individual point of

2586
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:42,730
view.
Like if there's no way you're going to

2587
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:47,700
get a real unique individual point of
view if you have so many people tweaking

2588
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:52,020
and adjusting and restricting and,
and demanding that a person behave a

2589
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:56,280
certain way or dress a certain way or
stay to a certain topic or you know,

2590
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:57,690
keep on,
you know,

2591
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,740
you have to keep within these very
clearly defined parameters.

2592
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:06,420
Where was it a worst for you?
Which show was it the man show when you

2593
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:08,080
did the man show?
I was asked.

2594
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,450
Yeah,
that was a disaster for a bunch of

2595
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:11,280
reasons,
but one of the reasons why that was a

2596
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:15,330
disaster was because Janet Jackson and
Justin timberlake decided to pull

2597
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,900
Janet's booby out on TV.
Oh,

2598
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,170
and so they cracked down,
so it'd be policing.

2599
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:22,920
They were terrified of everything,
but that's also,

2600
01:56:22,921 --> 01:56:25,830
you have a bunch of people again,
that aren't comedians.

2601
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:30,720
They don't know what's funny and they're
trying to impose their idea of what's

2602
01:56:30,721 --> 01:56:33,540
funny and what's not.
You have a lot of that on television

2603
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:35,070
now,
you have a lot of these people that

2604
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:39,360
aren't necessarily comedians,
but they might be like super progressive

2605
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:42,930
social justice warrior types and now
they're trying to push that kind of

2606
01:56:42,931 --> 01:56:46,260
comedy is being what everybody likes and
then that shit gets to,

2607
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:47,880
you know,
Jamie's hometown,

2608
01:56:47,881 --> 01:56:48,780
Columbus,
Ohio,

2609
01:56:48,781 --> 01:56:50,160
and these people are like,
what the fuck?

2610
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:51,120
Exactly.
Eating me.

2611
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,800
And then meanwhile,
like we were talking about for the

2612
01:56:52,801 --> 01:56:55,560
podcast,
a guy like joey diaz comes around and

2613
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:56,430
everybody's like,
that's it.

2614
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,300
That's what we want you to know this guy
on in the world.

2615
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:04,800
He's a perfect example too because for
the longest time I was trying to tell

2616
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:07,650
people for the longest time,
like I had agents,

2617
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:10,080
former agents of mine that would tell
me,

2618
01:57:10,081 --> 01:57:13,650
you've got to stop working with them.
That's literally the dumbest Shit I've

2619
01:57:13,651 --> 01:57:16,170
ever heard in my life is not fun and
it's so easy to see.

2620
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:21,171
He's like a diamond in the rough in how
unique he is and how just

2621
01:57:22,141 --> 01:57:23,880
straightforward he is.
Yeah,

2622
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:26,160
he's a genius.
He's a comedy genius.

2623
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:29,190
I think he's the funny in terms of like
bursts of,

2624
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:31,830
I might not be the very best joke writer
of all time,

2625
01:57:31,831 --> 01:57:34,920
but in terms of being the funniest,
I think he's the funniest person that's

2626
01:57:34,921 --> 01:57:35,430
ever lived.

2627
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:38,430
I've seen everybody.
I've seen almost everybody either live

2628
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:40,590
or on video.
I don't think anybody's ever been

2629
01:57:40,591 --> 01:57:44,430
funnier than Joey.
I've seen joey some nights at the Ice

2630
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:46,110
House or some nights at the comedy
store.

2631
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:51,000
Hit levels of ridiculousness.
I don't think I've seen anybody and his

2632
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,250
whole thing.
He's a God damn human cartoon.

2633
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:56,290
Says Voice is cartoon.
Listen,

2634
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:01,340
dog says way moves and forever.
They were telling me that that guy is

2635
01:58:03,391 --> 01:58:04,770
not funny.
This is not good.

2636
01:58:04,771 --> 01:58:07,920
This guy can't work and he wasn't
getting work other than like character

2637
01:58:07,921 --> 01:58:10,920
work in movies,
but then the internet came along and

2638
01:58:10,921 --> 01:58:15,570
then people got to know him on podcasts
and that's what really made Joey and you

2639
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:17,730
knew that.
Everybody who is telling you that was

2640
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:22,140
working backwards from their conclusion
that they had this idea in their mind of

2641
01:58:22,141 --> 01:58:24,270
what somebody who's popular is supposed
to be.

2642
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:26,640
Yeah.
He didn't fit that mold because he's too

2643
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:29,340
rough around the edges and he curses too
much and he talks about eating ass and

2644
01:58:29,341 --> 01:58:30,930
all that shit,
and then you knew.

2645
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:33,900
No,
I know innately I look at this guy and

2646
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:36,990
he,
he touches something in me so I know

2647
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:39,120
this is going to connect with other
people while I'm also.

2648
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:44,150
I'm out there in the clubs and I'm
watching joey go onstage and crush them,

2649
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:45,520
telling me he's not funny.
I'm like,

2650
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:46,450
you're out of your mind.
Yeah,

2651
01:58:46,451 --> 01:58:47,710
you're just wrong.
I've seen it.

2652
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:49,960
Not only that,
I'm a fan of comedy.

2653
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:52,150
I'm not just.
I'm not just a fan of things that are

2654
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,530
gross.
I'm a fan.

2655
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:57,280
In fact,
if someone's gross and it's not well

2656
01:58:57,281 --> 01:58:59,080
done,
it's appalling to me.

2657
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:00,910
I didn't want to.
Yeah,

2658
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:03,880
I know when people are just being gross
for the sake of trying to get a

2659
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:05,500
reaction.
It's annoying.

2660
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:08,830
It's like it's bad on your brain.
Especially when you hear it more than

2661
01:59:08,831 --> 01:59:09,601
once.
It's like it's.

2662
01:59:09,601 --> 01:59:10,270
It's,
it's,

2663
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:12,700
it's grading.
Joe Not doing that.

2664
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:15,730
He just,
he's being himself and I was watching

2665
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:19,210
him kill over and over and over again
and having these people telling me that

2666
01:59:19,211 --> 01:59:22,330
it's not good.
And then podcast came along,

2667
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:22,991
you know,
seven,

2668
01:59:22,991 --> 01:59:27,430
eight years ago and got to know him and
then now when we have them on,

2669
01:59:27,431 --> 01:59:31,120
it's like always one of our shows and
admitted always

2670
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,083
so,
uh,

2671
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:34,010
out.
And I was telling you before the podcast

2672
01:59:34,011 --> 01:59:35,930
too,
and I'll tell joe if he's watching.

2673
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,130
Joey,
don't,

2674
01:59:37,131 --> 01:59:38,270
you don't need guests on your podcast.

2675
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:41,600
I really like it when it's just joey and
Lee and they just talk.

2676
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:43,850
I liked that too,
but I like Joey with guests too.

2677
01:59:43,851 --> 01:59:46,980
I just like Joey,
I'm going to direct and produce Joey

2678
01:59:46,981 --> 01:59:48,500
standup special.
Oh that's great.

2679
01:59:48,501 --> 01:59:53,060
We couldn't get anybody to do it.
It's just like they still don't get it.

2680
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:56,840
Like there's a lot of people that still
don't get it and I'm hoping they get it

2681
01:59:56,841 --> 01:59:59,000
when we put something together,
but we're going to film something that

2682
01:59:59,001 --> 02:00:01,880
the Ice House and I'm gonna put it all
together.

2683
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:04,250
Yeah.
And I'm going to direct it and produce

2684
02:00:04,251 --> 02:00:07,250
it and the whole thing.
And just have someone edit it and just

2685
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:10,940
put it together and just make the
ultimate Joey Diaz comedy specials so

2686
02:00:10,941 --> 02:00:14,090
people could know and um,
we're going to do a shit load of shows

2687
02:00:14,091 --> 02:00:15,440
too,
because that's the other thing,

2688
02:00:15,441 --> 02:00:18,680
like when a comic has to do one show
ready here,

2689
02:00:18,681 --> 02:00:21,050
kyle,
this is your one moment to be funny and

2690
02:00:21,051 --> 02:00:24,330
it's going to be seeing forever.
It's like you smoking pot and realizing

2691
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:27,170
millions of people.
Exactly that,

2692
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:29,800
that's a,
that's sort of what it's like for a

2693
02:00:29,801 --> 02:00:32,780
comic to do a special.
So you do one,

2694
02:00:32,781 --> 02:00:35,390
you get it into can you feel loose?
Then you get that second one and you're

2695
02:00:35,391 --> 02:00:35,631
like,
oh,

2696
02:00:35,631 --> 02:00:37,220
we got it.
And then the third one you're like,

2697
02:00:37,221 --> 02:00:38,960
now we really got it needed a fourth
one.

2698
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:42,050
The fourth one is generally like a real
comedy show.

2699
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:44,180
Like where there's no,
no concern,

2700
02:00:44,181 --> 02:00:45,380
no worries,
no issues.

2701
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:46,150
Well,

2702
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:50,500
the evolution of stuff is interesting
because it's almost impossible to start

2703
02:00:50,501 --> 02:00:53,980
something and just get it like you.
It requires a lot of time,

2704
02:00:53,981 --> 02:00:55,690
a lot of effort,
a lot of cultivation,

2705
02:00:55,691 --> 02:00:57,880
a lot of attention.
And you know,

2706
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,860
it's,
it's that book,

2707
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:01,900
I forget who wrote it,
but the idea of you have to do something

2708
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:04,850
for 10,000 hours or whatever the fuck it
is that gladwell no.

2709
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,970
So they might be,
that might be a Malcolm Gladwell,

2710
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,570
but that's true.
And you know what I,

2711
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:13,270
what I say is even if,
let's say you don't get there with

2712
02:01:13,271 --> 02:01:15,970
whatever you're trying to do,
you're definitely gonna be better after

2713
02:01:15,971 --> 02:01:18,700
those 10,000 hours.
And also you might learn a lot about

2714
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:22,420
yourself and a lot about what you're
capable of and a lot about dedication

2715
02:01:22,421 --> 02:01:24,340
and discipline.
If you just stick with something.

2716
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:26,200
And I've always said,
you know,

2717
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:30,910
people like to shit on one dimensional
people and act like,

2718
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:31,511
ah,
you know,

2719
02:01:31,511 --> 02:01:33,460
you're not supposed to do I suppose to
be well rounded and this and that.

2720
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:35,200
But you know,
again,

2721
02:01:35,201 --> 02:01:37,270
to bring up tiger woods,
how the fuck do you think he got good at

2722
02:01:37,271 --> 02:01:37,661
golf?
You know,

2723
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:40,100
how he got good at golf by only fucking
playing golf.

2724
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:44,120
And he was able to find something that
he got so fucking good at it and create

2725
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:47,990
meaning in his life.
And also use that to develop different

2726
02:01:47,991 --> 02:01:51,110
parts of your personality.
And it's,

2727
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,580
I'm in favor of people doing whatever
they think

2728
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:59,360
suits their creative pursuits.
Don't,

2729
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:01,160
don't feel bad if you're somebody who's
all I.

2730
02:02:01,161 --> 02:02:03,650
all I do is this one fucking thing.
Okay,

2731
02:02:03,651 --> 02:02:04,730
well you can get really fucking good at
it.

2732
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:06,260
And who,
even if it's some shit like playing

2733
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:07,011
video games,
okay,

2734
02:02:07,011 --> 02:02:09,080
go be the fucking best video game player
in the world.

2735
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:12,590
Might as well if that's what you're
really good at and you can do the time

2736
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:14,780
and put in the work,
especially if you enjoy that.

2737
02:02:14,781 --> 02:02:17,240
And there's something about getting the
GRC.

2738
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,370
Jiro dreams of Sushi.
No,

2739
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:22,250
really interesting documentary.
One of the weirdest things about it,

2740
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:26,720
it's just a,
there's a term that the Japanese use for

2741
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:30,470
someone who does something over and over
and over again,

2742
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:33,320
even a simple task and becomes a master
at it.

2743
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:35,150
Do you remember what that term was?
Jamey.

2744
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,393
Remember that?
Um,

2745
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:41,450
but this is one guy in the film I was at
first I was very skeptical.

2746
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:43,340
Like,
I'm not watching a fucking movie about a

2747
02:02:43,341 --> 02:02:45,890
due to make Sushi because the fish,
he puts it on the right,

2748
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:49,220
but then when you see what really goes
into it to show Coonan I think,

2749
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:53,000
how'd he say it?
Show coon and um,

2750
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:55,990
and that is,
what is the definition of that was the,

2751
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,260
what is it?
What do they call it?

2752
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,790
What is the actual.
A tradesman?

2753
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:06,230
No,
it was like someone who practices

2754
02:03:06,231 --> 02:03:11,231
something methodically,
meticulously forever until they get it.

2755
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,240
And this guy was just making an egg
dish.

2756
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:18,590
It's like really fluffy egg dish and he,
you know,

2757
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:19,850
how you get those,
you know,

2758
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,340
you get Sushi sometimes it has that
little piece of egg on it.

2759
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,570
Like this.
I don't eat Sushi,

2760
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,000
tastes.
We don't eat pussy either.

2761
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:31,060
Well this fucking camera off as kind of
the you want to deal with the Sushi.

2762
02:03:32,421 --> 02:03:36,350
I'm not dealing with
the um.

2763
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:39,830
Anyway,
this guy was like almost in tears

2764
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,890
because he finally reached this state
where the guy was like,

2765
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:44,980
yeah,
this is the way to make the egg dish the

2766
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:49,380
mastery of one's profession show she'll
and things I'm seeing for definition.

2767
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:52,010
Okay,
show coon and mastery of one's

2768
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:54,800
profession,
but in that this is this thing that this

2769
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:57,740
guy had been studying the art of making
Sushi,

2770
02:03:57,741 --> 02:04:00,920
like the properly aging of the fish,
which I didn't even know.

2771
02:04:00,921 --> 02:04:04,620
I thought the fish was fresh.
I thought that was the move was aging.

2772
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:07,850
They know they want to.
They own refrigerators for long periods

2773
02:04:07,851 --> 02:04:10,730
of time that I would've never guessed
that they did that with fish.

2774
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,240
Obviously with meet everybody knows
about dry aged meat.

2775
02:04:14,241 --> 02:04:16,220
You're.
You're literally letting the bacteria

2776
02:04:16,221 --> 02:04:18,350
break down the meat over long periods of
time,

2777
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:23,000
but what's interesting is you would
never guess that there are so many

2778
02:04:23,001 --> 02:04:27,740
different angles to doing something as
simple as making that dish so much that

2779
02:04:27,741 --> 02:04:32,090
goes into it and if you care enough to
look at all the nuances of it and to

2780
02:04:32,091 --> 02:04:36,350
really get into the specifics of it,
then you can create something that has

2781
02:04:36,351 --> 02:04:38,970
meaning to you and really can develop
you as a person.

2782
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:39,990
Yeah,
yeah.

2783
02:04:39,991 --> 02:04:42,280
There's something in that where you.
You're.

2784
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:47,580
You're exploring your own potential for
getting good at things,

2785
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:49,440
right?
That's what you're doing.

2786
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:52,770
You're exploring like what?
What's keeping this guy from making this

2787
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,960
perfect egg dish and how does he nail
it?

2788
02:04:54,961 --> 02:04:57,150
Is it a timing issue?
Is it A.

2789
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:00,450
I mean,
is he getting the ingredients correct?

2790
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:02,670
I don't know what's what ingredients are
in this egg dish,

2791
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:04,290
but I don't know why I'm even using
that,

2792
02:05:04,291 --> 02:05:09,000
but for anything,
there's some exploration of these ideas.

2793
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,970
What is this?
Kaizen is someone that's the word that's

2794
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:14,190
the word.
Continuous improvement,

2795
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:19,050
a longterm approach to work that
systematically seeks to achieve small

2796
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:24,080
incremental changes in processes in
order to improve efficiency and quality

2797
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:28,290
Kaizen,
but I think it was show Coonan the show

2798
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:31,530
couldn't definition and said like the
definition of tradesmen isn't good

2799
02:05:31,531 --> 02:05:33,990
enough,
but there's more deeper meaning when you

2800
02:05:33,991 --> 02:05:36,130
get into like the Japanese cultural
expert.

2801
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:38,210
Okay.
So either one of those folks.

2802
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:41,070
Yeah.
I actually think that this topic that

2803
02:05:41,071 --> 02:05:44,550
we're talking about right now,
this is one of the main reasons why

2804
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:48,000
Jordan Peterson got very popular is
because Jordan Peterson,

2805
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:52,740
he talks a lot about stuff that other
people take for granted about self

2806
02:05:52,741 --> 02:05:55,470
improvement and like getting your own
shit together.

2807
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:58,090
Right?
And so that was like a market that was

2808
02:05:58,091 --> 02:06:00,870
awaiting to be served for so long where
people wanted to have a little bit of

2809
02:06:00,871 --> 02:06:05,220
direction and structure and framework as
to how do I go about doing that.

2810
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:08,670
And then this guy comes along and he's
very well spoken and he can kind of

2811
02:06:08,671 --> 02:06:10,470
break that down for people.
Yeah.

2812
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,570
Yeah.
And also he,

2813
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:16,500
he exemplifies a lot of those traits we
were just discussing when he was talking

2814
02:06:16,501 --> 02:06:20,850
about his first book.
And I'm one of the things that he said

2815
02:06:20,851 --> 02:06:23,460
is that it took him 15 years to write
the book.

2816
02:06:23,461 --> 02:06:24,780
The 12 rules book.
No,

2817
02:06:24,781 --> 02:06:28,170
the first,
the first book was on the Cold War and

2818
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:33,410
he was talking about how he went over
every sentence to see if it can be

2819
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:37,940
improved or criticized.
But do you do that with your podcasts?

2820
02:06:37,941 --> 02:06:40,250
Do you listen back or now because
there's sometimes.

2821
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:43,500
Sometimes if especially if I fucked up,
I fucked up,

2822
02:06:43,501 --> 02:06:45,480
I'll listen.
Or if I said something I know that could

2823
02:06:45,481 --> 02:06:46,980
be a bit,
said something.

2824
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,160
Well,
I'll have to go back and get another one

2825
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,160
of.
They're trying it.

2826
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,450
Yeah,
I'll do that.

2827
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,450
Or you know,
if some people say something that's

2828
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:57,060
really intense,
like the David Goggins podcast,

2829
02:06:57,061 --> 02:06:59,940
I plan on listening to that one again
because it was so inspirational.

2830
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:01,530
Oh yeah.
I turned it on.

2831
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:06,531
These guys talking about how he ran a
374,000 miles and meanwhile I'm like,

2832
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:08,640
great,
I'll be on Joe show next week talking

2833
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:11,800
about chronic masturbation.
He's um,

2834
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:14,280
I mean he's intense,
intense.

2835
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:16,710
It's not a good enough word.
It's like we need to.

2836
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:17,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2837
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:20,340
So Coonan word for intensity.
Yeah.

2838
02:07:20,341 --> 02:07:23,850
He's um,
but also you could get a lot out of

2839
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:26,370
that.
There's something about inspiration in

2840
02:07:26,371 --> 02:07:28,860
that form,
like the exemplified form.

2841
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:32,490
There's a term that a,
the Koreans used for a taekwondo

2842
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:35,860
instructor.
It's a Sabal Nim and it means one who

2843
02:07:35,861 --> 02:07:39,940
leads by example and that there's,
there's something about a guy like that,

2844
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:42,220
that,
that really does practice what he

2845
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:43,840
preaches,
preaches,

2846
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:47,440
and,
and is so motivational just by his own

2847
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:49,900
actions.
When you hear him talk about it and you

2848
02:07:49,901 --> 02:07:51,040
know,
he's actually done it.

2849
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:52,180
Like,
you just want to like,

2850
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,590
why am I sitting down?
I got to go.

2851
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:55,330
You just want to.
I think you said that after the.

2852
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:56,261
That's right,
you were like,

2853
02:07:56,261 --> 02:07:57,094
I'm in the gym,
but fuck,

2854
02:07:57,110 --> 02:07:59,410
I just want to go do something.
It's just,

2855
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:03,160
there's something about guys like him
that are very,

2856
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:06,460
very valuable to us and I think people
get real cynical about the idea of

2857
02:08:06,461 --> 02:08:11,461
inspiration because there's so many
ridiculous like not to single out girls

2858
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:13,120
because there's guys do it too,
but it's,

2859
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:16,540
there's some funny shit about girls just
stick their butt out on instagram and

2860
02:08:16,541 --> 02:08:20,200
they have all these motivational quotes
accord and I were talking about it

2861
02:08:20,201 --> 02:08:21,034
before.

2862
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:25,300
It's amazing how many Kim Kardashians
clones exist now.

2863
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:27,370
I mean,
and even in her own family,

2864
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:29,470
I don't know all the names of them,
but one of the younger ones,

2865
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:30,820
she,
it's like she went to the plastic

2866
02:08:30,821 --> 02:08:32,770
surgeon and she was like,
I want to look like Kim.

2867
02:08:32,910 --> 02:08:35,200
Yeah.
And they just give her the same face.

2868
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:37,590
You know,
what the fuck is up with that?

2869
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:41,620
The but thing is the most disgusting
thing where they're taking fat and stuff

2870
02:08:41,621 --> 02:08:43,930
and an into their ass and they developed
this diaper.

2871
02:08:43,931 --> 02:08:46,540
But I mean,
there's a lot of people out there with

2872
02:08:46,541 --> 02:08:48,370
diaper,
but I met a girl the other day that had

2873
02:08:48,371 --> 02:08:50,160
diaper,
but she was at the comedy store and I

2874
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:51,640
couldn't look away.
I was like,

2875
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:54,880
what is happening to her?
But because I knew it wasn't real.

2876
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,080
I knew she had.
Okay,

2877
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,750
so these spindly legs.

2878
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,630
Yeah,
the skinny legs.

2879
02:08:58,631 --> 02:08:59,580
And then the.
Well,

2880
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:04,600
if a girl has a big like hips and the
right member art chrome comics,

2881
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:07,300
do you remember our chrome comics now?
Our KARMAS are crumb.

2882
02:09:07,301 --> 02:09:10,640
There was a great documentary called
crumb and it's about this guy who's this

2883
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:14,950
really eccentric perverted cartoonist
from the 19 seventies.

2884
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:20,820
And he would always draw these women
with these enormous legs and enormous

2885
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:23,170
but,
but they weren't fat.

2886
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,660
They were just as voluptuous.
They will know.

2887
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:30,690
It was a path voluptuous into like super
athlete DNA.

2888
02:09:32,051 --> 02:09:34,810
Like if you could get that girl makes a
male babies with it,

2889
02:09:34,811 --> 02:09:37,240
you would have a fucking ultimate
warrior like that.

2890
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:39,220
See that woman.
Like they're perfect.

2891
02:09:39,221 --> 02:09:41,770
Yeah.
How to have fun with a strong girl.

2892
02:09:41,771 --> 02:09:43,720
And you see our chrome.
That's actually him.

2893
02:09:43,721 --> 02:09:45,410
Ronnie Coleman legs.
Yeah,

2894
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:48,790
that's actually him with his boner
because he was just a really frail,

2895
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:53,620
Dorky guy and he's got this image of
this woman who just looks like a tank.

2896
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:58,540
She has these giant muscle legs and and
big boobs,

2897
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:03,541
but not like ridiculous stripper boobs,
but more like just Super Alpha Dna.

2898
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:06,550
Female boobs.
Yeah.

2899
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:09,220
He was a freaky guy.
Like,

2900
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:10,360
look at him.
He's got soccer.

2901
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:12,550
I mean that's,
that's who he was like really the one

2902
02:10:12,551 --> 02:10:13,450
above that.
Jamie.

2903
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:14,351
The one to the right.
Yeah.

2904
02:10:14,351 --> 02:10:15,184
Right.
They're like,

2905
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:20,230
oh my goodness is what he used to draw.
He was always drawing this enormous,

2906
02:10:20,231 --> 02:10:22,510
powerful women.
This guy was definitely into getting

2907
02:10:22,511 --> 02:10:24,250
dominated.
Oh yeah.

2908
02:10:24,251 --> 02:10:26,750
He would just shove his whole head in
their pussy or so I'm sure,

2909
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:27,960
like,
look at him.

2910
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:30,970
He hit him riding one.
I guess he's supposed to be having sex

2911
02:10:30,971 --> 02:10:33,130
with him and this guy definitely noted
in like two seconds.

2912
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,310
Yeah.
Oh man,

2913
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:35,910
look,
he's choking them in these carts.

2914
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:39,300
Like he's always choking them.
Like you literally couldn't have an art

2915
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:43,120
crumb today that looks like it looks
kind of like a woody allen to.

2916
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:44,483
Yeah.
Well,

2917
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:48,210
see if you could find a video of him,
our crum,

2918
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:52,010
the documentaries.
Fascinating because I think he wound up

2919
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:56,180
moving to France or something like that.
I think you want to leaving America.

2920
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,420
Um,
but there's,

2921
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:01,310
there's actually,
if you go to video you'll,

2922
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:05,240
you'll find there's video of him.
But that was the guy.

2923
02:11:05,241 --> 02:11:09,620
He's a really fascinating guy that's on
him.

2924
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:13,640
It looks just like I'm on the right
not on the right.

2925
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:15,750
Oh,
that's not definitely not the right guy

2926
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:17,450
on the left.
Does that him?

2927
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:19,303
Oh,
there it is.

2928
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:22,160
Oh yeah,
he just looks odd.

2929
02:11:22,730 --> 02:11:26,120
It was just holding up that picture.
Maybe it's also because I'm looking at

2930
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:28,500
him now as an older man.
Um,

2931
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:30,950
the lot of the video that I'd seen was
him.

2932
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:33,040
It bothers me to look at him and think
like,

2933
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:35,090
that guy has a strong sex drive.

2934
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:36,740
Like,
oh,

2935
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:37,291
that's it.
Yeah.

2936
02:11:37,291 --> 02:11:39,680
You might not.
He might just save it up for every

2937
02:11:39,681 --> 02:11:43,250
couple of weeks and they try one of
those cartoons and beat off to it or

2938
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:45,920
find a cow suitable.
Exactly.

2939
02:11:45,921 --> 02:11:47,870
Pay Somebody to sit on his face.
A strange,

2940
02:11:47,871 --> 02:11:49,750
strange character though.
It doesn't matter.

2941
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:50,750
Jamie.
Sorry.

2942
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:53,030
What's that?
I say it looks he did Fritz the cat too.

2943
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:53,991
Yeah,
you did.

2944
02:11:53,991 --> 02:11:54,740
Fritz.
The cat.

2945
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:57,430
He did a lot of a pretty famous,
uh,

2946
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:01,640
uh,
animated or cartoon comic book Type

2947
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,230
Things,
but they were all at cartoonish

2948
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:05,480
features.
Everybody was weird.

2949
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:07,640
Yeah.
And you think Kim has now made that

2950
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:11,120
that's the standard and see this is like
a real like that,

2951
02:12:11,121 --> 02:12:13,490
those women's asses that are chrome
drew.

2952
02:12:13,491 --> 02:12:18,491
I'm not justifying his stuff,
but they were freak ge DNA specimen.

2953
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:21,320
Sure.
Those women at giant thighs and giant

2954
02:12:21,321 --> 02:12:22,880
ass is.
And that's who they were.

2955
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:26,180
Whereas with Kim,
she's got those spindly,

2956
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,440
not,
yeah,

2957
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,060
like her,
but is this,

2958
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:32,180
did just,
it's a surgical creation.

2959
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:36,770
Like there's pictures of her that are
online that make it look good,

2960
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:40,260
but they're all photoshop and we found
out about that because she got Paparazzi

2961
02:12:40,261 --> 02:12:43,220
Razzi when she was in Mexico.
They caught her on the beach.

2962
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:46,270
That was the one that they were showing
way gets worse than that way.

2963
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,770
Grocer.
They caught her wandering around the

2964
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:52,640
beach and they took photos of her,
like real Paparazzi photos.

2965
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:55,670
She would have fake Paparazzi photos
where she would hire pop routes,

2966
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:58,610
take photos of her,
and then she would photoshop a mop and

2967
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:01,190
they made it look like everything was in
place.

2968
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,060
But it's not.
Yeah,

2969
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,700
it's,
it's a disaster.

2970
02:13:04,701 --> 02:13:07,490
This is what it really looks like.
Yeah.

2971
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,690
Yeah.
So is that it?

2972
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,300
Okay.
So if the legs matched the ass,

2973
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:13,970
I'd,
I'd be totally fine with that.

2974
02:13:13,971 --> 02:13:18,290
But even that acid is a distortion
because there's so much going on there

2975
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:21,140
because you,
you're not supposed to have that much

2976
02:13:21,141 --> 02:13:25,430
fat in one place.
It a girl has an ass like that has legs

2977
02:13:25,431 --> 02:13:26,660
to match it.
That's what I'm saying.

2978
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:28,820
If the legs match the ass,
I'd like it.

2979
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:30,740
But the legs.
Yeah.

2980
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:31,940
The throw it off his little

2981
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:36,510
little twig,
legs and then you got the message.

2982
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:39,320
It's like those guys that shoot synthol
until

2983
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,200
it's the same thing,
like you're not,

2984
02:13:43,201 --> 02:13:46,470
that's not a real ass.
Like I just like those synthol muscles

2985
02:13:46,471 --> 02:13:49,420
are not real monster there.
So obviously fake.

2986
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:50,730
But yeah,
because of the legs though,

2987
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:52,380
but the legs were matched it.
I'd be like,

2988
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,360
that's nice.
But it wouldn't match it.

2989
02:13:54,361 --> 02:13:58,050
It's just not possible.
I've seen some where it matches.

2990
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:00,210
Yeah.
But not like that.

2991
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,600
Just it's the whole thing is a disaster.
It says.

2992
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:06,250
Have you ever watched the show?
Forgot,

2993
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:07,710
look at his face.
He's like,

2994
02:14:07,711 --> 02:14:09,020
I'm mailing this shit.
Yeah,

2995
02:14:09,021 --> 02:14:10,500
look at this.
I got this shit on lock.

2996
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:13,530
He's got tits.
He does.

2997
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:15,570
I mean,
these guys wind up getting horrible

2998
02:14:15,571 --> 02:14:17,400
infections too.
Sometimes they've,

2999
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,920
they.
Well they gangrene and shit.

3000
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,610
They say that there's an actual thing.
Oh my God.

3001
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,450
You say you see,
they say how there's an actual thing

3002
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:27,440
called bigorexia.
Like there's Anorexia and there's bigger

3003
02:14:27,441 --> 02:14:30,920
x body dysmorphia exists with A.
I mean there's,

3004
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,590
there's people that have body dysmorphia
in terms of their facial features.

3005
02:14:34,591 --> 02:14:36,240
They just can't stop tweaking their
nose.

3006
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:38,000
Did you hear about,
um,

3007
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:41,070
I read an article about how somebody was
like,

3008
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:45,990
I know I'm supposed to have a hand here,
but it feels so fucking foreign that.

3009
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:49,530
And there's been multiple recorded cases
of this where they will shove their

3010
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:53,310
fucking hand and dry ice so that they
can get an amputated said afterwards,

3011
02:14:53,311 --> 02:14:53,851
they can say,
look,

3012
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:55,110
I'm free.
I finally feel normal.

3013
02:14:55,190 --> 02:14:57,870
It's like you just.
And they save it to them.

3014
02:14:57,871 --> 02:15:00,840
It feels like if I had a fucking third
hand just growing out of here,

3015
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:04,680
I'd feel like that shit doesn't belong.
There are some people where they feel

3016
02:15:04,681 --> 02:15:08,700
like their hand doesn't fucking belong
and what that shows is like the

3017
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:13,350
variation in human psychology is so
fucking broad that it's scary because

3018
02:15:13,351 --> 02:15:15,330
when you really digest that,
that exists,

3019
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:19,710
you also can understand how well there's
monsters out there to want to fucking

3020
02:15:19,711 --> 02:15:22,980
massacre people and they dream about
that shit and that's how they get their

3021
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:23,800
rocks off.

3022
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,510
Yeah.
Human.

3023
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:28,070
The human mind vary so much.
There's so many different paths that

3024
02:15:28,071 --> 02:15:33,071
thoughts can go down and there's so many
different weird pathologies that that

3025
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,800
the mind is capable of,
but the idea that you would think that

3026
02:15:37,801 --> 02:15:40,880
you're supposed to be handicapped,
not handicapped,

3027
02:15:40,881 --> 02:15:43,230
and so you want to chop off a foot or
something like that.

3028
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:46,140
It's really,
I mean it's not common,

3029
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,370
I,
we shouldn't say it's common,

3030
02:15:47,371 --> 02:15:48,204
but it's,
it's,

3031
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:51,120
it's definitely documented.
So let me ask you,

3032
02:15:51,121 --> 02:15:52,410
what's your take on,
um,

3033
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,760
if somebody is transgender and they want
the surgery and let's say they're either

3034
02:16:00,271 --> 02:16:04,380
in the military or they're in prison or
something like that,

3035
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:08,910
is that something that you think should
be provided for them or no?

3036
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:13,020
Um hmm.
That's a good question.

3037
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:16,620
I haven't really thought about too much.
I don't think so.

3038
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:20,940
I don't think that that's an elective
surgery and people would say no,

3039
02:16:20,941 --> 02:16:24,120
it's not elective surgery.
But you think that other people should

3040
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:25,590
pay for that?
Boy,

3041
02:16:25,591 --> 02:16:28,320
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

3042
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,190
I don't have it.
Okay.

3043
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:34,300
So if I was gonna say I know why people
are transgender there.

3044
02:16:34,301 --> 02:16:38,230
Transgender because of body dysmorphia.
They're transgender because of gender

3045
02:16:38,231 --> 02:16:40,300
dysmorphia there.
They're transgender because of this.

3046
02:16:40,301 --> 02:16:41,740
Because of that,
because of abuse,

3047
02:16:41,741 --> 02:16:46,741
because of
easily susceptible to suggestion.

3048
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:50,020
I would just be talking about in my ass.
I don't really know.

3049
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:55,240
I would imagine though there was a broad
spectrum of reasons why someone becomes

3050
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:59,260
transgender.
Some of them being that they literally

3051
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:01,150
have the wrong programming in their
brain.

3052
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:04,240
Some of them being that they.
I mean they could have thought that they

3053
02:17:04,241 --> 02:17:06,010
were fucking Wood Elf.
I mean,

3054
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:08,680
or the.
That's the furry shit is the weird shit.

3055
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:12,190
Oh that's weird.
But very shit too is like I've talked to

3056
02:17:12,191 --> 02:17:13,024
some furries.

3057
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:15,420
I'm sorry,
I'm thinking other kids,

3058
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,750
that's the shit I'm thinking of.
The other

3059
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:19,490
can shit is nuts,
but there's also people that identify

3060
02:17:19,491 --> 02:17:22,880
with being a six year old girl.
I mean there's been cases where people

3061
02:17:22,881 --> 02:17:25,400
identify as being much younger than they
are and they think they should be able

3062
02:17:25,401 --> 02:17:26,690
to have sex with young kids.

3063
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:29,160
So I feel like.
So on the transgender one,

3064
02:17:29,161 --> 02:17:32,850
I feel like for a very long time,
I don't think I understood it at all.

3065
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:38,360
And then I think I finally got it when
it was explained to me like,

3066
02:17:38,551 --> 02:17:41,340
okay,
imagine that you as a straight,

3067
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,950
you know,
CIS gender male,

3068
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:45,660
if I use that term,
whatever it is,

3069
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,660
don't do it.
As a child.

3070
02:17:48,810 --> 02:17:52,260
Let's say I walk outside and I'm forced
every time I go outside to wear a

3071
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:56,280
fucking wig and lipstick and high heels
and a fucking dress and I'd be mortified

3072
02:17:56,281 --> 02:17:58,620
because I,
this is not who the fuck I am and why am

3073
02:17:58,621 --> 02:17:59,790
I wearing this shit?
Right?

3074
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:02,970
So if you think the first point you
made,

3075
02:18:02,971 --> 02:18:03,601
which is,
hey,

3076
02:18:03,601 --> 02:18:06,300
maybe they were just born with the wrong
programming that they're born

3077
02:18:06,301 --> 02:18:08,460
biologically male,
but they're really feel like they're a

3078
02:18:08,461 --> 02:18:09,300
woman or vice versa.

3079
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:14,280
So if that's the case and it's basically
like torture for them to not be the

3080
02:18:14,281 --> 02:18:17,220
other thing,
well then I kind of understand that and

3081
02:18:17,221 --> 02:18:20,730
I'm in favor of them being able to get
that surgery where they lose me,

3082
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,000
not transgender people,
but when I get lost in this whole

3083
02:18:24,001 --> 02:18:27,210
conversation is like the gender fluidity
one,

3084
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:29,850
like I was a male,
now I'm a woman and now I'm a man again.

3085
02:18:29,851 --> 02:18:31,500
And then a woman again and then I'm a
man again.

3086
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:33,800
Just fucking idiot.
He's,

3087
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,060
it's like you have a person at a certain
point,

3088
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:38,430
there are things that are real and there
are things that are not real.

3089
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:43,520
And I feel like it delegitimizes the
ones that are real when you go to goofy

3090
02:18:43,891 --> 02:18:46,520
and too far and you try to pretend like
gender fluidity is a thing.

3091
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:47,880
Well,
isn't it what we're talking about

3092
02:18:47,881 --> 02:18:49,460
earlier when we were talking about left
wing

3093
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:54,020
people versus right wing people that you
in in the term left wing people,

3094
02:18:54,021 --> 02:18:57,350
anybody can join and you're going to get
people like the green haired people that

3095
02:18:57,351 --> 02:19:01,700
were disrupting heather hiring speech
because she was saying there's a

3096
02:19:01,701 --> 02:19:04,310
difference between men and women.
You're going to get those nutty fuckers

3097
02:19:04,430 --> 02:19:07,400
and then you're going to get people that
are just reasonable people that happened

3098
02:19:07,401 --> 02:19:09,860
to be progressive.
You're going to get that with gender

3099
02:19:09,861 --> 02:19:11,780
fluidity.
You're going to get that with people

3100
02:19:11,781 --> 02:19:13,730
that are transgender.
You're going to get that with people

3101
02:19:13,731 --> 02:19:15,050
that are,
you know,

3102
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:20,620
it just going to get a wide variety.
It's very difficult to nail things down,

3103
02:19:20,670 --> 02:19:21,440
decide,

3104
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:25,640
but for like for everybody who looks at
that and then gets turned off to that

3105
02:19:25,641 --> 02:19:26,361
and says,
you know what?

3106
02:19:26,361 --> 02:19:29,060
I align with the right wing because of
that culture stuff.

3107
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:31,520
Like,
I get that feeling over the culture

3108
02:19:31,521 --> 02:19:32,690
issues,
but again,

3109
02:19:32,691 --> 02:19:37,100
the point that I would make to them is
just don't forget that when I talk about

3110
02:19:37,101 --> 02:19:39,590
politics and when I talk about where I
fall on the political spectrum,

3111
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:41,230
to me,
I break it down toward the,

3112
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:44,690
on policy and where I fall on the policy
issues and what we should implement,

3113
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,060
uh,
in order to fix the country.

3114
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:49,970
And on those issues like we were talking
about earlier,

3115
02:19:50,370 --> 02:19:54,170
I'm pretty reliably left wing and the
polls show that the American people

3116
02:19:54,171 --> 02:19:58,880
actually lean in that direction.
So if you focus on those issues,

3117
02:19:58,881 --> 02:20:01,370
the economic issues,
the substantive issues that change

3118
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:03,080
people's lives,
then,

3119
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:04,130
um,
you know,

3120
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:08,660
I think that one can look at the culture
issues as almost like a diversion

3121
02:20:08,661 --> 02:20:13,661
because it really is a gateway to other
ideas that I think are terrible.

3122
02:20:14,660 --> 02:20:19,660
So I think the idea of people on the
left calling out that goofiness is a

3123
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:23,330
good thing that you can redirect them
and be like,

3124
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:25,550
well,
this is what I actually stand for.

3125
02:20:25,551 --> 02:20:28,940
This is what people who are on the left
and want to improve people's lives

3126
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:31,600
really want to fight for.
Yeah.

3127
02:20:32,890 --> 02:20:36,330
I was talking to Douglas Murray about
this yesterday and there's just this

3128
02:20:36,331 --> 02:20:39,960
thing where everyone was forced to say
that Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful.

3129
02:20:40,230 --> 02:20:42,050
Like you couldn't just accept that she
was a woman.

3130
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:44,220
You were forced to say that she was
beautiful and that she is

3131
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,690
hero and that's where you get the
gateway to the right because people go,

3132
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:49,350
if you're going to get,
that's what you're going to tell me

3133
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:52,160
represents the left.
Then go fuck yourself because you're

3134
02:20:52,161 --> 02:20:53,870
just not being.
You're not telling the truth.

3135
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:55,760
Yeah,
you're not so and it's.

3136
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,070
I don't,
I hate the thing where it's like we have

3137
02:20:58,071 --> 02:21:02,060
to care more about feelings.
Didn't what's accurate,

3138
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:06,330
right?
So I don't know why there needs to be a

3139
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:11,320
giant wave on the left of the take.
No bullshit approach to stuff.

3140
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:12,190
Why

3141
02:21:12,190 --> 02:21:15,410
comes to the transgender thing too?
They're there.

3142
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:20,940
You need to be open to all avenues of
this discussion and one thing that I

3143
02:21:22,841 --> 02:21:27,040
think we need to be open to,
we need to think very carefully about

3144
02:21:27,041 --> 02:21:30,700
why it is that someone needs surgery to
be themselves.

3145
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:33,960
Why it is that someone needs exogenous
hormones that,

3146
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:38,650
that aren't native to their biology to
be themselves like someone who wants to

3147
02:21:38,651 --> 02:21:42,550
take estrogen is born a male.
Someone if you feel that you're a woman

3148
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:45,430
or you feel that you're in the wrong
body,

3149
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:52,860
does it make sense that nature wants you
to get surgery?

3150
02:21:53,230 --> 02:21:57,220
Does it make sense that nature wants you
to take hormones that don't exist in

3151
02:21:57,221 --> 02:21:58,054
your body?
I mean,

3152
02:21:58,210 --> 02:22:02,530
is this as.
This is a rational area of contention

3153
02:22:02,531 --> 02:22:04,210
and discussion.
This is something that people should

3154
02:22:04,211 --> 02:22:08,410
talk about.
Like when you say if someone is forced

3155
02:22:08,411 --> 02:22:11,170
to wear lipstick and high heels and make
up and walking down the street,

3156
02:22:11,171 --> 02:22:12,130
but that's not who you are.

3157
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:13,750
Wouldn't that frustrate you?
Yes,

3158
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:17,170
it would,
but it doesn't necessarily conversely

3159
02:22:17,171 --> 02:22:20,830
work where you are walking down the
street without lipstick and high heels

3160
02:22:20,831 --> 02:22:22,780
and makeup and you saying that's what
I'm supposed to have.

3161
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:23,111
Well,
no,

3162
02:22:23,111 --> 02:22:27,510
because that's not real like lipstick.
As something you choose to apply high

3163
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:31,950
heels or something you choose to wear,
it's no one's forcing you to not have

3164
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:35,370
those things on.
So you saying that those things are what

3165
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:36,300
you really are.
Well,

3166
02:22:36,301 --> 02:22:37,950
no,
you're adding those things to you.

3167
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:40,020
What you really are,
as you know,

3168
02:22:40,021 --> 02:22:42,090
makeup naked,
wake up in the morning,

3169
02:22:42,091 --> 02:22:44,280
take off your clothes.
That's where the fuck you really are.

3170
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:48,030
If you say that you should have the
right to wear makeup and the right to

3171
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:49,620
wear that.
Of course she had the right,

3172
02:22:49,621 --> 02:22:52,950
so get your face tattooed like a mowery
should have the right to do whatever the

3173
02:22:52,951 --> 02:22:56,340
fuck you want,
but that that's who you really are,

3174
02:22:56,341 --> 02:22:58,530
that that's somehow your true self.

3175
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:01,980
There might be an underlying
psychological issue there that's

3176
02:23:01,981 --> 02:23:06,981
relevant and to discuss that puts you in
this category of being transphobic or

3177
02:23:07,021 --> 02:23:11,880
insensitive or or right wing.
I don't think that's accurate or fair

3178
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:14,580
because I think this is a real weird
issue.

3179
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:17,940
It's very weird and I think the only
people that truly understand it are the

3180
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:19,560
people that are going through it
themselves,

3181
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:22,610
the people that actually haven't and you
know,

3182
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:24,570
we can call upon those people to explain
it to us,

3183
02:23:24,571 --> 02:23:26,850
but the,
you get a broad spectrum of answers from

3184
02:23:26,851 --> 02:23:28,650
those people as well.
What if,

3185
02:23:28,651 --> 02:23:33,651
um,
so what if it is kind of like depression

3186
02:23:34,321 --> 02:23:35,410
in a way?
So if some,

3187
02:23:35,411 --> 02:23:37,830
if you give chemical assistance,
is somebody who's going through

3188
02:23:37,831 --> 02:23:40,230
depression,
everybody goes bright good because you

3189
02:23:40,231 --> 02:23:43,350
want that person to feel like they're
happy and all necessarily even think

3190
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:44,184
that that's good.

3191
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:48,110
I think exhaust all other possibilities
first including exercise and diet and

3192
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:48,961
that's sure,
sure.

3193
02:23:48,961 --> 02:23:52,260
But there,
but there are examples of people who do

3194
02:23:52,261 --> 02:23:54,390
have that genuine chemical imbalance.
They do,

3195
02:23:54,391 --> 02:23:57,000
but why do they have that genuine
chemical imbalance?

3196
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:59,450
Johann Hari on the podcast,
who's.

3197
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:00,601
I saw that.
Yeah,

3198
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:04,290
and he makes a lot of really good points
about like what is it that's happening

3199
02:24:04,291 --> 02:24:06,300
in your life with?
Is it your,

3200
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:08,910
your,
your situation with your relationship,

3201
02:24:08,911 --> 02:24:10,170
your career,
your life,

3202
02:24:10,171 --> 02:24:12,150
your health,
all these different things need to be

3203
02:24:12,151 --> 02:24:15,630
taken into consideration instead of just
putting some duck tape over it in the

3204
02:24:15,631 --> 02:24:19,650
term of these SSRI and all these
different psych medications,

3205
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:22,800
if they're handing out just as easy as
they're handing out oxycontin's,

3206
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,650
they're passing these fucking things
around here.

3207
02:24:24,670 --> 02:24:27,690
Only overlap for sure.
Radically affect your consciousness.

3208
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,920
So let's say everybody has all their
ducks in a row and they're exercising,

3209
02:24:31,921 --> 02:24:34,050
they're eating healthy,
they're doing everything by the book.

3210
02:24:34,050 --> 02:24:36,150
And uh,
if you look at it on paper,

3211
02:24:36,151 --> 02:24:36,871
you're supposed to go,
yes,

3212
02:24:36,871 --> 02:24:38,390
that person should be healthy.
And what's,

3213
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,660
ah,
what the fuck's her name?

3214
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:40,171
Oh,
Cara,

3215
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:42,390
Santa Maria,
who you've had on the podcast before.

3216
02:24:42,391 --> 02:24:43,350
And she talks about how,
listen,

3217
02:24:43,351 --> 02:24:46,530
I was depressed and they tried a whole
bunch of different antidepressants.

3218
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,560
They finally got me on one that worked.
And then she says like,

3219
02:24:49,561 --> 02:24:51,090
listen,
I want people to understand.

3220
02:24:51,091 --> 02:24:53,910
You need to look at this like treatment.
Look at it like,

3221
02:24:53,911 --> 02:24:54,451
you know,
hey,

3222
02:24:54,451 --> 02:24:57,480
I've got a fucking disease and they got
to give me antibiotics in order to feel

3223
02:24:57,481 --> 02:24:59,970
better.
The problem with us as real scientists

3224
02:24:59,971 --> 02:25:02,790
and doctors to disagree with that and I
don't know if she exhausted every other

3225
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:07,410
possibility and Kara,
she worships at the throne of science

3226
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:10,200
and she thinks that this is the way to
handle it and she might be right.

3227
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:14,430
It also might be possible that if she
had rigorous exercise on a daily basis,

3228
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:18,240
cleaned up her diet and did a bunch of
other things that maybe that would be

3229
02:25:18,241 --> 02:25:20,490
just as effective if not more.
I don't know.

3230
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:22,260
So I don't know.
I don't know what she's done,

3231
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:26,200
but I that automatically assuming that
this,

3232
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:28,630
this blanket statement called
depression,

3233
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:30,520
which could be.
What does that even mean?

3234
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:31,960
You're not happy with your station in
life.

3235
02:25:31,961 --> 02:25:33,760
What does that mean?
You're not happy with your body?

3236
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:35,500
What does that mean?
I don't know what it means.

3237
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:37,660
I mean,
will you tell me that you have it.

3238
02:25:37,661 --> 02:25:40,450
You know what it is when you have it,
but how do you know that what you have

3239
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:44,350
is the same as what that guy has with
what she has or what other great sure we

3240
02:25:44,351 --> 02:25:48,610
don't know,
but we do know is the human body reacts

3241
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:50,470
in very different ways.

3242
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:55,300
When it's well fed with nutrients and
when you exercise on a daily basis,

3243
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:58,660
you flood your body with a natural
endorphins that come from that exercise.

3244
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:01,390
When you surround yourself with a loving
community,

3245
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:04,240
when you engage in things that are
rewarding to you,

3246
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:07,720
all these things have a very positive
effect on the way your mind works as

3247
02:26:07,721 --> 02:26:11,050
well as the way your body feels.
That way your body feels has a positive

3248
02:26:11,051 --> 02:26:14,320
result on the way your mind works.
To think of either one of being

3249
02:26:14,321 --> 02:26:16,150
independent of each other.
I think it's ignorant.

3250
02:26:16,151 --> 02:26:19,540
It's the same thing.
She has the same and there's radical.

3251
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,750
I'm not a depressed person,
but I feel way better after I exercise.

3252
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:25,660
Of course.
I mean there's science on that that says

3253
02:26:25,661 --> 02:26:27,130
when you exercise,
you eat right.

3254
02:26:27,131 --> 02:26:29,410
Of course you're going to get at.
Definitely get a boost in your mood,

3255
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:32,380
but it's hard to do and that's why
people like to take a pill and that's

3256
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:33,100
totally true.

3257
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:36,850
And he also liked to justify their
actions when people take a pill and that

3258
02:26:36,851 --> 02:26:38,320
pill is effective and they go,
well,

3259
02:26:38,321 --> 02:26:40,900
this is my thing,
this is what did it for me.

3260
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:41,943
They're like,
okay,

3261
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:45,130
but at what cost?
So can you orgasm anymore?

3262
02:26:45,131 --> 02:26:47,890
Like there's a lot of shit that happens
to people that when they take those

3263
02:26:47,891 --> 02:26:49,720
fucking things it really fuck them up.
Sure.

3264
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:52,840
So if you're making the point that
they're overprescribed and people rely

3265
02:26:52,841 --> 02:26:55,410
on them too much and it's part of the
culture in a negative way,

3266
02:26:55,630 --> 02:26:56,760
totally agree with you.
Yes.

3267
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:59,260
If,
if we look at the example of say

3268
02:26:59,261 --> 02:27:03,010
paranoid schizophrenia where it's
somebody who literally see shit that's

3269
02:27:03,011 --> 02:27:06,180
not there and it's a genuine
psychological disorder where they needed

3270
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:08,440
very powerful drug like seroquel or
something like that.

3271
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:13,960
So in the case of transgenderism,
what if it's more analogous to a mental

3272
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:16,230
state that's as real as that,
where the,

3273
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:16,930
you know what I mean?

3274
02:27:16,930 --> 02:27:19,360
Like a business solution,
surgery,

3275
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:22,120
sexual reassignment surgery.
And how do we even know,

3276
02:27:22,210 --> 02:27:24,040
I don't know,
but then this gets back to the point you

3277
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:26,170
made about the personal freedom angle of
it where they say,

3278
02:27:26,171 --> 02:27:27,730
you know what,
I'm going to do this and this is what I

3279
02:27:27,731 --> 02:27:29,260
want to do.
I definitely think they should have

3280
02:27:29,261 --> 02:27:31,390
personal freedom to do it.
Just like they think they should have

3281
02:27:31,391 --> 02:27:34,690
personal freedom to get their fucking
nose pierced and do whatever you want to

3282
02:27:34,691 --> 02:27:37,150
do.
But should you have to pay for it?

3283
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:39,220
Well that's.
Then that gets into the broader

3284
02:27:39,221 --> 02:27:42,610
conversation about who should pay for
medical coverage period,

3285
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:45,520
but is this,
is this an elective thing?

3286
02:27:45,550 --> 02:27:49,720
Like how about girls that identify with
a girl who has big tits identified as

3287
02:27:50,070 --> 02:27:52,660
big tits and I have a little tits and so
you're saying the line is fucking

3288
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:53,170
blurry.

3289
02:27:53,170 --> 02:27:55,510
Well it's.
It's certainly the same thing.

3290
02:27:55,870 --> 02:27:59,080
It's the same thing in terms of you
don't like your physical state and you

3291
02:27:59,081 --> 02:28:02,410
want someone to change it.
And if you say you would be happy if you

3292
02:28:02,411 --> 02:28:05,740
had d cups,
but you have a cups and you're convinced

3293
02:28:05,741 --> 02:28:08,980
this is the key to our happiness.
How is that any different than a person

3294
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:10,810
and you could get mad at me all you
want,

3295
02:28:10,811 --> 02:28:12,790
but you were talking about the physical
state.

3296
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,270
Sure.
To physical state of someone like how,

3297
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:19,780
how can you,
how can you say that the only way to fix

3298
02:28:19,781 --> 02:28:24,160
this or how could you offer that up as a
possible avenue that these people that

3299
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:25,460
can pursue it.
If,

3300
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:27,950
if you,
if there's any surgery that can help you

3301
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:30,980
and you want other people to pay for
that surgery,

3302
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:33,800
I don't care.
Just because it's it pertains to gender

3303
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:35,660
doesn't mean we have to automatically
act.

3304
02:28:35,670 --> 02:28:37,040
We ask.
I don't think that's.

3305
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:41,480
I don't think that's rational and it
when it comes to breasts or other other

3306
02:28:41,481 --> 02:28:45,830
various elective surgeries,
I strongly feel that people should pay

3307
02:28:45,831 --> 02:28:47,120
for those themselves.
Sure.

3308
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:48,110
I will.
Absolutely.

3309
02:28:48,111 --> 02:28:52,240
When it comes to the example you give
about breasts,

3310
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:55,430
but I totally agree 100 percent.
Why is that different than sex change?

3311
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:57,380
I'm not saying it is.
I'm not saying it is either.

3312
02:28:57,650 --> 02:28:59,170
I'm just saying,
um,

3313
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:02,510
if that is the case where,
and by the way,

3314
02:29:02,511 --> 02:29:05,360
I haven't read the science on this,
but I'm sure there has been silence on

3315
02:29:05,361 --> 02:29:09,410
this and they've answered the question
as to whether or not doing that surgery

3316
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:11,270
is effective.
What's not?

3317
02:29:11,271 --> 02:29:14,180
Here's the problem.
There's a massive massive suicide rate.

3318
02:29:14,181 --> 02:29:17,630
It's over 40 percent.
So even even post operation.

3319
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:20,200
And I was going to say,
am I wrong in my assumption that pre

3320
02:29:20,201 --> 02:29:22,400
operation death,
when more the suicides are versus

3321
02:29:22,430 --> 02:29:24,220
postop,
I don't think it changes.

3322
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:25,330
Pretty show.
See if,

3323
02:29:25,330 --> 02:29:26,900
let's,
let's be accurate about this.

3324
02:29:27,530 --> 02:29:29,030
Um,
suicide rates,

3325
02:29:29,031 --> 02:29:32,480
pre post transgender sexual reassignment
operations.

3326
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:35,990
I am pretty sure that it's very similar
that it doesn't change.

3327
02:29:35,991 --> 02:29:39,050
And then there's also causation versus
correlation,

3328
02:29:39,051 --> 02:29:40,520
right?
Is it because they were depressed

3329
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:43,250
because they were in the wrong body that
lead them down this road and now here

3330
02:29:43,251 --> 02:29:45,380
they are and they just can't get past
it.

3331
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:47,210
Even if they have the surgery,
there's still bummed out.

3332
02:29:47,211 --> 02:29:49,490
They're not accepted by society as a
woman,

3333
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:52,640
even if a become a trans woman,
they're still not accepted by society.

3334
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:57,320
And could that be changed by us being
more open minded and loving and nature?

3335
02:29:57,321 --> 02:29:58,730
Is it nurture?
Is it the environment?

3336
02:29:58,731 --> 02:30:00,640
Is it in the person?
I don't know what.

3337
02:30:00,650 --> 02:30:03,350
I don't either.
But if it is legitimate mental health

3338
02:30:03,351 --> 02:30:04,880
disorder,
which appears to be called,

3339
02:30:04,881 --> 02:30:06,500
it used to be called gender dysphoria.

3340
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:08,330
And now if you used the term gender
dysphoria,

3341
02:30:08,331 --> 02:30:10,610
it's hate speech.
Like it turns the bus.

3342
02:30:10,611 --> 02:30:13,110
Talking about this might get this
podcast demonetized.

3343
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:15,040
I'm sure it will be.
Probably will be.

3344
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:20,400
If it is gender dysphoria then wouldn't
it actually be a medical condition where

3345
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:23,120
the treatment should be paid for?
It's a good question.

3346
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:25,940
Is that the correct treatment for gender
dysphoria?

3347
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:28,430
Is that the correct treatment for
someone who thinks that they should have

3348
02:30:28,431 --> 02:30:30,590
no hand?
Should you chop that handoff?

3349
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:32,090
What do you think?
I don't know.

3350
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:34,250
She you chop a penis off.
I don't know.

3351
02:30:34,251 --> 02:30:36,970
That's what Caitlyn Jenner did it.
Wait,

3352
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:40,070
did you get did eventually?
But the muscle area statement after she

3353
02:30:40,071 --> 02:30:43,700
did that,
she said that she is no more of a woman

3354
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:45,530
now that she was before.
Well then,

3355
02:30:45,531 --> 02:30:47,180
Hey,
definitely keep your dick.

3356
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:48,883
Yeah,
that's a good point.

3357
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:53,050
If you were still a woman before and
pretty much everybody except now,

3358
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:55,190
which is why I did this really radical
thing like no.

3359
02:30:55,191 --> 02:30:57,560
Well you did admit that you did that for
a reason,

3360
02:30:57,561 --> 02:30:59,660
that you really wanted to do it and now
it's different.

3361
02:30:59,661 --> 02:31:00,620
I mean,
I dunno,

3362
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:04,310
maybe street creds letter her to have
the operation to fully get.

3363
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:08,030
I mean she's fully accepted by that
community and become a spokesperson,

3364
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:09,890
but the way,
and it's funny because she's,

3365
02:31:10,730 --> 02:31:14,720
she's super right wing on other issues.
Remember when she went on she was like,

3366
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:17,600
I'm a very traditional,
a traditional.

3367
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:18,434
I'm sure.
Yeah.

3368
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:22,440
So a lot of people in the Trans
community where like,

3369
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:23,191
you know what?
Fuck her.

3370
02:31:23,191 --> 02:31:26,610
Because she was out there arguing,
I forget it was gay marriage marriage,

3371
02:31:26,611 --> 02:31:28,740
but then there was another one where
she's talking about economics and she

3372
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:29,081
was,
you know,

3373
02:31:29,081 --> 02:31:30,720
like pull yourself up by your
bootstraps.

3374
02:31:30,721 --> 02:31:33,080
It's like fucking privileged prick
without.

3375
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:35,730
How much money do you have for just
sitting around all day and getting paid

3376
02:31:35,731 --> 02:31:38,580
from the Kardashians?
She's a mail card dash in the show is

3377
02:31:38,581 --> 02:31:42,120
was Swiss shows.
What she's on that fucking frivolous,

3378
02:31:42,121 --> 02:31:47,121
ridiculous show and she became a really
bizarre side note and pop culture and

3379
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:48,480
that's what's going on.
I mean,

3380
02:31:48,481 --> 02:31:50,850
when you listen to her talk,
she's like one of the worst spokespeople

3381
02:31:50,851 --> 02:31:53,420
ever for the Trans Community and a lot
of trans people say that they're like,

3382
02:31:53,430 --> 02:31:55,300
we don't want her as.
Because they're,

3383
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:58,440
you know,
if you trans people are individually.

3384
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:01,470
So you left a look at people like
they're individuals and when they,

3385
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:04,920
when somebody put out as this is a
leader of this movement.

3386
02:32:04,921 --> 02:32:06,980
And then it's like,
well that makes her examples.

3387
02:32:07,470 --> 02:32:09,360
The one,
the woman who created Sirius satellite

3388
02:32:09,361 --> 02:32:12,000
radio,
she also created a satellite navigation

3389
02:32:12,001 --> 02:32:12,990
system.
She used to be a man,

3390
02:32:13,230 --> 02:32:14,370
in fact,
very,

3391
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:18,320
very brilliant person.
I interviewed her for Phi,

3392
02:32:18,330 --> 02:32:19,950
for that Joe Rogan questions,
everything show.

3393
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:25,020
She created a model of her wife who they
actually had babies together and then

3394
02:32:25,021 --> 02:32:28,610
she became a woman and uh,
they stayed together and she could,

3395
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:31,830
she created a robot of her,
her wife,

3396
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:36,980
and she's like constantly programming it
and changing it and adding new language

3397
02:32:37,801 --> 02:32:42,570
and new vocabulary to it.
And she thinks eventually as technology

3398
02:32:42,571 --> 02:32:44,190
improves,
she's going to be able to recreate her

3399
02:32:44,191 --> 02:32:46,260
wife and a robot.
By the way,

3400
02:32:46,261 --> 02:32:49,220
another great example,
Brianna Westbrook,

3401
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:50,100
what does this say?

3402
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:51,900
They're uncomfortable truth that many
surveys,

3403
02:32:51,901 --> 02:32:56,010
including the 2011 Swedish study,
indicate that suicide rates remain high

3404
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:59,700
after sex reassignment surgery.
The Swedish study reports that people

3405
02:32:59,701 --> 02:33:04,160
have had sex reassignment surgery are 19
times more likely to die by suicide then

3406
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:06,060
as the general population.
To be fair,

3407
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:08,220
to be fair,
I see the sources life site news,

3408
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:09,370
which is a very,
very right wing.

3409
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,400
That's true.
But the national center for transgender

3410
02:33:11,401 --> 02:33:14,940
equality reported in 2014 that 40
percent of the people who identify as

3411
02:33:14,941 --> 02:33:18,150
transgender have attempted suicide.
Very well may be true.

3412
02:33:18,151 --> 02:33:21,570
I'm just saying that's the national
center for transgender equality or just

3413
02:33:21,571 --> 02:33:26,040
breaking up this article here,
which is the study halo as one is legit.

3414
02:33:26,041 --> 02:33:26,610
Okay.
Yeah,

3415
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:27,600
that's true.
That's legit.

3416
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:28,553
So,
um,

3417
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:31,470
but they're,
they're reporting facts from studies.

3418
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:32,070
And,
uh,

3419
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:35,400
I mean this is,
this is pretty well established that

3420
02:33:35,401 --> 02:33:38,820
there's a high suicide rate amongst
transgender people pre and post

3421
02:33:38,821 --> 02:33:41,410
reassignment surgery for the,
the,

3422
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:42,750
we go back to the same thing.

3423
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:45,660
It doesn't necessarily mean that they
couldn't be happy if they weren't just

3424
02:33:45,661 --> 02:33:47,500
fully accepted by society.
I mean,

3425
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:50,010
I don't know if it's,
I think Caitlyn Jenner's probably

3426
02:33:50,011 --> 02:33:51,840
happier because she gets a shitload of
attention now.

3427
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:53,870
She was in the shadow behind while I'm
over here,

3428
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:55,680
I'm over here,
by the way,

3429
02:33:55,681 --> 02:33:56,970
now she's the,
you know,

3430
02:33:56,971 --> 02:33:58,950
front and center.
Fucking vogue magazine.

3431
02:33:58,951 --> 02:34:00,120
Yeah.
A lot of attention.

3432
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:03,340
Speaking of a people who would be a
better example and,

3433
02:34:03,370 --> 02:34:04,540
and a better,
you know,

3434
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,600
face of the transgender movement.
Uh,

3435
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:09,240
Brianna Westbrook is a candidate who's
running for office and there's actually

3436
02:34:09,241 --> 02:34:13,110
a special election today and she's
running for Congress and she's really

3437
02:34:13,111 --> 02:34:14,310
inspirational.
Uh,

3438
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:16,890
I,
I know about her because I found a

3439
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:17,980
Justice Democrats,
which was a

3440
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,220
group that it was going to primary
corporate democrats and run candidates

3441
02:34:21,221 --> 02:34:24,160
who take no corporate pac money and
she's one of the candidates.

3442
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:29,460
And what you find is it the people who
are really respectful are the people who

3443
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:33,310
they like,
she happens to be transgender,

3444
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:35,590
but she's not putting that front and
center.

3445
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:37,060
You know what I'm saying?
Like a person,

3446
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:38,320
she's a person.
Exactly.

3447
02:34:38,321 --> 02:34:40,420
And she's going,
here are the things I believe in and I

3448
02:34:40,421 --> 02:34:42,970
think this will improve everybody's
lives and I'm gonna run on these issues

3449
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:44,170
and it's not like,
Hey,

3450
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:46,460
I'm transgender and if you don't vote
for me then you're a bigot.

3451
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:47,231
Right,
right,

3452
02:34:47,231 --> 02:34:47,771
right.
That's,

3453
02:34:47,771 --> 02:34:50,750
that's a very good point.
And I think open mindedness is

3454
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:51,840
incredibly

3455
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,650
cool in our wide diverse society and
when people,

3456
02:34:56,100 --> 02:35:00,000
when people push back against that,
it creates all sorts of giant problems

3457
02:35:00,001 --> 02:35:02,940
and I just think it doesn't matter.
You should be able to do whatever you

3458
02:35:02,941 --> 02:35:05,670
want to do and if it doesn't affect you,
what do you care?

3459
02:35:05,671 --> 02:35:06,460
I think we should

3460
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:08,050
be really,
really,

3461
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:10,240
really careful.
But what we do to children though,

3462
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:12,790
and there's a nice.
I saw your conversation on that recently

3463
02:35:12,791 --> 02:35:14,080
and I think you made a bunch of good
points.

3464
02:35:14,081 --> 02:35:17,530
Like when is it okay to say,
you know what?

3465
02:35:17,531 --> 02:35:19,210
Okay,
if you want to do the surgery now you

3466
02:35:19,211 --> 02:35:20,290
can do the surgery.
Well,

3467
02:35:20,291 --> 02:35:21,150
there's a,
there's a

3468
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:24,940
going back to heather hiring and Eric
Weinstein.

3469
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:26,410
There was a,
um,

3470
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:29,410
an article that I believe Eric,
not Eric,

3471
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:30,244
I'm sorry,
Bret,

3472
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:33,670
Bret Weinstein put up on his twitter
yesterday,

3473
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:36,820
or maybe it was heather,
what they were discussing,

3474
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:38,920
um,
this,

3475
02:35:39,370 --> 02:35:44,370
this real problem with kids who are
really young where it becomes a trendy

3476
02:35:44,471 --> 02:35:46,600
thing to,
to think that they're in the wrong

3477
02:35:46,601 --> 02:35:50,410
gender and then they get reinforcement
from their very progressive friends who

3478
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:55,411
also get excited about this idea and
then to intervene surgically or

3479
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:59,130
chemically when your body is still in
development.

3480
02:35:59,150 --> 02:36:03,730
You're 13 or whatever the fuck you are.
You don't know what you are yet and you

3481
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:06,430
should be able to give yourself a chance
to grow and develop.

3482
02:36:06,670 --> 02:36:08,350
But there's a lot of people that
disagree,

3483
02:36:08,351 --> 02:36:10,270
including people that are already
transgender.

3484
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:14,500
That in my mind they're probably more
supportive of it because they want more

3485
02:36:14,501 --> 02:36:15,334
people to do it.

3486
02:36:15,550 --> 02:36:18,850
Like Steven crowder had this weird thing
where he and jared,

3487
02:36:18,851 --> 02:36:21,820
that guy that he does his show with,
went to this meeting and they were

3488
02:36:21,821 --> 02:36:25,900
talking about they just does undercover
film thing where they're talking about

3489
02:36:25,901 --> 02:36:26,770
their six year old,
like,

3490
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:29,080
is that too young to transition them?
And they're like,

3491
02:36:29,081 --> 02:36:31,510
no.
Matter of fact studies show that it.

3492
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:34,000
That's the good,
it's a good time to do it and that you

3493
02:36:34,001 --> 02:36:36,550
could transition back if he changes his
mind.

3494
02:36:36,551 --> 02:36:38,320
And he was like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

3495
02:36:38,321 --> 02:36:39,154
No,
you can't.

3496
02:36:39,330 --> 02:36:42,160
He using hormone blockers in a kid,
you're going to radically affect the way

3497
02:36:42,161 --> 02:36:43,690
that kid develops as a grown adult.

3498
02:36:43,770 --> 02:36:47,340
Yeah.
I don't know what line is the proper

3499
02:36:47,341 --> 02:36:48,510
line?
Adulthood.

3500
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:50,640
Adulthood.
Is it 16?

3501
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:52,260
18,
a 21.

3502
02:36:52,261 --> 02:36:55,290
I think it's probably 25.
I think a fully developed frontal

3503
02:36:55,291 --> 02:36:57,240
cortex.
The only problem I have with that is

3504
02:36:57,241 --> 02:37:00,240
like I want.
I hate the fact that we have all of

3505
02:37:00,241 --> 02:37:01,740
these different lines in society.
Like,

3506
02:37:01,741 --> 02:37:03,120
okay,
you have to be this age to drink after

3507
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:04,650
me this age to do Tibet.
You get tobacco.

3508
02:37:04,651 --> 02:37:06,870
You have to be this age for porn.
I think a lot of those lines are

3509
02:37:06,871 --> 02:37:11,871
incorrect and I think science will show
that the frontal lobe is not fully

3510
02:37:11,971 --> 02:37:13,620
developed until you're 25 years old,
so.

3511
02:37:13,621 --> 02:37:16,010
But should you also not be able to vote
until really?

3512
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,861
Yes.
Yeah,

3513
02:37:16,861 --> 02:37:18,040
I think I agree with that.
Why?

3514
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:20,870
Because I screen haired fuckers that
were in his speech,

3515
02:37:21,210 --> 02:37:24,110
they were all like 19 and goofy.
They're gonna look back at that video

3516
02:37:24,111 --> 02:37:26,040
someday and go,
what the fuck was wrong with that list?

3517
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:29,660
And there's a lot of kids,
they're growing their own vegetables and

3518
02:37:29,661 --> 02:37:31,670
they have to work for a living.
But that's the thing is that those

3519
02:37:31,671 --> 02:37:33,380
people are assholes too.
And also not that smart.

3520
02:37:33,770 --> 02:37:35,300
Some of them,
some of them of course,

3521
02:37:35,301 --> 02:37:37,460
but then so we were just young,
you know,

3522
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:40,400
in my mind,
I think we should just draw a clean line

3523
02:37:40,401 --> 02:37:41,990
at 16 for everything.
Oh God.

3524
02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:44,690
You can fight for your country.
What do you want to have?

3525
02:37:44,691 --> 02:37:47,570
Kylie Jenner is a fucking president
because I don't see a lot of them.

3526
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:50,240
I don't want a baby kids.
I want to make it sort of baby them

3527
02:37:50,241 --> 02:37:52,340
either,
but I don't think like really radical

3528
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:55,280
choices should be up to them when their
brain's not fully developed,

3529
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:58,460
but at the same time you're so you're so
young,

3530
02:37:58,461 --> 02:37:59,000
you don't think.

3531
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,890
When did you first.
When did you first drink?

3532
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:05,390
It was definitely before I was 21 at a
party.

3533
02:38:05,391 --> 02:38:06,550
I was in high school.
I don't know.

3534
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:08,060
Somewhere around there.
Somewhere in your teens?

3535
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:09,590
Yeah.
So then should you be locked up for

3536
02:38:09,591 --> 02:38:10,401
that?
No,

3537
02:38:10,401 --> 02:38:12,070
not locked up,
but I shouldn't be.

3538
02:38:12,071 --> 02:38:14,210
It shouldn't be legal.
Shouldn't be able to go into a liquor

3539
02:38:14,211 --> 02:38:16,610
store and buy a pint of Jack Daniels in
Europe.

3540
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:19,520
I don't think they have any age laws in
Europe for alcohol and stuff.

3541
02:38:19,521 --> 02:38:20,211
Right.
Well,

3542
02:38:20,211 --> 02:38:22,640
am I wrong about that?
I think there is.

3543
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:23,440
I think it's.
Yeah,

3544
02:38:23,440 --> 02:38:26,570
I think it's fairly young that maybe
wine and things along with that.

3545
02:38:26,571 --> 02:38:29,390
I think first of all,
having things that are forbidden

3546
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:32,150
definitely accentuates the desire to
have them.

3547
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,370
We know that.
Sure.

3548
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:36,050
Telling a kid that cigarettes are bad.
You can't have cigarettes.

3549
02:38:36,051 --> 02:38:36,950
They want to smoke cigarettes.

3550
02:38:37,070 --> 02:38:38,720
They want to be rebels,
they want to drink,

3551
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:40,850
they want to,
they want to do things that the adults

3552
02:38:40,851 --> 02:38:42,440
do.
And what age for sexual consent.

3553
02:38:42,441 --> 02:38:43,820
I mean this is,
we obviously can't.

3554
02:38:43,821 --> 02:38:45,250
You're 25 for that,
right?

3555
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:47,600
So you have to draw a reasonable line
where you say,

3556
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:50,450
okay,
enough people have developed to the

3557
02:38:50,451 --> 02:38:53,990
point where they're physically mature,
but there's a big difference between

3558
02:38:53,991 --> 02:38:55,970
sex,
which I don't think is a bad thing.

3559
02:38:56,030 --> 02:38:58,100
I think.
I don't think it's a disastrous thing.

3560
02:38:58,150 --> 02:39:00,620
I don't mind the different lines,
like 21,

3561
02:39:00,621 --> 02:39:03,620
$60 to have sex with each other when
they like it.

3562
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:07,550
Like I think kids should be able to give
you some of the massage as a 17 year old

3563
02:39:07,551 --> 02:39:10,550
boy and a 17 year old girl of course
that should be able to make out and they

3564
02:39:10,551 --> 02:39:14,510
should be able to fuck up.
Do you think it's our job to responsibly

3565
02:39:14,511 --> 02:39:17,950
educate them about birth control and
about consent and about.

3566
02:39:17,950 --> 02:39:19,010
And it also,
you know,

3567
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:23,240
there's different styles of parenting.
You know,

3568
02:39:23,241 --> 02:39:27,050
some people grow up in horrible
households where the dad's massage and

3569
02:39:27,070 --> 02:39:29,390
there's no mom and you know,
this kid's going to have a fucked up

3570
02:39:29,391 --> 02:39:32,750
idea.
What women are same could be said about

3571
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:36,680
women or girls who grow up with a
hateful mother who hates men.

3572
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:40,550
I mean you have a lot of weird shit that
you have to get over as you become an

3573
02:39:40,551 --> 02:39:42,500
adult.
As you move out of the nest and you

3574
02:39:42,501 --> 02:39:46,100
become your own person,
established your own ideas based on your

3575
02:39:46,101 --> 02:39:49,460
life experiences and education,
what you've learned from all the other

3576
02:39:49,461 --> 02:39:51,860
people that you've interacted with.
I mean,

3577
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:55,700
it's not a hard fast rule,
but I think there's a big difference

3578
02:39:55,701 --> 02:39:59,360
between that and voting on what happens
with our future.

3579
02:39:59,361 --> 02:40:01,850
What happens with war,
what happens with.

3580
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:05,210
There's so many things that a 16 year
old kids is now ready for.

3581
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:06,930
So.
But like again,

3582
02:40:06,931 --> 02:40:08,660
my.
I think my counter argument to that is,

3583
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:13,350
but there are a lot of fucking 68 year
old idiots out there too and we don't

3584
02:40:13,351 --> 02:40:14,310
try to deal with itemize

3585
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:18,090
their vote because I think we should.
But anytime you have a system where you

3586
02:40:18,091 --> 02:40:18,541
say,
ah,

3587
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:21,870
well you're an idiot so you can't vote,
it's always inevitably just flip back to

3588
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:24,240
be used against the,
the poor in society.

3589
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:25,650
So that.
So.

3590
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:29,100
Well look,
I mean there's a great quote from

3591
02:40:29,101 --> 02:40:31,050
Winston Churchill.
I think you said democracy is the worst

3592
02:40:31,051 --> 02:40:32,610
form of government except for all
others.

3593
02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:33,811
Yeah.
That's great.

3594
02:40:33,811 --> 02:40:34,201
Cool.
Yeah,

3595
02:40:34,201 --> 02:40:35,034
exactly.
And that's.

3596
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,570
So that's kind of what we're talking
about here.

3597
02:40:36,571 --> 02:40:38,250
And in terms of drawing the line,
I don't know,

3598
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:41,460
I just feel like there's something right
about drawing one line and saying

3599
02:40:41,461 --> 02:40:44,160
everything over this.
But I do hear you like it is true that

3600
02:40:44,161 --> 02:40:45,870
sex is a very different thing from
voting.

3601
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:48,450
So yeah,
I don't think we should regulate sex

3602
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:50,790
except for adults having sex with
minors.

3603
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:52,920
I agree a hundred percent.
When I was 17,

3604
02:40:52,921 --> 02:40:56,820
my girlfriend was 16 and I remember I
turned 18 and she turned 17.

3605
02:40:56,820 --> 02:40:58,440
And there was a year.
You were a criminal?

3606
02:40:58,670 --> 02:41:00,810
Yeah.
Someone told me that if we kept having

3607
02:41:00,811 --> 02:41:01,810
sex,
that I would go to jail.

3608
02:41:01,811 --> 02:41:02,700
I was like,
what the fuck?

3609
02:41:02,701 --> 02:41:04,860
Are you serious?
This is madness.

3610
02:41:04,861 --> 02:41:07,140
Yes,
I mean we've been banging it out for 11

3611
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:09,030
months now.
If we could stop now.

3612
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:10,470
It makes no sense.
Yeah.

3613
02:41:10,471 --> 02:41:11,730
I was really nervous.
I was like,

3614
02:41:11,731 --> 02:41:14,400
what if I go to jail?
I don't think that works that way.

3615
02:41:14,430 --> 02:41:15,750
I don't think they put you in jail for
that.

3616
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:19,380
But yeah,
I remember how bad I felt when I was in

3617
02:41:19,381 --> 02:41:22,710
high school and I was smoking weed and I
felt like if I get caught doing this

3618
02:41:22,711 --> 02:41:25,230
shit,
but then you think about it and it's

3619
02:41:25,231 --> 02:41:27,750
like,
hold the fuck on Bill Clinton.

3620
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:28,631
US.
No,

3621
02:41:28,631 --> 02:41:31,620
but I didn't know.
And Barack Obama was part of the fucking

3622
02:41:31,630 --> 02:41:33,870
tomb gang or some shit where he would,
what?

3623
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:37,080
He was part of this thing called the
tomb gang where he would uh,

3624
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:37,890
yeah,
look up Jimmy.

3625
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:38,723
He,
uh,

3626
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:40,620
he would smoke weed.
There's picture of him smoking weed on

3627
02:41:40,621 --> 02:41:42,270
the Internet.
He's when he chances cigarette.

3628
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:43,530
You sure?
I'm pretty sure.

3629
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:45,060
Okay.
Because he did smoke weed alive.

3630
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:46,260
He admits it.
And then,

3631
02:41:46,261 --> 02:41:48,180
you know,
I think that there were charges of Bush

3632
02:41:48,181 --> 02:41:51,420
used cocaine and then Obama said he did
a little bit of cocaine and shit like

3633
02:41:51,421 --> 02:41:53,730
that.
So what drives me fucking crazy is that

3634
02:41:53,731 --> 02:41:55,770
you have these guys who did all these
things.

3635
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:58,980
They know damn well that what they did
at the time was just experimentation.

3636
02:41:59,070 --> 02:42:01,890
There's nothing morally wrong about it.
And now we have a system where we lock

3637
02:42:01,891 --> 02:42:05,100
up fucking thousands of people,
millions of people over the same shit.

3638
02:42:05,220 --> 02:42:07,320
Meanwhile,
they became president when they did

3639
02:42:07,321 --> 02:42:09,100
that.
You're running on that eight,

3640
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,700
the eight years that he was in the
office.

3641
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:13,680
How many people were locked up for
marijuana?

3642
02:42:13,681 --> 02:42:14,970
Exactly.
Exactly.

3643
02:42:15,030 --> 02:42:15,900
Yeah.
Not just,

3644
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:18,540
not just for selling,
but for recreational use in certain

3645
02:42:18,541 --> 02:42:20,370
states.
There were people who got,

3646
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:24,270
who have life sentences as a result of
nonviolent drug offenses.

3647
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:27,330
Now to Obama's credit,
towards the end of his time in office,

3648
02:42:27,331 --> 02:42:30,510
he started doing a pardons and
commutations of those sentences.

3649
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:32,280
But the thing that drives me crazy,
again,

3650
02:42:32,281 --> 02:42:33,690
to get back to one of my main points
here,

3651
02:42:33,691 --> 02:42:37,440
is I hate the fucking incrementalism and
gradual ism moving towards the thing

3652
02:42:37,441 --> 02:42:39,750
that we all know is the right answer.
We don't know the right answer is to

3653
02:42:39,751 --> 02:42:42,690
legalize it and fucking let every single
nonviolent drug offenders out of prison

3654
02:42:42,691 --> 02:42:44,460
and fucking apologized to him.
Not only that,

3655
02:42:44,461 --> 02:42:47,880
the hypocritical nature of having all
this coincide with the pharmaceutical

3656
02:42:47,881 --> 02:42:51,840
industry selling opioids that are
killing people at a radical rate while

3657
02:42:51,841 --> 02:42:54,210
they take contributions from us.
It's fucking crazy.

3658
02:42:54,211 --> 02:42:56,100
I mean,
they are literally a part of a drug

3659
02:42:56,101 --> 02:42:58,450
dealing enterprise.
I remember my,

3660
02:42:58,570 --> 02:43:02,910
my grandma on my dad's side,
I remember she passed away a while ago,

3661
02:43:02,911 --> 02:43:06,600
but I would go to her place and look at
her fucking medicine thing.

3662
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:11,650
There were 70 different kinds of pills.
I was like,

3663
02:43:11,651 --> 02:43:12,370
holy

3664
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:15,100
fuck.
She's getting zonked out of her mind on

3665
02:43:15,101 --> 02:43:17,320
a regular basis.
Like that's the whole point of it.

3666
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:19,360
And I'm not even begrudging an older
person who's like,

3667
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:20,710
fuck it,
I'm checking out unless you give me all

3668
02:43:20,711 --> 02:43:22,270
the pills you want.
But my point is,

3669
02:43:22,271 --> 02:43:25,000
if you're gonna,
if that's going to be the mentality for

3670
02:43:25,001 --> 02:43:25,640
them,
why,

3671
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:29,170
why the fuck would you lock up poor
people for smoking weed or doing cocaine

3672
02:43:29,171 --> 02:43:31,390
or whatever the case is.
I don't think anybody could rationally

3673
02:43:31,391 --> 02:43:32,470
argue that.
I mean,

3674
02:43:32,471 --> 02:43:34,960
it's just seems at this stage of the
game,

3675
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:38,110
especially when it comes to things that
are nontoxic or,

3676
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:39,730
or,
or a nonfatal.

3677
02:43:39,970 --> 02:43:42,940
Things like marijuana or Kratom,
there's no argument against.

3678
02:43:42,941 --> 02:43:45,670
It doesn't make any sense.
Especially when you could go right down

3679
02:43:45,671 --> 02:43:48,340
the street.
You could go to the CVS and buy enough

3680
02:43:48,341 --> 02:43:49,690
liquor to kill yourself instantly.

3681
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:51,520
Exactly.
Easily,

3682
02:43:51,580 --> 02:43:53,380
easily right here.
That,

3683
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:55,660
that table right over there will kill
you.

3684
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:57,460
Yeah.
If you drink all that for sure.

3685
02:43:57,470 --> 02:43:59,500
Yeah.
There's a table there with a big bottle

3686
02:43:59,501 --> 02:44:02,020
of gentleman's Jack.
There's a couple of bottles of whiskey

3687
02:44:02,021 --> 02:44:05,380
to some whiskey from some place in
Bakersfield and a big jug of wine dead

3688
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:06,520
drink.
All that shit.

3689
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:07,510
Dead.
One hundred percent.

3690
02:44:07,810 --> 02:44:08,590
So,
uh,

3691
02:44:08,590 --> 02:44:11,020
sorry to change topic so abruptly.
But I'm from New York.

3692
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:13,030
The bagels here.
Fucking terrible.

3693
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:15,370
Is that the water?
I don't know.

3694
02:44:15,450 --> 02:44:16,211
Must Be.
I was like,

3695
02:44:16,211 --> 02:44:18,490
this isn't a Bagel.
This is like a fucking piece of stale

3696
02:44:18,491 --> 02:44:19,450
bread.
Yeah,

3697
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:21,760
I think it's the water.
I think it's the moisture in the air

3698
02:44:21,761 --> 02:44:23,470
too.
I wonder if the bagels are better in

3699
02:44:23,471 --> 02:44:25,390
Seattle.
Is it moisture up there?

3700
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:27,670
Right?
It's wet and then I'm going to try the

3701
02:44:27,671 --> 02:44:29,020
pizza.
I'm going to try the pizza.

3702
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:31,210
I think today,
here don't do it.

3703
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:34,000
I'm going to do it just because I got.
I got to compare,

3704
02:44:34,001 --> 02:44:36,070
man.
I got to compare my whole life.

3705
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:37,720
I heard like a New York piece is the
best.

3706
02:44:37,721 --> 02:44:39,410
Where do you live now?
And you live in the city and uh,

3707
02:44:39,460 --> 02:44:40,660
no.
I live just outside of the city.

3708
02:44:40,661 --> 02:44:42,270
I live in Westchester County still,
but not nourished.

3709
02:44:42,271 --> 02:44:44,590
Yell anymore.
It's better pizza for sure.

3710
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:47,500
Did used to go to Nicki's pizza?
I went down the street from white

3711
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:48,940
plains.
Been there once,

3712
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,110
but there's one next to that called
[inaudible].

3713
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:52,870
Have you ever been there?
I don't think so.

3714
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:54,700
No.
Executive billiards.

3715
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:57,880
If you walked out of executive and take
a right in white plains.

3716
02:44:57,970 --> 02:45:00,670
Nikki's was on the right hand side,
but I heard Nikki's burnt down.

3717
02:45:01,090 --> 02:45:02,260
Okay.
Nicky's had.

3718
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:05,770
I only never had white pizza before
until I went to Nikki's and I had white

3719
02:45:05,771 --> 02:45:06,040
pizza.

3720
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:06,970
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

3721
02:45:06,971 --> 02:45:09,160
This is one of the greatest things
humans have ever created.

3722
02:45:09,550 --> 02:45:11,530
When you were there,
were there.

3723
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:14,860
Was there the Strip of bars developed
yet on white plain in in white plains

3724
02:45:14,861 --> 02:45:15,490
or.
No,

3725
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:17,920
it's hard to remember.
There was some bars there for sure,

3726
02:45:17,921 --> 02:45:21,460
but there were old dive bars and shit.
All we would do is go play pool.

3727
02:45:21,570 --> 02:45:23,170
Yeah.
Here it is.

3728
02:45:23,380 --> 02:45:25,120
Nikki's is still there.
Still there?

3729
02:45:25,121 --> 02:45:26,790
I think it's still a science.
What's that?

3730
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:29,650
Stickers on the door.
Why is that shit on the door?

3731
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:32,440
The right to the right of that?
It looks like there's like closed down.

3732
02:45:32,510 --> 02:45:35,620
Yeah.
Tim was there like two years ago,

3733
02:45:35,621 --> 02:45:38,470
so I mean it could have,
could have closed since then.

3734
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:41,530
I think Mario's pizza in white plains.
Is it?

3735
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:43,660
You have to trial.
It is open so it is open now.

3736
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:47,830
So they must have did it burn down and
they rebuilt it because that was yellow

3737
02:45:47,831 --> 02:45:49,690
tape over the door.
Like police tape.

3738
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:52,990
Oh yeah.
They cleaned it up fucking damn.

3739
02:45:52,991 --> 02:45:55,600
If they have the same recipe,
a run,

3740
02:45:55,601 --> 02:45:57,910
do not walk,
run to Nikki's and get some of that

3741
02:45:57,911 --> 02:46:02,110
white pizza or any of their pizza.
So speaking of your crazy stories about

3742
02:46:02,111 --> 02:46:04,810
at executive billiards and all the crazy
characters you've met there.

3743
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:06,790
My friend Karen and I,
we,

3744
02:46:06,870 --> 02:46:09,770
when we were in high school,
we would go play poker at these

3745
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:12,800
basically underground spots in new
Rochelle.

3746
02:46:13,220 --> 02:46:16,220
And they were either founders like the
movie with Matt Damon,

3747
02:46:16,310 --> 02:46:17,360
kind of,
but they weren't rushing.

3748
02:46:17,361 --> 02:46:22,130
They were either like weird,
weird fake mafioso dudes or real mafioso

3749
02:46:22,131 --> 02:46:24,290
do is we couldn't tell the difference.
We didn't know because they don't talk

3750
02:46:24,291 --> 02:46:26,870
like this and they're like hey Jimmy,
give me a fucking diet coke.

3751
02:46:26,871 --> 02:46:29,540
And all they would do is sit there and
smoke cigarettes the whole time.

3752
02:46:29,870 --> 02:46:33,980
And so we,
we played cards there and you know,

3753
02:46:33,981 --> 02:46:36,680
we had some friends who did well and me
and my friend probably lost money

3754
02:46:36,681 --> 02:46:40,430
overall,
but there was years later I was watching

3755
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,890
a I turn on the TV,
just happened to be a local news report.

3756
02:46:43,730 --> 02:46:46,280
Learned that one of the guys who was
there,

3757
02:46:46,580 --> 02:46:51,580
God is fucking hand chopped off right in
front of the place.

3758
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:54,200
And I was like,
well,

3759
02:46:54,201 --> 02:46:57,330
we were in over our heads now were we,
we were in high school,

3760
02:46:58,180 --> 02:47:00,020
one of the chop his head off for
stealing.

3761
02:47:00,050 --> 02:47:03,050
I'm sure it,
I'm sure they were real mafia mafia

3762
02:47:03,051 --> 02:47:04,670
guys.
And there was some shortcuts,

3763
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:05,900
you know,
that's dark,

3764
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:09,500
chopping a person's hand off his fucking
gave it to him here.

3765
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:12,560
Go get this sewed back on bitch.
But what's funny is,

3766
02:47:12,561 --> 02:47:13,730
um,
they will fucking,

3767
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:15,950
even though their mafia guys,
they were fucking like,

3768
02:47:15,951 --> 02:47:19,940
they were really nice to us with high
school kids and a lot of Mafia people

3769
02:47:19,941 --> 02:47:22,180
who are gentlemen.
The thing is like,

3770
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:26,300
just can't be in the wrong situation.
You can't owe them money.

3771
02:47:26,570 --> 02:47:29,620
You can't be in a situation where they
can get money out of you or they can

3772
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:31,340
extort money from you.
You know,

3773
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:35,060
if you were running a business or
anything where they offered you

3774
02:47:35,061 --> 02:47:37,820
protection or any of that kind of shit,
like you're fucked man.

3775
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:41,930
And that's why gambling should be
fucking illegal because it's illegal.

3776
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:42,823
Push it underground.

3777
02:47:42,830 --> 02:47:45,470
Now those guys run it and then people
forget their fucking hands chopped off,

3778
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:46,333
right?
Yeah.

3779
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:47,241
Well,
yeah.

3780
02:47:47,241 --> 02:47:49,280
In Vegas they just.
What are they doing to kick your ass?

3781
02:47:49,281 --> 02:47:51,320
Put you in jail.
Then the Vegas,

3782
02:47:51,321 --> 02:47:52,850
he used to run them off,
or the [inaudible] brothers.

3783
02:47:53,170 --> 02:47:54,980
I used to run funding everything.
Yeah.

3784
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:59,000
Even a half a fucking Hollywood.
I'm sure it was financed with mobster

3785
02:47:59,001 --> 02:47:59,721
money.
Well,

3786
02:47:59,721 --> 02:48:01,310
you know,
we've talked about that many times at

3787
02:48:01,311 --> 02:48:03,830
Ciro's nightclub was owned by Bugsy
Siegel.

3788
02:48:03,860 --> 02:48:05,750
That's the comedy store.
There you go.

3789
02:48:05,751 --> 02:48:08,660
Yeah.
They used to be a total mob run joint

3790
02:48:08,661 --> 02:48:12,830
and to this day I've never,
I don't believe in ghosts,

3791
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:15,440
but I'd go to the belly room.
I've gone to the belly room several

3792
02:48:15,441 --> 02:48:18,440
times with my friends,
like over the 20 years that I've been

3793
02:48:18,441 --> 02:48:20,510
there.
We go by when it's dark,

3794
02:48:20,570 --> 02:48:21,870
just stand there.
What do you think you feel?

3795
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,090
Anything?
I'm fucking scared.

3796
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:24,013
Heartbeat.

3797
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:29,300
I don't believe in ghosts,
but I think energy is real and I don't

3798
02:48:29,301 --> 02:48:31,730
know whether we create in our own mind
where we look at something and we're

3799
02:48:31,731 --> 02:48:34,100
like,
I feel weird looking at cars.

3800
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:36,530
Enter rooms give you a feel.
You walk into a room,

3801
02:48:36,531 --> 02:48:38,510
you get a feel off the roof.
Well,

3802
02:48:38,511 --> 02:48:42,350
people had been murdered there for sure.
And that's the thought process about

3803
02:48:42,410 --> 02:48:47,410
that place is that there's probably some
leftover weird vibes and I know a lot of

3804
02:48:47,541 --> 02:48:50,570
people that have seen weird shit there,
but I don't know if I believe them.

3805
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:52,970
They say they've seen weird shifts.
I know Tony Hinchcliffe.

3806
02:48:52,971 --> 02:48:55,430
I saw the podcast where he was like,
I saw a ghost.

3807
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:57,860
Maybe just so you know Tony,
I love you,

3808
02:48:57,861 --> 02:48:59,240
but I was at home going,
fuck off.

3809
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:02,660
Fuck off Tony.
I've never seen a ghost there,

3810
02:49:02,661 --> 02:49:04,340
but I felt weird.
Like I said,

3811
02:49:04,341 --> 02:49:07,650
I've gone into the main room when it's
dark at night and I'll be gone by myself

3812
02:49:07,651 --> 02:49:08,010
and I shit

3813
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:09,930
my pants,
I gotta get Outta here,

3814
02:49:10,290 --> 02:49:12,510
but I,
I definitely believe people were

3815
02:49:12,511 --> 02:49:16,200
murdered there and they used to be a
tunnel that would go from the back of

3816
02:49:16,201 --> 02:49:18,060
the comedy store all the way up to crest
hill,

3817
02:49:18,061 --> 02:49:21,310
which is a street above the comedy store
for the comedy store.

3818
02:49:21,311 --> 02:49:22,950
He used to own,
I think they bought the two of them

3819
02:49:22,951 --> 02:49:26,340
together and you.
It was like a tunnel where they take

3820
02:49:26,341 --> 02:49:30,420
booze and dead people and Shit and
fucking screwed him up there and throw

3821
02:49:30,421 --> 02:49:32,270
them in the back of a trunk.
I don't know.

3822
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:36,590
It's a fun thing to talk about.
When you look at like all those tv shows

3823
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:39,270
like haunted Hollywood.
The comedy store is very high on the

3824
02:49:39,271 --> 02:49:40,030
list.

3825
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:43,030
Have you ever seen like the paranormal
fucking ghost hunters,

3826
02:49:43,031 --> 02:49:46,720
so stupid goofy shows ever?
It's like dark in a hallway and they

3827
02:49:46,721 --> 02:49:47,680
were running like,
shit,

3828
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:52,660
I think I'm still over here.
That is the biggest cock tease of a

3829
02:49:52,661 --> 02:49:53,321
show.
I know.

3830
02:49:53,321 --> 02:49:56,170
Oh remember,
I'm John.

3831
02:49:56,171 --> 02:50:00,400
John Edward to guy crossing like it guy
and then he tried to do it with nine

3832
02:50:00,401 --> 02:50:01,480
slash 11 victims.
They were like,

3833
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:03,100
fuck you.
Now you're canceled.

3834
02:50:03,190 --> 02:50:04,330
Yeah,
that's right.

3835
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:08,440
You used to do it up until that time,
but I don't like how the fuck do network

3836
02:50:08,441 --> 02:50:12,640
executives approved shows where it's
like the fucking long island medium or

3837
02:50:12,641 --> 02:50:14,920
some shit and it's like they pretend to
talk to the dead.

3838
02:50:14,921 --> 02:50:17,260
How the fuck you going to put that on
daytime TV?

3839
02:50:17,290 --> 02:50:18,700
Like it's not complete and utter
horseshit?

3840
02:50:18,730 --> 02:50:20,140
Well,
that was one of the problems that

3841
02:50:20,230 --> 02:50:22,240
happened when I was doing that Saifai
show,

3842
02:50:22,480 --> 02:50:23,950
the Joe Rogan questions.
Everything showed.

3843
02:50:23,951 --> 02:50:26,970
They wanted to make sure that I wasn't
out to debunk a lot of the shows that

3844
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:27,340
they would have

3845
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:30,820
on their network and I can look.
I just want to find out what's going on.

3846
02:50:30,890 --> 02:50:32,650
I want to go.
Some of it's probably real.

3847
02:50:32,651 --> 02:50:34,380
I want it to be real.
Yeah.

3848
02:50:35,140 --> 02:50:39,230
That was an eyeopening experience.
Doing that show was very eyeopening

3849
02:50:39,250 --> 02:50:41,560
because I realized what kind of people
were really into these things.

3850
02:50:41,561 --> 02:50:45,070
They're just whimsical,
hopeful people that don't have much

3851
02:50:45,071 --> 02:50:48,790
going on and they want it to be real,
that there's a 10 foot tall,

3852
02:50:48,791 --> 02:50:51,860
furry man living in the forest or the
aliens come down,

3853
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:55,000
suck people out of their beds and bring
them through walls in the middle of the

3854
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:55,730
night and all that shit.

3855
02:50:55,730 --> 02:50:58,340
Well,
you really took it to the chem trail

3856
02:50:58,341 --> 02:50:59,360
people.
Yeah.

3857
02:50:59,361 --> 02:51:00,400
Those poor fox.
Well,

3858
02:51:00,430 --> 02:51:02,870
they did.
They despise you now get mad.

3859
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:06,110
You're fucking chill.
Geoengineering is real brow.

3860
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:08,390
What does Alex Jones say to you?
Because I know you're friends with him.

3861
02:51:08,391 --> 02:51:09,850
What does he say to you about chem
trails?

3862
02:51:09,851 --> 02:51:10,660
So you try to convince you?

3863
02:51:10,660 --> 02:51:13,160
No,
he thinks that most of what you see

3864
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:15,230
according to him,
but to see Alex,

3865
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:17,180
he goes with the weather a little bit
too.

3866
02:51:17,870 --> 02:51:22,520
He thinks most of what you see is just
condensation trails that happen when you

3867
02:51:22,521 --> 02:51:27,521
have a jet engine and you have the cold
air and condensation in the atmosphere

3868
02:51:27,591 --> 02:51:29,270
and the.
That's what they are.

3869
02:51:29,271 --> 02:51:31,760
I mean,
they're artificial clouds that are

3870
02:51:31,761 --> 02:51:34,250
created by a jet engine passing through
the air.

3871
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:36,800
That's what they are.
You can do it over and over again.

3872
02:51:36,801 --> 02:51:39,410
You could do it right now.
The idea that they're spraying something

3873
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:42,800
and that something happens to have
aluminum and Barium in it,

3874
02:51:42,801 --> 02:51:44,900
but it also looks exactly the cloud.
No,

3875
02:51:45,050 --> 02:51:47,540
that's moisture.
The reason why it looks like a cloud is

3876
02:51:47,541 --> 02:51:50,240
because it's a fucking cloud and one of
the things that I said in the chem trail

3877
02:51:50,241 --> 02:51:51,920
thing like go,
you want to talk about real chem trails?

3878
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:55,730
Here's the real chem trail.
They're burning gasoline in the sky

3879
02:51:55,731 --> 02:52:00,350
above your head every day to turn to the
tune of thousands of flights.

3880
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:02,450
You're not concentrating on that.
Instead,

3881
02:52:02,451 --> 02:52:05,980
you're concentrating on the natural
reaction of jet engines and moisture in

3882
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,330
the air.
It's so stupid.

3883
02:52:07,390 --> 02:52:12,130
I don't get because there's a thing that
people do where it's almost like they're

3884
02:52:12,131 --> 02:52:16,210
trying to find the worst possible
fucking argument and then that's the

3885
02:52:16,211 --> 02:52:17,510
part of it that they get upset.
So that.

3886
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:21,610
And this goes back to the thing about
trump where I told you on CNN all they

3887
02:52:21,611 --> 02:52:25,000
did for an hour and a fucking half was
talking about Russia and it's like I'm

3888
02:52:25,001 --> 02:52:28,180
sitting there going,
I just covered a story on my show last

3889
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:31,420
week about how the head of the consumer
financial protection bureau is a guy

3890
02:52:31,421 --> 02:52:34,840
named Mick Mulvaney.
He took over $50,000 from the predatory

3891
02:52:34,841 --> 02:52:37,690
payday loan industry.
Donald trump at his inauguration took

3892
02:52:37,691 --> 02:52:40,120
over a million dollars from the
predatory payday loan industry.

3893
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:44,710
They just scrapped the rules that we're
supposed to clean up that industry.

3894
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:48,370
And now they're letting them charge 950
percent interest.

3895
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:50,260
You want the fucking conspiracy?

3896
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:53,930
There it is right there.
And you're not talking about Putin in

3897
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,190
Russia.
He's a fucking Manchurian candidate and

3898
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:58,990
loud noises and he curses a lot and
fucking stormy daniels.

3899
02:52:58,991 --> 02:53:01,360
I don't give a fuck about any of that.
Talk about the shit that matters.

3900
02:53:01,390 --> 02:53:03,200
I care about storming.
No,

3901
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:09,160
I do wonder what's going to happen with
the indictments.

3902
02:53:09,310 --> 02:53:10,570
I do wonder.
So it was.

3903
02:53:10,571 --> 02:53:13,090
People were pleading guilty now and you
know,

3904
02:53:13,170 --> 02:53:14,950
the.
The concern is that it's going to

3905
02:53:14,951 --> 02:53:16,900
trickle.
So here's the thing.

3906
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:20,230
Here's the thing,
is Donald Trump a corrupt businessman?

3907
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:23,410
Fuck yes.
Anybody who says he's not has no fucking

3908
02:53:23,411 --> 02:53:25,270
idea what this has been into.
There's evidence.

3909
02:53:25,271 --> 02:53:29,680
He did deals with the Mafia.
He has a hotel in Panama which was

3910
02:53:29,681 --> 02:53:32,410
laundering drug money.
So do I think he's a criminal?

3911
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:34,300
Yes.
Do I think he did money laundry?

3912
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:37,900
Yes.
Would it be good if somehow got him on

3913
02:53:37,901 --> 02:53:38,300
these things?

3914
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:41,500
So of course it would be,
but the idea that he's a Manchurian

3915
02:53:41,501 --> 02:53:45,430
candidate or he did treason is so
ridiculous that it makes me a guy who's

3916
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:49,720
massively anti-trump scarf and get
really angry when people try to push

3917
02:53:49,721 --> 02:53:53,020
that narrative,
and here's the thing there is it's an

3918
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:56,800
open legal question as to whether or not
you can indict a sitting president.

3919
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:01,390
Usually what has to happen is you have
to impeach a sitting president will.

3920
02:54:01,391 --> 02:54:03,580
Right now,
Congress is overwhelmingly Republican.

3921
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:05,950
You know who's not going to fucking
impeach Donald Trump.

3922
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:08,920
Even if they prove the worst case
scenario that he's some sort of

3923
02:54:08,921 --> 02:54:11,650
Manchurian candidate,
the Republicans are not going to fucking

3924
02:54:11,651 --> 02:54:14,020
impeach him.
So at the end of the day when the

3925
02:54:14,021 --> 02:54:19,021
Democrats focus on this ad Nauseum,
the reason they're doing that is because

3926
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:23,370
it's something that they feel
comfortable and safe talking about

3927
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:26,750
because they don't have to talk about
Medicare for all or free college or a

3928
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:29,740
living wage or getting the corporate
money out of politics or ending the

3929
02:54:29,741 --> 02:54:31,570
fucking wars which they also support.

3930
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:34,330
So they're not talking about real issues
and they're focusing on this,

3931
02:54:34,420 --> 02:54:38,140
the fake scandal and sensationalism
because they think will score them cheap

3932
02:54:38,141 --> 02:54:41,680
points with the electorate and it won't.
And they think there's an end game here

3933
02:54:41,681 --> 02:54:43,900
and there's not.
But there is something there,

3934
02:54:43,901 --> 02:54:45,270
right?
I mean if yes,

3935
02:54:45,310 --> 02:54:48,100
he made money,
but if people are getting indicted,

3936
02:54:48,290 --> 02:54:50,920
I'm sure with this Russia thing.
So I'll break that down.

3937
02:54:51,010 --> 02:54:52,930
Paul Manafort is one of the people who
got indicted,

3938
02:54:53,230 --> 02:54:56,470
super duper corrupt laundering money.
Michael Flynn,

3939
02:54:56,970 --> 02:54:58,390
saving money.
How so?

3940
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:01,420
So in the case,
I know more of the details about flint.

3941
02:55:01,480 --> 02:55:03,120
So Flynn is a guy,
he got a,

3942
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:04,700
he,
what's his face?

3943
02:55:04,701 --> 02:55:09,380
Molar went after Flynn and it was proven
that Flynn took $500,000 from the

3944
02:55:09,381 --> 02:55:12,530
Turkish government and in return for
that,

3945
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:17,560
he pushed the trump administration to
not arm the Kurds who are fighting isis.

3946
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:23,270
And the reason why is because Turkey
hates the Kurds and they don't want us

3947
02:55:23,271 --> 02:55:25,040
to arm the Kurds.
So in other words,

3948
02:55:25,041 --> 02:55:29,150
Michael Flynn was doing the bidding of
the Turkish government and pushing their

3949
02:55:29,151 --> 02:55:32,150
influence in our government and he
didn't register as a foreign agent in

3950
02:55:32,151 --> 02:55:34,370
the process.
So exactly.

3951
02:55:34,371 --> 02:55:37,930
So he's doing the bidding of the Turkish
government and not disclosing that.

3952
02:55:38,010 --> 02:55:40,730
And you have to register as a foreign
agent if you're going to take that money

3953
02:55:40,731 --> 02:55:43,460
and you're going to do that.
And this doesn't run down to trump.

3954
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:45,890
Um,
well that's the open question as to

3955
02:55:45,891 --> 02:55:48,110
whether or not at some point along the
way,

3956
02:55:48,111 --> 02:55:50,330
whether it's with Russia or with other
countries.

3957
02:55:50,331 --> 02:55:52,070
By the way,
nobody talks about the fact that trump

3958
02:55:52,071 --> 02:55:54,980
registered eight new businesses in Saudi
Arabia when he was on the campaign

3959
02:55:54,981 --> 02:55:56,540
trail.
And then he just gave them over

3960
02:55:56,541 --> 02:55:57,920
$100,000,000,000 weapons deal.

3961
02:55:58,220 --> 02:56:02,420
He also took $270,000 from top Saudi
officials at his hotel when he was

3962
02:56:02,421 --> 02:56:04,130
president elect.
And then again he gave over

3963
02:56:04,131 --> 02:56:06,350
$100,000,000,000 weapons deal.
The case of Israel,

3964
02:56:06,351 --> 02:56:08,890
jared Kushner has a,
you know,

3965
02:56:08,930 --> 02:56:12,020
millions of dollars from Israeli banks.
And then Lo and behold,

3966
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:16,640
when Donald Trump was president elect,
they tried to push the UN to not condemn

3967
02:56:16,641 --> 02:56:18,260
Israel over there,
illegal settlements.

3968
02:56:18,530 --> 02:56:22,460
So you have his entire administration.
It's just a grab bag of corruption in

3969
02:56:22,461 --> 02:56:25,610
foreign influence say.
But it's far influence across the board

3970
02:56:25,670 --> 02:56:28,220
and its influenced also from
corporations.

3971
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:30,260
But again,
people are not focusing on the

3972
02:56:30,261 --> 02:56:32,960
corporations and they're not focusing on
the other countries that they're corrupt

3973
02:56:32,961 --> 02:56:36,290
with because there are hyperfocused on
the Russia thing and at the end of the

3974
02:56:36,290 --> 02:56:38,750
day they want to impeach trump over
Russia.

3975
02:56:39,110 --> 02:56:41,150
But like I said,
it's going to be hard to prove.

3976
02:56:41,151 --> 02:56:44,060
And then it's an open question.
If you can indict A.

3977
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:45,650
I don't think you can indict a sitting
president.

3978
02:56:45,651 --> 02:56:47,360
You have to impeach.
They're not going to fucking impeach.

3979
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:50,720
So really this is Democrats sniffing
their own farts and acting like they're

3980
02:56:50,721 --> 02:56:52,190
doing something important when they're
really not.

3981
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:53,990
And the only they're there,
in my opinion,

3982
02:56:54,350 --> 02:56:56,240
is money laundering.
He's a corrupt businessman,

3983
02:56:56,450 --> 02:57:00,350
but he's not some sort of Putin puppet
because he's actually done many policies

3984
02:57:00,351 --> 02:57:02,180
that are against Putin.
So for example,

3985
02:57:02,181 --> 02:57:05,330
he armed Ukrainian rebels who are
fighting Russia right now.

3986
02:57:05,510 --> 02:57:08,240
You don't arm people who are fighting
Russia if you're there fucking puppet,

3987
02:57:08,740 --> 02:57:09,380
you know,
he,

3988
02:57:09,380 --> 02:57:13,220
he also is bombing Syria and we're
staying indefinitely in Syria.

3989
02:57:13,221 --> 02:57:16,850
They just announced that recently.
You don't that Syria,

3990
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:18,920
the Syrian government,
that's one of Putin's top allies.

3991
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:21,950
You're not going to permanently occupy
their country and try to fight that

3992
02:57:21,951 --> 02:57:25,100
government if you're in bed.
They're doing a NATO buildup on Russia's

3993
02:57:25,101 --> 02:57:26,210
border right now.

3994
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:29,120
So if you're,
if you're a Putin's puppet,

3995
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:31,880
you don't have a military buildup on his
border.

3996
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,470
There was just a story the other day
about how now the US,

3997
02:57:34,490 --> 02:57:36,860
our military sending our ships,
uh,

3998
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:39,410
to black seat,
right on Russia's fucking border.

3999
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:42,390
So it's military escalation.
And that's another part of this that

4000
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:44,870
pisses me off,
is that if the Democrats really want us

4001
02:57:44,871 --> 02:57:46,970
to resist trump,
resist that,

4002
02:57:46,971 --> 02:57:48,170
say,
I don't want to send our fucking

4003
02:57:48,171 --> 02:57:50,120
military to get into a standoff with
Russia.

4004
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:53,000
I don't want to bomb Syria and
permanently occupy it.

4005
02:57:53,150 --> 02:57:54,890
This is how the Democrats should be
resisting.

4006
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,150
They should be resisting trump from a
left wing position,

4007
02:57:57,170 --> 02:57:59,540
from an anti interventionist position.
But instead,

4008
02:57:59,541 --> 02:58:02,630
everything you hear from the Democrats
is pays under Putin spellman.

4009
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:05,400
He needs to make sure that he's even
harder on Putin and he does more

4010
02:58:05,401 --> 02:58:07,860
sanctions against Putin and he escalates
further with Russia.

4011
02:58:08,310 --> 02:58:08,910
Listen,
man,

4012
02:58:08,910 --> 02:58:11,940
there are nuclear armed power.
Do you want to fucking get into a

4013
02:58:11,941 --> 02:58:13,560
confrontation with a nuclear armed
power?

4014
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:16,290
We're sitting here living our lives just
going about our business.

4015
02:58:16,770 --> 02:58:18,180
And this is.
I mean,

4016
02:58:18,181 --> 02:58:19,890
this is crazy.
We're rolling the dice and we're playing

4017
02:58:19,891 --> 02:58:24,891
a game of chicken with Vladimir Putin.
Do you think that they're just caught up

4018
02:58:25,291 --> 02:58:26,970
in this sexy thing?
Yes.

4019
02:58:27,090 --> 02:58:28,620
A lot of it is sensationalism.
Yes.

4020
02:58:28,630 --> 02:58:29,311
Yes.
Also,

4021
02:58:29,311 --> 02:58:31,350
what the public is really focused on
right now,

4022
02:58:31,351 --> 02:58:34,380
so it's something that gathers ratings.
I think they're driving it.

4023
02:58:34,920 --> 02:58:38,070
I think it's driven from the top down,
from the establishment media down from

4024
02:58:38,071 --> 02:58:39,720
the Democrats down.
Because again,

4025
02:58:39,900 --> 02:58:42,720
if you talk to regular people,
they're fucking hurting,

4026
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:45,720
right?
Wages have been stagnant since 1980.

4027
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:50,100
There's 30 million people that don't
have healthcare in trump's first year in

4028
02:58:50,101 --> 02:58:52,860
office.
3 million more people last healthcare

4029
02:58:53,010 --> 02:58:56,310
because he did all these executive
orders that basically took a hatchet to

4030
02:58:56,311 --> 02:58:57,144
obamacare.

4031
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:59,880
So you have all these people who are
really hurting their.

4032
02:58:59,930 --> 02:59:01,560
They care about their wages,
they care about,

4033
02:59:01,710 --> 02:59:03,960
you know,
not being saddled with over a trillion

4034
02:59:03,960 --> 02:59:06,660
dollars in student loan debt.
This is the shit regular people care

4035
02:59:06,661 --> 02:59:09,570
about.
So when they turn on CNN and they see

4036
02:59:09,571 --> 02:59:10,171
Russia,
Russia,

4037
02:59:10,171 --> 02:59:12,090
Russia,
even if you don't like trump,

4038
02:59:12,091 --> 02:59:14,430
I despise trump with every fiber of my
fucking being.

4039
02:59:14,431 --> 02:59:16,680
But when I see this,
I roll my fucking eyes and then they

4040
02:59:16,681 --> 02:59:18,060
have the nerve to say,
oh,

4041
02:59:18,061 --> 02:59:21,810
trump won't shut up about Russia.
You were talking about it all day and he

4042
02:59:21,811 --> 02:59:24,390
responded to it and because he responds
to it,

4043
02:59:24,391 --> 02:59:25,111
you're like,
oh,

4044
02:59:25,111 --> 02:59:27,430
there he goes again with Russia.
Yeah.

4045
02:59:27,510 --> 02:59:29,970
It's going to be interesting to see how
this all plays out.

4046
02:59:30,570 --> 02:59:33,330
I'm really fascinated.
I'm fascinated to see if he can make it

4047
02:59:33,331 --> 02:59:34,680
out of four years.
Well,

4048
02:59:34,710 --> 02:59:35,130
not only.

4049
02:59:35,130 --> 02:59:36,980
Well,
I think he's gonna do think he's going

4050
02:59:36,981 --> 02:59:38,840
to run.
He's going to run again and he's going

4051
02:59:38,841 --> 02:59:40,110
to win again.
He has a chance.

4052
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:42,370
He has a fucking chance because the
Democrats,

4053
02:59:42,371 --> 02:59:45,660
if the Democrats run Kamala Harris,
if they run cory booker or any of the

4054
02:59:45,661 --> 02:59:49,170
other corporatists he can win because
he's going to go right back into his tap

4055
02:59:49,171 --> 02:59:52,200
dance about being a populist and helping
people and guess what?

4056
02:59:52,201 --> 02:59:55,350
In the first few years of his tax bill,
regular people did get a tax cut,

4057
02:59:55,650 --> 02:59:56,311
so he's going to say,
look,

4058
02:59:56,311 --> 02:59:59,460
you look at your tax bill.
I just gave you an extra thousand

4059
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:00,450
dollars this year who you want to vote
for?

4060
03:00:01,230 --> 03:00:04,650
And so there is an argument that he's
going to make to the people and if you

4061
03:00:04,651 --> 03:00:09,510
don't have somebody like Bernie Sanders
or Bernie Sanders talking about the

4062
03:00:09,511 --> 03:00:13,050
issues that matter to people will then
of course he can fucking win again.

4063
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:15,120
Listen,
there was.

4064
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:19,470
I was laughed at when I said if it's
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,

4065
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:22,310
he can.
When people left at me because they

4066
03:00:22,311 --> 03:00:25,170
didn't want it.
Didn't want it to be true because.

4067
03:00:25,171 --> 03:00:26,970
Yeah.
Because then the narrative story,

4068
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:31,320
all you saw was that there was like a 75
percent chance that hillary was gonna

4069
03:00:31,321 --> 03:00:35,220
win the fucking Huffington Post.
One was over 99 percent.

4070
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:38,940
No God before the election to the
election.

4071
03:00:38,941 --> 03:00:40,260
So silly.
I know though,

4072
03:00:40,261 --> 03:00:43,350
and the way they calculate it,
such good articles to the sprinkler and

4073
03:00:43,351 --> 03:00:45,330
great articles.
That's easily horseshoe.

4074
03:00:45,360 --> 03:00:48,150
The trick is avoid the opinion section
and.

4075
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:49,710
But if.
But if you stick to the actual

4076
03:00:49,711 --> 03:00:53,220
journalists and then they do a good job.
It's got to be embarrassing for them

4077
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,540
all.
For the journalist.

4078
03:00:54,541 --> 03:00:55,051
Yeah.
They're like,

4079
03:00:55,051 --> 03:00:57,360
you guys are fucking shitting all over
the hard work that I do.

4080
03:00:57,470 --> 03:00:58,920
You know,
Kyle,

4081
03:00:59,000 --> 03:00:59,860
it's been a lot of fun,
man.

4082
03:00:59,890 --> 03:01:00,830
This has been a lot of fun,
man.

4083
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:02,320
I really appreciate it.
Let's do it again.

4084
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:03,340
Oh,
anytime.

4085
03:01:03,370 --> 03:01:04,580
Thanks for your time.
Really appreciate it.

4086
03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:06,370
This was a lot of fun.
I enjoyed this.

4087
03:01:06,371 --> 03:01:08,270
Thanks.
Tell everybody where they can find a

4088
03:01:08,271 --> 03:01:10,400
show,
a youtube.com/secular talk,

4089
03:01:10,401 --> 03:01:12,640
and if you want to follow me on twitter,
it's at Kyle Kalinsky.

4090
03:01:12,910 --> 03:01:17,800
Boom.
That was great.

4091
03:01:24,040 --> 03:01:24,860
Mm.
